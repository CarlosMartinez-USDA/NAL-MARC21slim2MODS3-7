The relations between wasp abundances and colonization and host—finding rates were addressed with two types of experiments. In the first experiment, galls were stripped from a large area of host plants in the field, and recolonization by the midge and wasps was monitored. Colonization rate, which includes dispersal, search, and successful parasitization, correlated with field abundance of the wasp species in undisturbed habitat, with one exception. Torymus koebelei was the slowest colonizer but was the most abundant wasp. In a second set of experiments, the host—finding rates of the wasp species were measured in the greenhouse, by exposing hosts at field density to single female wasps. The wasp species differed in the number of hosts parasitized per day. Furthermore, this measure of host—finding rate correlated with abundance in the field, again with one exception. T. koebelei was third in host—finding ability, although first in abundance. Colonization rate measured in the field correlates strongly with host—finding rate measured in the laboratory. This suggests that most of the differences among the wasps in colonization rate resulted from differences in ability to find hosts on a small spatial scale (e.g., on a single host plant) and not from differences in dispersal over longer distances. Host—finding rate and fecundity were found not to correlate. These experiments and others on the same system suggest that host—finding rate and larval competitive ability determine the abundances of these wasps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaccharis pilularis 3aRhopalomyia californica 3aTorymus 3afecundity 3afemales 3agalls 3agreenhouses 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3ahost seeking 3alarvae 3amidges 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids0 tEcology.g1984 Feb., v. 65, no. 1 p.20-27dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19394543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03905naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245009700162300001800259520194000277592002802217650002102245650002602266650001302292650001302305650002302318650002702341650002802368650001602396650001302412650001702425650001702442650001602459650001902475650002602494650002202520650002502542650002302567650001602590653002802606653004102634653001902675653002402694653001802718653003602736700001702772700001702789700002102806700005602827700005602883700001802939700006302957700005703020773013903077856007803216852000903294655001203303IND60596018420180802000000.0180609e20180213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059601842DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b006662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Shanshan10aTailoring Polyelectrolyte Architecture To Promote Cell Growth and Inhibit Bacterial Adhesion  ap. 7882-7891.  aAn important challenge facing the application of implanted biomaterials for tissue engineering is the need to facilitate desirable tissue interactions with the implant while simultaneously inhibiting bacterial colonization, which can lead to implant-associated infection. In this study, we explore the relevance of the physical parameters of polyelectrolyte multilayers, such as surface charge, wettability, and stiffness, in tissue cell/surface and bacteria/surface interactions, and investigate the tuning of the multilayer architecture to differentially control such interactions. Polyions with different side-chain chemical structures were paired with polyethylenimine to assemble multilayers with parallel control over surface charge and wettability under controlled conditions. The multilayers can be successfully cross-linked to yield stiffer (the apparent Young’s modulus was increased more than three times its original value) and more stable films while maintaining parallel control over surface charge and wettability. The initial adhesion and proliferation of 3T3 fibroblast cells were found to be strongly affected by surface charge and wettability on the non-cross-linked multilayers. On the other hand, these cells adhered and proliferated in a manner similar to those on the cross-linked multilayers (apparent Young’s modulus ∼2 MPa), regardless of surface charge and wettability. In contrast, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) adhesion was primarily controlled by surface charge and wettability on both cross-linked and non-cross-linked multilayers. In both cases, negative charge and hydrophilicity inhibited their adhesion. Thus, a surface coating with a relatively high degree of stiffness from covalent cross-linking coupled with negative surface charge and high wettability can serve as an efficient strategy to enhance host cell growth while resisting bacterial colonization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadhesion 3abacteria 3abacterial adhesion 3abacterial colonization 3abiocompatible materials 3acell growth 3acoatings 3acrosslinking 3aelectrolytes 3afibroblasts 3ahydrophilicity 3amodulus of elasticity 3apolyethyleneimine 3asurface interactions 3atissue engineering 3awettability 0alayer-by-layer assembly 0apolyelectrolyte multilayer stiffness 0asurface charge 0asurface wettability 0aantimicrobial 0acell adhesion and proliferation1 aKwek, Min Yi1 aToh, Zi Qian1 aPranantyo, Dicky1 aKang, En-Tang1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0599-78341 aLoh, Xian Jun1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8118-65021 aZhu, Xiaoying1 aJańczewski, Dominik1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5466-64441 aNeoh, Koon Gee1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2700-19140 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 13, v. 10, no. 9 p.7882-7891dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b006663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04484naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133024004300169040001800212100006200230245011000292300001600402506002800418506003600446506007600482506003100558520240100589592002802990596004503018506003703063650002103100650002603121650002303147650002503170650002803195650002003223650001703243650001503260650001503275650001803290650003303308650001803341650001303359650002303372650001203395650001003407651002903417653002803446653001803474653001503492653002603507653002803533653001603561700002403577700001603601773012503617856008303742903002403825852000903849655001203858IND60556997720221207140010.0190318e20161003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055699772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2016.09.0192chorus7 a10.1016/j.agee.2016.09.0192doi7 a10.1016/j.agee.2016.09.0192chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngelella, Gina M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2874-947010aLandscape composition is more important than local management for crop virus–insect vector interactions  ap. 253-261.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aManaging crop viruses is difficult due to complex interactions among vectors, reservoirs, and mediating factors such as land cover. Identifying the appropriate ecological neighborhood, or the spatial area in which the most influential interactions occur affecting virus epidemiology, would therefore be beneficial in exposing which of the many explanatory variables to target in the plant-pathogen system. We constructed partial least squares path models to find the neighborhood size for vectors of stylet-borne nonpersistent viruses infecting pumpkins, and compare the relative influence of within-field and extra-field land cover. Two economically important aphid-vectored viruses in the U.S. Midwest are included in these analyses: papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) and watermelon mosaic virus (WMV). In 2010 and 2011, we used commercial pumpkin fields to quantify virus infection, vector (aphid) alightment (i.e., landing rates), and within-field weed communities, and subsequently analyzed extra-field cover from 1 to 5km concentric buffer zones within the surrounding landscape. Alightment rates of total noncolonizing vectors and the top three numerically dominant species (Aphis craccivora Koch, Therioaphis trifolii (Monell), and Rhopalosiphum padi [L.]) were included in individual path models. Overall, we found that extra-field landscape composition had a far stronger influence on vector alightment than within-field weed cover; this pattern was consistent for seven of eight statistical models. In one exception, weed cover influenced alightment of the putative PRSV vector, A. craccivora, while surrounding landscape had no effect. In this case, weed coverage and vector alightment were inversely related, demonstrating that aphids were less likely to land in weed-infested fields. However, weed cover did not predict alightment of T. trifolii or total noncolonizers. The neighborhood size scales for total noncolonizers’ tended to be larger than for individual species (4–5km), suggesting future studies of dispersal by multi-species aphid groups may benefit from an extended gradient. On balance, our results indicate that while surrounding land cover interactions are complex, they exert greater influence over vector dispersal than within-field weed cover, calling into question whether management of local weeds is an effective method of crop virus prevention in some systems.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAphis craccivora 3aPapaya ringspot virus 3aRhopalosiphum padi 3aTherioaphis trifolii 3aWatermelon mosaic virus 3acrop management 3aepidemiology 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3aleast squares 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3apumpkins 3astatistical models 3aviruses 3aweeds 3aMidwestern United States 0aEcological neighborhood 0aNonpersistent 0aLand cover 0aPapaya ringspot virus 0aWatermelon mosaic virus 0aPath models1 aHolland, Jeffrey D.1 aKaplan, Ian0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 Oct. 03, v. 233 p.253-261dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003100149245015000180300001800330520134000348592002801688650001801716650001201734650001301746650001201759650002601771650002301797650002501820650002801845650001101873650001701884650002501901650001501926650002501941650002201966650001001988650001001998651001002008651001002018651001002028700001702038700002102055700001802076773008802094856008302182852000902265655001202274IND60096810220221123000440.0141104e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009681022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThakuri, Min Bikram Malla,10aApplying global cost-benefit analysis methods to indoor air pollution mitigation interventions in Nepal, Kenya and Sudan: Insights and challenges  ap. 7518-7529.  aIndoor air pollution from burning solid fuels for cooking is a major environmental health problem in developing countries, predominantly affecting children and women. Traditional household energy practices also contribute to substantial time loss and drudgery among households. While effective interventions exist, levels of investment to date have been very low, in part due to lack of evidence on economic viability. Between 2004 and 2007, different combinations of interventions – improved stoves, smoke hoods and a switch to liquefied petroleum gas – were implemented in poor communities in Nepal, Sudan and Kenya. The impacts were extensively evaluated and provided the basis for a household-level cost-benefit analysis, which essentially followed the methodology proposed by the World Health Organization. The results suggest that interventions are justified on economic grounds with estimated internal rates of return of 19%, 429% and 62% in Nepal, Kenya and Sudan, respectively. Time savings constituted by far the most important benefit followed by fuel cost savings; direct health improvements were a small component of the overall benefit. This paper describes the methodology applied, discusses the findings and highlights the methodological challenges that arise when a global approach is applied to a local programme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aburning 3achildren 3acooking 3acost benefit analysis 3acost effectiveness 3adeveloping countries 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aenvironmental health 3ahouseholds 3aliquid petroleum gas 3apollution control 3asmoke 3awomen 3aKenya 3aNepal 3aSudan1 aBruce, Nigel1 aBates, Elizabeth1 aRehfuess, Eva0 tEnergy policy.g2011 Dec., v. 39, no. 12 p.7518-7529dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010300162300001200265520102400277592002801301650002601329650001301355650000901368650001901377650001101396650001801407650001601425653002801441653002801469653002801497653002501525653002101550700001901571700001701590700001201607700001601619700001701635773011801652856008101770852000901851655001201860IND60637882120221119002458.0190712e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063788212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.04.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Lele10aInactivation and recovery kinetics of Escherichia coli O157:H7 treated with ohmic heating in broth  ap. 1-7.  aIn order to explore the inactivation effect of ohmic heating on bacteria, inactivation and recovery kinetics of Escherichia coli O157:H7 treated with ohmic heating in broth were studied and compared with conventional water bath heating. During the heating process, the temperature of E. coli broth treated with ohmic heating increased linearly with the increasing of time, while in water bath heating, the temperature increased linearly with heating time at first, and then the increase became slower gradually. Temperature-inactivation profiles showed that the inactivation history of ohmic heating was different from that of water bath heating. The modified Gompertz model was better to fit the inactivation experimental data, while the modified Logistic model worked better to fit the recovery curves. Model parameters analysis showed that E. coli cells treated with ohmic heating had longer lag phase in recovery compared to that of water bath heating, which might be related to non-thermal effect of ohmic heating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3abacteria 3aheat 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3aohmic heating 3atemperature 0aElectrical conductivity 0aModified Gompertz model 0aModified Logistic model 0aInactivation kinetic 0aRecovery kinetic1 aTian, Xiaojing1 aYu, Qianqian1 aXu, Lei1 aLi, Xingmin1 aDai, Ruitong0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Aug., v. 110 p.1-7dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.04.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012000162300002000282520119000302592002801492650002001520650002401540650001801564650001501582650002301597650000701620650001901627650001901646650001901665650001601684650002101700653001901721653002201740653001901762653002301781653002001804700001701824700005701841700005701898700005501955773014202010856007802152852000902230655001202239IND60596018520221116144536.0180609e20180409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059601852DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b006772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Huijun10aNanoplasmonically Engineered Interfaces on Amorphous TiO2 for Highly Efficient Photocatalysis in Hydrogen Evolution  ap. 14145-14152.  aThe nanoplasmonic metal-driven photocatalytic activity depends heavily on the spacing between metal nanoparticles (NPs) and semiconductors, and this work shows that ethylene glycol (EG) is an ideal candidate for interface spacer. Controlling the synthetic systems at pH 3, the composite of Ag NPs with EG-stabilized amorphous TiO₂ (Ag/TiO₂-3) was synthesized by the facile light-induced reduction. It is verified that EG spacers can set up suitable geometric arrangement in the composite: the twin hydroxyls act as stabilizers to bind Ag NPs and TiO₂ together and the nonconductive alkyl chains consisting only of two CH₂ are able to separate the two building blocks completely and also provide the shortest channels for an efficient transfer of radiation energies to reach TiO₂. Employed as photocatalysts in hydrogen evolution under visible light, amorphous TiO₂ hardly exhibits the catalytic activity due to high defect density, whereas Ag/TiO₂-3 represents a remarkably high catalytic efficiency. The enhancement mechanism of the reaction rate is proposed by the analysis of the compositional, structural, and optical properties from a series of Ag/TiO₂ composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethylene glycol 3ahydrogen production 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aoptical properties 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asemiconductors 3astabilizers 3atitanium dioxide 0aamorphous TiO2 0aAg/TiO2 composite 0aphotocatalysis 0ahydrogen evolution 0aethylene glycol1 aMeng, Qiuxia1 aWang, Xiaobing1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2136-639X1 aZhang, Hucheng1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4225-43191 aWang, Jianji1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2417-46300 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Apr. 09, v. 10, no. 16 p.14145-14152dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b006773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245012800178300001300306520129400319592002801613650001501641650001601656650001701672650002201689650002401711650002601735650001301761650002401774650002401798650001101822650002101833650001701854650002001871650002401891650001001915653002401925653003201949653002401981653002002005653002202025700001802047700001802065773009802083856008602181852000902267655001202276IND60559726820221118153515.0170105e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055972682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.11.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattacharyya, Rupsha10aPhotovoltaic solar energy conversion for hydrogen production by alkaline water electrolysis: Conceptual design and analysis  ap. 1-13.  aThe use of solar energy for electricity generation and use of this electricity for hydrogen production by alkaline water electrolysis promises to be a truly sustainable scheme for the postulated hydrogen economy. This work addresses the design of a standalone solar photovoltaic (PV) energy system that meets the energy requirements of the electrolysis process, followed by the performance analysis under different environmental conditions. Energy requirement for electrolysis depends on the hydrogen production rate desired and the operating conditions of the electrolysis cell and it has been predicted from an essentially thermodynamic analysis. Mean solar irradiation data is estimated from location specific meteorological data. The current-voltage output characteristics of the solar modules have been predicted as function of the solar irradiation using the five parameter, single diode model of a solar panel and they have been linked to the production rates of hydrogen. The module behaviour and its thermodynamic and conversion efficiencies have also been predicted for actual operating conditions. Thus a step-by-step simplified approach for the preliminary PV power system design and analysis for an electrolysis based hydrogen production unit has been presented in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3aelectricity 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy conversion 3aenergy requirements 3aenvironmental factors 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3asystems engineering 3awater 0aSolar photovoltaics 0aAlkaline water electrolysis 0aHydrogen production 0aExergy analysis 0aConceptual design1 aMisra, Apurva1 aSandeep, K.C.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017 Feb. 01, v. 133 p.1-13dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.11.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014200171300001400313520088700327592002801214650001101242650001901253650001601272650001401288650001101302650002601313650001001339650000901349650002101358653002801379653002601407653002401433653002201457653002901479700001801508773009901526856008601625852000901711655001201720IND60559727020221118152837.0170105e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055972702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.11.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMago, Pedro J.10aPotential reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from the use of electric energy storage on a power generation unit/organic Rankine system  ap. 67-75.  aThis paper evaluates the potential carbon dioxide emissions reduction from the implementation of electric energy storage to a combined power generation unit and an organic Rankine cycle relative to a conventional system that uses utility gas for heating and utility electricity for electricity needs. Results indicate that carbon dioxide emission reductions from the operation of the proposed system are directly correlated to the ratio of the carbon dioxide emission conversion factor for electricity to that of the fuel. The location where the system is installed also has a strong influence on the potential of the proposed system to save carbon dioxide emissions. Finally, it is shown that by using carbon emissions cap and trade programs, it is possible to establish a frame of reference to compare/exchange operational cost gains with carbon dioxide emission reductions/gains.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenvironmental markets 3afuels 3aheat 3apower generation 0aElectric energy storage 0aOrganic Rankine cycle 0aEmissions reduction 0aMaintenance costs 0aCarbon dioxide emissions1 aLuck, Rogelio0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017 Feb. 01, v. 133 p.67-75dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.11.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245012300173300001800296520142700314592002801741650001601769650001101785650003101796650002501827650001201852650001001864650002901874650002101903650002001924650001501944650002601959650001101985650001901996651001102015651001802026700002402044773008802068856008302156852000902239655001202248IND60096810520221123000604.0141104e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009681052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.09.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerguson, Thomas M.10aTrade-linked Canada–United States household environmental impact analysis of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions  ap. 8011-8021.  aWe compare energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with total household expenditures and activities in Canada and US in 1997, the first detailed estimate of environmental burdens for Canadian households. We estimate direct burdens from published government data and indirect burdens using an industry-by-commodity, bi-national economic input–output life cycle assessment model developed in this study. Comparing 30 expenditure and two activity categories, per capita US household expenditures were 70% higher, while per capita household energy use and GHG emissions were only 10% and 44% higher, respectively. Energy use/dollar of expenditure was higher in most Canadian categories, while the average ratio of GHG emissions/energy use was higher in the US (65 vs 50kg Eq. CO₂/GJ) due largely to a higher proportion of electricity from nonrenewable sources. Indirect environmental burdens represented 63–69% of total burdens and 62–70% of total burdens were associated with household operation and transportation. Key drivers of differences between energy profiles were: higher per capita electricity use by Canadian households, and higher US household private health care expenditures and motor fuel use. Energy-intensive production for export represented a higher proportion of Canadian production, resulting in less agreement between consumption and production-based analyses for Canada than US.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental impact 3aexports 3afuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahealth services 3ahouseholds 3alife cycle assessment 3amodels 3atransportation 3aCanada 3aUnited States1 aMacLean, Heather L.0 tEnergy policy.g2011 Dec., v. 39, no. 12 p.8011-8021dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.09.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013100170300001600301500001500317520164300332592002801975650001302003650002102016650002202037650002002059650001002079650001402089650002102103650001602124650001402140650001802154650002102172650002302193650001102216650001702227650001202244650001302256650001902269650001702288650001702305650001202322650002002334650001702354650001802371650001802389650002102407650002102428651001102449653001502460700002002475773011102495856008102606852000902687655001202696IND60119800920221122195629.0150106e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011980092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-014-0843-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeonardsson, Jenny10aDifferential survival and growth of stumps in 14 woody species after conservation thinning in mixed oak-rich temperate forests  ap. 199-209.  a2019-12-04  aMany trees sprout after cutting and other disturbances, and individuals may persist for a long time. In 25 forests in Sweden subjected to thinning for biodiversity values, we tested whether survival and growth of sprouts are related to stump diameter. Stem diameters vary under conservation thinning and earlier work had indicated high survival of stumps of small diameter. We also tested whether a continuum of responses in sprouting existed among the 14 species, as predicted by earlier work. We cut on average 26 % of the basal area (mean basal area 28 m²/ha) and analysed 1,044 stumps (diameters 10–76 cm). The response of the species after 9 years ranged along a continuum from weak to strong sprouting. Survival was highest for Corylus avellena (95 % of cut individuals survived) and Tilia cordata (85 %), then decreased as follows; Crataegus spp. > Alnus glutinosa > Prunus avium > Fraxinus excelsior > Quercus robur/Q. petraea > Salix caprea > Sorbus aucuparia > Acer platanoides > Betula pendula, to Betula pubescens (8 %) and Fagus sylvatica (8 %). Within species, stump survival was unrelated to stump diameter. Mean maximal sprout height of surviving stumps varied from about 1 to 4 m among the species after 9 years. Sprout height was unrelated to stump diameter. Stump survival (%) and mean sprout height were positively correlated across species. In conclusion, stem diameter had no effect on sprouting, but the 14 species could be clearly ranked in regrowth. Our results are useful in planning thinning of mixed forests for biodiversity conservation, for biomass harvest, or combined purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplanning 3aCorylus avellana 3atemperate forests 3aAlnus glutinosa 3atrees 3aCrataegus 3aSorbus aucuparia 3acorrelation 3asprouting 3aTilia cordata 3aBetula pubescens 3aFraxinus excelsior 3astumps 3aSalix caprea 3acutting 3aregrowth 3aBetula pendula 3awoody plants 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3aFagus sylvatica 3aPrunus avium 3amixed forests 3aQuercus robur 3astand basal area 3aAcer platanoides 3aSweden 0abasal area1 aGötmark, Frank0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2015 Jan., v. 134, no. 1 p.199-209dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-014-0843-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245006000173300001600233520113700249592002801386650001201414650000901426650001801435650001601453653001701469653002001486653002601506653002001532653001901552700002001571700002101591773010101612856008601713852000901799655001201808IND60559727220221118152907.0170105e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055972722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErbay, L.

The equality of the work generation of the heat engine to the work consumption of the refrigerator is the primary constraint of the duplex Stirling. The duplex Stirling refrigerator is investigated thermodynamically by considering the effects of constructional and operational parameters which are namely the temperature ratios for heat engine and refrigerator, and the compression ratios for both sides. The primary concern is given to the parametric effects on the overall coefficient of performance of the duplex Stirling refrigerator. The given diagrams provide a design bounds and benchmark results that allows seeing the big picture about the cooling load and heat input relation. Moreover they ease to determine the corresponding work rate to the target cooling load. As regard to the obtained results, a definite region for coefficient of performance of the refrigerator and a definite region for the thermal efficiency of the heat engine of the duplex Stirling are identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3aheat 3arefrigerators 3atemperature 0aCooling load 0aStirling engine 0aStirling refrigerator 0aDuplex Stirling 0aStirling cycle1 aOzturk, M.

Proteins whose biosynthesis is controlled through FoxOs fulfil key functions in antioxidant defense, metabolism, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.All four mammalian FoxO isoforms (FoxO1, FoxO3, FoxO4 and FoxO6) are expressed in skin but functions have been specified only for FoxO1 and FoxO3. This review provides an overview on the roles of FoxO1 and FoxO3 in the major types of skin cells: fibroblasts, keratinocytes and melanocytes.As expected because of their target genes, FoxOs are involved in counter-acting oxidative stress and in decisions on cell fate regarding apoptosis or senescence. However, their role in skin surpasses these rather obvious tasks: FoxO1 is part of signaling axes related to the control of epidermal morphogenesis and the pathogenesis of acne. FoxO3 dampens the biosynthesis of melanin in melanocytes; on the other hand, FoxO3 suppression in melanoma is associated with impaired apoptosis and increased metastatic potential of melanoma cells. Upon skin injury, a well-balanced and -timed up-regulation of FoxOs appears to support the healing process through affecting proliferation, migration and apoptosis of keratinocytes, fibroblasts and other cells accumulating at the wounded site.FoxO1 and FoxO3 are discussed as homeostatic factors that influence morphogenesis, maintenance and repair processes in skin as well as the pathogenesis of disorders such as acne and skin cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacne 3amelanin 3ametastasis 3agenes 3amammals 3aoxidative stress 3askin neoplasms 3ahomeostasis 3aapoptosis 3amaintenance and repair 3atranscription factors 3amorphogenesis 3akeratinocytes 3amelanocytes 3aantioxidant activity 3abiosynthesis 3amelanoma 3afibroblasts 3acell cycle 3agene regulatory networks 0aEpidermis 0aWound healing 0aMelanogenesis 0apathogenesis 0aIGF-1 0aUV 0ap631 aKlotz, Lars-Oliver1 aSteinbrenner, Holger0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 May, v. 1861, no. 5 p.1057-1064dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.02.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015500157300001600312500001500328520132400343592002801667650002701695650001201722650001501734650001401749650002501763650002701788650003501815650001101850650001401861650001901875650001401894650001701908650002001925650001501945651001201960653001401972700001901986700001902005700001602024700001702040700001802057773011402075856007302189852000902262655001202271IND60519621620221116144217.0160506e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051962162DNAL7 a10.1111/ppa.124622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontes, M.

The fungicide metalaxyl‐M (Mefenoxam) has played an important role in controlling the disease, but insensitivity to the fungicide in certain isolates is now of major concern. A genetic basis for resistance to metalaxyl suggests the possibility for linking resistance phenotypes to specific population genetic markers, but in order to do this, the population genetic structure and mode of reproduction in a population must first be well described. The dynamics of metalaxyl‐M resistance in the Danish population of P. infestans was characterized over the course of the 2013 growing season, as was the population genetic structure, using simple sequence repeat (SSR) genotypes and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)‐based mitochondrial haplotyping of over 80 isolates. Both mating types A1 and A2 were present in most fields, but tests for recombination showed that clonal reproduction dominates in Danish populations. Genotype was not linked to haplotype and no differentiation was observed at the haplotype level, but rather between fields. Resistance phenotypes were linked to specific SSR alleles, demonstrating the potential for a more precise SNP‐based marker system for predicting resistance to metalaxyl‐M.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aalleles 3ahaplotypes 3aphenotype 3aasexual reproduction 3aPhytophthora infestans 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aclones 3apathogens 3agrowing season 3amefenoxam 3amating types 3agenetic markers 3aprediction 3aDenmark 0ametalaxyl1 aNielsen, B.

Time series analysis with a generalized additive model was performed to estimate the associations between ambient air pollutants and mortality outcomes in Shenzhen City for the period of 2012–2014. The results showed that nitrogen dioxide (NO₂)-induced excess risks (ER) of total non-accidental mortality and cardiovascular mortality were significantly increased (6.05% (95% CI 3.38%, 8.78%); 6.88% (95% CI 2.98%, 10.93%), respectively) in interquartile range (IQR) increase analysis. Also, these associations were strengthened after adjusting for other pollutants. Moreover, similar associations were estimated for sulfur dioxide (SO₂), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <10 μm (PM₁₀), and total non-accidental mortality. There were significant higher ERs of associations between PM₁₀ and mortality for men than women; while there were significant higher ERs of associations between PM₁₀/NO₂ and mortality for elders (65 or elder) than youngers (64 or younger). Season analyses showed that associations between NO₂ and total non-accidental mortality were more pronounced in hot seasons than in warm seasons. Taken together, NO₂ was positively associated with total non-accidental mortality and cardiovascular mortality in Shenzhen even when the concentrations were below the ambient air quality standard. Policy measures should aim at reducing residents’ exposure to anthropogenic NO₂ emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aelderly 3aemissions 3aissues and policy 3amen 3amodels 3amortality 3anitrogen dioxide 3aparticulates 3arisk 3asulfur dioxide 3atime series analysis 3awomen1 aMa, Yue1 aZhang, Yanwei1 aHuang, Suli1 aWu, Yongsheng1 aYu, Shuyuan1 aZou, Fei1 aCheng, Jinquan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Sept., v. 24, no. 25 p.20261-20272dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9502-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03978naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011200161300001600273500002000289520237000309592002802679650002302707650001102730650001902741650001102760650002602771650001202797650001902809650001602828650002602844650001602870650001302886650001402899650002202913650002302935650001302958650001402971650002202985650001903007650001903026650001103045650001203056650002203068650002003090650001203110651001103122700002003133700001903153700002003172700003003192773009603222856007303318852000903391655001203400IND60523678520221120162817.0160623e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052367852DNAL7 a10.1890/13-0363.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuglerová, Lenka10aGroundwater discharge creates hotspots of riparian plant species richness in a boreal forest stream network  ap. 715-725.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRiparian vegetation research has traditionally focused on channel‐related processes because riparian areas are situated on the edge of aquatic ecosystems and are therefore greatly affected by the flow regime of streams and rivers. However, due to their low topographic position in the landscape, riparian areas receive significant inputs of water and nutrients from uplands. These inputs may be important for riparian vegetation, but their role for riparian plant diversity is poorly known. We studied the relationship between the influx of groundwater (GW) from upland areas and riparian plant diversity and composition along a stream size gradient, ranging from small basins lacking permanent streams to a seventh‐order river in northern Sweden. We selected riparian sites with and without GW discharge using a hydrological model describing GW flow accumulation to test the hypothesis that riparian sites with GW discharge harbor plant communities with higher species richness. We further investigated several environmental factors to detect habitat differences between sites differing in GW discharge conditions. Vascular plant species richness was between 15% and 20% higher, depending on the spatial scale sampled, at riparian sites with GW discharge in comparison to non‐discharge sites, a pattern that was consistent across all stream sizes. The elevated species richness was best explained by higher soil pH and higher nitrogen availability (manifested as lower soil C/N ratio), conditions which were positively correlated with GW discharge. Base cations and possibly nitrogen transported by groundwater may therefore act as a terrestrial subsidy of riparian vegetation. The stable isotopes ¹⁵N and ¹³C were depleted in soils from GW discharge compared to non‐discharge sites, suggesting that GW inputs might also affect nitrogen and carbon dynamics in riparian soils. Despite the fact that many flows of water and nutrients reaching streams are filtered through riparian zones, the importance of these flows for riparian vegetation has not been appreciated. Our results demonstrated strong relationships between GW discharge, plant species richness and environmental conditions across the entire stream size gradient, suggesting that both river hydrology and upland inputs should be considered to fully understand riparian vegetation dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abasins 3aboreal forests 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acations 3achemical bases 3acorrelation 3aenvironmental factors 3agroundwater 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3ahydrologic models 3alandscape position 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aplant communities 3ariparian areas 3ariparian soils 3arivers 3asoil pH 3aspecies diversity 3astable isotopes 3astreams 3aSweden1 aJansson, Roland1 aÅgren, Anneli1 aLaudon, Hjalmar1 aMalm-Renöfält, Birgitta0 tEcology.g2014 Mar., v. 95, no. 3 p.715-725dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-0363.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245008000210300001600290506007600306520131600382592002801698506003701726650002001763650001801783650001001801650002001811650001601831650001101847650001201858650002201870650001701892650001001909650001801919650000901937650000901946650002101955700002801976700002202004700001802026700002402044700002302068773012802091856008202219852000902301655001202310IND60089340320221207132944.0141102e20110311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008934032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.02.0282doi7 aPMC30569432pmcid7 a213163442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSparks, Janet D.10aAcute suppression of apo B secretion by insulin occurs independently of MTP  ap. 252-256.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSecretion of apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins by the liver depends mainly upon apo B availability and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) activity and is subject to insulin regulation. Hepatic MTP mRNA expression is negatively regulated by insulin which correlates with inhibition of apo B secretion suggesting that insulin might suppress apo B secretion through an MTP-dependent mechanism. To investigate this possibility, we examined the acute effect of insulin on hepatic MTP expression and activity levels in vivo utilizing apobec-1⁻/⁻ mice. Insulin did not significantly alter hepatic MTP mRNA levels or lipid transfer activity 2h following injection, but suppressed expression of genes important in gluconeogenesis. To study the specific role of MTP, we expressed human MTP (hMTP) in primary rat hepatocytes using adenoviral gene transfer. Increased expression of hMTP resulted in a 47.6±17.9% increase in total apo B secreted. Incubation of hepatocytes with insulin suppressed apo B secretion by 50.1±10.8% in cells over-expressing hMTP and by 53.0±12.4% in control transfected hepatocytes. Results indicate that even under conditions of increased hepatic apo B secretion mediated by MTP, responsiveness of hepatocytes to insulin to suppress apo B secretion is maintained.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agene expression 3agene transfer 3agenes 3agluconeogenesis 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3alipoproteins 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3arats 3atriacylglycerols1 aChamberlain, Jeffrey M.1 aO’Dell, Colleen1 aKhatun, Irani1 aHussain, M.

Data for the present study were drawn from a longitudinal study following individuals (n = 82) from infancy through early childhood. At 6 and 12 months of age, the infants tasted a novel food (green beans, hummus, or cottage cheese) and their reactions were coded for rejection of the food (i.e. crying, force outs, or refusals). The children returned to the laboratory at 4.5 years of age and participated in a behavioral neophobia task where they were offered three novel foods (lychee, nori, and haw jelly) and the number of novel foods they tasted was recorded. Mothers also reported their own and their children's levels of food neophobia. Regression analyses revealed that rejection of novel foods at 6 months interacted with maternal neophobia to predict parent-rated child neophobia. Infants who exhibited low levels of rejection at 6 months showed higher levels of parent-rated neophobia when their mothers also showed high compared to low levels of neophobia. At 12 months of age, however, infants who exhibited high levels of rejection tended to have high levels of parent-rated neophobia regardless of their mothers' levels of neophobia. These results provide preliminary evidence that rejection of novel foods during infancy does predict neophobia during early childhood, but the results vary depending on when rejection of new foods is measured.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achildhood 3achildren 3acottage cheese 3aeating disorders 3aedible seaweed 3agreen beans 3ainfancy 3ainfants 3alitchis 3alongitudinal studies 3amothers 3anovel foods 3aregression analysis 0aFood neophobia 0aInfant novel food rejection 0aStability of neophobia1 aStifter, Cynthia A.0 tAppetite.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 97 p.72-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2015.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009200167500001900259520156100278592002801839650001601867650002001883650000901903650001701912650002101929650000901950650001401959650000901973650001701982653002001999653002202019653002902041653002002070700001402090700002302104700001802127700002202145700001502167773012102182856008502303852000902388655001202397IND60700977720221119091156.0200913e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070097772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1151102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Weiqin10aLead source and bioaccessibility in windowsill dusts within a Pb smelting-affected area  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWindowsill, heavy metal-containing dust samples, collected at different building heights, may provide some insight into both source and human health risk. Windowsill dust samples were collected from the 1st to 9th floor (1.4–23.2 m above ground) near a lead smelter (1 km to the smelter) and in urban areas (4.2–7.3 km to the smelter) and separated into <10, 10–45 and 45–125 μm size fractions. Samples were extracted with artificial lysosomal fluid (ALF) and the physiologically based extraction test (PBET) (<10 μm fractions only), subjected to scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and Pb isotopic analysis. Greater Pb concentrations were found in 10–45 μm fraction than the other size fractions; at the PX site, dust Pb concentrations increased with windowsill height, while an opposite trend was found at other sites. Isotopic analysis and SEM-EDS results supported this contention. Higher floor samples collected near the smelter were more affected by lead smelting than lower floor samples; lower floor samples collected at urban sites were more affected by resuspended Pb-laden particles from the ground than higher floors. The Pb bioaccessible fraction (BAF) in the ALF and PBET ranged between 68.9-90.1 and 1.3–17.0%, respectively; urban samples had greater BAF values than samples collected near the smelter. This, first of its kind investigation regarding Pb in dusts at different building heights, provides further insight for reducing human health risks within Pb smelter vicinities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3abioavailability 3adust 3ahuman health 3aisotope labeling 3alead 3apollution 3arisk 3aspectroscopy 0aBuilding height 0aHuman health risk 0aLead isotopic signatures 0aWindowsill dust1 aYang, Hao1 aIppolito, James A.1 aZhang, Yuqing1 aScheckel, Kirk G.1 aLi, Liping0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Nov., v. 266 p.115110-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1151103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03704naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245016000164300001200324500002000336520220200356592002802558650001702586650002702603650002502630650001002655650002602665650001502691650001502706650000902721650001302730650002002743650002202763650001202785650001602797650001502813650001402828650001702842700002102859700002202880700002002902700003202922700002202954700002002976700002302996773009603019856007403115852000903189655001203198IND60523678720221120162659.0160623e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052367872DNAL7 a10.1890/13-1023R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKartzinel, Tyler R.10aPlant and small‐mammal responses to large‐herbivore exclusion in an African savanna: five years of the UHURU experiment: Ecological Archives E095‐064  ap. 787.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAssessing the direct and indirect consequences of nonrandom species removal within guilds of strongly interacting species, such as large mammalian herbivores, is an important goal in basic and applied ecology. The ecological impacts of such perturbations are often contingent on abiotic conditions, which have hindered efforts to generalize the results of field experiments. Thus, there is a need for experiments that selectively remove different species from ecologically important guilds and that are replicated across environmental gradients. In 2008, we constructed a series of size‐selective large‐herbivore exclosures across a natural rainfall gradient in semi‐arid Kenyan savanna. This experiment (“UHURU”, for ungulate herbivory under rainfall uncertainty) aims to (a) characterize the effects of successively removing the largest size classes of herbivores from the system and (b) evaluate how the direction and magnitude of these effects are shaped by variation in precipitation regimes. UHURU consists of three electrically fenced herbivore‐exclusion treatments and an unfenced control, applied to blocks of contiguous 1‐ha plots. The three fenced treatments are: “Mega” (exclusion of elephants and giraffes only); “Meso” (exclusion of both megaherbivores and mesoherbivores, ∼40 kg and larger); and “Total” (exclusion of all herbivores ≥5 kg). Each block of treatments is replicated three times at each of three sites along the 20‐km rainfall gradient (increasing from 439 mm/yr in the north to 639 mm/yr in the south, with little background variation in soil attributes and species composition). We present data, spanning 2008–2013, from (a) biannual surveys of understory plants at 49 staked grid points within each of the 36 1‐ha plots (1764 total stakes); (b) annual woody‐plant censuses within the central 0.36 ha of each plot; (c) annual and semi‐annual monitoring of individually marked woody plants; (d) small‐mammal capture–mark–recapture sessions conducted every other month in total‐exclusion and open plots; (e) daily rainfall monitoring throughout the course of the experiment; and (f) quarterly large‐mammal dung surveys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElephantidae 3aGiraffa camelopardalis 3aenvironmental impact 3afeces 3afield experimentation 3aherbivores 3amonitoring 3arain 3asavannas 3asoil properties 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3aunderstory 3aungulates 3awoody plants1 aGoheen, Jacob R.1 aCharles, Grace K.1 aDeFranco, Elyse1 aMaclean, J.

Congo red (CR) and Direct blue 6 (DB) from single and binary adsorptive systems. Binary adsorptive system involved the synergistic and antagonistic influence of one dye over the adsorption of other dye. Physico-chemical alterations due to surfactant modification and post adsorption were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM), Zeta Potential, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), surface area analysis and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Process parameters influencing efficient adsorption of CR and DB species viz. initial pH of dye solution, adsorbent dosage, incubation temperature and initial concentration of dye species were optimised. Sorbate-sorbent interaction studies for single adsorptive system revealed sorbate’s monolayer formation over adsorbent’s surface and the involvement of chemisorption, as verified by Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second order model, respectively. Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was 555.56 mg/g for CR and 625.00 mg/g for DB. Meanwhile, for binary adsorptive system, competitive Langmuir model verified both CR and DB had antagonistic/competitive effect over each other’s adsorption. Thermodynamic analysis revealed the adsorptive process as exothermic, spontaneous and thermodynamically favourable with an elevated degree of dis-orderedness. Co-existing cations and anions has nominal effect on the adsorption capacity of dyes. Recyclability studies verified a modest efficiency of 62.52% for CR and 50.47% for DB species after the end of 4th adsorption-desorption cycle; thus affirming its recyclability potential. Phytotoxic assay affirmed the effectivity of the adsorbent in adsorbing dye species from aqueous solutions using Vigna mungo seeds as the model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMillettia pinnata 3aVigna mungo 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aheat production 3amodels 3apH 3aphytotoxicity 3apollution 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3azeta potential 0aAcid activated carbon 0aAnionic azo dyes 0aSingle/binary adsorptive system 0aCompetitive Langmuir isotherm model1 aGupta, Rishabh1 aBedadeep, Das1 aNarayanasamy, Selvaraju0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Nov., v. 266 p.115102-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1151023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245013200177300001400309520161700323592002801940650001801968650001101986650001001997650001602007650001802023650002402041650001302065650001802078650000702096650001202103650002102115650001702136650002002153650003702173653001802210653001102228653002302239653001602262700002002278700001802298773009102316856008502407852000902492655001202501IND60544556220221117094544.0190417e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054455622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foostr.2015.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarunglumlert, Teeraya10aInfluence of aggregate structure of casein on the encapsulation efficiency of β-carotene entrapped via hydrophobic interaction  ap. 42-50.  aSpray-dried casein clusters were prepared from sodium caseinate solutions and applied to the encapsulation of β-carotene via hydrophobic interactions. The influence of cluster types (aggregated casein formed by adjusting the solution pH and re-assembled micelles prepared by the addition of salts) on the encapsulation properties (i.e., encapsulation efficiency and storage stability) was evaluated. The encapsulation efficiency of aggregated casein was higher than that of the re-assembled casein micelles; aggregated casein prepared at pH 6.0 had the highest encapsulation efficiency. The results of SAXS and TEM observations showed that the aggregated casein had dense and packed cluster structure, while the cluster obtained from the re-assembled micelle system had randomly grown branches. Aging the solution of casein aggregated at pH 6.0 for 120h increased the encapsulation efficiency and simultaneously decreased the amount of free β-carotene. Dried powders obtained from the aged solution also showed good stability in terms of β-carotene retention and color changes under 11%RH and 75%RH over 21d. Evidence of cluster deformation was observed by SAXS for the aggregated casein solution with pH 6.0. The data suggested that the stability and encapsulation efficiency of spray-dried powders were closely linked to the nanostructures of the original clusters; thus, the product quality may prospectively be improved by utilizing processing conditions that effect cluster formation and affect the resultant structure, with the consequent influence on the encapsulation efficiency and storage stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-carotene 3acasein 3acolor 3adeformation 3aencapsulation 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amicelles 3ananomaterials 3apH 3apowders 3asodium caseinate 3aspray drying 3astorage quality 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aEncapsulation 0aCasein 0aCasein sodium salt 0aAggregation1 aNakagawa, Kyuya1 aAdachi, Shuji0 tFood structure.g2015 July, v. 5 p.42-50dElsevier LtdwJournal:23298x2213-32917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foostr.2015.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245009000192300001600282500001500298520104400313592002801357650002201385650001301407650001801420650001201438650001801450650003001468650002801498650001201526650004001538650004801578650003301626650001201659650001301671650003001684650005701714650004201771650003101813650002501844650004801869650001901917653001001936700002001946700001501966700001701981700001801998773009702016856005502113852000902168655001202177IND4469034320221121223731.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446903432DNAL7 a219549612pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04801.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlanz, Stephanie10aRaa4 is a trans‐splicing factor that specifically binds chloroplast tscA intron RNA  ap. 421-431.  a2019-12-06  aDuring trans‐splicing of discontinuous organellar introns, independently transcribed coding sequences are joined together to generate a continuous mRNA. The chloroplast psaA gene from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii encoding the P700 core protein of photosystem I (PSI) is split into three exons and two group IIB introns, which are both spliced in trans. Using forward genetics, we isolated a novel PSI mutant, raa4, with a defect in trans‐splicing of the first intron. Complementation analysis identified the affected gene encoding the 112.4 kDa Raa4 protein, which shares no strong sequence identity with other known proteins. The chloroplast localization of the protein was confirmed by confocal fluorescence microscopy, using a GFP‐tagged Raa4 fusion protein. RNA‐binding studies showed that Raa4 binds specifically to domains D2 and D3, but not to other conserved domains of the tripartite group II intron. Raa4 may play a role in stabilizing folding intermediates or functionally active structures of the split intron RNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3asequence analysis 3aproteins 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3aphotosystem I 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3afluorescence microscopy 3aintrons 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixgenetics 2aChloroplast Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aIntrons 2aMutation 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aPhotosystem I Protein Complexxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Chloroplastxgenetics 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTrans-Splicing 0agenes1 aJacobs, Jessica1 aKock, Vera1 aMishra, Arti1 aKück, Ulrich0 tplant journal.g2012 Feb., v. 69, no. 3 p.421-431dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04801.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245012900181300001200310520231900322592002802641650001702669650001602686650001802702650001802720650001002738651001002748653001802758653002402776653002102800653002202821700001502843700001502858700001902873773010002892856008502992852000903077655001203086IND60545981920221121065910.0160903e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054598192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2015.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Ceballos, M.A.14aThe role of mesoscale meteorology in modulating the 222Rn concentrations in Huelva (Spain) – impact of phosphogypsum piles  ap. 1-9.  aThe combined analysis of 222Rn activity concentrations and mesoscale meteorological conditions at Huelva city (Spain) was addressed in this study to understand the potential impact of phosphogypsum piles on the 222Rn activity concentrations registered at this area. Hourly mean data from April 2012 to February 2013 registered at two sampling sites (Huelva city and in the background station of El Arenosillo, located 27 km to the south-east) have been used in the study.The results of the present study showed a large difference in mean radon concentrations between the two stations during the sampling period, 6.3 ± 0.4 Bq m−3 at Huelva and 3.0 ± 0.2 Bq m−3 at El Arenosillo. The analysis has demonstrated that hourly 222Rn concentrations at Huelva city above 22 Bq m−3, with nocturnal peaks up to 50 Bq/m3, mainly coincided with the occurrence of a pure sea-land breeze cycle. Mesoscale circulations in this region are mainly characterized by two patterns of sea-land breeze, pure and non-pure, with the phosphosypsum piles directly upstream (south) of the city during the afternoon on pure sea-breeze days. The difference between mean 222Rn activity concentrations at Huelva city were 9.9 ± 1.5 Bq m−3 for the pure pattern and 3.3 ± 0.5 Bq m−3 for the non-pure pattern, while in the background station concentrations were 3.9 ± 0.4 Bq m−3 and 2.8 ± 0.4 Bq m−3 respectively.Considering these large differences, a detailed analysis of composites and case studies of representative sea-land breeze cycles of both types and their impact on 222Rn activity concentration was performed. The results suggested that the presence of the phosphogypsum piles was necessary in order to justify the high 222Rn activity concentrations observed at Huelva compared with the background station in the afternoons on pure sea breeze days (1.5–2.0 Bq m−3). On the other hand, large night time differences between the two sites on these days were likely to be associated with a combination of shallow density currents travelling down the Guadalquivir valley and, again, the presence of phosphogypsum piles.The results have demonstrated a significant impact of the phosphogypsum piles on 222Rn activity concentrations in Huelva city during the occurrence of pure sea breeze days.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ameteorology 3aphosphogypsum 3aradionuclides 3aradon 3aSpain 0aOutdoor radon 0aPhosphogypsum piles 0aSea-land breezes 0aIberian Peninsula1 aVargas, A.1 aArnold, D.1 aBolívar, J.P.0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2015 July, v. 145 p.1-9dElsevier Ltdx0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2015.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245009000160300001800250520236200268592002802630650001502658650002202673650001102695650001302706650001102719650002402730650001102754650001702765650001302782650001402795650001402809650001302823650001502836650001102851650001802862651001202880700002002892773009802912856007103010852000903081655001203090IND60518886520221119085713.0160419e199206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051888652DNAL7 a10.2307/19401772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoodman, Robert L.10aDifferential Larval Predation by Ants Can Influence Willow Sawfly Community Structure  ap. 1028-1037.  aWe experimentally tested the ability of generalist predatory ants to structure sawfly gall communities through differential predation on sawfly—galler larvae in relation to their life history patterns. Galler larvae of three species exit their galls in late summer and are exposed to predatory ants, while larvae of one species (stem—gallers) remain within their galls to overwinter. Many ant species (Formicidae) are patchily abundant in willows in northern Arizona. The abundances of four galler species and the activity levels of ant assemblages were assessed in census studies performed on variable numbers of the willow clones between 1986 and 1989. Two distinct types of sawfly gall communities were found on willow clones in the study area, communities composed of four galler species (stem, leaf, and petiole galls, and leaf folds), and communities composed primarily of stem galls. Clones with low ant activity levels support the former, whereas those with high activity levels support the latter. Experimental introductions of larvae of two existing species (leaf— and petiole—gallers) into and beneath natural willow clones with high and low ant activity levels showed that larvae are quickly captured by ants in and under high activity willows. Ants were not selective to larval species in these introductions, and were clearly shown to be generalist predators when experimentally offered two species of larvae. Experimental introductions of leaf— and petiole—galler larvae into four clones with high ant activity in 1987 and 1988 did not result in higher gall populations in the following year, indicating that larvae did not survive to recruit into those clones as adults. Experimental caging of leaf— and petiole—galler adults onto branches of high activity clones resulted in the establishment of modest populations of both species, followed by seemingly normal gall development patterns and larval survival rates inside galls. We conclude that the absence of leaf and petiole galls from willows with high ant activity is due to intensive larval predation by generalist ants, and not to plant resistance factors. This means that generalists and opportunistic predatory ants can significantly structure insect gall communities through differential predation that is dependent upon specific life history traits of some gallers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3aNematus ventralis 3aadults 3abranches 3aclones 3acommunity structure 3alarvae 3alife history 3apetioles 3apredation 3apredators 3asawflies 3astem galls 3asummer 3asurvival rate 3aArizona1 aPrice, Peter W.0 tEcology.g1992 June, v. 73, no. 3 p.1028-1037dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19401773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011000169300001400279520125700293592002801550650002401578650001101602650001301613650001401626650002201640650001301662700001501675700003001690700001801720773008601738856004801824852000901872655001201881IND50064746120221120183750.0130409e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006474612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-011-0989-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, Daryl L.10aEmpirical evidence linking increased hydrologic stability with decreased biotic diversity within wetlands  ap. 81-96.  aCompeting demands for water have resulted in many wetlands becoming either more permanently flooded or more permanently dry. It has been stated that such changes may lead to a loss of diversity in wetland communities; yet to date, this has not been tested experimentally. In this study, we experimentally test the hypothesis that increasing the hydrologic stability of wetlands results in reduced abundance, richness and diversity of aquatic biota emerging from wetland sediments. Sediment was collected from 19 wetlands that were divided into five groups (permanently flooded and wetlands that had been dry for 2, 7, 11 and 30 years). Aquatic plant communities germinating from the sediment of wetlands that had been permanently inundated and those that had been dry for 30 years had lower species richness and number of individuals than wetlands with intermediate flooding histories. For microfaunal communities, significantly less individuals but more taxa hatched from wetlands that had been permanently flooded or dry for 2 years than the other wetland groups. These results provide evidence of reduced biotic diversity as hydrological stability is increased under the common management scenarios of making wetlands more permanently wet or dry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic communities 3afloods 3ahatching 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 3awetlands1 aPodnar, K.1 aWatts, R.

Luteolin (0.0015 %) was applied to two cultivars of maize (Giza 2 and single cross 10) grains, germinated in the absence and presence of NaCl, in order to assess the bioactivity of luteolin and its role in alleviating the harmful effect of salt stress on maize. The results showed that luteolin enhanced germination and seedling growth of both maize cultivars in normal conditions. Furthermore, luteolin successfully alleviated the harmful effect of salinity on germination and seedling growth of maize. The potential role of luteolin was performed mainly by stimulating α-amylase activity leading to enhancing starch mobilization and increasing the accumulation of soluble sugars, and partially by enhancing the antioxidative defense. As future prospective, a great number of phenolic compounds need to be screened in order to make use of them in improving agriculture under stressful conditions. © 2012 Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCichorium endivia 3abioactive properties 3acorn 3acultivars 3agermination 3aleaves 3aluteolin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphenolic compounds 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseedling growth 3asodium chloride 3aspectral analysis 3astarch 3asugars1 aAbdElgawad, Hamada0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2012 Nov., v. 34, no. 6 p.2165-2177dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-012-1017-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245017200178300001600350520166200366592002802028650002402056650001602080650001902096650001602115650000902131650001102140650001802151650001702169650002702186650001502213650001302228651001102241653002402252653000802276653002702284653001702311653001902328653002602347700003302373700002402406700003002430700002502460700002402485700002302509773012002532856008502652852000902737655001202746IND60535288720221119212920.0190401e20140714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053528872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.03.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXenoulis, Panagiotis G.10aProspective evaluation of serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity and troponin I concentrations in Leishmania infantum-infected dogs treated with meglumine antimonate  ap. 326-330.  aCanine leishmaniosis (CanL) caused by Leishmania infantum is an important zoonotic disease. One of the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of CanL is meglumine antimonate. Drugs of this class have been associated with pancreatitis and cardiotoxicity in humans infected with Leishmania spp. The aim of this study was to measure serum canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (Spec cPL) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations in dogs with leishmaniosis during treatment with meglumine antimonate, and to compare them with those of dogs with leishmaniosis not treated with this drug. A total of 30 non-uremic dogs with leishmaniosis, living in Greece, were prospectively enrolled into the study. Of the 30 dogs, 20 (Group A) were treated with a combination of meglumine antimonate (100mg/kg, SC, q24h) and allopurinol (10mg/kg, PO, q12h) for 28 days, while 10 dogs (Group B) were treated with allopurinol alone (10mg/kg, PO, q12h) for 28 days. Blood samples were collected at timepoint 0 (before treatment) and at 14 and 28 days after the initiation of treatment. None of the dogs treated with meglumine antiomonate had a Spec cPL concentration suggestive of pancreatitis (≥400μg/L) or clinical signs suggestive of pancreatitis at any of the timepoints. Similarly, none of the dogs treated with meglumine antiomonate had a serum cTnI concentration above the upper limit of the reference range (>0.5ng/mL) or clinical evidence of cardiotoxicity at any of the 3 timepoints. In the present study, meglumine antimonate treatment in dogs with leishmaniosis did not result in clinical or laboratory evidence of either pancreatitis or cardiotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania infantum 3aallopurinol 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3adogs 3ahumans 3aleishmaniasis 3apancreatitis 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3atroponin I 3azoonoses 3aGreece 0aLeishmania infantum 0aDog 0aPentavalent antimonial 0aPancreatitis 0aCardiotoxicity 0aAdverse drug reaction1 aSaridomichelakis, Manolis N.1 aChatzis, Manolis K.1 aKasampalēs, Dēmētrēs,1 aPetanides, Theodoros1 aSuchodolski, Jan S.1 aSteiner, Jörg M.,0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2014 July 14, v. 203, no. 3-4 p.326-330dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.03.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02226naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009900170300001400269520084300283592002801126650003401154650002501188650001301213650002001226650002401246650001601270650001801286650001201304650001001316650001701326650001501343650002101358650001801379650001601397653001201413653001301425653002701438653002401465653002601489700002301515700001901538773010501557856008501662852000901747655001201756IND60544556620221117095145.0190417e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054455662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foostr.2015.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabaghi, Moslem10aEnhancing structural properties and antioxidant activity of kefiran films by chitosan addition  ap. 66-71.  aFilm-forming solutions of different ratios of kefiran to chitosan (100/0, 68/32, 50/50 and 32/68) were cast at oven in 30°C.

These effects may depend on dissolved nutrients that differentially constrain microbial autotrophy and heterotrophy to drive contrasting carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) dynamics during decomposition. We incubated sugar maple (Acer saccharum) litter under three dissolved P amendments (0, 50 or 500 μg L⁻¹ P) and two light levels (14 or 475 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹) in laboratory microcosms. We measured litter chlorophyll a, microbial respiration and net metabolism, carbon:nitrogen (C:N) and C:P content, microbial P uptake and release and litter decomposition over 134 days. Elevated dissolved P increased algal biomass in the high‐light treatment and magnified net heterotrophy and autotrophy in the low‐ and high‐light treatments, respectively. Litter C:P and C:N declined as dissolved P increased, and litter C:P was further reduced by high light only in the highest P treatment. Microbial P uptake fluxes peaked under moderate P and high light, whereas P release fluxes were consistently low throughout the experiment. The percent of P uptake that was released was significantly higher under low light. High light stimulated decomposition under low P but slowed decomposition under high P, suggesting increased nutrients weakened algal priming of litter decomposition. Our study suggests factors controlling the degree of autotrophy versus heterotrophy on organic matter, such as light and nutrient availability, may interactively shift litter C and P dynamics during decomposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer saccharum subsp. saccharum 3aalgae 3aautotrophs 3abiomass 3acarbon 3achlorophyll 3ametabolism 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3aphotons 3aplant litter 3astoichiometry1 aScott, Erin E.1 aEntrekin, Sally A.1 aEvans‐White, Michelle A.1 aScott, J.

However, information concerning the impact of this species of lungworm on feline population is limited to a few case reports. From July 2011 to May 2013 an epidemiological survey was carried out on Sardinia island (Italy), where 107 individual faecal samples were examined by Baermann technique, and first-stage larvae were identified based on their morphology and characterization of molecular markers. The 29.9% (32/107) of cats examined were infested by broncho-pulmonary nematodes and, although A. abstrusus was the most frequently detected (n=27; 25.2%), larvae of T. brevior were also found (n=7; 6.5%). In addition, two cats (1.9%) were co-infested by both species. Overall metastrongyloid infection was higher in female cats (n=22; 38.6%) than in males (n=10; 20%) (χ2=4.39; p=0.036). The mean age of positive animals was 21.1 (±29.8) months, being infected animals from 2 months to 10 years of age. Of the 32 animals that scored positive for lungworms only 6 (18.8%) displayed a respiratory condition associated with lungworm infestations. Biomolecular characterization confirmed the morphological diagnosis of A. abstrusus. Positive samples that were identified at genus level as Troglostrongylus spp. were molecularly characterized as T. brevior. This study represents the first epidemiological survey on metastrongyloid lungworms of domestic cats in Sardinia and the first report of T. brevior on this island.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAelurostrongylus 3aCrenosomatidae 3acase studies 3acats 3aepidemiological studies 3afeces 3afemales 3agenetic markers 3alarvae 3alungworms 3amales 3aItaly 3aSardinia 3aSpain 0aBroncho-pulmonary nematodes 0aAelurostrongylus abstrusus 0aTroglostrongylus brevior 0aCats 0aEpidemiology 0aSardinia1 aVarcasia, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6306-99781 aBrianti, E.1 aPipia, A.P.1 aFrau, V.1 aPinna Parpaglia, M.L.1 aSanna, G.1 aGarippa, G.1 aOtranto, D.1 aScala, A.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2014 June 16, v. 203, no. 1-2 p.222-226dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01970naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014300169300001600312520032900328592002800657650002000685650002900705650002300734650002900757650001300786650001100799650001700810653002900827653002900856653002300885653002900908653002200937653002200959700001800981700001800999700001801017700001901035700001601054700002201070700002401092700001701116700002401133700002101157700002001178773017201198856008501370852000901455655001201464IND60543726320221123032430.0180904e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054372632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2015.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFunahashi, Eri10aFinding of thiosulfate pathway for synthesis of organic sulfur compounds in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and improvement of ethanol production  ap. 666-669.  aWe found that Saccharomyces cerevisiae utilizes thiosulfate as a sole sulfur source.

Primary data supplied by a Portuguese manufacturer contributed for achieving accurate life cycle inventory data that were then modelled in SimaPro 8.5.0 complemented with data from Ecoinvent database 3.4. The assessment was performed using the Recipe 2016 Midpoint V1.01 at the Hierarchist perspective. The results of the study show that the use stage (mainly owing to water consumption and fuel pre-combustion and combustion) is by far the largest contributor to the environmental burdens, followed by the raw materials production stage. The comparison between the two fuels considered demonstrates that liquefied petroleum gas leads to higher impacts than natural gas, mainly as a result of emissions from its own life cycle. The environmental damage varies noticeably in some impact categories depending on the country where this water heater is used, due to different natural gas origins. Practical implications of this work will enable the manufacturer to identify where to focus on the new water heaters that will be developed to achieve better levels of environment-friendliness.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3acradle-to-grave 3adatabases 3aemissions 3aheaters 3alife cycle inventory 3aliquid petroleum gas 3anatural gas 3araw materials 0aGas-fired water heater 0aLife cycle assessment 0aSustainability 0aEcodesign1 aDias, Ana Cláudia0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 254 p.109786-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1097863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03441naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245015400161300001600315520200400331592002802335650001202363650001102375650002402386650002002410650002002430650001102450650001402461650001202475650001502487650001302502650001502515650001102530650001702541650001002558650002102568650001702589650002002606650001402626650001002640650001502650651001102665700002202676700002002698700002402718773011102742856007302853852000902926655001202935IND60519622420221116144156.0160506e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051962242DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.127452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlson, Peter E.10aStrong land‐use effects on the dispersal patterns of adult stream insects: implications for transfers of aquatic subsidies to terrestrial consumers  ap. 848-861.  aThe dispersal of terrestrial adults of freshwater insects is a key process regulating the transfer resources from aquatic habitats to terrestrial consumers, including high‐quality lipids synthesised in the aquatic environment. However, the efficiency of these transfers depends strongly on both subsidy production in the aquatic source habitat and permeability of the aquatic–terrestrial boundary. We assessed how land use (agriculture versus forest) affects stream riparian habitats and the dispersal of adult aquatic insects. Flying insects were sampled alongside eight streams (four agricultural, four forested) in central Sweden using sticky traps, placed from 1 up to 100 m from the stream edge. Environmental variables including temperature, wind, vegetation structure and canopy cover were also quantified. Abundances of adult aquatic insects were greater at agricultural than at forested sites, but most (64%) were caught close to the stream edge. In contrast, catches of adult aquatic insects declined relatively little with increasing distance from the forest streams. Overall, dispersal of the dominant aquatic insect order (Diptera) was positively associated with greater tree density and canopy shading and negatively associated with higher wind speeds and soil temperatures, more open habitats and steeper topographies. Taxonomic differences among assemblages, reflecting differing dispersal capacities, were also important, but less so than environmental factors. Our results indicate that adult aquatic insects in our forested landscapes are more likely to subsidise near‐ground food webs at a greater distance from stream channels, whereas the abundant subsidy emerging from the agricultural sites is likely to be most influential near the stream channel. A key question for future research is whether the deposition of large quantities of aquatic subsidy in agricultural riparian habitats exceeds the resource requirements and processing capacities of terrestrial consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiptera 3aadults 3aaquatic environment 3aaquatic habitat 3aaquatic insects 3acanopy 3afood webs 3aforests 3afreshwater 3aland use 3alandscapes 3alipids 3apermeability 3ashade 3asoil temperature 3asticky traps 3astream channels 3asubsidies 3atrees 3awind speed 3aSweden1 aMcKie, Brendan G.1 aSandin, Leonard1 aJohnson, Richard K.0 tFreshwater biology.g2016 June, v. 61, no. 6 p.848-861dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.127453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003200141245010800173520207200281592002802353650001602381650002002397650001102417650000902428650001102437700003002448700002202478700002302500773011702523856007602640852000902716655001202725IND60760628920221122045220.0211223e20211004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076062892DNAL7 a10.3390/fire40400672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShams Abadi, Seyedeh Tannaz10aBIM-Based Co-Simulation of Fire and Occupants’ Behavior for Safe Construction Rehabilitation Planning  aConstruction renovation projects increase the risk of structural fire, mostly due to the accumulation of combustible construction materials and waste. In particular, when the building remains operational during such projects, the redistribution of occupants and interruptions with access corridors/exit egress can exponentially increase the risk for the occupants. Most construction projects are, however, planned and scheduled merely based on the time and budget criteria. While safety is considered paramount and is meant to be applied as a hard constraint in the scheduling stage, in practice, safe evacuation considerations are reduced to rules of thumb and general code guidelines. In this paper, we propose simulation as a tool to introduce safety under structural fire, as a decision criterion, to be mixed with time and budget for selecting the best construction schedule alternative. We have used the BIM (building information model) to extract the building’s spatial and physical properties; and have applied co-simulation of fire, through computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and occupants’ evacuation behavior, through agent-based modeling (ABM) to estimate the average and maximum required safe egress time for various construction sequencing alternatives. This parameter is then used as a third decision criterion, combined with the project’s cost and duration, to evaluate construction schedule alternatives. We applied our method to a three-floor fire zone in a high-rise educational building in Montreal, and our results show that considering the fire safety criterion can make a difference in the final construction schedule. Our proposed method suggests an additional metric for evaluating renovation projects’ construction plans, particularly in congested buildings which need to remain fully or partially operational during the renovation. Thus, this method can be employed by safety officers and facility managers, as well as construction project planners to guide accounting for fire incidents while planning for these types of projects.  aPublisher supplied data 3afire safety 3afluid mechanics 3amodels 3arisk 3awastes1 aMoniri Tokmehdash, Nojan 1 aHosny, Abdelhady 1 aNik-Bakht, Mazdak 0 tFire.g2021 Oct. 04, v. 4, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27135x2571-62557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fire40400673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136024004600175040001800221100002000239245009000259300001600349506002800365506003600393506007600429506003100505520116300536592002801699596004501727506003701772650002501809650003801834650001501872650002201887650001501909650001801924650001101942650000901953650001701962650001501979650001201994653000802006653000802014653001002022653000902032653000902041653002502050653002502075653002302100653002302123653002302146653002102169700002002190700001402210700001802224700001802242700001902260700002402279773010902303856008602412903002402498852000902522655001202531IND60563926120221207131216.0190319e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056392612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2017.01.0362chorus7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2017.01.0362doi7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2017.01.0362chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOki, Lorence R.10aElimination of Tobacco mosaic virus from irrigation runoff using slow sand filtration  ap. 107-113.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aSlow sand filters (SSF) are effective in removing pythiacious organisms from captured runoff to prepare the water for reuse in irrigation. Plant viruses can also be present in this runoff, but until this study, it hadn’t been clearly shown that SSFs can remove these pathogens. In this study, purified preparations of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were regularly added to captured irrigation runoff water that was provided to the SSFs. Water samples were collected weekly from sampling ports above and below the sand bed and tested for the presence of TMV by ELISA and inoculation to indicator plants. Biologically viable TMV passed through the sand filters for approximately 5 weeks, followed by a gradual reduction and then elimination of detectable amounts of the virus by week 6–9. Testing of water samples continued for several more weeks after the initial loss of virus titer to confirm complete elimination. This is the first controlled study showing elimination of a plant virus from captured irrigation runoff using SSFs. Since TMV is a highly robust organism, it is likely that other plant pathogenic viruses can also be removed using SSF systems.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afiltration 3aindicator species 3airrigation 3aplant viruses 3arunoff 3asand 3asand filters 3aviral load 3aviruses 0aSSF 0aTMV 0aELISA 0aPFBV 0aToMV 0aTobacco mosaic virus 0aSlow sand filtration 0aVirus transmission 0aBiological control 0aDisease management 0aWater management1 aBodaghi, Sohrab1 aLee, Eric1 aHaver, Darren1 aPitton, Bruno1 aNackley, Lloyd1 aMathews, Deborah M.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 217 p.107-113dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2017.01.0363Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle04491naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001300168245011600181300001600297520250700313592002802820650001502848650002702863650002702890650001202917650001002929650001102939650001902950650001002969650001002979650003002989650001803019650003403037650001103071650002903082650002503111650001203136650003903148650002603187650001103213650002903224650004503253650004103298650000903339650002303348650003003371650003703401650003803438650001603476650002603492650003603518700002503554700001403579700001703593700002503610700001703635773009503652856008503747852000903832655001203841IND4446544820221118064522.0141110e20110117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444654482DNAL7 a210364072pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, D.10aTributyltin-induced imposex in marine gastropods involves tissue-specific modulation of the retinoid X receptor  ap. 221-227.  aDespite the large number of studies on the phenomenon of imposex, the mechanism underlying the abnormal growth of male sexual characters onto females in numerous gastropod species is yet to be fully elucidated. Although several hypotheses have been raised over the years, a convincing body of evidence indicates that tributyltin-induced imposex involves the abnormal modulation of the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Here, we investigate the RXR gene transcription at different timings and tissues upon exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of tributyltin (TBT) (100ng Sn/L TBT) in both genders of the imposex susceptible gastropod Nucella lapillus. RXR gene transcription was determined at two time-points (i.e., before and after imposex initiation) by quantitative Real Time PCR in potential target tissues: the central nervous system (CNS), penis/penis forming area (PFA), gonads and digestive gland. TBT-exposure altered transcription of RXR gene in a tissue and sex specific manner. In the CNS, a significant down-regulation was observed in females both before and after imposex initiation (P≤0.01 and P≤0.05, respectively). A similar trend was observed in male CNS at the first time-point, although differences between control and the TBT-exposed group were just above significance (P=0.059). The penis/PFA showed no differences in transcription of RXR gene between control and TBT exposed female snails before imposex induction, or before and after imposex initiation for males. However, male penis showed higher transcription of RXR gene in comparison to the PFA of females. After imposex has been induced, a significant (P≤0.001) increase in transcription of RXR gene was observed in penis of females with vas deference sequence index (VDS) levels of 3–4 in comparison with the PFA of both control and imposex females with VDS 1–2. At advanced stages of imposex, females displayed RXR transcription patterns in penis identical to those of males, which points to a functional role of RXR in the penis of both genders. In the other tissues, gonads and digestive gland, RXR gene transcription was not affected by TBT, at any of the analysed time-points. These patterns of RXR gene transcription upon TBT exposure highlight the pivotal involvement of the CNS in the mechanism of imposex induction. We integrate the results in a conceptual model, and discuss the central role of RXR and the retinoic acid signalling pathways in imposex and male genitalia formation in gastropods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3acentral nervous system 3aenvironmental exposure 3afemales 3agenes 3agonads 3amale genitalia 3amales 3apenis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aretinoic acid 3asex differentiation disorders 3asnails 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aCentral Nervous Systemxmetabolism 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGastropodaxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGenitaliaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRetinoid X Receptorsxmetabolism 2aSex Differentiationxdrug effects 2aSex Factors 2aTretinoinxmetabolism 2aTrialkyltin Compoundsxtoxicity1 aReis-Henriques, M.A.1 aSilva, R.1 aSantos, A.I.1 aFilipe C.

This study evaluated the potential of crop residues numerically for the co-production of power and bio-fertilizer using ASPEN Plus® simulation software. The results showed that the gas yield increases with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure while the yield of bio-fertilizer is dependent on the biomass composition. The biomass with a low ash content produces high bio-fertilizer at the designated gasification temperature. The IGCC configuration conserves more energy than a directly-fired biomass power plant. In addition, the solar-assisted IGCC attains a higher net electricity output per unit of crop residue feed and achieves net thermal efficiencies of around 53%. The use of such hybrid systems offer the potential to produce 0.55 MW of electricity per unit of solar-thermal energy at a relatively low cost. The ASPEN Plus model predicted that the solar biomass-based IGCC set up is more efficient in increasing the power generation capacity than any other conversion system. The results showed that a solar to electricity efficiency of approximately 55% is achievable with potential improvements. This work will contribute for the sustainable bioenergy production as the relationship between energy production and biomass supplies very important to ensure the food security and environmental sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aash content 3abiofertilizers 3abiomass 3acomputer simulation 3acrop residues 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3afood security 3agasification 3amodels 3apollution 3apower generation 3apower plants 3atemperature 0aConcentrated solar power 0aBio-fertilizer 0aSyngas 0aIntegrated gasification combined cycle1 aAhmed, Ashfaq1 aRazzaq, Abdul1 aHildebrandt, Diane1 aLiu, Xinying1 aPark, Young-Kwon0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Nov., v. 266 p.115103-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1151033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03649naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003900150245012300189300001600312500001500328520195800343592002802301650003402329650003102363650002802394650002402422650002702446650001402473650002402487650000902511650001502520650002102535650001302556650002802569650001202597650001202609650001102621653001002632653002002642653001602662653001602678700002702694700002802721700002102749700004402770700002202814700001802836700003902854773012002893856008503013852000903098655001203107IND60535289120221119213049.0190401e20140714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053528912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonteiro, Caio Márcio de Oliveira10aEntomopathogenic nematodes in insect cadaver formulations for the control of Rhipicephalus microplus (Acari: Ixodidae)  ap. 310-317.  a2019-12-06  aThis study evaluated the efficacy of four entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) strains in insect cadaver formulations against Rhipicephalus microplus and compared the efficacy of the most virulent EPNs applied in cadavers of Galleria mellonella and Tenebrio molitor. In the first experiment, infected G. mellonela larvae were used as the source of EPNs. Engorged females of R. microplus were placed in pots filled with soil and different numbers of G. mellonella larvae infected with one of four species of nematodes. All treatments with EPNs of the genus Heterorhabditis caused significant reduction (p<0.05) in the egg mass weight and hatching percentage of larvae. The EPNs of the genus Steinernema, except for the group exposed to Steinernema carpocapsae ALL, whose source nematodes included six larvae of G. mellonella, caused a significant reduction (p<0.05) in the egg mass weight produced per female. Steinernema feltiae SN applied with two, four, and six cadavers and S. carpocapsae ALL with two cadavers caused a reduction in hatching percentage of larvae of R. microplus (p<0.05). The percentage of control was above 95% in all groups treated with Heterorhabditis bacteriophora HP88 and Heterorhabditis indica LPP1 and in the treatment with four larvae infected with S. feltiae SN. The second experiment followed the same methodology, using G. mellonella and T. molitor larvae infected by the two most virulent EPNs. H. bacteriophora HP88 and H. indica LPP1 in different formulations caused reduction in the egg mass weight and hatching percentage of larvae. The percentage of control were 82.4 and 84.9% for H. bacteriophora HP88 and H. indica LPP1, respectively, formulated in T. molitor, and reaching 99.9% in groups formulated with G. mellonella. The EPNs tested in insect cadaver formulation showed pathogenicity to engorged females of R. microplus and EPNs of the genus Heterorhabditis formulated in G. mellonella larvae were more effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeterorhabditis bacteriophora 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3aSteinernema feltiae 3aHeterorhabditis indica 3avirulence 3aGalleria mellonella 3asoil 3aegg weight 3aTenebrio molitor 3ahatching 3aSteinernema carpocapsae 3ainsects 3afemales 3alarvae 0aAcari 0aHeterorhabditis 0aCattle tick 0aSteinernema1 aMatos, Renata da Silva1 aAraújo, Laryssa Xavier1 aCampos, Roberson1 aBittencourt, Vânia Rita Elias Pinheiro1 aDolinski, Claudia1 aFurlong, John1 aPrata, Márcia Cristina de Azevedo0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2014 July 14, v. 203, no. 3-4 p.310-317dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02221naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245004100159520123500200592002801435650002001463650002001483650001601503650002301519650001001542650001901552650001601571650001301587650000901600700001801609700002301627700001901650773011701669856007601786852000901862655001201871IND60760629120221122045322.0211223e20211010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076062912DNAL7 a10.3390/fire40400692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSagel, Daryn 10aFine-Scale Fire Spread in Pine Straw  aMost wildland and prescribed fire spread occurs through ground fuels, and the rate of spread (RoS) in such environments is often summarized with empirical models that assume uniform environmental conditions and produce a unique RoS. On the other hand, representing the effects of local, small-scale variations of fuel and wind experienced in the field is challenging and, for landscape-scale models, impractical. Moreover, the level of uncertainty associated with characterizing RoS and flame dynamics in the presence of turbulent flow demonstrates the need for further understanding of fire dynamics at small scales in realistic settings. This work describes adapted computer vision techniques used to form fine-scale measurements of the spatially and temporally varying RoS in a natural setting. These algorithms are applied to infrared and visible images of a small-scale prescribed burn of a quasi-homogeneous pine needle bed under stationary wind conditions. A large number of distinct fire front displacements are then used statistically to analyze the fire spread. We find that the fine-scale forward RoS is characterized by an exponential distribution, suggesting a model for fire spread as a random process at this scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer vision 3aconifer needles 3afire spread 3aprescribed burning 3astraw 3aturbulent flow 3auncertainty 3awildland 3awind1 aSpeer, Kevin 1 aPokswinski, Scott 1 aQuaife, Bryan 0 tFire.g2021 Oct. 10, v. 4, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27135x2571-62557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fire40400693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011100168300001400279520095800293592002801251650000801279650001001287650001901297650001101316650002601327650002201353650001301375650002301388650002301411650001501434650001301449650001701462650001601479650001201495650001301507650002601520653001101546653001201557653001301569653001901582653001901601700002201620700002401642700002301666773010701689856008301796852000901879655001201888IND60544557220221117095400.0190417e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054455722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2015.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelović, Miona14aThe influence of hot air treatment and UV irradiation on the quality of two tomato varieties after storage  ap. 63-67.  aThe influence of hot air and ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the sensory quality of tomatoes after storage was compared. Two tomato varieties (“Zouk” and “Camry”) were harvested in turning ripening stage and treated with hot air (60°C) or UV radiation. Fruits were stored for 14 days in semi-controlled conditions (temperature range 14.4–19.9°C, relative humidity range 35–55%), while non-treated tomatoes stored under the same conditions were used as a control. Sensory evaluation of samples was performed by trained panel, and instrumental measurements of color and texture were also carried out. Both postharvest treatments were effective in preventing tomato fruit spoilage. Hot air treatment resulted in better quality of tomato fruits in terms of sensory properties after two weeks of storage, but the UV irradiation resulted in favorable effects in terms of extension of tomato shelf life because it led to delayed ripening of tomato.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acolor 3afood packaging 3afruits 3apostharvest treatment 3arelative humidity 3aripening 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3astorage time 3atemperature 3atexture 3atomatoes 3aultraviolet radiation 0aTomato 0aStorage 0aRipening 0aHeat treatment 0aUV irradiation1 aKevrešan, Žarko1 aPestorić, Mladenka1 aMastilović, Jasna0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2015 Sept., v. 5 p.63-67dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2015.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014100168300001600309520088600325592002801211650003001239650001301269650001501282650001501297650001701312650001701329650002801346650002301374650002201397650001301419650001701432650001401449650001701463653001801480653001301498653001701511653003001528653001401558700003001572773017201602856008501774852000901859655001201868IND60543726820221123005531.0180904e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054372682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2015.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇabuk, Burcu10aProtection of Lactobacillus acidophilus NRRL-B 4495 under in vitro gastrointestinal conditions with whey protein/pullulan microcapsules  ap. 650-656.  aIn this research, whey protein/pullulan (WP/pullulan) microcapsules were developed in order to assess its protective effect on the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus NRRL-B 4495 under in vitro gastrointestinal conditions.

This data set is unique in that it provides comprehensive water quality sampling, habitat conditions, and associated breeding and molting waterfowl data over a three‐year period, which includes a drought year. Land use in the BTZ has rapidly changed with at least 73% of the BTZ, particularly in Saskatchewan, AB, being converted from forest to agriculture since the early 20th century. The BTZ has experienced a drying trend over the past 60 years with the lowest cumulative effective precipitation since 1943 with a −2323‐mm precipitation deficit recorded in 2006. A total of 723 and 489 wetlands were surveyed for waterfowl abundance during the breeding and molting seasons, respectively. A subset of 214 and 213 wetlands in May and August, respectively, was further sampled for habitat, limnology, and agricultural encroachment surrounding the wetland. A subset of 25 wetlands was sampled in 2006 for fish abundance data. This data set has been used in several papers in assessing the impact of drought and agricultural impact on water quality and wetland conditions, as well as drought and land use impacts on habitat associations between breeding and molting waterfowl and wetland condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abreeding 3adata collection 3adrought 3adrying 3afish 3afish communities 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aland use 3alandscapes 3alimnology 3alowlands 3amolting 3awater quality 3awaterfowl 3awetlands 3aAlberta 3aBritish Columbia 3aSaskatchewan1 aBayley, Suzanne E.1 aThompson, Jonathan E.0 tEcology.g2014 Mar., v. 95, no. 3 p.789-789dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-1910.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013500160300001600295520110300311592002801414650002301442650001201465650001501477650001501492650002401507650001401531650001001545650001701555650001401572650001601586700002301602700002101625773011101646856007301757852000901830655001201839IND60519623020221116144201.0160506e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051962302DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.127542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, Brie A.10aEffects of declining calcium availability on the survival, growth and calcium content of a freshwater crayfish, Orconectes virilis  ap. 914-922.  aCalcium (Ca) decline is a severe and widespread phenomenon threatening softwater ecosystems around the world. In north temperate lakes, these declines have been linked with declines in numerous freshwater taxa, in particular, crustacean zooplankton and crayfish. The purpose of this study was to determine, under lab conditions, the effect of low Ca concentrations on survival, growth and Ca content of a freshwater crayfish, Orconectes virilis, originating in a region experiencing Ca decline. We found that survival of juvenile O. virilis was significantly reduced at 0.5–0.9 mg L⁻¹, which is among the lowest requirement reported for a freshwater crayfish. Neither growth nor whole‐body Ca content were related to Ca concentration. Based on these findings, the acute tolerance of O. virilis to low Ca may allow the species to persist under forecast concentrations of lakes in regions experiencing Ca decline; however, most lakes are experiencing stress from multiple environmental agents which could influence the impact of Ca on mortality and potentially other life history attributes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrconectes virilis 3acalcium 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3afreshwater crayfish 3ajuveniles 3alakes 3alife history 3amortality 3azooplankton1 aJackson, Donald A.1 aSomers, Keith M.0 tFreshwater biology.g2016 June, v. 61, no. 6 p.914-922dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.127543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004800094040001800142100002300160245009700183300001400280506002800294520120600322592002801528506003701556650002101593650002901614650001801643650002001661650002001681650000901701650001401710650001501724650001601739653001401755653001901769653001501788653002001803700002001823700002001843773011001863856009501973852000902068655001202077IND60774315720221207072213.0200608e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077431572DNAL7 ahttps://doi.org/10.21897/rta.v20i2.7612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez, Luz A.10aAssessment of productive parameters in broilers and supplemented by probiotic microorganisms  ap. 81-85.  aResource is Open Access  aPoultry systems intended for the production of broilers usually handle high poultry densities to obtain a higher production rate of meat by confinement area, situation that results in animal stress and thus zootechnical low yields. Considering that the use of probiotics in animal nutrition is an alternative to improve production rates and replace the use of growth-promoter antibiotics, this research evaluated the effect of a consortium of microorganisms, probiotics, Bacillus clausii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactococuslactis on the weight gain and food conversion rate in broilers. Probiotics were administered in drinking water at the rate of 1 x 108 UFC of each microorganism, by 2 ml g-1 of food offered at day 10, 20 and 30 of growth counted from the second day of life of the chicken. Weighing of animals took place at day 10,30, and 42 of production. Statistical analyses showed significant differences with P<0,05 between the two treatments, demonstrating that the probiotic supplemented population gained an average weight of 65,97 g/day, 1,74 food conversion and 0% mortality. These data suggest that probiotics have a positive effect on weight gain and feed conversion in broilers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus clausii 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aanimal stress 3afeed conversion 3afood conversion 3ameat 3amortality 3aprobiotics 3aweight gain 0aprobiotic 0asuplementation 0aconsortium 0alactic bacteria1 aBedoya, Oswaldo1 aArenas, Juan E.0 tTemas Agrarios.g2015 July, v. 20, no. 2 p.81-85dUniversidad de CórdobawJournal:27729x2389-91827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.21897/rta.v20i2.7613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245005800167300001400225520120300239592002801442650001601470650001801486650001001504650001701514650002501531653001301556653002101569653001701590653002101607653002401628700002401652700001801676700002001694773009201714856008401806852000901890655001201899IND60535552020221117222457.0190318e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053555202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2013.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAres, Gaston,10aFood and wellbeing. Towards a consumer-based approach  ap. 61-69.  aInterest in understanding how foods affect consumers’ perceived wellbeing has grown in the last decade due to the increasing need to modify dietary patterns. Considering that wellbeing is a broad concept that lacks of a unique definition, in order to use and measure this concept it is necessary to explore how consumers understand it, particularly in the context of food consumption. The aim of the present work was to investigate consumers’ perception of wellbeing in a food-related context using an exploratory qualitative approach. A study was carried out with 120 Uruguayan participants using three qualitative techniques: word association, open-ended questions and free listing. Wellbeing in a food-related context was strongly associated with physical health. The expected effects of foods on wellbeing were mainly related to non-communicable diseases such as high cholesterol levels, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. However, hedonic and emotional aspects of food consumption were also salient for consumers perceived wellbeing. The information gathered in this study can contribute to the development of scales for measuring consumer perceived wellbeing when consuming foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholesterol 3aeating habits 3afoods 3ahypertension 3aqualitative analysis 0aWellness 0aConsumer studies 0aFree listing 0aWord association 0aQualitative studies1 aDe Saldamando, Luis1 aGiménez, Ana1 aDeliza, Rosires0 tAppetite.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 74 p.61-69dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2013.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001900192245013100211300001400342506007600356520156200432592002801994506003702022650001802059650001102077650001302088650001602101650002202117650001602139650002302155650001602178650002802194650000902222650002702231650001602258653002302274653002802297653002902325653002502354700002002379700002002399700001802419773009002437856008502527852000902612655001202621IND60086132020221207080129.0161018e20130910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008613202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.03.0272doi7 aPMC37457832pmcid7 a235628662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbegg, Kathrin10aAcute peripheral GLP-1 receptor agonism or antagonism does not alter energy expenditure in rats after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass  ap. 70-78.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCompared to traditional weight loss strategies, the compensatory decrease in energy expenditure in response to body weight loss is markedly attenuated after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). Because basal and postprandial levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are increased after RYGB surgery, and because GLP-1 has been shown to increase energy expenditure, we investigated if increased GLP-1 levels are involved in the alterations in energy expenditure after RYGB. Adult male Wistar rats were randomized for RYGB (n=8) or sham surgery (n=17). Part of the sham-operated rats were food restricted and body weight-matched (n=8) to the RYGB animals. The effects of acute subcutaneous administration of the GLP-1 antagonist Exendin (9–39) (Ex-9, 30μg/kg) or the GLP-1 agonist Exendin-4 (Ex-4, 5μg/kg), respectively, on energy expenditure were tested using indirect calorimetry. We found that Ex-9 increased food intake in RYGB, but not in sham-operated rats.Energy expenditure was lower in RYGB and sham-operated body weight-matched rats compared to sham-operated ad libitum fed rats, but significantly higher in RYGB rats compared to sham-operated body weight-matched rats. There was no effect of Ex-9 treatment on energy expenditure in either group of animals. Similarly, Ex-4 decreased food intake more in RYGB than in sham-operated rats, but Ex-4 did not modulate energy expenditure in any surgical group. We conclude that acute modulation of GLP-1 signaling is not directly involved in altered energy expenditure after RYGB surgery in rats.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacute effects 3aadults 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3abariatric surgery 3acalorimetry 3aenergy expenditure 3afood intake 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3arats 3asubcutaneous injection 3aweight loss 0aEnergy expenditure 0aGlucagon-like peptide-1 0aRoux-en-Y gastric bypass 0aIndirect calorimetry1 aSchiesser, Marc1 aLutz, Thomas A.1 aBueter, Marco0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2013 Sept. 10, v. 121 p.70-78dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03660naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245013900203300001600342520213800358592002802496650001102524650001702535650002502552650001702577650002002594650002802614650001202642650002202654650002102676650001202697650001402709650002302723650001102746650003002757650002602787650001902813650001702832650000902849651001202858651001202870700001502882700001702897700002002914700001402934773011202948856008503060852000903145655001203154IND60576023320221117190701.0190509e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057602332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2017.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuber, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6044-797710aApplication of multi criteria analysis methods for a participatory assessment of non-wood forest products in two European case studies  ap. 103-111.  aWith the advent of the European bioeconomy and a shift in lifestyle among European citizens, non-wood forest products (NWFPs) are given more attention in the public debate. Their potential to strengthen the economic viability of rural economies appears to be high, particularly in regions where wood is not the most profitable forest product. However, information on NWFP production potentials are scarce and tools to support forest owners in decision making about NWFP management are rarely available. Considering the complex relationships between a sustained production of NWFPs, the use of the available ecological resources, as well as the organizational and the market potential of forest management regimes, we introduce a knowledge-based expert model for supporting NWFP management. In a mixed-method approach qualitative and quantitative techniques are combined to depict regional production and business potentials of NWFPs, explicitly addressing different environmental and socio-economic contexts. For the model building multi-criteria analysis methods were used for preference elicitations in an iterative form, including stakeholders and experts. Within two distinct case study settings (i.e. Austria and Finland) the expert model is tested for applicability and to depict the most suitable option from a suite of selected NWFPs. Results for both case studies well reflect current NWFP business potentials and provide insights to the opportunities of mixing more resilient and more risky NWFPs to a solid regional business portfolio, fostering the co-production of wood and non-wood resources. The approach presented has a potential to steer the mindset of different forest owner types to critically revise their interests in forest management. It could act as an eye-opener for forestry-oriented stakeholders who have not yet considered NWFPs as potential assets in forest management systems. With its ability to include various NWFPs and to consider different forest owner preferences, future applications can be tailored towards the needs of both small-scale (non-industrial) forest owners and bigger forest holdings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3abioeconomics 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aeconomic sustainability 3aexperts 3aforest management 3aforest ownership 3aforests 3alifestyle 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3anontimber forest products 3aquantitative analysis 3asocioeconomics 3astakeholders 3awood 3aAustria 3aFinland1 aHujala, T.1 aKurttila, M.1 aWolfslehner, B.1 aVacik, H.0 tForest policy and economics.g2019 June, v. 103 p.103-111dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2017.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100005700183245015500240506007600395520153800471592002802009596002702037506003702064650001402101650002602115650002202141650001402163650000702177650001902184650002402203700002002227700001902247700002202266700001802288700001702306700002102323700001702344700006002361773012002421856007602541852000902617655001202626IND60686360920221207073650.0200317e20200304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068636092DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/82650542doi7 aPMC70735042pmcid7 a321904042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLennon, Gavin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4072-398910aAssessing the Oxidative Degradation of N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP) in Microelectronic Fabrication Processes by Using a Multiplatform Analytical Approach  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring the construction of recording head devices, corrosion of metal features and subsequent deposition of corrosion by-products have been observed. Previous studies have determined that the use of N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) may be a contributing factor. In this study, we report the use of a novel multiplatform analytical approach comprising of pH, liquid chromatography/UV detection (LC/UV), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), and LC/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to demonstrate that reaction conditions mimicking those of general photoresist removal processes can invoke the oxidation of NMP during the photolithography lift-off process. For the first time, we have confirmed that the oxidation of NMP lowers the pH, facilitating the dissolution of transition metals deposited on wafer substrates during post-mask and pre-lift-off processes in microelectronic fabrication. This negatively impacts upon the performance of the microelectronic device. Furthermore, it was shown that, by performing the process in an inert atmosphere, the oxidation of NMP was suppressed and the pH was stabilized, suggesting an affordable modification of the photolithography lift-off stage to enhance the quality of recording heads. This novel study has provided key data that may have a significant impact on current and future fabrication process design, optimization, and control. Results here suggest the inclusion of pH as a key process input variable (KPIV) during the design of new photoresist removal processes.  aPublisher supplied data  cSeagate Technology PLC0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acorrosion 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3apH 3aprocess design 3atransition elements1 aWillox, Shannon1 aRamdas, Ragini1 aFunston, Scott J.1 aKlun, Matthew1 aPieh, Robert1 aFairlie, Stewart1 aDobbin, Sara1 aCobice, Diego F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5283-29310 tJournal of Analytical Methods in Chemistry (Online).g2020 Mar. 4, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:26807x2090-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/82650543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002600169245010700195300001600302520090000318592002801218650002101246650001301267650001701280650001401297650001001311650002501321650002201346650001501368650002001383650001801403650001201421650001501433650001101448650002101459650002401480650004701504650002201551650001301573650003101586650001101617650004401628650004601672650004501718650002801763650007001791650003001861650002601891650004601917651001301963651001301976700002501989700002102014700002502035773010702060856008402167852000902251655001202260IND60099456720221118000810.0141105e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009945672DNAL7 a211829862pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2010.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarzón-Ospina, Diego10aLow genetic polymorphism of merozoite surface proteins 7 and 10 in Colombian Plasmodium vivax isolates  ap. 528-531.  aThe merozoite surface protein (MSP) family is involved in the initial interaction between merozoites and erythrocytes in Plasmodium species, its members are therefore becoming major targets for vaccine development. Considering that antigens included in a subunit malaria vaccine should be both accessible to the immune system and lack genetic diversity or have very limited polymorphism, we have analyzed the genetic diversity of three msp genes (msp-7A, msp-7K and msp-10) in different geographical regions of Colombia. The results showed that these genes follow the neutral model of evolution and also display low genetic diversity. The strong conservation found for msp-7 haplotypes in isolates from geographically different regions further suggests that these proteins could be good components of a vaccine against Plasmodium vivax malaria, thereby avoiding strain-specific immune responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium vivax 3aantigens 3aerythrocytes 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3amalaria 3amerozoites 3amodels 3asurface proteins 3avaccine development 2aAntigens, Protozoanxgeneticsximmunology. 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aHumans 2aMalaria Vaccinesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aMalaria, Vivaxximmunologyxparasitology. 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlasmodium vivaxxgeneticsximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aProtozoan Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 3aColombia 0aColombia1 aRomero-Murillo, Liza1 aTobón, Luisa F.1 aPatarroyo, Manuel A.0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2011 Mar., v. 11, no. 2 p.528-531dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2010.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02051naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245010000159300001800259520113000277592002801407650001301435650001201448650001301460650001001473650001801483650001101501650001601512700003101528773009801559856007101657852000901728655001201737IND60518719220221119140154.0160418e198312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051871922DNAL7 a10.2307/19374982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeters, Wm.

In one experimental woodlot where males had been removed, the remaining females became malelike in their foraging behavior. Specifically, females selected branch diameters, foraging heights, and substrate angles normally used only by males. In a second experimental woodlot where females were removed, males did not change their foraging behavior. Controls supported the conclusion that the change in foraging by females could only have been caused by the removal of males. These results support the hypothesis that sex—specific foraging niches in Downy Woodpeckers are caused by female avoidance of the foraging microhabitat of socially dominant males. Our results also refute the hypothesis that intersexual niche partitioning in the Downy Woodpecker occurs because each sex has a different foraging microhabitat that is genetically determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicoides 3afemales 3aforaging 3amales 3amicrohabitats 3aniches 3awoodpeckers1 aGrubb, Thomas C., Jr.cJr.0 tEcology.g1983 Dec., v. 64, no. 6 p.1437-1443dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19374983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007700172300001400249520121500263592002801478650001901506650001801525650001901543650001001562650001701572650001901589650001101608650002301619650001001642650001601652650001201668653000701680653001301687653002101700653001101721653001401732653002401746653001401770700001601784773009001800856008501890852000901975655001201984IND60086132220221116155551.0161018e20130910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008613222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlissett, Jackie10aIntrinsic and extrinsic influences on children's acceptance of new foods  ap. 89-95.  aThe foods that tend to be rejected by children include those which may have greatest importance for later health. This paper reviews some of the intrinsic and extrinsic influences on preschool children's eating behavior, with particular reference to their acceptance of new foods into their diet. Factors conceptualized as intrinsic to the child in this review include sensory processing, taste perception, neophobia, and temperament. The important extrinsic determinants of children's food acceptance which are reviewed include parental and peer modeling, the family food environment, infant feeding practices including breastfeeding and age at weaning, concurrent feeding practices including restriction, pressure to eat, prompting and reward, and the taste & energy content of foods. Children's willingness to accept new foods is influenced by a wide range of factors that likely have individual and also interactive effects on children's willingness to taste, and then continue to eat, new foods. The literature lacks longitudinal and experimental studies, which will be particularly important in determining interventions most likely to be effective in facilitating children's acceptance of healthy foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast feeding 3aeating habits 3aenergy content 3afoods 3ahealthy diet 3ainfant feeding 3amodels 3apreschool children 3ataste 3atemperament 3aweaning 0aFV 0aChildren 0aFeeding practice 0aEating 0aNeophobia 0aSensory sensitivity 0aParenting1 aFogel, Anna0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2013 Sept. 10, v. 121 p.89-95dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245009600159300001400255520179300269592002802062650001102090650002202101650001802123650001402141650002302155650001102178650001002189650001402199650002402213650001602237650001202253650001302265650001402278650001302292650000902305700001702314700001702331700001702348700001602365700002502381773008402406856008102490852000902571655001202580IND60119797620221121233753.0150106e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011979762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-014-1861-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xin10aGlutamate–glutamine cycle and exchange in the placenta–fetus unit during late pregnancy  ap. 45-53.  aThe present review focuses on the physiological functions of glutamate–glutamine exchange involving placental amino acid transport and umbilical amino acid uptake in mammals (particularly in sows), with special emphasis on the associated regulating mechanisms. Glutamate plus glutamine are among the most abundant and the most utilized amino acids in fetus during late gestation. During pregnancy, amino acids, notably as precursors of macromolecules including proteins and nucleotides are involved in fetal development and growth. Amino acid concentrations in fetus are generally higher than in the mother. Among amino acids, the transport and metabolism of glutamate and glutamine during fetal development exhibit characteristics that clearly emphasize the importance of the interaction between the placenta and the fetal liver. Glutamate is quite remarkable among amino acids, which originate from the placenta, and is cleared from fetal plasma. In addition, the flux of glutamate through the placenta from the fetal plasma is highly correlated with the umbilical glutamate delivery rate. Glutamine plays a central role in fetal carbon and nitrogen metabolism and exhibits one of the highest fetal/maternal plasma ratio among all amino acids in human and other mammals. Glutamate is taken up by placenta from the fetal circulation and then converted to glutamine before being released back into the fetal circulation. Works are required on the glutamate–glutamine metabolism during late pregnancy in physiological and pathophysiological situations since such works may help to improve fetal growth and development both in humans and other mammals. Indeed, glutamine supplementation appears to ameliorate fetal growth retardation in sows and reduces preweaning mortality of piglets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3afetal development 3aglutamic acid 3aglutamine 3agrowth retardation 3ahumans 3aliver 3amortality 3anitrogen metabolism 3anucleotides 3apiglets 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3aproteins 3asows1 aXie, Chunyan1 aZhang, Yuzhe1 aFan, Zhiyong1 aYin, Yulong1 aBlachier, François,0 tAmino acids.g2015 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.45-53dSpringer-Verlagx0939-44517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-014-1861-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03764naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006700150245011300217520203300330592002802363650001602391650002502407650001402432650002302446650002002469650002202489650001502511650003402526650002602560650003002586650001202616650002402628650001302652650000902665653003402674653000902708653001302717653002002730700006002750700002102810700003402831700002502865700002002890700002502910700002102935700002102956700005802977773010503035856008503140852000903225655001203234IND60770678620221120113521.0220906e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077067862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1131452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheslack-Postava, Keely1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7945-407X10aMaternal serum persistent organic pollutant exposure and offspring diagnosed ADHD in a national birth cohort  aEvidence implicates environmental factors in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) risk. Prenatal exposures to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the pesticide metabolite p,p’-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (DDE) have been linked to lower cognitive ability, increased impulsivity, and attention related deficits in the offspring. However, information on the relationship of these exposures to the risk of clinically diagnosed ADHD is limited. To determine whether prenatal maternal levels of PCBs or DDE are associated with ADHD diagnosis in the offspring. The investigation was conducted in the Finnish Prenatal Study of ADHD (FIPS-ADHD), a case-control study nested in a national birth cohort. Cases were born in 1998 or 1999 and diagnosed with ADHD (ICD-9 314x or ICD-10 F90. x) according to the national Care Register for Health Care. Each case was individually matched to a control on sex, date, and place of birth. PCB congeners (PCB 74, 99, 118, 138, 153, 156, 170, 180, 183, 187) and DDE were quantified from archived prenatal maternal sera from 359 matched case-control pairs using gas chromatography - high triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Maternal total PCBs were quantified as the sum of concentrations of the measured congeners. Associations with ADHD were examined using conditional logistic regression. Maternal PCB or DDE levels greater than the 75th percentiles of the control distributions showed no evidence of association with offspring ADHD (PCBs: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.63, 1.60), p = 0.98; DDE: aOR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.71, 1.81; p = 0.60). Maternal levels of either pollutant dichotomized at the 90th percentile or considered as a continuous variable also did not show evidence for association with offspring ADHD diagnosis. This study did not find evidence for association of maternal prenatal levels of PCBs or DDE with clinical diagnosis of offspring ADHD; however, this does not rule out the possibility of an impact on subclinical phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acase-control studies 3acognition 3agas chromatography 3ahealth services 3amass spectrometry 3aodds ratio 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apesticide metabolites 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aprogeny 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3arisk 0aPersistent organic pollutants 0aADHD 0aPrenatal 0aOrganochlorines1 aRantakokko, Panu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8624-13871 aKiviranta, Hannu1 aHinkka-Yli-Salomäki, Susanna1 aSurcel, Heljä-Marja1 aVivio, Nicholas1 aFalabella, Genevieve1 aMcKeague, Ian W.1 aSourander, Andre1 aBrown, Alan S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3892-20730 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Sept., v. 212 p.113145-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1131453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010300169300001500272520128600287592002801573650001601601650001901617650002401636650001201660650002701672650001901699650001201718650001201730650001201742650001101754650001201765650001201777650001501789650001101804653002901815653002201844653001801866653001901884653001901903653001601922653001101938700002201949700002601971773009101997856008502088852000902173655001202182IND60086132320221116155609.0161018e20130910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008613232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMimee, Andrea10aCircumventricular organs: Targets for integration of circulating fluid and energy balance signals?  ap. 96-102.  aThe subfornical organ (SFO), as one of the sensory circumventricular organs (CVOs), is among the only central nervous system structures which interfaces directly with circulating substances that do not cross the blood brain barrier. Here we describe a growing literature showing that circulating indicators of cardiovascular (angiotensin II, osmolarity, calcium, sodium) and metabolic (adiponectin, amylin, glucose, ghrelin, leptin) statuses influence the excitability of single SFO neurons. Single cell electrophysiological studies from our laboratory have demonstrated excitatory effects of angiotensin II on individual SFO neurons, and changes in angiotensin II receptor expression in this CVO in hypertensive states emphasize the dynamic contribution of SFO neurons to the regulation of fluid balance. Furthermore, we have shown both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing effects of the adipokines adiponectin and leptin in SFO cells, and highlight that conditions of fasting in the case of adiponectin, and obesity in the case of leptin, alter the sensitivity of SFO neurons to these circulating factors. The results examined in this review provide evidence for a role of the SFO as a mediator and integrative structure in the maintenance of cardiovascular and metabolic functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiponectin 3aangiotensin II 3ablood-brain barrier 3acalcium 3acentral nervous system 3aenergy balance 3afasting 3aghrelin 3aglucose 3aleptin 3aneurons 3aobesity 3aosmolarity 3asodium 0aCircumventricular organs 0aSubfornical organ 0aFluid balance 0aEnergy balance 0aAngiotensin II 0aAdiponectin 0aLeptin1 aSmith, Pauline M.1 aFerguson, Alastair V.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2013 Sept. 10, v. 121 p.96-102dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03732naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245019100173500002200364520207000386592002802456650002302484650001602507650002002523650001302543650001302556650001102569650001602580650001602596650001402612650000902626650001402635650001102649650001902660650003102679650000902710650002102719650002402740651001202764653002702776653002102803653003302824653002402857653002002881653001102901700002002912700002602932700002502958700002102983773007803004856008703082852000903169655001203178IND60564446720221118061637.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056444672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHebig, Klaus H.10aTransport behavior of the pharmaceutical compounds carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, and naproxen, and the lifestyle drug caffeine, in saturated laboratory columns  aPre-press version  aDespite the large number of pharmaceutically active compounds found in natural environments little is known about their transport behavior in groundwater, which is complicated by their wide range of physical and chemical properties. The transport behavior of five widely used and often detected pharmaceutical compounds and one lifestyle drug has therefore been investigated, using a set of three column experiments. The investigated compounds were the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, the lifestyle drug caffeine, the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole, the lipid regulator gemfibrozil, and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories ibuprofen and naproxen. The columns were filled with three different types of sand. The substrates consisted of artificially prepared iron-coated sand, artificially prepared organic carbon sand (with 5% leaf compost), and natural aquifer sand from Long Point, Ontario (Canada). The experiments were conducted simultaneously under the same hydraulic conditions and with the same input solution of about 1μg·L−1 of each compound. The transport behavior of the organic compounds differed significantly between both the different columns and the different compounds. A strong correlation was observed between the retardation factors for carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, and ibuprofen and the organic carbon content of the substrate. While the retardation increased with increasing organic carbon content, no direct relationship was observed between the organic carbon content and the removal of these compounds. In contrast, the retardation factors for sulfamethoxazole and naproxen showed no correlation with the organic carbon content but these compounds were significantly removed in the presence of organic matter. The influence of the Fe3+ surfaces in the iron-coated sand was less significant than expected, with all compounds except for sulfamethoxazole having retardation factors <1.8. Caffeine was so strongly removed during transport through those substrates containing organic carbon that no reliable retardation factor could be determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aantibiotics 3aanticonvulsants 3aaquifers 3acaffeine 3acarbon 3agemfibrozil 3agroundwater 3aibuprofen 3airon 3alifestyle 3alipids 3aorganic matter 3aphysicochemical properties 3asand 3asulfamethoxazole 3ayard waste composts 3aOntario 0aSaturated column study 0aIron-coated sand 0aEnriched organic carbon sand 0aLong Point sediment 0aMicropollutants 0aCXTFIT1 aGroza, Laura G.1 aSabourin, Michelle J.1 aScheytt, Traugott J.1 aPtacek, Carol J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014800165300001600313520172100329592002802050650002002078650002002098650001102118650001102129650001802140650001402158650002202172650001502194650001302209650002702222650001602249650003502265653001402300653001402314653001402328653002302342653002002365653000802385700002002393700001702413700002202430773012902452856008202581852000902663655001202672IND60517385320221120053329.0190803e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051738532DNAL7 a10.1017/S14792621140001362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Satish10aMolecular-level and trait-level differentiation between the cultivated apple (Malus× domestica Borkh.) and its main progenitor Malussieversii  ap. 330-340.  aThe present study is the first to compare the trait-level differentiation (Q ₛₜ) and the molecular-level differentiation (F ₛₜ) between Malus× domestica and Malus sieversii. A set of 115 accessions representing M.× domestica (99) and M. sieversii (16) were genotyped using the International RosBREED SNP Consortium apple 8K SNP array and phenotyped for eight fruit quality traits in a clonally replicated experiment. A set of 3521 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with an average call rate of 98% was retained following SNP data quality filters. About 86% of the total SNPs were polymorphic in M. sieversii, while all but three SNPs were polymorphic in M. × domestica. The patterns of linkage disequilibrium were different, especially at the longer distances, between the two species. No differentiation (F ₛₜ= 0) was observed for nearly 23% of the SNPs, but about 20% of the SNPs exhibited a high genetic differentiation (F ₛₜ≥ 0.15). A highly significant (P< 0.001) genome-level F ₛₜ= 0.12 was observed between M. × domestica and M. sieversii. The average estimated Q ₛₜ value was 0.20 (range 0.08–0.40), and for three of the eight studied traits (crispness, flavour intensity and fruit weight), Q ₛₜ value was more than twice the estimated genome-level F ₛₜ value. A higher Q ₛₜ value than F ₛₜ value for four of the eight fruit quality traits indicated differential (or directional) selection for these traits in M. × domestica. The average posterior probability of assignment of M. × domestica accessions to the M. sieversii gene pool was 11%, supporting the hypothesis of M. sieversii being one of the progenitors of the domesticated apple.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aMalus sieversii 3aapples 3aflavor 3afruit quality 3agene pool 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3ahardness 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aprobability 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aadmixture 0adiversity 0agermplasm 0aMalus× domestica 0aMalus sieversii 0aSNP1 aRaulier, Pierre1 aChagné, D.,1 aWhitworth, Claire0 tPlant genetic resources.g2014 Dec., v. 12, no. 3 p.330-340dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl4078550x1479-263X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14792621140001363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03943naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245008100133300001600214506002800230520285600258592002803114506003703142650002003179650001703199650001503216650001703231650001703248650001103265650002403276650002403300653001003324653002803334653001803362773020403380852000903584655001203593IND60774316720221207051844.0201111e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077431672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSapucaia, Cintia10aDietoterapia e suplementação vitamínica no combate a hiperhomocisteinemia  ap. 127-134.  aResource is Open Access  aNíveis elevados de Homocisteína (Hcy) têm sido considerados como fator de risco independente para diversas doenças. Alimentação balanceada e rica em folato e vitaminas do complexo B se apresentam como forma eficaz no combate a hiperhomocisteinemia. O objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar a eficiência da dietoterapia e suplementação vitamínica na redução dos níveis homocisteicos em adultos. Foram avaliados 19 adultos com idade entre 15 e 80 anos, realizando coleta de dados antropométricos: peso, altura, circunferência da cintura (CC), Índice de Massa Corpórea (IMC) e exame bioquímico de Homocisteína pré e pós-tratamento terapêutico e suplementar vitamínico. Os valores de Hcy foram comparados através do teste t student (α = 0,05) e os dados antropométricos e de concentração da Hcy foram associados através de uma matriz de correlação. Os resultados mostraram diferença estatística significativa entre as concentrações de Hcy antes e depois do tratamento (p<0,01). No pré-tratamento, 57,89% dos pacientes se encontravam com hiperhomocisteinemia (>15 μmol/L) comparado a nenhum pós-tratamento. A redução média de Hcy, peso, circunferência da cintura foram de 27,26%, 8,26 % e 9,22%, respectivamente. Não foi verificada associação entre Hcy e os dados antropométricos. Pode-se afirmar que a terapia dietética aliada à suplementação vitamínica utilizadas influenciou decisivamente na redução dos níveis de Homocisteína. ABSTRACT Dietotherapy and vitamin supplementation to combat hyperhomocysteinemia High levels of homocysteine (Hcy) have been considered an independent risk factor for several diseases. Balanced diet rich in folate and B vitamins present themselves as effective in combating hyperhomocysteinemia. The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of diet therapy and vitamin supplementation in reducing homocysteine levels in adults. It was evaluated 19 adults aged 15 to 80 years, performing anthropometric data: height, weight, waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI) and biochemical examination before and after the therapeutic and supplementary treatment vitamin. Homocysteine values were compared using the t test student (α = 0.05) and anthropometric data and concentration of Hcy are associated through a correlation matrix. The results showed a statistically significant difference between Hcy concentrations before and after treatment (p <0.01). In the pre-treatment, 57.89% of the patients were with hyperhomocysteinemia (>15 µmol /L) compared to the no post-treatment. The average reduction of Hcy, weight, waist circumference was 27.26%, 8.26% and 9.22%, respectively. There was no association between Hcy and anthropometric data. It can be said that dietary therapy combined with vitamin supplementation used a decisive influence in reducing homocysteine levels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3adiet therapy 3afolic acid 3ahomocysteine 3arisk factors 3at-test 3avitamin supplements 3awaist circumference 0adieta 0avitaminas do complexo b 0ahomocisteína0 tRevista brasileira de obesidade, nutrição e emagrecimento.g2017 Feb., v. 11, no. 63 p.127-134dInstituto Brasileiro de Pesquisa e Ensino em Fisiologia do ExercíciowJournal:27930x1981-99197nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01826naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245010100173300001800274520091000292592002801202650002501230650001601255650001301271650001101284650001301295650001201308700002401320773008801344856008301432852000901515655001201524IND60096807720221120083430.0141104e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009680772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaney, Aoife Brophy10aExploring the determinants of “best practice” benchmarking in electricity network regulation  ap. 7739-7746.  aIn this paper we use a best practice index constructed from the survey responses of regulators in 40 countries to explore the determinants of the methods used in electricity network regulation. Drawing from the incentive regulation and institutional economics literature, we construct an empirical model to investigate the impact of industry size, political and economic institutions on the degree of best practice regulation. Our results suggest that the existence and experience of an independent regulator is the most important institutional determinant of best practice regulation. In addition, small numbers of network companies act as a constraint on the use of advanced benchmarking methods. Finally, regional effects are also important. These findings lead us to question whether one “best practice” model is in fact applicable to countries with very different political and economic contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aelectricity 3aindustry 3amodels 3apolitics 3asurveys1 aPollitt, Michael G.0 tEnergy policy.g2011 Dec., v. 39, no. 12 p.7739-7746dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012400169300001400293520176200307592002802069650002402097650001102121650000902132650001502141650001502156650000902171650001102180650002202191650001402213650001002227650001502237650002002252650002402272650001702296653001202313653001202325653002102337653001202358700002202370700002202392700002302414700001702437773011702454856008302571961001302654852000902667655001202676IND60637880220221119001904.0190830e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063788022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2019.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArthur, Frank H.10aGrowth and development of Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) on rice flour and brown rice as affected by time and temperature  ap. 73-77.  aTribolium castaneum (Herbst), the red flour beetle, is a cosmopolitan stored product insect that infests a variety of raw grains and processed grain products. Although this pest is prevalent in rice mills, there is a comparative lack of data on growth and development on rice by-products and fractions compared to other grains. In this study, ten mixed-sex adults were exposed on 200 g of either rice flour or brown rice, and populations were assessed after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 months at 22, 27, or 32 °C. At 22 °C, the number of adults, pupae and larvae on rice flour and brown rice remained low throughout the 12-month storage period. At 27 °C, the number of adults on rice flour increased to a maximum at 8 months, while adult populations on brown rice remained relatively constant from 2 to 10 months, with few pupae or larvae in the samples. At 32 °C, adult populations on rice flour and brown rice were constant after month 2, with low numbers of pupae and larvae. Adult predation could have accounted for low numbers of pupae and larvae. Using the original 10-month data, populations were projected for an additional 14 months to predict population patterns. Adult numbers showed an increase over time at all temperatures on rice flour and brown rice at 22 °C but numbers seemed to stabilize at 27 and 32 °C. For both diets at 27 and 32 °C, projected pupae and larvae numbers remained steady but low compared to adults. However, populations would not be expected to increase indefinitely because at some point the resources would become limited and populations would crash or decline. Results show T. castaneum can deplete fixed resources such as bags of rice flour or brown rice when temperatures equal or exceed 27 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTribolium castaneum 3aadults 3abags 3abrown rice 3abyproducts 3adiet 3alarvae 3apopulation growth 3apredation 3apupae 3arice flour 3astorage insects 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 0aStorage 0aInsects 0aRed flour beetle 0aMilling1 aStarkus, Laura A.1 aGerken, Alison R.1 aCampbell, James F.1 aMcKay, Tanja0 tJournal of stored products research.g2019 Sept., v. 83 p.73-77dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2019.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011400167300001600281520138200297592002801679650001201707650001901719650001101738650002001749650002201769650001101791650001401802650001401816650000901830650003001839650001001869653001001879653001101889653001101900653001701911653001401928700001901942700001801961773012901979856008202108852000902190655001202199IND60517385520221120053326.0190803e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051738552DNAL7 a10.1017/S14792621140009262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Jeong Hwan10aEvaluation of genetic variations at glutenin loci in Korean wheat landraces using allele-specific DNA markers  ap. 353-356.  aThe allelic variations at glutenin loci could significantly affect the bread baking quality, and specific glutenin alleles might be closely associated with greater gluten strength, which, in turn, is related to superior bread baking quality. In this study, allelic variations at Glu-1, Glu-A3 and Glu-B3 loci were evaluated in 222 Korean wheat landraces using gene-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers. Ten alleles were identified at Glu-1 loci. Glu-A1c, Glu-B1b, and Glu-D1a or Glu-D1f alleles were predominantly found at the respective loci and their frequencies were 86.5, 87.8 and 96.9 %, respectively. Seven Korean wheat landraces carried the Glu-D1d allele, and only one Korean wheat landrace (IT173162) achieved 10 points for the Glu-1 score. Fifteen alleles were identified at Glu-A3 and Glu-B3 loci; Glu-A3c and Glu-B3d or Glu-B3i alleles were commonly found at the respective loci and their frequencies were 77.0, 33.3 and 37.8 %, respectively. Glu-B3 alleles exhibited the highest genetic diversity than other alleles, while Glu-B1 and Glu-A1 alleles exhibited the lowest genetic diversity than other alleles. Twenty Korean wheat landraces had the Glu-A3d and Glu-B3b, Glu-B3d, Glu-B3f, Glu-B3g or Glu-B3i alleles, which were correlated with superior bread baking quality. Among these wheat lines, two (IT59787 and IT236544) carried the Glu-D1d allele.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abaking quality 3abreads 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agluten 3aglutenins 3alandraces 3aloci 3apolymerase chain reaction 3awheat 0aGlu-1 0aGlu-A3 0aGlu-B3 0aKorean wheat 0alandraces1 aLee, Soo-Kyung1 aPak, Chul-su,0 tPlant genetic resources.g2014 Dec., v. 12, no. 3 p.353-356dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl4078550x1479-263X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14792621140009263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007000151245017300221520129300394592002801687650002201715650002201737650001301759650002401772650001701796650001301813650001201826650001801838650001401856650001701870650001101887650001701898653002201915653002201937653004001959653001301999653001702012653002402029653002902053653003102082653002502113653002202138700003402160700003002194700001802224700005002242700003102292700006802323700003002391700002502421700002602446700001902472700002402491700007002515773012002585856008602705852000902791655001202800IND60770679020221120113524.0220517e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077067902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2022.1082472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendonça Lopes, Duclécio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4538-380210aEcdysone modulates both ultrastructural arrangement of hindgut and attachment of Trypanosoma cruzi DM 28c to the rectum cuticle of Rhodnius prolixus fifth-instar nymph.  aStudies on the effects of azadirachtin treatment, ecdysone supplementation and ecdysone therapy on both the ultrastructural organization of the rectum in 5th-instar nymph of Rhodnius prolixus and the ex vivo attachment behavior of Trypanosoma cruzi under these experimental conditions were carried out. Control insects had a typical and significant organization of the rectum cuticle consisted of four main layers (procuticle, inner epicuticle, outer epicuticle, and wax layer) during the entire period of the experiment. Both azadirachtin treatment and ecdysone supplementation avoid the development of both outer epicuticle and wax layer. Oral therapy with ecdysone partially reversed the altered organization and induce the development of the four main rectal cuticle layers. In the same way, the ex vivo attachment of T. cruzi to rectal cuticle was blocked by azadirachtin treatment but ecdysone therapy also partially recovered the parasite adhesion rates to almost those detected in control insects. These results point out that ecdysone may be a factor responsible - directly or indirectly - by the modulation of rectum ultrastructural arrangement providing a superficial wax layer to the attachment followed by metacyclogenesis of T. cruzi in the rectum of its invertebrate hosts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodnius prolixus 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aadhesion 3aattachment behavior 3aazadirachtin 3aecdysone 3ahindgut 3ainvertebrates 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3arectum 3atherapeutics 0aRhodnius prolixus 0aTrypanosoma cruzi 0aHindgut ultrastructural arrangement 0aEcdysone 0aAzadirachtin 0aFlagellate adhesion 0aperimicrovillar membrane 0aprothoracicotropic hormone 0ahead critical period 0aecdysone receptor1 aProvençano, Aluízio Fonseca1 aMello, Cícero Brasileiro1 aFeder, Denise1 aAlbuquerque Cunha, José Mauricio Albuquerque1 aSant'Anna, Nadir Francisca1 aCurty Lechuga, Guilherme1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4538-38021 aCabral Bourguignon, Saulo1 aSouza, Wanderley de,1 ade Souza Garcia, Eloi1 aFolly, Evelize1 aAzambuja, Patrícia1 aGonzalez, Marcelo Salabert1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5442-64400 tExperimental parasitology.g2022 May,  June, v. 236-237 p.108247-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2022.1082473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245014500164300002000309520107600329592002801405650001901433650002501452650001901477650001901496650001401515650001101529650001701540653003001557653001701587653003001604653002501634653001701659653002401676700002101700700001501721700006601736700002001802700006401822700005901886773014201945856007802087852000902165655001202174IND60596016620180802000000.0180609e20180306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059601662DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b005722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEckstein, Chris10aNanoporous Anodic Alumina Surface Modification by Electrostatic, Covalent, and Immune Complexation Binding Investigated by Capillary Filling  ap. 10571-10579.  aThe fluid imbibition-coupled laser interferometry (FICLI) technique has been applied to detect and quantify surface changes and pore dimension variations in nanoporous anodic alumina (NAA) structures. FICLI is a noninvasive optical technique that permits the determination of the NAA average pore radius with high accuracy. In this work, the technique is applied after each step of different surface modification paths of the NAA pores: (i) electrostatic immobilization of bovine serum albumin (BSA), (ii) covalent attachment of streptavidin via (3-aminipropyl)-triethoxysilane and glutaraldehyde grafting, and (iii) immune complexation. Results show that BSA attachment can be detected as a reduction in estimated radius from FICLI with high accuracy and reproducibility. In the case of the covalent attachment of streptavidin, FICLI is able to recognize a multilayer formation of the silane and the protein. For immune complexation, the technique is able to detect different antibody–antigen bindings and distinguish different dynamics among different immune species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3abovine serum albumin 3aglutaraldehyde 3ainterferometry 3ananopores 3asilane 3astreptavidin 0ananoporous anodic alumina 0aoptofluidics 0asurface functionalization 0abovine serum albumin 0astreptavidin 0aimmune complexation1 aAcosta, Laura K.1 aPol, Laura1 aXifré-Pérez, Elisabet1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6072-98891 aPallares, Josep1 aFerré-Borrull, Josep1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5210-51331 aMarsal, Lluis F.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5976-14080 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Mar. 06, v. 10, no. 12 p.10571-10579dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b005723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245013500168500002200303520186500325592002802190650002102218650001102239650001702250650001902267650001902286650001302305650001902318650002102337650001502358650001402373650001602387650001702403651001002420653001202430653002202442653002102464653000802485653002402493653001802517700001902535700001802554700001702572700001802589700001402607700001402621700001602635773007802651856008702729852000902816655001202825IND60564447020221118061736.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056444702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Chao10aSeasonal responses of soil respiration to warming and nitrogen addition in a semi-arid alfalfa-pasture of the Loess Plateau, China  aPre-press version  aResponses of soil respiration (Rs) to increasing nitrogen (N) deposition and warming will have far-reaching influences on global carbon (C) cycling. However, the seasonal (growing and non-growing seasons) difference of Rs responses to warming and N deposition has rarely been investigated. We conducted a field manipulative experiment in a semi-arid alfalfa-pasture of northwest China to evaluate the response of Rs to nitrogen addition and warming from March 2014 to March 2016. Open-top chambers were used to elevate temperature and N was enriched at a rate of 4.42g m−2yr−1 with NH4NO3. Results showed that (1) N addition increased Rs by 14% over the two-year period; and (2) warming stimulated Rs by 15% in the non-growing season, while inhibited it by 5% in the growing season, which can be explained by decreased plant coverage and soil water. The main effect of N addition did not change with time, but that of warming changed with time, with the stronger inhibition observed in the dry year. When N addition and warming were combined, an antagonistic effect was observed in the growing season, whereas a synergism was observed in the non-growing season. Overall, warming and N addition did not affect the Q10 values over the two-year period, but these treatments significantly increased the Q10 values in the growing season compared with the control treatment. In comparison, combined warming and nitrogen addition significantly reduced the Q10 values compared with the single factor treatment. These results suggest that the negative indirect effect of warming-induced water stress overrides the positive direct effect of warming on Rs. Our results also imply the necessity of considering the different Rs responses in the growing and non-growing seasons to climate change to accurately evaluate the carbon cycle in the arid and semi-arid regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrate 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate change 3agrowing season 3anitrogen 3asemiarid zones 3asoil respiration 3asoil water 3asynergism 3atemperature 3awater stress 3aChina 0aWarming 0aNitrogen addition 0aSoil respiration 0aQ10 0aSemi-arid grassland 0aLoess Plateau1 aYe, Jian-sheng1 aGong, Yanhong1 aPei, Jiuying1 aYuan, Ziqiang1 aXie, Chan1 aZhu, Yusi1 aYu, Yueyuan0 tScience of the total environment.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002200190245005200212300001400264506007600278520207500354592002802429506003702457650002002494650002102514650001002535650001002545650001702555650000902572650002502581653001302606653001402619653001602633653001702649653001802666653000902684700002202693773009202715856008402807852000902891655001202900IND60535552720221207131933.0190318e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053555272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2013.12.0042doi7 aPMC39440592pmcid7 a243421762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTreesukosol, Yada10aAnalyses of meal patterns across dietary shifts  ap. 21-29.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe direct controls of meal size can be categorized into positive signals such as those from the oral cavity and negative signals such as postoral inhibitory cues. It follows that the relative contribution of these signals, and in turn meal pattern parameters, change across periods of high-energy diet exposure. Here, we compared daily intake and meal pattern analysis in male Sprague–Dawley rats presented a high-energy diet for 6weeks then standard chow for ∼1week (HE), with those of standard chow fed controls (CHOW). These measures allow for evaluation of (1) whether there are distinct dynamic and static phases of DIO and if so, how they are characterized, (2) how meal patterns change across short and long term HE experience, and (3) ingestive behavioral changes when HE-fed animals are returned to standard chow. The HE animals showed significantly higher intake primarily driven by an increase in meal size compared to CHOW controls. This was most pronounced during the first several days of high-energy diet exposure thus characterizing the dynamic phase. Intake and meal size decreased with longer exposure to the diet but remained significantly higher than those of CHOW. Increased meal size could be driven by enhanced orosensory stimulation and/or reduced sensitivity to postoral inhibitory feedback. Distribution curves derived from histogram plots of meal size revealed both larger average meal size (right shift) and spread (standard deviation) thus it is tempting to speculate that more than one type of mechanism influences increased meal size. Meal number decreased suggesting post meal inhibitory signaling is relatively intact. However, this increase was insufficient to compensate for the increased meal size. When HE animals were switched to standard chow, daily intake and meal size decreased and eventually returned to values comparable to those of the CHOW rats. Meal number remained lower suggesting altered physiological mechanism(s) that underlie the control of ingestive behavior as a function of previous high-energy diet exposure.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abehavior change 3ahigh energy diet 3amales 3amouth 3aportion size 3arats 3astatistical analysis 0aHigh fat 0aMeal size 0aMeal number 0aPalatability 0aPostingestive 0aOral1 aMoran, Timothy H.0 tAppetite.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 75 p.21-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2013.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245007700158300001800235520140800253592002801661650002701689650001701716650002001733650000901753650001901762650002301781650001201804650001001816650001001826650001201836650001001848650001001858650001601868650001101884650002301895650001201918700002701930700002101957773009801978856007102076852000902147655001202156IND60518719820221119140227.0160418e198312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051871982DNAL7 a10.2307/19375002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyan, Michael J.10aEnergetics of Reproduction in a Neotropical Frog, Physalaemus Pustulosus  ap. 1456-1462.  aThe rate of oxygen consumption (VO₂) of male Physalaemus pustulosus (mean mass 1.51 g) during 30 min of forced activity was 1.76 mL/h. The VO₂ sustained by males (mean mass 1.84 g) during °3 min of intense activity was 3.34 mL/h. Formation of a foam nest by a pair, which includes oviposition and fertilization, involved consumption of 2.64 mL O₂. In terms of ATP yield, the energy contributions of anaerobiosis account for only 2—7% of the total energy expended during calling, nest building, and sustained forced activity. The energy content of nests plus eggs averaged 3.96 kJ. By combining the metabolic data with data on the reproductive pattern of the species, we estimate the total aerobically supported energy expenditure for reproduction by each sex over a breeding season. Females expend an order of magnitude more energy for reproduction than do males: 40.96 vs. 3.25 kJ. There are few comparative data available, but female Physalaemus expend slightly more energy per gram than do female lizards (Uta stansburiana) but slightly less energy than the lizards when energy expenditure is adjusted for the length of the breeding season. Male Physalaemus use much less energy for reproduction than male lizards (Uta stansburiana). Male Physalaemus also use less energy for reproduction per gram than do males of two speices of Australian frogs (Ranidella signifera and R. parinsignifera).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aanaerobiosis 3abreeding season 3aeggs 3aenergy content 3aenergy expenditure 3afemales 3afoams 3afrogs 3alizards 3amales 3anests 3aoviposition 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3atropics1 aBartholomew, George A.1 aRand, A.

One such avoided cost that has received little attention is the market price response, or how distributed PV generation reduces utilities’ procurement costs and, consequently, consumers’ costs through reduced wholesale electricity prices in the short-term. We quantify the reduction in day-ahead wholesale electricity prices to distributed PV generation in California (CA) from 2013 through 2015. Using a database of all distributed PV systems in the three CA investor owned utilities, we estimate historic hourly distributed PV generation using three methods that we validate with metered generation from 205 PV systems. Via multiple linear regression, we then estimate electricity price reductions due to distributed PV generation. Across the three methods used to estimate PV generation, distributed PV generation reduced hourly median (mean) wholesale electricity prices by up to $2.7–3.1/MWh ($2.9–3.2/MWh) ($₂₀₁₅), or by 7–8% (8–9%). Lower wholesale prices reduced utilities’ energy procurement costs in the day-ahead market by up to $650–730 million ($₂₀₁₅) from 2013 through 2015. These avoided costs are similar to other avoided costs commonly included in value of solar studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy 3amarket prices 3amarkets 3aregression analysis 3aretrospective studies 3asolar collectors 3aCalifornia 0aDistributed solar 0aMarket price response 0aMerit order effect 0aValue of solar1 aJaramillo, Paulina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4214-11061 aHodge, Bri-Mathias1 aWilliams, Nathaniel J.1 aSevernini, Edson0 tEnergy policy.g2018 Oct., v. 121 p.394-403dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001700150245013700167300001800304520134700322592002801669650001401697650001201711650002301723650001401746650001001760650002501770650001501795650001101810650001201821650001401833650000901847651001401856651002901870700001801899700001601917700001701933700002101950700002301971773009601994856008602090852000902176655001202185IND4462911520221122210500.0141110e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446291152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.06.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbas, Dalia10aHarvesting forest biomass for energy – An alternative to conventional fuel treatments: Trials in the Superior National Forest, USA  ap. 4557-4564.  aThe goal of this article is to address the question: can the production and sale of biomass for energy help reduce the costs of conventional mechanical pile and burn forest fuel treatments? To address this question, this study analyzes data from six forest fuel reduction treatment units that combined biomass-harvesting trials in the Superior National Forest located in the state of Minnesota, USA. Machine operating and ownership costs are assessed. Costs for conventional mechanical treatment costs (pile and burn) are compared with those for a biomass-harvesting option (harvesting and delivery costs less income from the sale of recovered biomass for energy or pulp). In study trials, conventional treatment costs were found to be less than the biomass energy option costs, indicating that the conventional treatment is a cheaper option. A sensitivity analysis of different transport distance and operating conditions scenarios is carried out. Findings show that under certain operational conditions these operations could be cost effective. Conditions determining cost effectiveness are site specific and depend on-site conditions, harvesting prescriptions, biomass stocking, forwarding distance, distance to end users, equipment hauling costs, the number of operations using the same machine, the operator’s skill, and truck payload.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acost effectiveness 3aequipment 3afuels 3afuels (fire ecology) 3aharvesting 3aincome 3alogging 3aownership 3apulp 3aMinnesota 3aSuperior National Forest1 aCurrent, Dean1 aRyans, Mark1 aTaff, Steven1 aHoganson, Howard1 aBrooks, Kenneth N.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2011 Nov., v. 35, no. 11 p.4557-4564dElsevier Ltdx0961-95347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.06.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245011000164300001800274520172600292592002802018650002202046650001202068650001102080650001402091650002302105650002802128650002402156650001802180650001802198650001802216650001702234653000902251653001402260653001602274653001702290653002602307700001802333700005202351700001502403700001702418700001302435700001802448700005602466773013902522856007802661852000902739655001202748IND60596016720221116144551.0180609e20180228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059601672DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b005732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Jianping10aMOF-Templated Fabrication of Hollow Co4N@N-Doped Carbon Porous Nanocages with Superior Catalytic Activity  ap. 7191-7200.  aMetallic Co₄N catalysts have been considered as one of the most promising non-noble materials for heterogeneous catalysis because of their high electrical conductivity, great magnetic property, and high intrinsic activity. However, the metastable properties seriously limit their applications for heterogeneous water phase catalysis. In this work, a novel Co-metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived hollow porous nanocages (PNCs) composed of metallic Co₄N and N-doped carbon (NC) were synthesized for the first time. This hollow three-dimensional (3D) PNC catalyst was synthesized by taking advantage of Co-MOF as a precursor for fabricating 3D hollow Co₃O₄@C PNCs, along with the NH₃ treatment of Co-oxide frames to promote the in situ conversion of Co-MOF to Co₄N@NC PNCs, benefiting from the high intrinsic activity and electron conductivity of the metallic Co₄N phase and the good permeability of the hollow porous nanostructure as well as the efficient doping of N into the carbon layer. Besides, the covalent bridge between the active Co₄N surface and PNC shells also provides facile pathways for electron and mass transport. The obtained Co₄N@NC PNCs exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability for 4-nitrophenol reduction in terms of low activation energy (Eₐ = 23.53 kJ mol–¹), high turnover frequency (52.01 × 10²⁰ molecule g–¹ min–¹), and high apparent rate constant (kₐₚₚ = 2.106 min–¹). Furthermore, its magnetic property and stable configuration account for the excellent recyclability of the catalyst. It is hoped that our finding could pave the way for the construction of other hollow transition metal-based nitride@NC PNC catalysts for wide applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aammonia 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrical conductivity 3amagnetic properties 3amass transfer 3ananomaterials 3ap-nitrophenol 3apermeability 0aCo4N 0ananocages 0aMOF-derived 0ananocatalyst 0awater phase catalysis1 aWang, Liqiang1 aDeng, Liu1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1392-68281 aZhang, Min1 aHe, Haichuan1 aZeng, Ke1 aTang, Feiying1 aLiu, You-Nian1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7078-59370 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 28, v. 10, no. 8 p.7191-7200dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b005733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03843naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003500151245008500186300001600271520209000287592002802377650001702405650002102422650001702443650001702460650002502477650001302502650001102515650002002526650002702546650001702573650001702590650002402607650001902631650002202650650001302672650001002685650001802695650001102713650000702724650003302731650002202764653001302786653000902799653000802808653001802816653002202834700001802856700002902874700003702903700004002940700006602980773011203046856008603158852000903244655001203253IND60554228420221120101610.0180904e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055422842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcatb.2016.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMafra, Agnes Cristina Oliveira10aDiffusion effects of bovine serum albumin on cross-linked aggregates of catalase  ap. 107-116.  aStabilization of multimeric enzymes is one of the major challenges in biocatalysis since dissociation of subunits can inactivate the enzyme. Particularly, catalase that breaks down hydrogen peroxide in water and molecular oxygen is an enzyme difficult to stabilize by conventional immobilization techniques, because it is a tetrameric structure containing Fe-protoporphyrin IX in its active site. Cross-linking of enzyme aggregates is a methodology that can overcome this bottleneck, but diffusional delay of mass transport within the particles is a recurrent drawback. In this work, cross-linked aggregates of catalase from bovine liver were prepared, evaluating the influence of precipitant and cross-linking agents, as well as bovine serum albumin (BSA) as feeder protein on the catalytic properties, thermal stability, and mass transport resistance of the derivatives. The most active derivatives were prepared using ammonium sulfate as precipitant agent, 50mM glutaraldehyde as cross-linker, and mass ratio BSA/catalase of 3.0. These derivatives in the absence of diffusive effects showed recovered activity of 98±1.7% and high stability at 40°C and pH 7.0 (∼80% of the initial activity was recovery after 200h under these conditions). The co-precipitation of BSA together with catalase reduced the size of clusters suggesting a decrease of diffusive effects within the biocatalyst. Empirical kinetic model was fitted to the experimental data of initial rate vs. substrate concentration and used to make a comparative analysis of mass transfer into derivatives with and without BSA. Results suggested that the main effect that differentiates the free enzyme and the two derivatives analyzed was of diffusive nature. In fact, the effectiveness factor of the cross-linked aggregates of catalase with BSA increased around 4 times. Statistical design of experiments and the analysis of the response surface methodology showed that the immobilization did not alter the conditions of maximum activity of the catalase, which were found to be 30°C and pH ∼7.0 for all biocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aammonium sulfate 3abiocatalysis 3abiocatalysts 3abovine serum albumin 3acatalase 3acattle 3acoprecipitation 3across-linking reagents 3acrosslinking 3adissociation 3aexperimental design 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahydrogen peroxide 3akinetics 3aliver 3amass transfer 3aoxygen 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3athermal stability 0aCatalase 0aCLEA 0aBSA 0aKinetic model 0aDiffusional delay1 aKopp, Willian1 aBeltrame, Maisa Bontorin1 ade Lima Camargo Giordano, Raquel1 ade Arruda Ribeiro, Marcelo Perencin1 aTardioli, Paulo Waldir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5011-98810 tJournal of molecular catalysis.g2016 Nov., v. 133 p.107-116dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12410x1381-11777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcatb.2016.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013300166300001600299520148000315592002801795650001801823650001501841650001901856650002401875650001601899650001701915650002001932650001001952650002101962650002001983650001602003650001902019650001602038653002402054653002402078653002102102653002702123653002102150653001602171700001302187700001402200700001902214700002002233700001602253700001802269700001502287773009402302856008402396852000902480655001202489IND60535552820221120023658.0190318e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053555282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2013.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLassen, A.D.10aEffectiveness of offering healthy labelled meals in improving the nutritional quality of lunch meals eaten in a worksite canteen  ap. 128-134.  aHealthier meal selections at restaurants and canteens are often limited and not actively promoted. In this Danish study the effectiveness of a healthy labelling certification program in improving dietary intake and influencing edible plate waste was evaluated in a quasi-experimental study design. Employees from an intervention worksite canteen and a matched control canteen were included in the study at baseline (February 2012), after completing the certification process (end-point) and six month from end-point (follow-up) (total n=270). In order to estimate nutrient composition of the consumed lunch meals and plate waste a validated digital photographic method was used combining estimation of food intake with food nutrient composition data. Food satisfaction was rated by participants using a questionnaire. Several significant positive nutritional effects were observed at the intervention canteen including a mean decrease in energy density in the consumed meals from 561kJ/100g at baseline to 368 and 407kJ/100g at end-point and follow-up, respectively (P<0.001). No significant changes were seen with regard to food satisfaction and plate waste. In the control canteen no positive nutritional effects were observed. The results of the study highlight the potential of using healthy labelling certification programs as a possible driver for increasing both the availability and awareness of healthy meal choices, thereby improving dietary intake when eating out.  aPublisher supplied data 3acertification 3aeating out 3aenergy density 3aexperimental design 3afood intake 3ahealthy diet 3ahuman resources 3alunch 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3aplate waste 3aquestionnaires 3arestaurants 0aNutrition labelling 0aFood away from home 0aHealth promotion 0aNutrition intervention 0aFood environment 0aPlate waste1 aBeck, A.1 aLeedo, E.1 aAndersen, E.W.1 aChristensen, T.1 aMejborn, H.1 aThorsen, A.V.1 aTetens, I.0 tAppetite.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 75 p.128-134dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2013.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006300140245019800203300001800401500002000419520169300439592002802132596004902160650002402209650001202233650002102245650001702266650002402283650001602307650002302323650001402346650000902360650003302369650001302402650000902415650001302424650002302437650001302460700002202473700001902495700007402514773015202588856007402740852000902814655001202823IND60686361620221119050128.0200317e20200330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068636162DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.102002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarajzadeh, Mir Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3746-001110aPreparation of a new three‐component deep eutectic solvent and its use as an extraction solvent in dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction of pesticides in green tea and herbal distillates  ap. 1904-1912.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: A new solvent, deep eutectic solvent, in which there is growing interest, has been prepared and used as an extraction solvent in the dispersive liquid–liquid method of microextraction. To prepare the solvent, dichloroacetic acid, l‐menthol, and n‐butanol are mixed at a molar ratio of 4:1:1 and the deep eutectic solvent is formed after heating. Then a dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction method using the prepared solvent is used for the extraction and preconcentration of some pesticides from an aqueous sample. To carry out the procedure, the deep eutectic solvent is mixed with methanol and rapidly injected by a syringe into the aqueous sample containing the analytes. After centrifuging, an aliquot of the sedimented phase is injected into the gas chromatograph. The influence of several variables on the extraction efficiency was investigated and optimized. RESULTS: Extraction recoveries and enrichment factors were obtained in the ranges of 53–86% and 1760–2853, respectively. The intra‐ (n = 6) and inter‐day (n = 5) precision of the method was satisfactory, with relative standard deviations ≤ 7% obtained at two concentrations of 10 and 50 μg L⁻¹ of each analyte. Moreover, detection and quantification limits for the target analytes were obtained in the ranges of 0.11–0.23 and 0.38–0.74 μg L⁻¹, respectively. CONCLUSION: Different samples, including green tea, rose water, lemon balm, mint, and pussy willow distillates were analyzed successfully using the method that was developed, and chlorpyrifos was found in rose water at a concentration of 17 ± 1 μg L⁻¹ (n = 3). © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  cResearch Council of the University of Tabriz 3aMelissa officinalis 3abutanol 3achemical species 3achlorpyrifos 3adichloroacetic acid 3adistillates 3agas chromatography 3agreen tea 3aheat 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amethanol 3amint 3asolvents 3astandard deviation 3asyringes1 aAbbaspour, Maryam1 aKazemian, Roya1 aAfshar Mogaddam, Mohammad Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1144-45230 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2020 Mar. 30, v. 100, no. 5 p.1904-1912dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.102003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015900173300001600332520169700348592002802045650002102073650002402094650002602118650002102144650002502165650000902190650002002199650001102219650002202230650002502252650001902277650002102296650001302317653002602330653002902356653002602385653003102411653002502442700002202467700002302489700006302512700001902575700006102594700002302655700006402678773017202742856008502914852000902999655001203008IND60576024020221119124022.0181015e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057602402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2017.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLacombe, Séverine10aOptimized transitory ectopic expression of promastigote surface antigen protein in Nicotiana benthamiana, a potential anti-leishmaniasis vaccine candidate  ap. 116-123.  aIn recent years, plants have been shown to be an efficient alternative expression system for high-value pharmaceuticals such as vaccines. However, constitutive expression of recombinant protein remains uncertain on their level of production and biological activity. To overcome these problems, transitory expression systems have been developed. Here, a series of experiments were performed to determine the most effective conditions to enhance vaccine antigen transient accumulation in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves using the promastigote surface antigen (PSA) from the parasitic protozoan Leishmania infantum. This protein has been previously identified as the major antigen of a licensed canine anti-leishmaniasis vaccine. The classical prokaryote Escherichia coli biosystem failed in accumulating PSA. Consequently, the standard plant system based on N. benthamiana has been optimized for the production of putatively active PSA. First, the RNA silencing defense mechanism set up by the plant against PSA ectopic expression was abolished by using three viral suppressors acting at different steps of the RNA silencing pathway. Then, we demonstrated that the signal peptide at the N-terminal side of the PSA is required for its accumulation. The PSA ER signaling and retention with the PSA signal peptide and the KDEL motif, respectively were optimized to significantly increase its accumulation. Finally, we demonstrate that the production of recombinant PSA in N. benthamiana leaves allows the conservation of its immunogenic property. These approaches demonstrate that based on these optimizations, plant based systems can be used to effectively produce the biological active PSA protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLeishmania infantum 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aRNA interference 3abioactive properties 3adogs 3agene expression 3aleaves 3aprokaryotic cells 3arecombinant proteins 3asignal peptide 3asurface antigens 3avaccines 0aPlant-based biosystem 0aRNA silencing suppressor 0aNicotiana benthamiana 0aAnti-leishmaniasis vaccine 0aRecombinant proteins1 aBangratz, Martine1 aBrizard, Jean-Paul1 aPetitdidier, Elodie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8554-84241 aPagniez, Julie1 aSérémé, Drissa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2439-57351 aLemesre, Jean-Loup1 aBrugidou, Christophe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4176-66700 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2018 Jan., v. 125, no. 1 p.116-123dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2017.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011500160300001800275520099600293592002801289650001701317650002601334650001001360650001901370650001501389650001801404650001401422650000701436650001301443650001701456653001701473653001101490653001801501653001501519653001901534700005501553700001601608700001901624700001501643700001801658700001701676700001601693773013901709856007801848852000901926655001201935IND60596016820221116144456.0180609e20180214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059601682DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b005832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Yixia10apH-Triggered Peptide Self-Assembly for Targeting Imaging and Therapy toward Angiogenesis with Enhanced Signals  ap. 7871-7881.  aMild acidic environment and angiogenesis are two typical characteristics of tumor. The specific response toward both lower pH and angiogenesis may enhance the targeting ability both for drug and diagnostic probe delivery. Herein, we present a kind of dual responding self-assembled nanotransformation material that is tumor angiogenesis targeting and pH triggered based on amphiphilic conjugation between peptides (STP) and aromatic molecules (tetraphenylethylene (TPE)). The morphology of the self-assembled peptide conjugates is responsibly changed from nanoparticles in neutral condition to nanofibers in acidic condition, which “turn on” the in vivo targeting imaging and accelerate the efficient drug delivery and in vivo therapy. On the basis of the well-controlled nanotransformation both in vitro and in vivo, we envisioned the successful demonstration of the responding materials would open a new avenue in turn on targeting imaging diagnostics and specific cancer therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3adiagnostic techniques 3adrugs 3aimage analysis 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apH 3apeptides 3atherapeutics 0apH-triggered 0aVEGFR2 0aself-assembly 0abioimaging 0acancer therapy1 aWang, Weizhi1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7310-40681 aWang, Zihua1 aJia, Xiangqian1 aHan, Qiuju1 aRostami, Iman1 aWang, Yuehua1 aHu, Zhiyuan0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 14, v. 10, no. 9 p.7871-7881dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b005833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008000171300001400251520143100265592002801696650002501724650001501749650002501764650001501789650001201804650001401816650001101830650001701841650002801858650001701886650001401903650001001917650002301927650001401950653001401964653001401978653003101992653001902023653001702042653001902059700002302078700001502101700002102116773012702137856008202264852000902346655001202355IND60517385820221120053253.0190803e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051738582DNAL7 a10.1017/S14792621140005862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroot, Steven P. C.10aProlonging the longevity of ex situ conserved seeds by storage under anoxia  ap. 18-26.  aPlant genetic resources are conserved by genebanks mainly in the form of seeds. In most of the cases, the dried seeds can be stored for a considerable period of time, but eventually seed deterioration results in the inability to generate healthy seedlings. Prolonging seed longevity during storage reduces the frequency of regeneration, which is beneficial from a genetic as well as a management point of view. To reduce the rate of deterioration, cool and dry storage conditions are usually practised for long-term seed storage. In spite of the growing body of evidence that seed deterioration is predominantly caused by oxidative processes, the importance of seed storage under anoxic conditions has received little attention from the genebank community. Herein, we report on the effects of anoxia on seed viability, the oxygen uptake by dry seeds in closed containers and the permeability for oxygen of various seed storage containers. Our results confirm that the ageing of dry seeds is accelerated by the presence of oxygen in the storage environment. Therefore, we recommend that genebanks store dry seeds under anoxic conditions to prolong their longevity during ex situ conservation. To reduce the initial rate of viability loss, we further recommend that the period of temporary storage after seed harvest be minimized and also that the seeds are kept during this period under controlled conditions, including anoxia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3acontainers 3aex situ conservation 3agene banks 3ahypoxia 3alongevity 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3aplant genetic resources 3aseed storage 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3astorage conditions 3aviability 0agenebanks 0aoxidation 0apost-harvesting management 0aseed longevity 0aseed storage 0aseed viability1 ade Groot, Liesbeth1 aKodde, Jan1 avan Treuren, Rob0 tPlant genetic resources.g2015 Apr., v. 13, no. 1 p.18-26dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl4078550x1479-263X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14792621140005863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012100170500002200291520176200313592002802075650001602103650001102119650002202130650001002152650001902162650001402181650000902195650002102204650002002225650001502245650001802260650001502278650002802293650001002321650002202331650001502353650001602368650001202384650001502396650002402411650001202435650001302447653002802460653001502488653002902503653001402532653003002546700001702576700001702593700001602610700001702626700001802643773007802661856008702739852000902826655001202835IND60564447320221118061623.0170713s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056444732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Guowei10aIn vivo metabolism of organophosphate flame retardants and distribution of their main metabolites in adult zebrafish  aPre-press version  aUnderstanding the metabolism of chemicals as well as the distribution and depuration of their main metabolites in tissues are essential for evaluating their fate and potential toxicity in vivo. Herein, we investigated the metabolism of six typical organophosphate (OP) flame retardants (tripropyl phosphate (TPRP), tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) and tri-p-cresyl phosphate (p-TCP)) in adult zebrafish in laboratory at three levels (0, 1/150 LC50 (environmentally relevant level), and 1/30 LC50 per OP analog). Twenty main metabolites were detected in the liver of OPs-exposed zebrafish using high resolution mass spectrometry (Q-TOF). The reaction pathways involving scission of the ester bond (hydrolysis), cleavage of the ether bond, oxidative hydroxylation, dechlorination, and coupling with glucuronic acid were proposed, and were further confirmed by the frontier electron density and point charge calculations. Tissue distribution of the twenty metabolites revealed that liver and intestine with the highest levels of metabolites were the most active organs for OPs biotransformation among the studied tissues of intestine, liver, roe, brain, muscle, and gill, which showed the importance of hepatobiliary system (liver–bile–intestine) in the metabolism and excretion of OPs in zebrafish. Fast depuration of metabolites from tissues indicated that the formed metabolites might be not persistent in fish, and easily released into water. This study provides comprehensive information on the metabolism of OPs in the tissue of zebrafish, which might give some hints for the exploration of their toxic mechanism in aquatic life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3abiotransformation 3abrain 3adechlorination 3aexcretion 3afish 3aflame retardants 3aglucuronic acid 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroxylation 3aintestines 3alethal concentration 50 3aliver 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amuscles 3aphosphates 3atissue distribution 3atissues 3atoxicity 0aOrganophosphorus esters 0aMetabolism 0aMetabolites distribution 0aZebrafish 0aFrontier electron density1 aChen, Hanyan1 aDu, Zhongkun1 aLi, Jianhua1 aWang, Zunyao1 aGao, Shixiang0 tScience of the total environment.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03699naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002100176245010800197300001500305500001500320520192600335592002802261650001602289650001602305650001602321650001502337650001802352650001702370650001102387650001802398650001602416650001602432650001502448650002002463650001402483650002002497650001902517650001702536650001202553650002402565650001202589650000902601653001802610700002002628700001602648700001802664700001702682700002302699700002002722773015102742856006902893856010302962990002303065852000903088655001203097IND60643515520221122195524.0190510e20140227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064351552DNAL7 a10.3791/512972doi7 aPMC41405982pmcid7 a246379692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorampudi, Vijay10aDnbs/tnbs colitis models: providing insights into inflammatory bowel disease and effects of dietary fat  ap. e51297.  a2019-12-06  aInflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), including Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, have long been associated with a genetic basis, and more recently host immune responses to microbial and environmental agents. Dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis allows one to study the pathogenesis of IBD associated environmental triggers such as stress and diet, the effects of potential therapies, and the mechanisms underlying intestinal inflammation and mucosal injury. In this paper, we investigated the effects of dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on the colonic mucosal inflammatory response to DNBS-induced colitis in rats. All rats were fed identical diets with the exception of different types of fatty acids [safflower oil (SO), canola oil (CO), or fish oil (FO)] for three weeks prior to exposure to intrarectal DNBS. Control rats given intrarectal ethanol continued gaining weight over the 5 day study, whereas, DNBS-treated rats fed lipid diets all lost weight with FO and CO fed rats demonstrating significant weight loss by 48 hr and rats fed SO by 72 hr. Weight gain resumed after 72 hr post DNBS, and by 5 days post DNBS, the FO group had a higher body weight than SO or CO groups. Colonic sections collected 5 days post DNBS-treatment showed focal ulceration, crypt destruction, goblet cell depletion, and mucosal infiltration of both acute and chronic inflammatory cells that differed in severity among diet groups. The SO fed group showed the most severe damage followed by the CO, and FO fed groups that showed the mildest degree of tissue injury. Similarly, colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, a marker of neutrophil activity was significantly higher in SO followed by CO fed rats, with FO fed rats having significantly lower MPO activity. These results demonstrate the use of DNBS-induced colitis, as outlined in this protocol, to determine the impact of diet in the pathogenesis of IBD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aweight gain 3adietary fat 3abody weight 3acanola oil 3aCrohn disease 3ainflammation 3amodels 3asafflower oil 3aweight loss 3aneutrophils 3aintestines 3amyeloperoxidase 3afish oils 3aimmune response 3asulfonic acids 3apathogenesis 3acolitis 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aethanol 3arats 0asulfonic acid1 aBhinder, Ganive1 aWu, Xiujuan1 aDai, Chuanbin1 aSham, Ho Pan1 aVallance, Bruce A.1 aJacobson, Kevan0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 Feb. 27, , no. 84 p.e51297-e51297dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/512973Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/51297/dnbstnbs-colitis-models-providing-insights-into-inflammatory-bowel  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015900172300001400331520126500345592002801610650003701638650001201675650002501687650001501712650003001727650001101757650001901768650000901787650002701796650001401823650002101837650000901858651000901867653002201876653002601898653002201924653002301946653000901969653002001978700003201998700001902030700002402049700001802073700002402091700002102115773012702136856008202263852000902345655001202354IND60517385920221120053206.0190803e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051738592DNAL7 a10.1017/S14792621140005982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoulati-Baneh, Hamed10aGenetic characterization of some wild grape populations (Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris) of Zagros mountains (Iran) to indentify a conservation strategy  ap. 27-35.  aIn this study, the genetic constitution of wild grape populations distributed in the Zagros Mountains in the north-west part of Iran was investigated to assess their risk of extinction and to identify the most suitable conservation strategy. A total of 65 wild grapevine samples from five different populations were analysed using 23 SSR loci. Consistent allelic richness was detected in all the analysed populations (from 4.01 to 5.35). The observed heterozygosity and expected heterozygosity were high with mean values of 0.67 and 0.69, respectively. A modest heterozygosity deficiency was detected only in the Piranshahr and Sardasht-Shalmash populations. The neighbour-joining dendrogram clustered the accessions into three groups corresponding to the geographical distribution of the populations. Molecular data combined with field evaluation revealed that an ex situ conservation approach is the most suitable strategy for preserving the genetic richness of Iranian wild grape populations with consistent rare alleles (about 20%). We propose in situ preservation only in the case of the Sardasht-Ghasmarash population to ensure that evolutionary dynamic forces continue to influence plant adaptation and survival in response to environmental alterations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris 3aalleles 3aex situ conservation 3aextinction 3ageographical distribution 3agrapes 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amountains 3aplant adaptation 3arisk 3aIran 0agenetic resources 0agermplasm collections 0amolecular markers 0aplant conservation 0aSSRs 0awild grapevines1 aMohammadi, Seyed Abolghasem1 aLabra, Massimo1 aDe Mattia, Fabrizio1 aBruni, Ilaria1 aMezzasalma, Valerio1 aAbdollahi, Rahim0 tPlant genetic resources.g2015 Apr., v. 13, no. 1 p.27-35dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl4078550x1479-263X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14792621140005983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02023naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245011600159300001800275520108400293592002801377650002201405650000901427650002601436650001601462650001801478650001201496650001001508651001301518773009801531856007101629852000901700655001201709IND60518720220221119140015.0160418e198312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051872022DNAL7 a10.2307/19375062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevenson, R.

Diatom abundances on tiles exposed for 24 h, i.e., diatom immigration rates, ranged from 30 t 1500 cells .cm— ².d— ¹. Immigration rates in areas sheltered from the 27 cm/s currents of two Michigan streams were greater than in areas exposed to the current. Diatom immigration rates increased by a factor of 6 when microhabitat conditions were altered by interrupting currents near the substrate surface, and by a factor of 2 when substrates wee coated with agar. These two microhabitat conditions, respectively, simulated changes in current patterns near the substrate, and in adsorptive characteristics of the substrate that could occur autogenically as diatoms accumulate on substrates. Species—specific effects of current velocity and microhabitat conditions were related to size and growth habits of cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aagar 3acommunity development 3aimmigration 3amicrohabitats 3astreams 3atiles 3aMichigan0 tEcology.g1983 Dec., v. 64, no. 6 p.1514-1524dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19375063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011500159300001800274500002000292520175100312592002802063650002302091650001302114650002502127650001702152650001802169650001402187650001802201650002002219650002202239650001402261650002102275650001402296650002302310650002402333650001902357650002602376650001002402650001202412651001302424651001102437700006002448700002602508700002202534700002102556773015302577856007402730852000902804655001202813IND60686361920221119045639.0200317e20200330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068636192DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.102222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSobota, Aldona10aYellow‐coated quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd) – physicochemical, nutritional, and antioxidant properties  ap. 2035-2042.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Quinoa seeds are an excellent source of nutrients and phytochemical compounds with well documented activity; however, different cultivars are usually characterized by different physical properties and chemical composition. This study presented the physical properties, nutrient content, and antioxidant capacities of 25 cultivars of yellow‐coated quinoa. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that quinoa seeds may be an excellent source of dietary fiber (up to 198 g kg⁻¹ d.m. – Baer cultivar), with a 1:2 ratio of the soluble to insoluble fraction. Digestible carbohydrates were present at the highest level in the Puno cultivar (640 g kg⁻¹). The highest content of proteins was determined in the Colorado 407D and Faro cultivars (c.a. 16%). The average content of albumin and globulins in the seeds was 29.2 and 65.6 g kg⁻¹, respectively. The quinoa seeds were characterized by low activity of protease inhibitors. The lowest inhibition of trypsin was determined for the UDEC‐3, Faro Orange, and Titicaca cultivars, and the highest value was exhibited by the Titicaca White and UDEC‐5 cultivars. Phenolics in the tested cultivars ranged from 7.1 g kg⁻¹ (UDEC‐3) to 10.6 g kg⁻¹ (Temuko). The best antiradical properties were determined for Temuco and Rainbow (2.05 g TE kg⁻¹ and 1.85 g TE kg⁻¹, respectively), while the Baer and Temuco cultivars were characterized by the highest reducing power (2.28 g TE kg⁻¹ and 2.17 g TE kg⁻¹, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study has shown that quinoa cultivated in European countries is a good source of nutrients, dietary fiber, and antioxidants; however, its composition varies significantly. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aChenopodium quinoa 3aalbumins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acarbohydrates 3acultivars 3adietary fiber 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aglobulins 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphenolic compounds 3aphysical properties 3aphytochemicals 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aseeds 3atrypsin 3aColorado 3aEurope1 aŚwieca, Michał1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6513-83991 aGęsiński, Krzysztof1 aWirkijowska, Anna1 aBochnak, Justyna0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2020 Mar. 30, v. 100, no. 5 p.2035-2042dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.102223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002500190245008400215300001600299506007600315520148900391592002801880506003701908650001101945650001701956650001001973650000801983650001501991650001002006650001002016651001802026653001102044653001002055653000902065653001002074653001002084653001002094653001102104700002402115700002102139700002002160773009502180856008402275852000902359655001202368IND60559725220221207143659.0190401e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055972522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2016.11.0362doi7 aPMC52068982pmcid7 a279150792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornelis, Marilyn C.10aRecalled taste intensity, liking and habitual intake of commonly consumed foods  ap. 182-189.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTaste intensity and quality affect the liking of foods, and determine food choice and consumption. We aimed to 1) classify commonly consumed foods based on recalled taste intensity for bitter, sweet, salty, sour, and fatty taste, and 2) examine the associations among recalled taste intensity, liking, and habitual consumption of foods. In Stage 1, 62 Canadian adults recalled the taste intensity of 120 common foods. Their responses were used to identify sets of 20–25 foods classified as strongly bitter, sweet, salty, sour or fatty-tasting. In Stage 2, 287 U.S. adults validated these selections, and let us reduce them to sets of 11–13 foods. Ratings of recalled taste intensity were consistent across age, sex and overweight status, with the exceptions that sweet, bitter and fatty-tasting foods were rated as more intense by women than by men. The recalled intensity ratings of the most bitter, salty and fatty foods (but not sour or sweet foods) were inversely correlated with liking and intake. The negative correlation between fatty taste intensity and fatty food liking was stronger among normal weight than among overweight participants. Our results suggest that the recalled taste intensity of foods is associated with food liking and habitual consumption, but the strength of these relationships varies by taste. The food lists based on taste intensity ratings provide a resource to efficiently calculate indices of exposure to the different tastes in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3afood choices 3afoods 3amen 3aoverweight 3ataste 3awomen 3aUnited States 0aBitter 0aSalty 0aSour 0aFatty 0aSweet 0aTaste 0aLiking1 aTordoff, Michael G.1 aEl-Sohemy, Ahmed1 avan Dam, Rob M.0 tAppetite.g2017 Feb. 01, v. 109 p.182-189dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2016.11.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013700164300001400301520175300315592002802068650001902096650001202115650002202127650001302149650001402162650001402176650001202190650000902202650001002211650002702221650001402248650001402262650000902276650001602285653002902301653003102330653002202361653001602383653001602399653002202415653001402437653002302451700002602474700002302500700002102523700001902544700002302563700001502586700001802601700002002619700001802639773012702657856008202784852000902866655001202875IND60517386220221121042826.0190803e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051738622DNAL7 a10.1017/S147926211400063X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhera, Pawan10aGenetic variability in trait-specific rice germplasm groups based on coefficient of parentage, SSR markers and fertility restoration  ap. 56-67.  aTo maximize heterosis, it is important to understand the genetic diversity of germplasm and associate useful phenotypic traits such as fertility restoration for hybrid rice breeding. The objectives of the present study were to characterize genetic diversity within a set of rice germplasm groups using coefficient of parentage (COP) values and 58 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for 124 genotypes having different attributes such as resistance/tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. These lines were also used for identifying prospective restorers and maintainers for wild abortive-cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) line. The mean COP value for all the lines was 0.11, indicating that the genotypes do not share common ancestry. The SSR analysis generated a total of 268 alleles with an average of 4.62 alleles per locus. The mean polymorphism information content value was 0.53, indicating that the markers selected were highly polymorphic. Grouping based on COP analysis revealed three major clusters pertaining to the indica, tropical japonica and japonica lines. A similar grouping pattern with some variation was also observed for the SSR markers. Fertility restoration phenotype based on the test cross of the 124 genotypes with a CMS line helped identify 23 maintainers, 58 restorers and 43 genotypes as either partial maintainers or partial restorers. This study demonstrates that COP analysis along with molecular marker analysis might encourage better organization of germplasm diversity and its use in hybrid rice breeding. Potential restorers identified in the study can be used for breeding high-yielding stress-tolerant medium-duration rice hybrids, while maintainers would prove useful for developing new rice CMS lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aalleles 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3aheterosis 3ahybrids 3aloci 3amales 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparentage 3aphenotype 3arice 3atestcrosses 0acoefficient of parentage 0acytoplasmic male sterility 0agenetic diversity 0ahybrid rice 0amaintainers 0amolecular markers 0arestorers 0aspikelet fertility1 aSingh, Akhilesh Kumar1 aPriyadarshi, Rahul1 aKhandekar, Durga1 aAllu, Rajani K1 aHiremath, Chitkale1 aKumar, Raj1 aMohan, Rashmi1 aUlaganathan, K.1 aShenoy, Vinay0 tPlant genetic resources.g2015 Apr., v. 13, no. 1 p.56-67dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl4078550x1479-263X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S147926211400063X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03390naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245007800170300001300248506002800261520188100289592002802170506003702198650002002235650001902255650002702274650001202301650001202313650002402325650002102349650001702370650001702387650002002404651001202424653002202436653002002458653002402478653001902502653001902521653003302540700002202573700002302595700002202618700002402640773013402664856008902798852000902887655001202896IND60774318120221207072645.0220322e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077431812DNAL7 a10.48077/scihor.24(10).2021.9-162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBosak, Alla10aDetermination of the Concepts of Building a Solar Power Forecasting Model  ap. 9-16.  aResource is Open Access  aSince in Ukraine there are fines for imbalances in solar power generation in the “day-ahead” energy market, the forecasting of electricity generation is an important component of the solar power plant operation. To forecast the active power generation of photovoltaic panels, a mathematical model should be developed, which considers the main factors affecting the volume of energy generation. In this article, the main factors affecting the performance of solar panels were analysed using correlation analysis. The data sets for the construction of the forecasting model were obtained from the solar power plant in the Kyiv region. Two types of data sets were used for the analysis of factors and model building: 10-minute time interval data and daily data. For each data set, the input parameters were selected using correlation analysis. Considering the determining factors, the models of finding the function of reflecting meteorological factors in the volume of electricity generation are built. It is established that through models with a lower discreteness of climatic parameters forecast it is possible to determine the potential volume of electricity production by the solar power plant for the day-ahead with a lower mean absolute error. The best accuracy of the model for predicting electric power generation over the 10-minute interval is obtained in the ensemble random of a forest model. It is determined that models without solar radiation intensity parameters on the input have an unsatisfactory coefficient of determination. Therefore, further research will focus on combining a model of forecasting the day-ahead solar radiation with 10-minutes discreteness with a model for determining the amount of electricity generation. The determined predicted values of solar radiation will be the input parameter of the forecasting model described in the article  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata collection 3aelectric power 3aelectricity generation 3aforests 3amarkets 3amathematical models 3apower generation 3apower plants 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3aUkraine 0asolar power plant 0asolar radiation 0aregression analysis 0aregularisation 0amodel accuracy 0acoefficient of determination1 aMatushkin, Dmytro1 aDubovyk, Volodymyr1 aHomon, Sviatoslav1 aKulakovskyi, Leonid0 tNaukovì gorizonti.g2022 Jan., v. 24, no. 10 p.9-16dZhytomyr National Agroecological UniversitywJournal:27917x2663-21447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.48077/scihor.24(10).2021.9-163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001300137245009000150300001800240520115200258592002801410650001001438650001301448650002401461650002401485650001301509650002201522650002201544650001101566650001501577700001801592700002001610773009801630856007101728852000901799655001201808IND60518720520221119140012.0160418e198312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051872052DNAL7 a10.2307/19374992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRice, J.10aTurnovers in Species Composition of Avian Communities in Contiguous Riparian Habitats  ap. 1444-1455.  aWe examined 4 yr of intensive census records for 72 line transects in contiguous riparian vegetation. Across all transects the number of bird species differing between pairs of successive years followed a random distribution. For any season, from one—quarter to over one—third of the species differed. There were weak tendencies for specific plant communities and seral stages to have high or low turnover rates. The proportion of avian species in a community changing between years was lower in summer than in other seasons but was similar between years for any specific season. Locally breeding species showed slightly more stable communities than did nonlocally breeding species. These high turnover rates in bird community composition between years bring into question assumption underlying current theories of avian habitat selection, as well as assumptions essential when competition theory is used as the framework to account for community organization. Furthermore, there are substantial empirical similarities between these species turnovers in contiguous habitats and species turnovers on island and island—like patches of habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3abreeding 3acommunity structure 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aplant communities 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3avegetation1 aOhmart, R.

However, it is also a frequent component of the understory in mature oak—hickory forests in central Missouri, where light levels are typically <10% of full sunlight during much of the growing season. This is below eastern redcedar's reported optimum for photosynthesis. The competitive survival of understory eastern redcedar under such environmental conditions was apparently due to it being an evergreen conifer in a deciduous forest. Hence, its foliage was able to maintain a positive carbon dioxide balance throughout much of the year, with maximum net photosynthetic rates occurring during periods when the overstory was leafless. The greatest daily average net photosynthetic rates (Phₙ) occurred during overstory leaf emergence when temperatures were moderate and light levels to the understory trees were annually the highest. Furthermore, since leaf temperatures and tree water deficits were relatively low at this time, daily gas exchange rates were not greatly limited by midday stomatal closure. After the overstory foliage had fully developed, understory light levels averaged °50—80% below levels observed in early spring. Thus, photosynthesis was severely light limited during the day, resulting in Ph?ₙ that were °15—45% of the springtime maxima. The greatest daily average transpiration rates (TR) occurred during the summer due to the high evaporative demand. Increasing leaf temperatures and tree water deficits became more important by late summer, causing stomatal closure during some afternoons, which reduced Phₙ and TR to °30 and 40%, respectively, of the early summer levels. During the autumn, winter, and early spring, understory light levels were normally above the saturation point for photosynthesis. The light saturation point for an understory study tree (expressed as flux of photosynthetically active photons) was °800 @mmol°m— ²°s— ¹, less than half of that reported for open—grown eastern redcedar. This relatively lower light saturation point suggested an adjustment to shade conditions. During the autumn overstory defoliation period, light levels to understory trees progressively increased, and Phₙ eventually reached 80% of the springtime maximum. In contrasts, TR only reached °25% of the summer maximum, owing to relatively low evaporative demands. During the late autumn and winter, low leaf and oil temperatures combined to limit gas exchange severely. The major controlling factors seemed to be cold air temperatures directly inhibiting Phₙ and cold soil temperatures indirectly producing tree water deficits due to reduced water uptake at the soil—rate interface. Such conditions promoted persistent stomatal closure, resulting in Phₙ near zero. However, a temporary warming trend during the winter caused an increase in Phₙ to a level °30% of the springtime maximum. Higher net photosynthetic rates probably were not possible due to the effects of low soil and air temperatures on the especially mechanism and on the photosynthetic apparatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuniperus virginiana 3aair temperature 3aautumn 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonate rocks 3acold 3acold soils 3aconifers 3adeciduous forests 3adefoliation 3adrought tolerance 3aecophysiology 3aenvironmental factors 3aevaporative demand 3agas exchange 3agrowing season 3aleaf emergence 3aleaves 3aoils 3aoverstory 3apastures 3aphotons 3aphotosynthesis 3apioneer species 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3astomatal movement 3asummer 3atranspiration 3atrees 3aunderstory 3awater uptake 3awinter 3aEastern United States 3aMissouri1 aDougherty, Phillip M.1 aReich, Peter B.1 aHinckley, Thomas M.1 aMetcalf, Clifford M.1 aDina, Stephen J.0 tEcology.g1983 Dec., v. 64, no. 6 p.1355-1366dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19374903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03915naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245017000168300001600338520200500354592002802359650002602387650001302413650001902426650001602445650002002461650000902481650001202490650002002502650003102522650001902553650001802572650002602590650001002616650001202626650001002638650001402648650001602662650001702678650001702695650001502712650002002727650002902747650002702776653002602803653001502829653004602844653002502890653002202915700001402937700001702951700001702968700001402985700001702999700001503016773016403031856008503195852000903280655001203289IND60770679920221120113629.0220706e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077067992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2022.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Haoran10aSchistosoma japonicum translationally controlled tumour protein, which is associated with the development of female worms, as a target for control of schistosomiasis  ap. 569-579.  aSchistosomiasis is a globally important helminthic disease of both humans and animals, and is the second most common parasitic disease after malaria. Although praziquantel is extensively used for treatment of parasitic diseases, drug resistance has been reported. Therefore, new drugs and effective vaccines are needed for continuous control of schistosomiasis. Eggs produced by schistosomes are responsible for the occurrence and spread of schistosomiasis. Revealing the reproductive mechanism of schistosomes will help to control this disease. In this study, the proteomic profiles of single-sex infected female worms and bisexual infected mature female worms of Schistosoma japonicum at 18, 21, 23 and 25 days p.i. were identified with isobaric tags for relative quantitation-coupled liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Differentially expressed proteins were subsequently used for bioinformatic analysis. Six highly expressed differentially expressed proteins in mature female worms were selected and long-term interference with small interfering RNA (siRNA) was conducted to determine biological functions. SiRNA against S. japonicum translationally controlled tumour protein (SjTCTP) resulted in the most significant effect on the growth and development of MF worms. Sjtctp mRNA expression gradually increased over time with a high level of expression maintained at 25–42 days p.i., while levels were significantly higher in mature female worms than male and SF worms. The subsequent animal immune protection experiments showed that recombinant SjTCTP (rSjTCTP) reduced the number of adults by 44.7% (P < 0.01), average egg burden per gram of liver by 57.94% (P < 0.01), egg hatching rate by 47.57% (P < 0.01), and oviposition of individual females by 43.16%. rSjTCTP induced higher levels of serum IgG, IL-2, and IL-10 in mice. Collectively, these results show that SjTCTP is vital to reproduction of female worms and, thus, is a candidate antigen for immune protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma japonicum 3aantigens 3abioinformatics 3ablood serum 3adrug resistance 3aeggs 3afemales 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-2 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3amalaria 3amales 3aneoplasms 3aoviposition 3aparasitology 3apraziquantel 3aproteomics 3aschistosomiasis 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atranslation (genetics) 0aSchistosoma japonicum 0aProteomics 0aTranslationally controlled tumour protein 0aBiological functions 0aImmune protection1 aRen, Yuqi1 aQin, Fanglin1 aLi, Xiaochun1 aHou, Ling1 aGu, Shaopeng1 aJin, Yamei0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2022 July, v. 52, no. 8 p.569-579dElsevier LtdaAustralian Society for ParasitologywJournal:jnl1441x0020-75197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2022.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006800149245011300217300001400330520161900344592002801963650001601991650000902007650001102016650001902027650001202046650001602058650002302074650001502097653001502112653001002127653001402137653001402151653001202165653001502177700002202192700002102214700002402235773009202259856008402351852000902435655001202444IND60535553420221120022016.0190318e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053555342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2013.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarraway-Stage, Virginia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6152-143810aEvaluation of a pictorial method to assess liking of familiar fruits and vegetables among preschool children  ap. 11-20.  aResearch suggests fruit and vegetable (FV) preferences greatly influence on FV intake. Methods for assessing children’s FV preference in a reliable and valid manner are needed. The purpose of this study was to develop a practical, reliable, and valid method for evaluating FV liking among preschool-aged children using photographs. Authors formatively assessed a series of digital FV photographs and hedonic scales to develop content for the liking measure. The measure for assessment included 20 high-quality, digital photographs presenting 13 FVs. A non-gendered 5-point face scale (super yummy to super yucky) was chosen to determine level of liking. We used this measure to establish reliability (i.e., test re-test) and concurrent validity (i.e., photograph versus tasting experience) of the pictorial method. Data were analyzed using Spearman’s Rho Correlation Coefficients and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The measure demonstrated varying levels of reliability/validity for individual FV items and the fruit scale; however, the vegetable scale and collapsed FV scale were determined to be valid measures. Authors recommended the removal of one weak pictorial fruit item (halved peach) from the fruit and FV scales to improve validity. The final recommended measure included 19 high-quality, digital photographs presenting 12 FVs. The pictorial FV measure and subscales may be useful for assessing FV liking among groups of preschool-aged children within the studied population. Additional research is needed to further validate the use of the pictorial FV measures in a larger, more generalizable sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3aface 3afruits 3ahedonic scales 3apeaches 3aphotographs 3apreschool children 3avegetables 0aPreference 0aFruit 0aVegetable 0aPreschool 0aPicture 0aEvaluation1 aSpangler, Hillary1 aBorges, Michelle1 aGoodell, L.

V95A reduced the ATPase rate when filaments were saturated with regulatory proteins both in the presence and absence of calcium, indicating either a stabilization of the inactive state or an inability to fully populate the active state. Effects of E180G and D175N were more complex. These two mutations increased ATPase rates at sub-saturating concentrations of troponin and tropomyosin as compared to wild type tropomyosin. At higher concentrations of regulatory proteins, ATPase rates became similar to wild type. Normal activation was achieved with the tight-binding myosin analog N-ethylmaleimide-S1, at saturating regulatory protein concentrations. These results suggest that the E180G and D175N mutations reduce the affinity of tropomyosin for actin and also destabilize troponin binding to the actin thin filaments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactin 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abinding properties 3acalcium 3acardiomyopathy 3amutation 3amyosin 3aregulatory proteins 3atropomyosins1 aChase, P.

Sustainable crop production intensification will require the development of an array of nutrient management strategies tailored to farm-specific conditions, rather than blanket recommendations across diverse farms. This study reviewed key literature on smallholder farm typologies focusing on three countries (Kenya, Malawi and Zimbabwe), to gain insights on opportunities for crop production intensification, and the importance of developing farm-specific nutrient management practices. Investigations on farm typologies have done well in highlighting the fundamental differences between farm categories, with 3–5 typologies often adequate to represent the wide differences in resource endowment. Resource-endowed farmers have ready access to large quantities of manure and mineral fertilizers, which contribute to higher soil fertility and crop productivity on their farms. Resource-constrained households use little or no manure and mineral fertilizers, and have limited capacity to invest in labour-demanding soil fertility management technologies. These farmers often have to rely on off-farm opportunities for income that are largely limited to selling unskilled labour to their resource-endowed neighbors. The variability in management practices by farmers has resulted in three main soil fertility classes that can be used for targeting soil fertility management technologies, characterized by potential response to fertilizer application as: (1) low-responsive fertile fields that receive large additions of manure and fertilizer; (2) high-responsive infertile fields that receive moderate nutrient applications; (3) poorly responsive degraded soils cultivated for many years with little or no nutrient additions. The main conclusions drawn from the review are: (1) resource constrained farmers constitute the widest band across the three countries, with many of the farmers far below the threshold for sustainable maize production intensification and lacking capacity to invest in improved seed and fertilizer, (2) farm sizes and livestock ownership were key determinants for both farmer wealth status and farm productivity, and (3) soil organic carbon and available P were good indicators for predicting previous land management, that is also invariably linked to farmer resource endowment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3afarm size 3afarmers 3afarms 3afertilizer application 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3alabor 3aland management 3alivestock 3amineral fertilizers 3anutrient management 3aownership 3aprediction 3asmall-scale farming 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic carbon 3asustainable agricultural intensification 3aKenya 3aMalawi 3aZimbabwe1 aZingore, Shamie1 aSnapp, Sieglinde1 aJohnston, Adrian0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2014 Sept., v. 100, no. 1 p.1-18dSpringer-Verlagx1385-13147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-014-9632-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245021700162300001600379500001500395520120400410592002801614650000901642650001301651650001001664650003001674650001901704650002601723650001001749650001801759650001101777650001901788650001201807650001001819650001101829650001001840650003501850653003001885700002701915700001901942700002301961700002001984700002302004700002402027773011302051856004802164852000902212655001202221IND4467623620221118073845.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446762362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-011-0053-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrashant, S.10aIsolation of cinnamoyl CoA reductase and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase gene promoters from Leucaena leucocephala, a leguminous tree species, and characterization of tissue-specific activity in transgenic tobacco  ap. 421-436.  a2019-12-06  aPromoter sequences of a 795 bp cinnamoyl CoA reductase (LlCCR) and 1,882 bp cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (LlCAD) genes were isolated from Leucaena leucocephala, a leguminous tree species by genome walking, and analysed using bioinformatics tools. This revealed presence of cis-elements such as AC-boxes, XYLAT, WRKY, and MYB binding sites in addition to CAAT and TATA boxes. For functional characterization, each of LlCCR and LlCAD promoter sequences were fused to β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, immobilized into pBI101 plasmid, and introduced into tobacco via Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404. Histochemical observations of transgenic lines indicated tissue-specific expression of GUS in the vascular tissues of leaves, stems, and roots. These results demonstrate that GUS expression driven by either LlCCR or LlCAD promoters were involved in lignifying tissues, and more specifically in differentiating xylem cells. This observed tissue-specific expression driven by either LlCCR or LlCAD promoters is sufficient for reducing the lignin content only in vascular tissues, thus overcoming the risks and challenges associated with down-regulation of lignin content in whole plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3aTATA box 3astems 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3abioinformatics 3aLeucaena leucocephala 3atrees 3abinding sites 3aleaves 3areporter genes 3atobacco 3axylem 3alignin 3aroots 3acinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aSri Lakshmi Sunita, M.1 aSirisha, V.

This is of particular importance for durum wheat, which accumulates more Cd than bread wheat. The contamination of durum wheat grain by Cd depends not only on the genotype but also to a large extent on soil Cd availability. Assessing the phytoavailability of Cd for durum wheat is thus crucial, and appropriate methods are required. For this purpose, we propose a statistical model to predict Cd accumulation in durum wheat grain based on soil geochemical properties related to Cd availability in French agricultural soils with low Cd contents and neutral to alkaline pH (soils commonly used to grow durum wheat). The best model is based on the concentration of total Cd in the soil solution, the pH of a soil CaCl₂ extract, the cation exchange capacity (CEC), and the content of manganese oxides (Tamm’s extraction) in the soil. The model variables suggest a major influence of cadmium buffering power of the soil and of Cd speciation in solution. The model successfully explains 88% of Cd variability in grains with, generally, below 0.02 mg Cd kg⁻¹ prediction error in wheat grain. Monte Carlo cross-validation indicated that model accuracy will suffice for the European Community project to reduce the regulatory limit from 0.2 to 0.15 mg Cd kg⁻¹ grain, but not for the intermediate step at 0.175 mg Cd kg⁻¹. The model will help farmers assess the risk that the Cd content of their durum wheat grain will exceed regulatory limits, and help food safety authorities test different regulatory thresholds to find a trade-off between food safety and the negative impact a too strict regulation could have on farmers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3acadmium 3acalcium chloride 3acation exchange capacity 3adurum wheat 3afarmers 3afood intake 3afood safety 3afoods 3agenotype 3ahumans 3amanganese oxides 3apH 3aprediction 3asoil solution 3astatistical models1 aLaurette, Julien1 aDenaix, Laurence1 aGourdain, Emmanuelle1 aMéléard, Benoit1 aNguyen, Christophe1 aSchneider, André,1 aSappin-Didier, Valérie0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Sept., v. 24, no. 25 p.20641-20654dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9712-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245012800163520127500291592002801566650001601594650001601610700002101626700001701647773011801664856007601782852000901858655001201867IND60760625820221121231515.0211223e20210927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076062582DNAL7 a10.3390/fire40400632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpson, Heather 10aQuantifying the Prevalence and Practice of Suppression Firing with Operational Data from Large Fires in Victoria, Australia  aFire management agencies around the world use suppression firing for fire control. Yet, we know little about the extent of its use (e.g., prevalence and spatial coverage) and its impact on containment. We examine the prevalence and practice of suppression firing in Victoria, Australia. We used operational data from five years (2010–2015) to identify and map the incidence of suppression firing on 74 large fires (500+ ha). Suppression firing occurred on half (34) of these fires, 26 of which had data to map firing locations. The area burnt by suppression firing ranged from <1 ha to ~20,000 ha on separate fires. Archetypal suppression firing occurred during intervals of low fire spread and resulted in modest fire behaviour. Ground crews generally conducted the perimeter suppression firing. Aerial ignition was more common on large internal firing operations. For the 26 fires where we mapped the firing locations, firing occurred along 77% of the perimeter-aligned road. Suppression firing was a prominent containment tool used along one-fifth of the total external perimeter of these 74 large fires. Quantification of this practice is a first step towards establishing ignition thresholds, production rates, and integration with containment probability models.  aPublisher supplied data 3afire spread 3aprobability1 aBradstock, Ross 1 aPrice, Owen 0 tFire.g2021 Sept. 27, v. 4, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27135x2571-62557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fire40400633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03921naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009500172300002000267520167800287592002801965650001901993650005002012650002602062650001302088650001202101650001202113650001302125650001202138650001302150650001102163650001102174650001102185650002702196650000902223650002102232650001502253650001702268650001102285650001502296650002502311650000902336650001402345650001202359650001102371650001502382650001802397650000902415650001602424650001102440650001302451650001602464650000802480650001302488650002002501650001702521650002002538650001502558650001502573650000902588651001102597700002402608700002402632700002502656700001802681700002302699700002302722700001702745700002302762700001902785700002102804700002602825773015002851856008103001852000903082655001203091IND60579748220221116143004.0170830e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057974822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9461-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, Carolina S.10aHealth risks of environmental exposure to metals and herbicides in the Pardo River, Brazil  ap. 20160-20172.  aMixture of metals and herbicides in rivers may pose relevant risks for the health of surrounding communities. Humans may be exposed to river pollution through intake of contaminated water and fish, as well as irrigated agricultural products. The aim of this study was to assess the human health risks of environmental exposure to metals and herbicides through water and fish intake in the Pardo River. Metals (Al, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Mn, Hg, Ni, Tl, Sn, V, and Zn) were analyzed in river water and in edible fish. Herbicides (ametryn, atrazine, diuron, hexazinone, simazine, and tebuthiuron) were analyzed in river water. Seasonal variances were also studied. Aluminum, Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn levels in river water were higher than the USEPA benchmarks. Non-carcinogenic risks due to pollutants mixture exposure were above the limit, and carcinogenic risks of As exposure were >10⁻⁶ in the sampling points during the rainy season. Metal levels in fish were lower than the Brazilian legislation and do not pose a threat to public health. Herbicides were detected in four sampling points, with atrazine concentrations (range 0.16–0.32 μg/L) below the Brazilian standard (2.0 μg/L), but above the European Union standard (0.1 μg/L). Considering the water supply needs of cities located in the Pardo River Basin and the persistence of metals and herbicides, the present study indicated that there was a seasonal influence on non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks to human health, especially in the rainy season. Studies for water treatment plants implantation should consider the risks of exposure to persistent substances, in order to protect the population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aagricultural products 3aaluminum 3aametryn 3aarsenic 3aatrazine 3acadmium 3achromium 3acities 3acopper 3adiuron 3aenvironmental exposure 3afish 3afish consumption 3ahexazinone 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3airrigation 3alaws and regulations 3alead 3amanganese 3amercury 3anickel 3apollutants 3apublic health 3arisk 3ariver water 3arivers 3asimazine 3atebuthiuron 3atin 3avanadium 3awater pollution 3awater supply 3awater treatment 3awatersheds 3awet season 3azinc 3aBrazil1 aFregonesi, Brisa M.1 aAlves, Renato I.

This study aims to compare the food attitudes (i.e., hedonic- and nutrition-based) of children using both an implicit pairing task and an explicit forced-choice categorization task suitable for the cognitive abilities of 5- to 11-year-olds. A dominance of hedonically driven attitudes was expected for all ages in the pairing task, designed to elicit affective and spontaneous answers, whereas a progressive emergence of nutrition-based attitudes was expected in the categorization task, designed to involve deliberate analyses of the costs/benefits of foods. An additional exploratory goal was to evaluate differences in the attitudes of normal and overweight children in both tasks.Children from 3 school levels (n = 194; mean age = 8.03 years) were individually tested on computers in their schools. They performed a pairing task in which the tendencies to associate foods with nutritional vs. culinary contexts were assessed. Next, they were asked to categorize each food into one of the following four categories: “yummy”, “yucky” (i.e., hedonic categories), “makes you strong”, or“makes you fat” (i.e., nutritional categories).The hedonic/culinary pairs were very frequently selected (81% on average), and this frequency significantly increased through school levels. In contrast, in the categorization task, a significant increase in nutrition-driven categorizations with school level was observed. Additional analyses revealed no differences in the food attitudes between the normal and overweight children in the pairing task, and a tendency towards lower hedonic categorizations among the overweight children.Culinary associations can reflect cultural learning in the French context where food pleasure is dominant. In contrast, the progressive emergence of cognitively driven attitudes with age may reflect the cognitive development of children who are more reasonable and influenced by social norms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3acognition 3acognitive development 3acomputers 3acost analysis 3afoods 3alearning 3aschools 3asocial behavior 0aExplicit task 0aImplicit task 0aCategorization 0aPairing 0aAssociation 0aAttitudes 0aChildren 0aAffective attitudes 0aCognitive attitudes 0aFood pleasure 0aHedonic 0aNutrition1 aMarty, Lucile1 aBayer, Frédéric1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8566-40811 aNicklaus, Sophie1 aChambaron, Stéphanie0 tAppetite.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 96 p.580-587dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2015.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245009500181300002000276520165100296592002801947650002301975650001701998650002902015650003502044650001502079650001902094650001602113650001102129650002202140650001602162650001502178650002502193650002002218650001802238651000902256700001902265773015002284856008102434852000902515655001202524IND60579748320221116142956.0170830e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057974832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9720-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZolfagharipoor, Mohammad Amin10aEffluent trading in river systems through stochastic decision-making process: a case study  ap. 20655-20672.  aThe objective of this paper is to provide an efficient framework for effluent trading in river systems. The proposed framework consists of two pessimistic and optimistic decision-making models to increase the executability of river water quality trading programs. The models used for this purpose are (1) stochastic fallback bargaining (SFB) to reach an agreement among wastewater dischargers and (2) stochastic multi-criteria decision-making (SMCDM) to determine the optimal treatment strategy. The Monte-Carlo simulation method is used to incorporate the uncertainty into analysis. This uncertainty arises from stochastic nature and the errors in the calculation of wastewater treatment costs. The results of river water quality simulation model are used as the inputs of models. The proposed models are used in a case study on the Zarjoub River in northern Iran to determine the best solution for the pollution load allocation. The best treatment alternatives selected by each model are imported, as the initial pollution discharge permits, into an optimization model developed for trading of pollution discharge permits among pollutant sources. The results show that the SFB-based water pollution trading approach reduces the costs by US$ 14,834 while providing a relative consensus among pollutant sources. Meanwhile, the SMCDM-based water pollution trading approach reduces the costs by US$ 218,852, but it is less acceptable by pollutant sources. Therefore, it appears that giving due attention to stability, or in other words acceptability of pollution trading programs for all pollutant sources, is an essential element of their success.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3acase studies 3adecision support systems 3amulti-criteria decision making 3apollutants 3apollution load 3ariver water 3arivers 3asimulation models 3auncertainty 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3aIran1 aAhmadi, Azadeh0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Sept., v. 24, no. 25 p.20655-20672dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9720-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245021300167300001400380520161800394592002802012650002702040650000902067650002002076650001702096650001002113650001302123650001902136650001602155650001302171650003402184650001102218650002002229650001502249650002402264650002602288650001602314653002002330653002702350653001202377653003402389653001502423700001802438700002102456700001602477700001802493773010602511856008302617852000902700655001202709IND60544554120221117082818.0190417e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054455412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2014.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Dong Soo14aThe combined effects of ultraviolet-C irradiation and modified atmosphere packaging for inactivating Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and extending the shelf life of cherry tomatoes during cold storage  ap. 19-30.  aThe combined effects of ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation, modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), and cold storage temperature on the quality of inoculated (Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium) and non-inoculated cherry tomatoes were investigated. Based on the inactivation and sublethal injury tests of S. Typhimurium by UV-C irradiation, 2kJ/m2 UV-C was selected for the combined treatment. Non-inoculated and inoculated cherry tomatoes were irradiated with 2kJ/m2 UV-C and then packaged under two different modified atmosphere conditions (passive and active) and stored for 9d at 4 and 20°C. As controls, non-irradiated cherry tomatoes packaged in perforated film bags were stored. When the inoculated cherry tomatoes that were irradiated with UV-C were packaged under an active modified atmosphere (5.3% CO2+5.5% O2), the S. Typhimurium populations were significantly reduced during storage at 4°C compared to those of other treatments. Regarding the color, the combination of UV-C and active MAP delayed the change of Hunter b* and ΔE values in cherry tomatoes during storage at 4°C. Regardless of treatment and packaging method, the cherry tomatoes stored at 4°C exhibited a lower decrease of firmness compared to those stored at 20°C. After 9d of storage at 4 or 20°C, there were significant differences in lycopene content and weight loss depending on storage temperature or gas composition in packaging film. Therefore, these results suggest that the combination of UV-C irradiation and active MAP can improve the microbial safety and extend the shelf life of cherry tomatoes during cold storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3abags 3acherry tomatoes 3acold storage 3acolor 3afirmness 3afood packaging 3airradiation 3alycopene 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3aoxygen 3apackaging films 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 3aultraviolet radiation 3aweight loss 0aCherry tomatoes 0aMicrobiological safety 0aQuality 0aModified atmosphere packaging 0aShelf life1 aPark, Seok Ho1 aChoi, Seung Ryul1 aKim, Jin Se1 aChun, Ho Hyun0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2015 Mar., v. 3 p.19-30dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2014.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03261naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245007200161300001600233500002000249520181600269592002802085650002102113650002302134650001802157650001302175650001902188650002402207650001502231650001002246650002402256650001302280650002302293650002202316650002102338650001002359650002302369650002002392650001102412650001502423650002502438650001302463650001402476650001402490700001902504700001802523773009602541856007302637961001202710852000902722655001202731IND60523677020221120204504.0160623e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052367702DNAL7 a10.1890/12-1733.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtega, Yvette K.10aInvasive plant erodes local song diversity in a migratory passerine  ap. 458-465.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExotic plant invasions threaten ecosystems globally, but we still know little about the specific consequences for animals. Invasive plants can alter the quality of breeding habitat for songbirds, thereby impacting important demographic traits such as dispersal, philopatry, and age structure. These demographic effects may in turn alter song‐learning conditions to affect song structure and diversity. We studied Chipping Sparrows (Spizella passerina) breeding in six savannas that were either dominated by native vegetation or invaded by spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe), an exotic forb known to diminish food resources and reproductive success. Here, we report that the prevalence of older birds was relatively low in knapweed‐invaded habitat, where recruitment of yearlings compensated for diminished site fidelity to sustain territory abundance. In both habitat types, yearling males tended to adopt songs similar to their neighbors and match the songs of older birds rather than introducing new song types, a pattern seen in many songbird species. As a consequence, in invaded habitat where age structure was skewed away from older birds serving as potential song models, yearlings converged on fewer song types. Similarity of songs among individuals was significantly higher and the overall number of song types averaged nearly 20% lower in invaded relative to native habitat. Degradation of habitat quality generally impacts site fidelity and age ratios in migratory songbirds and hence may commonly alter song‐learning conditions. Associated shifts in song attributes known to influence reproductive success could in turn enforce demographic declines driven by habitat degradation. Local song structure may serve as an important indicator of habitat quality and population status for songbirds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentaurea stoebe 3aSpizella passerina 3aage structure 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3aforbs 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3amales 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory birds 3amodels 3aphilopatry 3areproductive success 3asavannas 3asongbirds 3ayearlings1 aBenson, Aubree1 aGreene, Erick0 tEcology.g2014 Feb., v. 95, no. 2 p.458-465dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-1733.13Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013000172300001400302520099200316592002801308650003001336650001101366650001101377650001801388650001101406650002001417650001501437650002001452650002201472650001501494650001201509650001801521650002301539650001701562650001101579650001201590650001201602653001801614653003001632653001701662653002301679700002401702700002101726773010201747856008501849852000901934655001201943IND60545979720221119191951.0160903e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054597972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2015.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrmpotić, Matea10aMussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) as a bio-indicator species in radioactivity monitoring of Eastern Adriatic coastal waters  ap. 47-51.  aCroatian Adriatic coastal waters are systematically monitored within the Mediterranean Mussel Watch Project using mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) as a bio-indicator species.

The model proposes that with increasing environmental stress, the factors predation, competition, and physical or physiological disturbance each predominate in turn in structuring food webs. Analyses of zooplankton communities along pH gradients do not support the Menge and Sutherland model. Patterns of species richness relationships with pH follow the general predictions of Menge and Sutherland (highest diversity of intermediate stress) in data from only 3 of 10 different studies that I examined. Predation and competition links in zooplankton food webs in acidified lakes near Sudbury, Ontario, maintain a constant ratio with acidification to pH 5.0, but at higher hydrogen ion concentrations food webs become highly variable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3acommunity structure 3afood webs 3ahydrogen 3alakes 3alittoral zone 3amodels 3apH 3apredation 3aprediction 3aspecies diversity 3azooplankton 3aOntario0 tEcology.g1992 June, v. 73, no. 3 p.903-909dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19401673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003100145245006600176300002000242520142500262592002801687650001601715650003401731650001101765650001901776650002901795650001901824650001101843650001401854650001301868650001401881650001101895650001401906650000901920650001901929700001901948700005801967700001602025700002102041700006002062773014302122856007902265852000902344655001202353IND60620172520181220000000.0181106e20180927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062017252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b037912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, M. E.q(Morris E.),10aManganese-Driven Carbon Oxidation at Oxic–Anoxic Interfaces  ap. 12349-12357.  aThe formation of reactive manganese (Mn) species is emerging as a key regulator of carbon oxidation rates, and thus CO₂ emissions, in soils and sediments. Many subsurface environments are characterized by steep oxygen gradients, forming oxic–anoxic interfaces that enable rapid redox cycling of Mn. Here, we examined the impact of Mn(II)ₐq oxidation along oxic–anoxic interfaces on carbon oxidation in soils using laboratory-based diffusion reactors. A combination of cyclic voltammetry, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray microprobe imaging revealed a tight coupling between Mn(II)ₐq oxidation and carbon oxidation at the oxic–anoxic interface. Specifically, zones of Mn(II)ₐq oxidation across the oxic–anoxic transition also exhibited the greatest lignin oxidation potential, carbon solubilization, and oxidation. Microprobe imaging further revealed that the generation of Mn(III)-dominated precipitates coincided with carbon oxidation. Combined, our findings demonstrate that biotic Mn(II)ₐq oxidation, specifically the formation of Mn(III) species, contributes to carbon oxidation along oxic–anoxic interfaces in soils and sediments. Our results suggest that we should regard carbon oxidation not merely as a function of molecular composition, which insufficiently predicts rates, but in relation to microenvironments favoring the formation of critically important oxidants such as Mn(III).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aimage analysis 3alignin 3amanganese 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asediments 3asoil 3asolubilization1 aNico, Peter S.1 aYing, Samantha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1247-25291 aRegier, Tom1 aThieme, Jürgen,1 aKeiluweit, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7061-83460 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Sept. 27, v. 52, no. 21 p.12349-12357dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b037913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002900146245010700175300001800282500001400300520080300314592002801117650002001145650002101165650001601186653001601202653001901218653001001237653000901247700003001256700003901286700003901325700003101364700003601395773015201431856008001583852000901663655001201672IND60710098320221119032530.0200908e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071009832DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.v0iOF.45552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez, Alma Gabriela12aA laboratory environment previously associated with a palatable diet can result in overfeeding in rats  ap. 1267-1270.  aNAL-light  aEnriched and non-enriched laboratory environments produce various biological and behavioral effects on laboratory animals.

Experiment 1 demonstrated that there are no significant differences in palatable food consumption irrespective of whether rats were exposed toenriched or nonenriched environments (P>0.05). In contrast, experiment 2 demonstrated that a combination of exposure to either of these environments and palatable food is enough to produce overfeeding in rats (P<0.05).

Meanwhile, the consolidation of cities has been a dominant trend in urban development and has led to the development and implementation of the green factor tool in cities such as Berlin, Melbourne, and Helsinki. In this study, elements of the green factor tool were monitored with laser-scanned and photogrammetrically derived point cloud datasets encompassing a yard in Espoo, Finland. The results show that with the support of 3D point clouds, it is possible to support the monitoring of the local green infrastructure, including elements of smaller size in green areas and yards. However, point clouds generated by distinct means have differing abilities in conveying information on green elements, and canopy covers, for example, might hinder these abilities. Additionally, some green factor elements are more promising for 3D measurement-based monitoring than others, such as those with clear geometrical form. The results encourage the involvement of 3D measuring technologies for monitoring local urban green infrastructure (UGI), also of small scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3adata collection 3agreen infrastructure 3aspatial data 3aurban areas 3aurban development 3aFinland1 aKauhanen, Heikki 1 aKeitaanniemi, Aino 1 aRantanen, Toni 1 aVirtanen, Juho-Pekka 1 aJulin, Arttu 1 aVaaja, Matti 1 aIngman, Matias 1 aAhlavuo, Marika 1 aHyyppä, Hannu 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 Nov. 11, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi101107623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005800155245014700213500001400360520174000374592002802114650001002142650002902152650001402181650001902195650003302214650002402247650001102271650001402282650001302296653002602309653001902335653002502354653002802379653001802407700001702425700002002442700006202462700002202524700001902546773009102565856009002656852000902746655001202755IND60709360920221120040921.0201209e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070936092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1282682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPujiwati, Arie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5875-209110aData-driven analysis for source apportionment and geochemical backgrounds establishment of toxic elements and REEs in the Tohoku region, Japan  aNAL-light  aThe Tohoku region of Japan is geologically diverse, with a long agriculture and mining history; however, little information about the origins and distribution mechanisms of elements in this region has been reported. This study aims to provide fundamental insights into the effects of geological features and anthropogenic activities on various elements, including toxic elements and rare-earth elements (REEs), in the Tohoku region. A geochemical database (2007, AIST) consisting of data for 53 elements in 485 river sediment samples from the region was used, and a data-driven method combining principal component analysis (PCA) was applied for analysis. GBs for numerous types of areas, including general areas (GGB), natural environments (NGB), high anthropogenic-influenced areas (AGB) and mineralised areas (MGB) were established; especially, MGB was newly proposed in this study to illuminate the role of ore deposits. Both PCA and GBs comparison results show that geological features (especially igneous rock distribution) were the most important factor affecting elemental distribution, rather than anthropogenic activities. In the PCA, the first principal component showed that REE resources were commonly associated with the distribution of granitic rocks and REE-bearing minerals. Anthropogenic contaminations from mining, urban, and anthropogenic areas played important roles as the origin of some toxic elements (e.g. Ni, Pb, Sb). Comparisons between these GBs effectively elucidated the enrichment of certain toxic elements (e.g., Hg, Sb) in ore deposit areas. This data-driven study not only clarified the origins of toxic elements, but also revealed the location of potential REE mineral resources in the Tohoku region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aanthropogenic activities 3adatabases 3amineralization 3aprincipal component analysis 3arare earth elements 3arivers 3asediments 3atoxicity 0aREE mineral resources 0aToxic elements 0aSource apportionment 0aGeochemical backgrounds 0aTohoku region1 aWang, Jiajie1 aNakamura, Kengo1 aKawabe, Yoshishige1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9951-94081 aWatanabe, Noriaki1 aKomai, Takeshi0 tChemosphere.g2021 Jan., v. 263 p.128268-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1282683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245011700166300001300283520136200296592002801658650000801686650001701694650001101711650001201722650002501734650001001759650001201769650000901781650001501790650001201805650001601817653001901833653001701852653000901869653001701878653002401895653002001919700002301939700001701962700001501979700001801994700001802012700001902030700002202049773012002071856007402191852000902265655001202274IND60152120120221122051651.0150529e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6015212012DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pct1492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayashi-Tsugane, Mika12aA Mutable Albino Allele in Rice Reveals that Formation of Thylakoid Membranes Requires the SNOW-WHITE LEAF1 Gene  ap. 3-15.  aActive DNA transposons are important tools for gene functional analysis. The endogenous non-autonomous transposon, nDart1-0 , in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is expected to generate various transposon-insertion mutants because nDart1-0 elements tend to insert into genic regions under natural growth conditions. We have developed a specific method (nDart1-0-iPCR) for efficient detection of nDart1-0 insertions and successfully identified the SNOW-WHITE LEAF1 (SWL1) gene in a variegated albino (swl1-v) mutant obtained from the nDart1 -promoted rice tagging line. The variegated albino phenotype was caused by insertion and excision of nDart1-0 in the 5′-untranslated region of the SWL1 gene predicted to encode an unknown protein with the N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide. SWL1 expression was detected in various rice tissues at different developmental stages. However, immunoblot analysis indicated that SWL1 protein accumulation was strictly regulated in a tissue-specific manner. In the swl1 mutant, formations of grana and stroma thylakoids and prolamellar bodies were inhibited. This study revealed that SWL1 is essential for the beginning of thylakoid membrane organization during chloroplast development. Furthermore, we provide a developmental perspective on the nDart1 -promoted tagging line to characterize unidentified gene functions in rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aOryza sativa 3aalbino 3aalleles 3adevelopmental stages 3agrana 3amutants 3arice 3athylakoids 3atissues 3atransposons 0aDNA transposon 0aGene tagging 0aiPCR 0aOryza sativa 0aPlastid development 0aVariegated leaf1 aTakahara, Hiroyuki1 aAhmed, Nisar1 aHimi, Eiko1 aTakagi, Kyoko1 aIida, Shigeru1 aTsugane, Kazuo1 aMaekawa, Masahiko0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2014 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.3-15dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pct1493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03716naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003000153245010800183520205500291592002802346650001502374650001802389650001202407650001802419650002102437650002502458650002002483650002902503650001402532650001802546650000702564650001702571650001502588650002302603650001802626650001502644650001802659650002602677650001502703651001802718651001902736653000802755653001102763653001502774653002002789653000902809653001102818700002102829700001702850700002502867700003002892773011902922856008803041852000903129655001203138IND60676616520221120101319.0200318e20200210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067661652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1355852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPschenyckyj, Catharine M.10aEffects of acidity on dissolved organic carbon in organic soil extracts, pore water and surface litters  aOver the past 30–40 years, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations have increased in soil solutions and surface waters in many acid-sensitive areas of Europe and North America. This has been linked to recovery from acidification in response to decreasing levels of atmospheric pollution. Evidence from radiocarbon dating suggests that DOC in surface waters is typically derived from recently photosynthesised organic matter such as plant litter and exudates, yet there is little information on the pH-sensitivity of organic matter solubility, or its decomposition, in litter layers and in different organic soils. Therefore the purpose of this study was to determine a) the sensitivity of DOC to acidity in different surface layers and soil types, in order to b) improve understanding of the key sources contributing to the increasing DOC trend. Such information is vital for understanding site specific characteristics contributing to inconsistencies in DOC release between catchments, and for improving predictions of carbon fluxes and budgets.Based on data collected at four established field pH-manipulation experiments in upland areas of the United Kingdom, we examined the sources, composition and acid-sensitivity of DOC export from the litter and organic soils. We found that litter generated nearly three times more DOC than the organic soils, consistent with radiocarbon evidence that recent plant inputs are a major source of DOC. Furthermore, litter derived DOC had lower specific ultraviolet light absorbance (SUVA) than organic soil DOC, suggesting greater biodegradability, and was not acid sensitive. In contrast, organic soil DOC concentrations were more strongly related to experimentally manipulated pH, implying that the mobility of this DOC may be subject to physicochemical rather than biotic controls. Our results suggest that physicochemically mediated controls on organic matter solubility may be a key driver behind the widely observed increases in surface water DOC in areas undergoing recovery from acidification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aacidification 3aacidity 3aair pollution 3abiodegradability 3acarbon radioisotopes 3adata collection 3adissolved organic carbon 3ahighlands 3aorganic soils 3apH 3aplant litter 3aprediction 3aradiocarbon dating 3asoil solution 3asolubility 3asurface water 3aultraviolet radiation 3awatersheds 3aNorth America 3aUnited Kingdom 0aDOC 0aLitter 0aSolubility 0aAcid deposition 0aPeat 0aPodzol1 aClark, Joanna M.1 aShaw, Liz J.1 aGriffiths, Robert I.1 aEvans, C.

Marking insects has been routinely carried out for over 100 years; however, there is no gold standard regarding the marking of specific disease-transmitting mosquitoes including Anopheles arabiensis, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The research presented offers a novel dusting technique and optimal dust colour and quantities, suitable for small-scale releases, such as mark-release-recapture studies. METHODS: We sought to establish a suitable dust colour and quantity for batches of 100 male An. arabiensis, that was visible both by eye and under UV light, long-lasting and did not negatively impact longevity. A set of lower dust weights were selected to conduct longevity experiments with both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus to underpin the optimal dust weight. A further study assessed the potential of marked male An. arabiensis to transfer their mark to undusted males and females. RESULTS: The longevity of male An. arabiensis marked with various dust colours was not significantly reduced when compared to unmarked controls. Furthermore, the chosen dust quantity (5 mg) did not negatively impact longevity (P = 0.717) and provided a long-lasting mark. Dust transfer was found to occur from marked An. arabiensis males to unmarked males and females when left in close proximity. However, this was only noticeable when examining individuals under a stereomicroscope and thus deemed negligible. Overall, male Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus displayed a greater sensitivity to dusting. Only the lowest dust weight (0.5 mg) did not significantly reduce longevity (P = 0.888) in Ae. aegypti, whilst the lowest two dust weights (0.5 and 0.75 mg) had no significant impact on longevity (P = 0.951 and 0.166, respectively) in Ae. albopictus. CONCLUSION: We have devised a fast, inexpensive and simple marking method and provided recommended dust quantities for several major species of disease-causing mosquitoes. The novel technique provides an evenly distributed, long-lasting mark which is non-detrimental. Our results will be useful for future MRR studies, prior to a major release campaign.  aPublisher supplied data  aRegular budgetcInternational Atomic Energy Agency  aTuition Fee BursarycUniversity of Liverpool  a682387cEuropean Research Council0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aAedes albopictus 3aAnopheles arabiensis 3acolor 3adust 3adusting 3afemales 3afluorescence 3ainsects 3alongevity 3amales 3amark release recapture 3amark-recapture studies 3aspecies abundance 3asterile insect technique 3aultraviolet radiation1 aKaiser, Maria1 aVenter, Nelius1 aVreysen, Marc J.

Here, a method is presented that utilises Confocal Raman microscopy as a tool for monitoring mineralisation within hydrogels. Synthetic hard–soft material interfaces were fabricated by apposing brushite (a sparingly soluble calcium phosphate) and biopolymer gel monoliths. The resulting structures were matured over a period of 28 days in phosphate buffered saline. Confocal Raman microscopy of the interfacial region showed the appearance of calcium phosphate salt deposits away from the original interface within the biopolymeric structures. Furthermore, the appearance of octacalcium phosphate and carbonated hydroxyapatite was observed in the region of the brushite cement opposing the biopolymer gel. This study describes not only a method for analysing these composite structures, but also suggests a method for recapitulating the graduated tissue structures that are often found in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman imaging 3abiopolymers 3acement 3ahydrogels 3ahydroxyapatite 3amineralization 3amonitoring 3atissues1 aBannerman, Alistair1 aGrover, Liam M.1 aMüller, Frank A.1 aBowen, James1 aPaxton, Jennifer Z.0 tBiomaterials science.g2013 Nov. 29, v. 2, no. 1 p.41-51dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3bm60102a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245010800162520135300270592002801623650002101651650001101672650001301683650001701696650002301713650001301736700002201749700002001771700001601791773016101807856007701968852000902045655001202054IND60757770620221119132727.0211125e20211111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075777062DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi101107652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchment, Zoe 12aA Multi-Level Analysis of Risky Streets and Neighbourhoods for Dissident Republican Violence in Belfast  aThis paper uses graph theoretical measures to analyse the relationship between street network usage, as well as other street- and area-level factors, and dissident Republican violence in Belfast. A multi-level statistical model is used. Specifically, we employ an observation-level random-effects (OLRE) Poisson regression and use variables at the street and area levels. Street- and area-level characteristics simultaneously influence where violent incidents occur. For every 10% change in the betweenness value of a street segment, the segment is expected to experience 1.32 times as many incidents. Police stations (IRR: 22.05), protestant churches (IRR: 6.19) and commercial premises (IRR: 1.44) on each street segment were also all found to significantly increase the expected number of attacks. At the small-area level, for every 10% change in the number of Catholic residents, the number of incidents is expected to be 4.45 times as many. The results indicate that along with other factors, the street network plays a role in shaping terrorist target selection. Streets that are more connected and more likely to be traversed will experience more incidents than those that are not. This has important practical implications for the policing of political violence in Northern Ireland generally and for shaping specific targeted interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorthern Ireland 3apolice 3apolitics 3aspatial data 3astatistical models 3aviolence1 aFrith, Michael J.1 aMorrison, John 1 aGill, Paul 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 Nov. 11, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi101107653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013100168300001600299520152400315592002801839650001701867650002201884650002101906650002401927650002501951650001601976650001401992650001502006650002202021650002402043650001602067650001902083650002502102650003102127650002202158650001202180650001102192700001802203773008102221856008502302852000902387655001202396IND60088445420221123035349.0141102e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008844542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiriake, Aya10aSome properties and cDNA cloning of proteinaceous toxins from two species of lionfish (Pterois antennata and Pterois volitans)  ap. 494-501.  aLionfish, members of the genera Pterois, Parapterois and Dendrochirus, are well known to be venomous, having venomous glandular tissues in dorsal, pelvic and anal spines. The lionfish toxins have been shown to cross-react with the stonefish toxins by neutralization tests using the commercial stonefish antivenom, although their chemical properties including structures have been little characterized. In this study, an antiserum against neoverrucotoxin, the stonefish Synanceia verrucosa toxin, was first raised in a guinea pig and used in immunoblotting and inhibition immunoblotting to confirm that two species of Pterois lionfish (P. antennata and P. volitans) contain a 75kDa protein (corresponding to the toxin subunit) cross-reacting with neoverrucotoxin. Then, the amino acid sequences of the P. antennata and P. volitans toxins were successfully determined by cDNA cloning using primers designed from the highly conserved sequences of the stonefish toxins. Notably, either α-subunits (699 amino acid residues) or β-subunits (698 amino acid residues) of the P. antennata and P. volitans toxins share as high as 99% sequence identity with each other. Furthermore, both α- and β-subunits of the lionfish toxins exhibit high sequence identity (70–80% identity) with each other and also with the β-subunits of the stonefish toxins. As reported for the stonefish toxins, the lionfish toxins also contain a B30.2/SPRY domain (comprising nearly 200 amino acid residues) in the C-terminal region of each subunit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendrochirus 3aPterois antennata 3aPterois volitans 3aSynanceia verrucosa 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3aantiserum 3aantivenoms 3acomplementary DNA 3aconserved sequences 3aguinea pigs 3aimmunoblotting 3aneutralization tests 3aphysicochemical properties 3asequence analysis 3atissues 3atoxins1 aShiomi, Kazuo0 tToxicon.g2011 Nov., v. 58, no. 6-7 p.494-501dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245014500158300002000303520146000323592002801783650002201811650002101833650001801854650001101872650002201883650003101905650002201936650000901958650001601967650001301983650001101996650001502007650001602022650001102038650001802049650001202067650001702079650001902096700001602115700001802131700001902149700002002168700005102188700001502239700001802254700005602272773014202328856007902470852000902549655001202558IND60620172820181220000000.0181106e20181009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062017282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b038822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Na10aVisible Light Driven Organic Pollutants Degradation with Hydrothermally Carbonized Sewage Sludge and Oxalate Via Molecular Oxygen Activation  ap. 12656-12666.  aConverting sewage sludge into functional environmental materials has become an attractive sewage sludge disposal route. In this study, we synthesize a sewage sludge-based material via a facile one-pot hydrothermal carbonization method and construct a visible light molecular oxygen activation system with hydrothermally carbonized sewage sludge (HTC-S) and oxalate to degrade various organic pollutants. It was found that iron species of HTC-S could chelate with oxalate to generate H₂O₂ via molecular oxygen activation under visible light, and also promote the H₂O₂ decomposition to produce •OH for the fast organic pollutants degradation. Taking sulfadimidine as the example, the apparent degradation rate of HTC-S/oxalate system was almost 5–20 times that of iron oxides/oxalate system. This outstanding degradation performance was attributed to the presence of iron-containing clay minerals in HTC-S, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction measurements and Mössbauer spectrometry. In the oxalate solution, these iron-containing clay minerals could be excited more easily than common iron oxides under visible light, because the silicon species strongly interacted with iron species in HTC-S to form Fe–O–Si bond, which lowered the excitation energy of Fe-oxalate complex. This work provides an alternative sewage sludge conversion pathway and also sheds light on the environmental remediation applications of sewage sludge-based materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3achemical bonding 3aclay minerals 3aenergy 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3airon oxides 3aoxalates 3aoxygen 3apollutants 3aremediation 3asewage 3asewage sludge 3asilicon 3aspectroscopy 3asulfamethazine1 aShang, Huan1 aTao, Shuangyi1 aWang, Xiaobing1 aZhan, Guangming1 aLi, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1135-83531 aAi, Zhihui1 aYang, Jiakuan1 aZhang, Lizhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6842-91670 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Oct. 09, v. 52, no. 21 p.12656-12666dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b038823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245006600176300001600242520116400258592002801422650001101450650001701461650001101478650000901489650001101498650001201509653001701521653001701538653001101555653002601566653002301592700002001615773010201635856008601737852000901823655001201832IND60585820420221122154724.0171114e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058582042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2015.05.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Ayman G.M.12aA solar desalination system: Exergetic performance assessment  ap. 379-392.  aThis paper presents a detailed thermodynamic assessment of a solar operated desalination system through exergy analysis. This system operates under vacuum condition and is equipped with an air-cooled condenser. The thermodynamic model of this system is developed, implemented in a MATLAB code and solved iteratively to investigate the influence of design and operational parameters. A spectrum of the thermodynamic model includes rates of energy streams, exergy streams, exergy destructions and improvement potentials. The outputs of thermodynamic model, namely improvement potential rates, are employed to explore enhancement of current design of the desalination system. The results of this investigation reveals that, an increase in absorptivity of basin base by 12% improves the productivity, energy and exergy efficiencies of the desalination system by 27%, 25% and 39%, respectively. In respect of improvement potential rates, the higher value is attributed to the basin base. It is shown that the reduction of heat losses from basin walls by 75% increases the productivity and exergy efficiency of the desalination system by 87% and 152%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adesalination 3aexergy 3aheat 3amodels 3astreams 0aSolar energy 0aDesalination 0aExergy 0aImprovement potential 0aDesign enhancement1 aDincer, Ibrahim0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 101 p.379-392dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.05.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245016100166300001600327520159100343592002801934650001501962650000901977650001301986650001601999653001902015653002002034653002302054653001402077653001402091653001702105700002202122700001602144773010202160856008602262852000902348655001202357IND60585820520221122154754.0171114e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058582052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2015.05.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgo, L.C.10aThree-dimensional analysis and numerical optimization of combined natural convection and radiation heat loss in solar cavity receiver with plate fins insert  ap. 757-766.  aThe numerical study and optimization of combined laminar natural convection and surface radiation heat transfer in solar cavity receiver with plate fins is presented in this paper. Minimizing heat loss in cavity receivers is seen as an effective way to enhance the thermal performance and the use of plate fins has been proposed as a low cost means to minimize heat loss. Firstly, the influence of operating temperature, emissivity of the surface, orientation and the geometric parameters on the total heat loss from the receiver was investigated. It was observed that convective heat loss is largely affected by the angle of inclination of the receiver, the presence of fins and the number of fins in the receiver. As for the radiation heat loss it was observed that it is mainly influenced by the properties of the cavity receiver surface. The radiation heat loss was found to be constant at all the angles of the receiver. Significant reduction in natural convection heat loss from the cavity receiver was accomplished by using the plate fins whereas radiation heat loss was marginally reduced by about 5%. Secondly, the optimization was conducted to obtain the optimal fin geometry and lastly, the overall thermal efficiency of the receiver was presented at different operating temperatures. The overall cavity efficiency marginally increased by approximately 2% with the insertion of fin plates although the convective heat loss was suppressed by about 20%. This is due to the fact that radiation heat loss dominates at high operating temperatures compared to convective heat loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconvection 3afins 3ageometry 3atemperature 0aParabolic dish 0aCavity receiver 0aNatural convection 0aRadiation 0aPlate fin 0aOptimization1 aBello-Ochende, T.1 aMeyer, J.P.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 101 p.757-766dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.05.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03918naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245009900175300001800274500002000292500001500312520194700327592002802274650002702302650002202329650002402351650002402375650001802399650002202417650001802439650002102457650002302478650002502501650002402526650001902550650001902569650001702588650001402605650001102619650002602630650001202656650001402668650002402682650004702706650002202753650002902775650000902804650002202813650002202835651001302857651001302870653002102883653001702904653001902921700002302940700002202963700002302985700002103008773013203029852000903161856007403170655001203244IND4418175420221120202946.0180321e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441817542DNAL7 a192638942pmid7 a10.1890/07-1743.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZak, Donald R.10aSimulated atmospheric no3− deposition increases soil organic matter by slowing decomposition  ap. 2016-2027.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aPresently, there is uncertainty regarding the degree to which anthropogenic N deposition will foster C storage in the N‐limited forests of the Northern Hemisphere, ecosystems which are globally important sinks for anthropogenic CO₂. We constructed organic matter and N budgets for replicate northern hardwood stands (n = 4) that have received ambient (0.7–1.2 g N·m⁻²·yr⁻¹) and experimental NO₃⁻ deposition (ambient plus 3 g NO₃⁻‐N·m⁻²·yr⁻¹) for a decade; we also traced the flow of a ¹⁵NO₃⁻ pulse over a six‐year period. Experimental NO₃⁻ deposition had no effect on organic matter or N stored in the standing forest overstory, but it did significantly increase the N concentration (+19%) and N content (+24%) of canopy leaves. In contrast, a decade of experimental NO₃⁻ deposition significantly increased amounts of organic matter (+12%) and N (+9%) in forest floor and mineral soil, despite no increase in detritus production. A greater forest floor (Oe/a) mass under experimental NO₃⁻ deposition resulted from slower decomposition, which is consistent with previously reported declines in lignolytic activity by microbial communities exposed to experimental NO₃⁻ deposition. Tracing ¹⁵NO₃⁻ revealed that N accumulated in soil organic matter by first flowing through soil microorganisms and plants, and that the shedding of ¹⁵N‐labeled leaf litter enriched soil organic matter over a six‐year duration. Our results demonstrate that atmospheric NO₃⁻ deposition exerts a direct and negative effect on microbial activity in this forest ecosystem, slowing the decomposition of aboveground litter and leading to the accumulation of forest floor and soil organic matter. To the best of our knowledge, this mechanism is not represented in the majority of simulation models predicting the influence of anthropogenic N deposition on ecosystem C storage in northern forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric deposition 3asimulation models 3anitrogen metabolism 3asoil organic carbon 3amineral soils 3atemperate forests 3aforest litter 3anitrate nitrogen 3amicrobial activity 3acarbon sequestration 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil fertility 3abiodegradation 3aforest soils 3aoverstory 3aleaves 2aAtmospherexchemistry 2aBiomass 2aEcosystem 2aNitratesxchemistry 2aNitrogenxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aNitrogen Isotopes 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aSoil 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTreesxmetabolism 3aMichigan 0aMichigan 0anitrogen content 0asoil biology 0asoil chemistry1 aHolmes, William E.1 aBurton, Andrew J.1 aPregitzer, Kurt S.1 aTalhelm, Alan F.0 tEcological applications.g2008 Dec., v. 18, no. 8 p.2016-2027dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-1743.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01013naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003000141245009200171300001600263520018200279592002800461650001300489650001000502650001300512700001900525773011900544856007500663852000900738655001200747IND60643733220221116234913.0190513e20141121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064373322DNAL7 a10.5586/am.1978.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudnicka-Jezierska, Wanda10aAttempts to eliminate Oidiodendron minus Barron from the substrate of Agaricus cultures  ap. 119-133.  aAmong fungi which destroy Agaricus mycelium Oidiodendron maius Barron turned out to be most dangerous.

The abnormalities of content and activity in specific enzymes are usually associated with the occurrence and the development of major diseases. Correspondingly, fluorescent bioprobes with distinctive sensing mechanisms and different functionalities have attracted growing attention as convenient tools for optical probing and monitoring the activity of enzymes. Ideally and excitedly, the recently emerged luminogens with an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) feature could perfectly overcome the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect of conventional bioprobes. Based on the fantastic characteristics of AIE luminogens (AIEgens), specific enzyme bioprobes have been designed through integration with recognition units, demonstrating many advantages including low background interference, a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and superior photostability. In this review, by presenting some typical examples, we summarize the working principle and structural design of specific AIEgen-based bioprobes that are triggered by enzymes and discuss their great potential in biomedical applications, with the aim to promote the future research of fluorescent bioprobes involving enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzymes 3afluorescent dyes 3amaterials science 3amonitoring 3aphotostability 0aaggregation-induced emission (AIE) 0aenzymes 0abioprobes 0afluorescence 0abiomarkers 0aturn-on/light-up1 aLi, Ya1 aLi, Qianqian1 aLi, Zhen1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1512-13450 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Dec. 12, v. 10, no. 15 p.12278-12294dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b149433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03814naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009200175300001800267520212000285592002802405650001702433650001802450650001502468650001702483650001102500650002002511650002402531650002602555650001102581650001802592650000902610650001702619650001502636650002302651650001102674650002302685650001902708650002302727650002202750650001202772650001102784650002202795650001402817651001502831700002202846700002502868700002502893700002002918700002202938700001802960700002102978773013202999856008403131852000903215655001203224IND60123425620221122212005.0150325e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012342562DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2013.8249342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaldwell, Colleen A.10aPrescribed-Fire Effects on an Aquatic Community of a Southwest Montane Grassland System  ap. 1049-1062.  aThe use of prescription fire has long been recognized as a reliable management tool to suppress vegetative succession processes and to reduce fuel loading to prevent catastrophic wildfires, but very little attention has been paid to the effects on aquatic systems. A late-fall prescribed burn was implemented to characterize effects on an aquatic community within a montane grassland system in north-central New Mexico. The fire treatment was consistent with protocols of a managed burn except that the fire was allowed to burn through the riparian area to the treatment stream to replicate natural fire behavior. In addition to summer and fall preburn assessment of the treatment and reference stream, we characterized immediate postfire effects (within a week for macroinvertebrates and within 6 months for fish) and seasonal effects over a 2-year period. Responses within the treatment stream were compared with an unburned reference stream adjacent to the prescription burn. During the burn, the diel range in air temperature increased by 5°C while diel range in water temperature did not change. Carbon–nitrogen ratios did not differ between treatment and reference streams, indicating the contribution of ash from the surrounding grassland was negligible. Although total taxa and species richness of aquatic macroinvertebrates were not altered, qualitative indices revealed departure from preburn condition due to loss of sensitive taxa (mayflies [order Ephemeroptera] and stoneflies [order Plecoptera]) and an increase in tolerant taxa (midges [order Chironomidae]) following the burn. Within 1 year of the burn, these attributes returned to preburn conditions. The density and recruitment of adult Brown Trout Salmo trutta did not differ between pre- and postburn collections, nor did fish condition differ. Fire is rarely truly replicated within a given study. Although our study represents one replication, the results will inform managers about the importance in timing (seasonality) of prescription burn and anticipated effects on aquatic communities.

Using a life cycle assessment methodology we analyze the impacts of the construction, disposal/end of life, and usage of each of the systems. Pumped hydro and compressed air storage are studied as mechanical storage, and advanced lead acid, sodium sulfur, lithium-ion and nickel–sodium-chloride batteries are addressed as electrochemical storage systems. Hydrogen production from electrolysis and subsequent usage in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell are also analyzed. The selected electricity storage systems mimic real world installations in terms of capacity, power rating, life time, technology and application. The functional unit is one kWh of energy delivered back to the grid, from the storage system. The environmental impacts assessed are climate change, human toxicity, particulate matter formation, and fossil resource depletion. Different electricity mixes are used in order to exemplify scenarios where the selected technologies meet specific applications. Results indicate that the performance of the storage systems is tied to the electricity feedstocks used during use stage. Renewable energy sources have lower impacts throughout the use stage of the storage technologies. Using the Belgium electricity mix of 2011 as benchmark, the sodium sulfur battery is shown to be the best performer for all the impacts analyzed. Pumped hydro storage follows in second place. Regarding infrastructure and end of life, results indicate that battery systems have higher impacts than mechanical ones because of lower number of cycles and life time energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abatteries 3aclimate change 3aelectricity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3afeedstocks 3afuel cells 3ahumans 3ahydrogen production 3ainfrastructure 3alead 3alife cycle assessment 3amineral resources 3aparticulates 3arenewable energy sources 3asodium 3astorage 3asulfur 3atoxicity 3aBelgium 0aLCA 0aEnergy storage 0aDistribution network 0aElectricity generation 0aEnvironmental impact1 aMessagie, M.1 aMertens, J.1 aLaget, H.1 aCoosemans, T.1 aVan Mierlo, J.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 101 p.326-335dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.05.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245015100171300001100322520213900333592002802472596003802500650001102538650001402549650001102563650001702574650001402591650001202605650002602617650000902643650001602652650001402668650002702682650002302709650001302732650001502745651001402760651004002774700002102814700001802835700002302853700002402876700002402900700002002924773010502944856008303049852000903132655001203141IND60688720520221120214954.0210522e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068872052DNAL7 a10.1186/s40317-020-00199-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovak, Ashleigh J.10aInferring residency and movement patterns of horse-eye jack Caranx latus in relation to a Caribbean marine protected area acoustic telemetry array  ap. 12.  aBACKGROUND: Information regarding the movement ecology of horse-eye jack Caranx latus throughout the Caribbean is limited despite their prevalence. Passive acoustic telemetry was used to infer movement patterns of seven adult C. latus within Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), a no-take marine protected area (MPA) northeast of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition, a preliminary exploration of detections recorded outside of BIRNM was used to gain knowledge of the potential for larger scale movements. Ascertaining long-term movement patterns, including residency, mobility, and identifying core activity spaces can play a considerable role in how MPAs, like BIRNM, are adapted to meet the needs of mobile species. RESULTS: High residency index values were observed for individual C. latus within the BIRNM array (mean ± SE: 0.913 ± 0.04, range 0.75–1.0) across the 17 months monitored. Most fish were also detected on receivers located outside BIRNM. An observed to expected detection ratio revealed that despite high residency, only 9.6% of expected transmissions were detected based on the average tag transmission rate. Network analysis revealed high individual connectivity with many of the receivers inside BIRNM and a large number of core use receivers (mean: 10.7, range 6–14) within individual networks. CONCLUSIONS: Most C. latus were present in BIRNM at least twice per day, but were overall detected below the expected rates, demonstrating mobility, large core activity spaces and wide use of the acoustic array inside BIRNM and greater St. Croix shelf. How residency is inferred from acoustic telemetry detections, and interpreted for species with variable mobility, has important considerations for spatial management planning and telemetry analyses. For MPA development to meet the spatial requirements of species with mixed resident–mobile spatial ecology, detailed long-term movement data are required. Assessing residency in MPAs using acoustic telemetry should be formalized and carefully interpreted based on specific species, environmental conditions, and array configuration.  aPublisher supplied data  aR-101-2-14cNational Park Service 3aCaranx 3aacoustics 3aadults 3abiotelemetry 3adetection 3aecology 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3ainformation 3aknowledge 3amarine protected areas 3anational monuments 3aplanning 3aprevalence 3aCaribbean 3aVirgin Islands of the United States1 aBecker, Sarah L.1 aFinn, John T.1 aDanylchuk, Andy J.1 aPollock, Clayton G.1 aHillis-Starr, Zandy1 aJordaan, Adrian0 tAnimal biotelemetry.g2020 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.12-12dBioMed CentralwJournal:21547x2050-33857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40317-020-00199-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009000175300001600265520196200281592002802243650002002271650002602291650001902317650000902336650001802345650000802363650001402371650001402385650003502399650000902434650001102443650002002454650001002474651001102484653000902495653000702504653000802511653001002519653000802529653002402537653001202561653002702573653002202600653001902622700002302641700002502664700002002689700002102709700001802730700002202748773008902770856008402859852000902943655001202952IND60544836920221119041910.0160901e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054483692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2014.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdam-Poupart, Ariane10aSummer outdoor temperature and occupational heat-related illnesses in Quebec (Canada)  ap. 339-344.  aPredicted rise in global mean temperature and intensification of heat waves associated with climate change present an increasing challenge for occupational health and safety. Although important scientific knowledge has been gathered on the health effects of heat, very few studies have focused on quantifying the association between outdoor heat and mortality or morbidity among workers.To quantify the association between occupational heat-related illnesses and exposure to summer outdoor temperatures.We modeled 259 heat-related illnesses compensated by the Workers׳ Compensation Board of Quebec between May and September, from 1998 to 2010, with maximum daily summer outdoor temperatures in 16 health regions of Quebec (Canada) using generalized linear models with negative binomial distributions, and estimated the pooled effect sizes for all regions combined, by sex and age groups, and for different time lags with random-effect models for meta-analyses.The mean daily compensation count was 0.13 for all regions of Quebec combined. The relationship between daily counts of compensations and maximum daily temperatures was log-linear; the pooled incidence rate ratio (IRR) of daily heat-related compensations per 1°C increase in daily maximum temperatures was 1.419 (95% CI 1.326 to 1.520). Associations were similar for men and women and by age groups. Increases in daily maximum temperatures at lags 1 and 2 and for two and three-day lag averages were also associated with increases in daily counts of compensations (IRRs of 1.206 to 1.471 for every 1°C increase in temperature).This study is the first to quantify the association between occupational heat-related illnesses and exposure to summer temperatures in Canada. The model (risk function) developed in this study could be useful to improve the assessment of future impacts of predicted summer outdoor temperatures on workers and vulnerable groups, particularly in colder temperate zones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3abinomial distribution 3aclimate change 3aheat 3alinear models 3amen 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aoccupational health and safety 3arisk 3asummer 3atemperate zones 3awomen 3aQuebec 0aCCDO 0aCI 0aIRR 0aNAICS 0aWCB 0aAmbient temperature 0aWorkers 0aHeat-related illnesses 0aCompensation data 0aClimate change1 aSmargiassi, Audrey1 aBusque, Marc-Antoine1 aDuguay, Patrice1 aFournier, Michel1 aZayed, Joseph1 aLabrèche, France0 tEnvironmental Research.g2014 Oct., v. 134 p.339-344dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2014.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013400164300001800298520098400316592002801300650002201328650001301350650001301363650002101376650001701397650001901414650001101433650001501444650001101459650001101470650001601481650001101497650001701508650001201525700001601537700002201553700002101575773009801596856008101694852000901775655001201784IND60439018020221122221427.0151024e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043901802DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-003-0287-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedeiros, R.10aBinding of the hemagglutinin from human or equine influenza H3 viruses to the receptor is altered by substitutions at residue 193  ap. 1663-1671.  aInteractions of the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza viruses with sialic acids (SA) are important for host range restriction. Most human H3s have a Ser193, while avian and equine H3s usually have an Asn or a Lys, respectively. To investigate the role of residue 193 in the recognition of SA, substitutions were introduced by mutagenesis within a human H3 and an equine H3. Hemadsorption assays performed on COS-1 cells expressing wt or mutated HAs, showed that a K193S substitution in the context of an equine H3 decreased its ability to bind several animal erythrocytes. Using de- and then α2,3 or α2,6 re-sialylated chicken erythrocytes we showed that for both human and equine H3s, substitution of a Serine by positively-charged Arginine or Lysine at position 193 increased binding to its preferred receptor, SAα2,6Gal and SAα2,3Gal, respectively. Moreover, when combined with the L194I substitution, the S193R substitution induced binding of the human H3 to NeuAcα2,3Gal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aarginine 3achickens 3aequine influenza 3aerythrocytes 3ahemagglutinins 3ahorses 3ahost range 3ahumans 3alysine 3amutagenesis 3aserine 3asialic acids 3aviruses1 aNaffakh, N.1 aManuguerra, J.-C.1 avan der Werf, S.0 tArchives of virology.g2004 Aug., v. 149, no. 8 p.1663-1671dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-003-0287-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245012800203300002000331520134300351592002801694650002201722650001301744650002101757650000901778650002101787650002101808650002601829650002901855650001601884650001301900650002501913650001801938650000901956650001001965651001001975651001201985700001301997700001702010700001402027700001302041700001802054700003002072773014202102856007902244852000902323655001202332IND60620173020221119222841.0181106e20181017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062017302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b039312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xiaotong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3831-881810aNitrous Oxide Emissions Increase Exponentially When Optimum Nitrogen Fertilizer Rates Are Exceeded in the North China Plain  ap. 12504-12513.  aThe IPCC assume a linear relationship between nitrogen (N) application rate and nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions in inventory reporting, however, a growing number of studies show a nonlinear relationship under specific soil-climatic conditions. In the North China plain, a global hotspot of N₂O emissions, covering a land as large as Germany, the correlation between N rate and N₂O emissions remains unclear. We have therefore specifically investigated the N₂O response to N applications by conducting field experiments with five N rates, and high-frequency measurements of N₂O emissions across contrasting climatic years. Our results showed that cumulative and yield-scaled N₂O emissions both increased exponentially as N applications were raised above the optimum rate in maize (Zea mays L.). In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) there was a corresponding quadratic increase in N₂O emissions with the magnitude of the response in 2012–2013 distinctly larger than that in 2013–2014 owing to the effects of extreme snowfall. Existing empirical models (including the IPCC approach) of the N₂O response to N rate have overestimated N₂O emissions in the North China plain, even at high N rates. Our study therefore provides a new and robust analysis of the effects of fertilizer rate and climatic conditions on N₂O emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3aclimatic factors 3acorn 3aempirical models 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ainventories 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3asnow 3awheat 3aChina 3aGermany1 aLiu, Min1 aJu, Xiaotang1 aGao, Bing1 aSu, Fang1 aChen, Xinping1 aRees, R.

The experiment was arranged in factorial with completely randomized design and four replications under greenhouse conditions. RESULTS: Application of 5 mg L ⁻¹ Cd or the lead levels (15 and 30 mg L ⁻¹) significantly reduced new shoot growth, plant leaf area, SPAD value, leaf water conductance and leaf photosynthesis, whereas significant increase in number of chlorotic and necrotic leaves, leaf transpiration rate, leaf proline and soluble sugars was observed. Higher reduction in new shoot growth and leaf water conductance and higher increase in leaf soluble sugars and proline was observed over the interaction of 5 mg L ⁻¹ Cd and 30 mg L ⁻¹ Pb. The highest soluble sugars and proline were in Pb30Cd5 (a3b2) treatment. Leaf Pb or Cd concentration was increased following their treatment. Application of cadmium significantly reduced leaf Pb, and similarly leaf Cd was significantly reduced by application of lead at both levels compared to untreated plants. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the hackberry growth was influenced by positive and negative interactions of Pb and Cd applied in irrigation water. The extent of growth reduction indicates that hackberry represents a relatively tolerant ornamental tree to high Pb and Cd levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeltis australis 3acadmium 3agreenhouse production 3agrowth retardation 3airrigation water 3alead 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aornamental trees 3aphotosynthesis 3aproline 3aseedlings 3asugars 3atranspiration1 aRezaei Nejad, Abdolhossein1 aKafi, Mohsen1 aSouri, Mohammad Kazem1 aShahbazi, Karim0 tChemical and biological technologies in agriculture.g2020 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.9-9dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:27327x2196-56417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40538-019-0173-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01625naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245011200161300001600273520050800289592002800797650002600825650002400851650001600875650003100891650001700922650002800939650001400967650001300981650001300994650002401007650001401031650001501045773011901060856007501179852000901254655001201263IND60643733620221116234942.0190513e20141121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064373362DNAL7 a10.5586/am.1978.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGładoch, Maria12aA contribution to an investigation of nitrogen metabolism of some thermophilic and thermophilous soil fungi  ap. 157-161.  aThe author has examined the assimilation of nitrogen on the basis of different sources of nitrogen and the secretion of nitrite to the substrate by some soil fungi.

In Ethiopia, even though individuals are dually affected by both malnutrition and HIV, there is no a nationwide study showing the proportion of malnutrition among HIV-positive adults. Consequently, this review addressed the pooled burden of undernutrition among HIV-positive adults in Ethiopia. METHODS: We searched for potentially relevant studies through manual and electronic searches. An electronic search was carried out using the database of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Google for gray literature and reference lists of previous studies. A standardized data extraction checklist was used to extract the data from each original study. STATA Version 13 statistical software was used for our analysis. Descriptive summaries were presented in tables, and the quantitative result was presented in a forest plot. Heterogeneity within the included studies was examined using the Cochrane Q test statistics and I² test. Finally, a random-effects meta-analysis model was computed to estimate the pooled proportion of undernutrition among HIV-positive adults. RESULTS: After reviewing 418 studies, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Findings from 15 studies revealed that the pooled percentage of undernutrition among HIV-positive adults in Ethiopia was 26% (95% CI: 22, 30%). The highest percentage of undernutrition (46.8%) was reported from Jimma University specialized hospital, whereas the lowest proportion of undernutrition (12.3%) was reported from Dilla Hospital. The subgroup analyses of this study also indicated that the percentage of undernourishment among HIV-positive adults is slightly higher in the Northern and Central parts of Ethiopia (27.5%) as compared to the Southern parts of Ethiopia (25%). CONCLUSION: This study noted that undernutrition among HIV-positive adults in Ethiopia was quite common. This study also revealed that undernutrition is more common among HIV-positive adults with advanced disease stage, anemia, diarrhea, CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm³, and living in rural areas. Based on our findings, we suggested that all HIV-positive adults should be assessed for nutritional status at the time of ART commencement.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aadults 3aanemia 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3adiarrhea 3ahospitals 3amalnutrition 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3anutritional status 3arural areas 3astatistics 3aEthiopia1 aKibret, Getiye Dejenu1 aPetrucka, Pammla1 aTesema, Cheru1 aMoges, Nurilign Abebe1 aWagnew, Fasil1 aAsmare, Getnet1 aKumera, Gemechu1 aBitew, Zebenay Workneh1 aKetema, Daniel Bekele1 aTiruneh, Tesfahun1 aMelkamu, Mamaru Wubale1 aHibstie, Yitbarek Tenaw1 aTemesgen, Belisty1 aEshetie, Setegn0 tBMC nutrition.g2020 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.10-10dBioMed CentralwJournal:27315x2055-09287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40795-020-00334-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245008300168300002000251520136300271592002801634650001801662650001101680650001101691650001801702650001701720650001901737650001601756650002501772650001801797650001201815650001601827651001601843700001901859700001401878700001301892700001801905700002001923700005801943773014202001856007902143852000902222655001202231IND60620173220221119223021.0181106e20181008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062017322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b040322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Young Kyoung10aHorizontal and Vertical Distribution of Microplastics in Korean Coastal Waters  ap. 12188-12197.  aThis is the first survey to investigate the vertical distribution and composition of microplastics >20 μm at the surface (0–0.2 m; bulk sample) and in the water column (3–58 m depth; pump) of six semi-enclosed bays and two nearshore areas of South Korea. The average microplastic abundance of 41 stations at all sampling depths was 871 particles/m³, and the microplastic abundance near urban areas (1051 particles/m³) was significantly higher than that near rural areas (560 particles/m³). Although the average microplastic abundances in the midcolumn (423 particles/m³) and bottom water (394 particles/m³) were approximately 4 times lower than that of surface water (1736 particles/m³), microplastics prevailed throughout the water column in concentrations of 10–2000 particles/m³. The average sizes of fragment and fiber type microplastics were 197 and 752 μm, respectively. Although the polymer composition differed by depth depending on the particle size and density, polypropylene and polyethylene predominated throughout the water column regardless of their low density and particle size. Finally, the middle and bottom water samples contained higher abundances of microplastics than predicted by a model based on physical mixing, indicating that biological interactions also influence the downward movement of low-density microplastics.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicroplastics 3amixing 3amodels 3aparticle size 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3arural areas 3aspatial distribution 3asurface water 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aSouth Korea1 aHong, Sang Hee1 aEo, Soeun1 aJang, Mi1 aHan, Gi Myung1 aIsobe, Atsuhiko1 aShim, Won Joon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9591-85640 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Oct. 08, v. 52, no. 21 p.12188-12197dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b040323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011400156300001400270520133800284592002801622650001601650650002101666650001301687650001001700650001201710650002201722650001301744650002001757650001301777650001501790650002101805650001801826650001001844650001601854650001901870650002001889650001301909653002201922653001201944653002101956653003101977653001902008653003502027700001502062700001602077700001902093700001702112773012102129856007402250852000902324655001202333IND60152122720221122042707.0150529e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6015212272DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pct1592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Junhui10aGmFNSII-Controlled Soybean Flavone Metabolism Responds to Abiotic Stresses and Regulates Plant Salt Tolerance  ap. 74-86.  aFlavones, a major group of flavonoids in most plant tissues, play multiple roles in plant–environment interactions. In our study, the expression of the two soybean flavone synthase genes, GmFNSII-1 and GmFNSII-2 , was significantly increased by methyl jasmonate (MeJA), glucose, mannitol and NaCl treatment, which were also found to increase flavone aglycone accumulation in Glycine max (L.) Merrill. In the GmFNSII-1 promoter, a specific CGTCA motif in the region (−979 bp to −806 bp) involved in the MeJA response was identified. Promoter deletion analysis of GmFNSII-2 revealed the presence of osmotic-responsive (−1,143 bp to −767 bp) and glucose-repressive sequence elements (−767 bp to −475 bp), which strongly supported the hypothesis that glucose induces soybean flavone production by acting as both an osmotic factor and a sugar signaling molecule simultaneously. Silencing of the GmFNSII gene clearly reduced the production of flavone aglycones (apigenin, luteolin and 7,4′-dihydroxyflavone) in hairy roots. The GmFNSII -RNAi (RNA interference) roots that had a reduced level of flavones accompanied by more malondialdehyde and H ₂O ₂ accumulation were more sensitive to salt stress compared with those of the control, and we concluded that flavones, as antioxidants, are associated with salt tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aRNA interference 3aapigenin 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aluteolin 3amalondialdehyde 3amannitol 3ametabolism 3amethyl jasmonate 3aplant tissues 3aroots 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium chloride 3asoybeans 0aFlavone aglycones 0aGlucose 0aMethyl jasmonate 0aPromoter deletion analysis 0aSalt tolerance 0aSoybean flavone synthase genes1 aWang, Biao1 aJiang, Yina1 aCheng, Linjing1 aWu, Tianlong0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2014 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.74-86dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pct1593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009300166300001600259520199100275592002802266650001302294650002502307650001202332650001202344650002202356650001602378650000902394650002602403650002302429650001802452650001702470650001602487650002102503650001802524650000902542650001102551653002602562653001802588653000902606653001702615653002402632700002302656773010802679856008402787852000902871655001202880IND60619553020221120021551.0210114e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061955302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2018.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhaleghi, M.10aBiologic improvement of a sandy soil using single and mixed cultures: A comparison study  ap. 112-119.  aBecause of global environmental problems due to desert expansion and dust storms as well as constructional requirements, looking for more efficient and comprehensive methods to stabilize dune sands and weak grounds seems to be an essential necessity. MICP (Microbial-induced CaCO₃ precipitation) is an innovative technique in which bacterial activities within soil mass are harnessed to modify the physical and mechanical properties of soils. This method produces calcium carbonate precipitation in the soil pores by fracturing urea in the presence of calcium ions. An important factor in achieving uniform calcite deposition (and hence consistent enhancement of geotechnical properties) throughout the treated soil mass is the protocol adopted for injecting the reagents of ureolytic bacteria, urea and calcium. In this research study, an urease microorganism (i.e. B. pasteurii) was prepared at single and mixed cultures (with B. subtilis) in the laboratory and injected into dune sand samples. After required and appropriate curing time, the samples were subjected under unconfined compression, direct shear and falling-head permeability tests. The test results showed significant strength improvement and reduction of permeability of the treated samples in comparison with those of the untreated soil, while the performance of the mixed culture was much better than that of the single culture in the stabilization outcome. More specifically, the unconfined strength of the soil samples treated with the mixed culture was 1.2 times that of samples treated with the single culture. The amount of permeability reduction in the mixed medium was also 34% more than that obtained with the single culture. The research results verified the capability of the application of biological treatment, particularly with the mixed culture, on the dune sand which may be regarded as a potential technique to control desert expansion, and dust storms through the stabilization of the weak grounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiological treatment 3acalcite 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3adust storms 3aions 3amechanical properties 3amicrobial activity 3amixed culture 3apermeability 3asandy soils 3asoil pore system 3asoil sampling 3aurea 3aurease 0aCalcite precipitation 0aMixed culture 0aSand 0aPermeability 0aUnconfined strength1 aRowshanzamir, M.A.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2019 Mar., v. 186 p.112-119dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2018.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245011400167300001800281500001400299520096500313592002801278650001901306650002001325650002401345650001001369650002501379650001401404650001001418650001201428651001001440653001401450653001301464653001501477653002101492653000801513653001401521700002201535700001801557700002201575700001801597700002501615700001501640700002601655700002501681700002601706700002501732773015201757856007701909852000901986655001201995IND60710099520221119032527.0200908e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071009952DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.

The disease was diagnosed based on clinical signs, lesions, electron microscopy and by molecular techniques. The virus was identified by PCR amplification targeting the viral late transcription factor-3 (VLTF-3) gene of swinepox virus. The VLTF-3 gene was cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis based on VLTF-3 gene sequence showed that the Swinepox viruses identified in these outbreaks were clustered along with the other Swinepox isolates reported across the globe and were distinctly separated from the other members of the poxviridae family. The north-eastern states of India, being a hub for pig husbandry, are the home for over a quarter of all India's pig population. Till now swinepox was not reportedfrom this part of India. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report on detection and characterization of swinepox from the north-eastern part of India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSwinepox virus 3aanimal research 3aelectron microscopy 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aswine 3aviruses 3aIndia 0aDiagnosis 0aElectron 0amicroscopy 0aNorth-east India 0aPig 0aVLTF gene1 aBorah, Biswajyoti1 aBora, Mousumi1 aKakati, Parikshit1 aNehar, Samsun1 aDutta, Lakshya Jyoti1 aMech, Puja1 aBarman, Nagendra Nath1 aVenkatesan, Gnanavel1 aReddy, G.B Manjunatha1 aDas, Sailendra Kumar0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2018 Sept., v. 52, no. 9 p.1337-1342dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.

Using a chronosequence of 57 stands ranging from 11 to 438 yr in age, we examined changes in forest structure and composition with complementary PCA and DCA ordination techniques. To determine stand ages and timing of tree recruitment, approximately 1800 trees were aged. Most early successional forests were dominated by Pinus contorta, which established rapidly following fire. Abies lasiocarpa and Picea glauca ××engelmannii were also able to establish quickly, but continued to establish throughout the sere. Few Pinus contorta survived beyond 200 yr, resulting in major changes in forest structure. In some stands P. contorta never established, which led to considerable variation among stands less than 200 yr old. The oldest forests converged on dominance by Abies lasiocarpa. Vascular plant diversity decreased during succession whereas canopy structure became more complex as gap dynamics developed. Although these sub-boreal forests contain few tree species, successional changes were pronounced, with structure changing more than composition across the chronosequence.Abbreviations: CWD == Coarse Woody Debris; DCA == Detrended Correspondence Analysis; DBH == Diameter at Breast Height; PCA == Principal Component Analysis.Nomenclature: Douglas et al.

An important statistical problem associated with tumor classification is the identification of new tumor classes using gene-expression profiles. Two essential aspects of this clustering problem are: to estimate the number of clusters, if any, in a dataset; and to allocate tumor samples to these clusters, and assess the confidence of cluster assignments for individual samples. Here we address the first of these problems. RESULTS: We have developed a new prediction-based resampling method, Clest, to estimate the number of clusters in a dataset. The performance of the new and existing methods were compared using simulated data and gene-expression data from four recently published cancer microarray studies. Clest was generally found to be more accurate and robust than the six existing methods considered in the study. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on prediction accuracy in conjunction with resampling produces accurate and robust estimates of the number of clusters.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomedical research 3adata collection 3agene expression 3amicroarray technology 3aneoplasms 3aprediction1 aFridlyand, Jane0 tGenome biology.g2002 June, v. 3, no. 7 p.455-455dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2002-3-7-research00363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03477naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245011300199300001600312506007600328520187800404592002802282506003702310650002102347650001702368650001302385650001302398650001602411650001202427650001302439650001402452650000902466650002102475650001102496650002302507650001202530650001402542700001702556700001902573700001602592700001502608700001802623700001402641700002002655700001702675700001802692700002402710773010502734856007502839852000902914655001202923IND60532793820221207100215.0160728e20140113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053279382DNAL7 a10.1021/bm401533y2doi7 aPMC39220642pmcid7 a243446252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCha, Chaenyung10aMicrofluidics-Assisted Fabrication of Gelatin-Silica Core–Shell Microgels for Injectable Tissue Constructs  ap. 283-290.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicrofabrication technology provides a highly versatile platform for engineering hydrogels used in biomedical applications with high-resolution control and injectability. Herein, we present a strategy of microfluidics-assisted fabrication photo-cross-linkable gelatin microgels, coupled with providing protective silica hydrogel layer on the microgel surface to ultimately generate gelatin-silica core–shell microgels for applications as in vitro cell culture platform and injectable tissue constructs. A microfluidic device having flow-focusing channel geometry was utilized to generate droplets containing methacrylated gelatin (GelMA), followed by a photo-cross-linking step to synthesize GelMA microgels. The size of the microgels could easily be controlled by varying the ratio of flow rates of aqueous and oil phases. Then, the GelMA microgels were used as in vitro cell culture platform to grow cardiac side population cells on the microgel surface. The cells readily adhered on the microgel surface and proliferated over time while maintaining high viability (∼90%). The cells on the microgels were also able to migrate to their surrounding area. In addition, the microgels eventually degraded over time. These results demonstrate that cell-seeded GelMA microgels have a great potential as injectable tissue constructs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that coating the cells on GelMA microgels with biocompatible and biodegradable silica hydrogels via sol–gel method provided significant protection against oxidative stress which is often encountered during and after injection into host tissues, and detrimental to the cells. Overall, the microfluidic approach to generate cell-adhesive microgel core, coupled with silica hydrogels as a protective shell, will be highly useful as a cell culture platform to generate a wide range of injectable tissue constructs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiodegradability 3acell culture 3acoatings 3adroplets 3aengineering 3agelatin 3ageometry 3ahydrogels 3aoils 3aoxidative stress 3asilica 3asol-gel processing 3atissues 3aviability1 aOh, Jonghyun1 aKim, Keekyoung1 aQiu, Yiling1 aJoh, Maria1 aShin, Su Ryon1 aWang, Xin1 aCamci-Unal, G.,1 aWan, Kai-tak1 aLiao, Ronglih1 aKhademhosseini, Ali0 tBiomacromolecules.g2014 Jan. 13, v. 15, no. 1 p.283-290dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm401533y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245011000175300001600285520153000301592002801831650002801859650001001887650001001897650001301907650001401920650001301934650000901947650001901956650000901975650001201984650001301996653002202009653001902031653002402050653002302074653001802097700001902115700001802134700001602152700001902168700002002187700002102207773008902228856008402317852000902401655001202410IND60544837320221119041920.0160901e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054483732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2014.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinkelstein, Myra E.10aLinking cases of illegal shootings of the endangered California condor using stable lead isotope analysis  ap. 270-279.  aLead poisoning is preventing the recovery of the critically endangered California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) and lead isotope analyses have demonstrated that ingestion of spent lead ammunition is the principal source of lead poisoning in condors. Over an 8 month period in 2009, three lead-poisoned condors were independently presented with birdshot embedded in their tissues, evidencing they had been shot. No information connecting these illegal shooting events existed and the timing of the shooting(s) was unknown. Using lead concentration and stable lead isotope analyses of feathers, blood, and recovered birdshot, we observed that: i) lead isotope ratios of embedded shot from all three birds were measurably indistinguishable from each other, suggesting a common source; ii) lead exposure histories re-constructed from feather analysis suggested that the shooting(s) occurred within the same timeframe; and iii) two of the three condors were lead poisoned from a lead source isotopically indistinguishable from the embedded birdshot, implicating ingestion of this type of birdshot as the source of poisoning. One of the condors was subsequently lead poisoned the following year from ingestion of a lead buckshot (blood lead 556µg/dL), illustrating that ingested shot possess a substantially greater lead poisoning risk compared to embedded shot retained in tissue (blood lead ~20µg/dL). To our knowledge, this is the first study to use lead isotopes as a tool to retrospectively link wildlife shooting events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGymnogyps californianus 3abirds 3ablood 3afeathers 3aingestion 3aisotopes 3alead 3alead poisoning 3arisk 3atissues 3awildlife 0aCalifornia condor 0aLead poisoning 0aWildlife management 0aEndangered species 0aLead isotopes1 aKuspa, Zeka E.1 aWelch, Alacia1 aEng, Curtis1 aClark, Michael1 aBurnett, Joseph1 aSmith, Donald R.0 tEnvironmental Research.g2014 Oct., v. 134 p.270-279dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2014.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245006400161300001800225520170600243592002801949650001701977650002001994650001502014650001702029650001702046650004302063650001502106650002202121650002302143700002202166700002402188700002102212773013002233856007502363852000902438655001202447IND60657834920221121032538.0190823e20130828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065783492DNAL7 a10.1039/c3bm60124b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGugutkov, Dencho10aFibrinogen nanofibers for guiding endothelial cell behavior  ap. 1065-1073.  aThis paper describes the biological consequences of presenting electrospun fibrinogen (FBG) to endothelial cells as a spatially organized nanofibrous matrix. Aligned and randomly oriented FBG nanofibers with an average diameter of less than 200 nm were obtained by electrospinning of native FBG solution. Electrophoretic profiling confirmed that the electrospun FBG resembled the native protein structure, and fluorescent tracing of FITC-labeled FBG showed that electrospun fibers withstood immersion in physiological solutions reasonably well for several days. With respect to cellular interactions, the nanofibrous FBG matrix provided better conditions for initial recognition by human umbilical vein endothelial cells compared to pre-adsorbed FBG on a flat surface. Furthermore, the spatial organization of electrospun FBG fibers presented opportunities for guiding the cellular behavior in a way that is not possible when the protein is presented in another form (e.g. adsorbed or soluble). For example, on aligned FBG fibers, cells rapidly oriented themselves along the fibers, and time-lapse recordings revealed pronounced cellular movements restricted to the fiber direction. In great contrast, on randomly deposited fibers, cells acquired a stellate-like morphology and became locally immobilized by the fibers. We also show that the FBG fiber orientation significantly influenced both the cytoskeleton organization in confluent cell layers and the orientation of the extracellular fibronectin matrix secreted by the cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that electrospun FBG nanofibers can be a promising tool for guiding endothelial cell behavior for tissue engineering applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytoskeleton 3aelectrophoresis 3afibrinogen 3afibronectins 3afluorescence 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ananofibers 3aprotein structure 3atissue engineering1 aGustavsson, Johan1 aGinebra, Maria-Pau,1 aAltankov, George0 tBiomaterials science.g2013 Aug. 28, v. 1, no. 10 p.1065-1073dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3bm60124b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011500171300001800286520157900304592002801883650002001911650002301931650001101954650001101965650001601976650001101992650001202003650001002015651001902025700002402044700002102068700002102089773013202110856008402242852000902326655001202335IND60123426520221122231253.0150325e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012342652DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2013.8267582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunham, Jason B.10aComparison of Electrofishing Techniques to Detect Larval Lampreys in Wadeable Streams in the Pacific Northwest  ap. 1149-1155.  aWe evaluated the probability of detecting larval lampreys using different methods of backpack electrofishing in wadeable streams in the U.S. Pacific Northwest.

Captures of lampreys at these sites were analyzed with a modified removal-sampling model and Bayesian estimation to measure the relative odds of capture using the lamprey-specific settings compared with the standard salmonid settings. We found that the odds of capture were 2.66 (95% credible interval, 0.87–78.18) times greater for the lamprey-specific settings relative to standard salmonid settings. When estimates of capture probability were applied to estimating the probabilities of detection, we found high (>0.80) detectability when the actual number of lampreys in a site was greater than 10 individuals and effort was at least two passes of electrofishing, regardless of the settings used. Further work is needed to evaluate key assumptions in our approach, including the evaluation of individual-specific capture probabilities and population closure. For now our results suggest comparable results are possible for detection of lampreys by using backpack electrofishing with salmonid- or lamprey-specific settings.

For solar steam generation, the primary focus is to design new materials that are biodegradable, sustainable, of low cost, and have high solar steam generation efficiency. Here, we designed a bilayer aerogel structure employing naturally abundant cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) as basic building blocks to achieve sustainability and biodegradability as well as employing a carbon nanotube (CNT) layer for efficient solar utilization with over 97.5% of light absorbance from 300 to 1200 nm wavelength. The ultralow density (0.0096 g/cm³) of the aerogel ensures that minimal material is required, reducing the production cost while at the same time satisfying the water transport and thermal-insulation requirements due to its highly porous structure (99.4% porosity). Owing to its rationally designed structure and thermal-regulation performance, the bilayer CNF–CNT aerogel exhibits a high solar-energy conversion efficiency of 76.3% and 1.11 kg m–² h–¹ at 1 kW m–² (1 Sun) solar irradiation, comparable or even higher than most of the reported solar steam generation devices. Therefore, the all-nanofiber aerogel presents a new route for designing biodegradable, sustainable, and scalable solar steam generation devices with superb performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aaerogels 3abiodegradability 3acarbon nanotubes 3acellulose microfibrils 3adesalination 3afreshwater 3aporosity 3aporous media 3aseawater 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3asteam 3awastewater 3awater shortages 3awavelengths 0acellulose nanofibrils 0acarbon nanotube 0aaerogel 0asolar steam generation 0awater treatment1 aLiu, He1 aLi, Yiju1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9240-56861 aKuang, Yudi1 aXu, Xu1 aChen, Chaoji1 aHuang, Hao1 aJia, Chao1 aZhao, Xinpeng1 aHitz, Emily1 aZhou, Yubing1 aYang, Ronggui1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3602-69451 aCui, Lifeng1 aHu, Liangbing1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9456-93150 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 10, no. 1 p.1104-1112dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b151253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014600156300001800302520123100320592002801551650001101579650002401590650001601614650002101630650001001651650001301661650001501674650001401689650001801703650001201721650001801733650001201751700001801763700001901781700001301800700001201813700001601825700001601841700002401857773012901881856007402010852000902084655001202093IND60688721420221120205812.0200416e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068872142DNAL7 a10.1039/c9bm01911a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Yuqing10aUrethral reconstruction using an amphiphilic tissue-engineered autologous polyurethane nanofiber scaffold with rapid vascularization function  ap. 2164-2174.  aReconstruction and functional rehabilitation of the long urethra in males is one of the difficult tasks in urological treatment. Although many kinds of tissue-engineered urethra scaffold grafts have been successfully used in animals and even clinical research of urethra reconstruction, they all have the disadvantages of slow vascularization in scaffolds, which may lead to complications such as stricture and blockage of the urethra. Here, an amphiphilic polyurethane tubular nanofiber scaffold with a hierarchical structure was designed as a urethral scaffold. The scaffold can regulate the phenotypic expression of epithelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in vitro and in vivo. Upon transplantation into the Beagle puppy's defective urethral site, the engineered PU-ran tubular scaffold graft, rich in seeded cell–matrix bio-interfaces, could induce local neo-vascularization in a controlled way, which facilitated lumen epithelialization and functional rehabilitation. This is favorable for urethral tissue-oriented reconstruction. These findings suggest the pivotal role of nano-topographical and biochemical features in the vascularized biomimetic scaffold design for efficacious urethral reconstruction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeagle 3abiomedical research 3abiomimetics 3aepithelial cells 3amales 3amyocytes 3ananofibers 3aphenotype 3apolyurethanes 3apuppies 3asmooth muscle 3aurethra1 aLiu, Guochang1 aChen, Chuangbi1 aFu, Ming1 aFu, Wen1 aZhao, Zhang1 aXia, Huimin1 aStadler, Florian J.0 tBiomaterials science.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 8, no. 8 p.2164-2174dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9bm01911a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014900167300001600316520125600332592002801588650001701616650001101633650001801644650001301662650002701675650001201702650001201714650002001726650002001746653001001766653001701776653001401793653001301807653002301820653002201843700002601865773010301891856008501994852000902079655001202088IND60622855620221120201254.0190403e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062285562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2018.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirk, Jacqui10aTemporal modification of social interactions in response to changing group demographics and offspring maturation in African lions (Panthera leo)  ap. 519-527.  aIn group living animals, affiliative social interactions maintain cohesion between individuals. Involvement in these interactions is likely to differ between individuals, depending on their sex, age and life history stages. Here we investigated different social network measures to describe greeting interactions within two prides of captive-origin African lions (Panthera leo). We aimed to determine if the introduction of cubs to these prides altered the strength of greeting networks among female lions. We also tested if the strength of greeting interactions changed between the age classes as younger lions matured. We found that interactions amongst female lions decreased from the period before cubs were born (least square means [95% CIs] 15.3 [7.67–22.93]) compared to after their integration into a pride (5.63 [−1.99–13.26] χ21 = 210.03, p < 0.001). In contrast, greeting network strength increased as offspring matured, with adults directing more interactions towards younger lions from 30 months of age (12.89 [1.96–23.82]) compared to when offspring were cubs (−0.69 [−11.63–−10.24] χ210 = 156.03, p < 0.001). We suggest that social interactions between age classes may mediate recruitment and dispersal in lion prides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanthera leo 3aadults 3aage structure 3acohesion 3ademographic statistics 3afemales 3aprogeny 3asocial behavior 3asocial networks 0aALERT 0aAfrican lion 0aDispersal 0aGreeting 0aSocial interaction 0aTemporal patterns1 aWascher, Claudia A.F.0 tBehavioural processes.g2018 Dec., v. 157 p.519-527dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2018.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100002100159245005800180300001800238500000900256500001500265520165300280592002801933650001401961650002401975650002301999650001102022650001302033650001202046650001202058650001502070653001502085700001702100700001502117700001802132700001302150773015002163852000902313856009602322655001202418IND2044481720221118165415.0191125e199411  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204448172DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1994.03615995005800060036x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidhalter, U.10aAdsorption of Thiamin (Vitamin B1) on Soils and Clays  ap. 1829-1837.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aRecent research suggests that thiamin applied to soils or coated onto seeds may stimulate plant growth. The behavior of thiamin in soils has not been investigated. Therefore, studies were carried out to determine how thiamin hydrochloride (3-[(4-amino-2-methyl-pyrimidinyl)methyl]-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazolium chloride hydrochloride) is adsorbed by 17 soils and three clays. The dominate mechanism in binding of thiamin is thought to be cation exchange with clay minerals and organic matter. In soils with low to medium organic matter content, thiamin adsorption occurred primarily on clay minerals and depended particularly on the amount and composition of the clay. Adsorption is species dependent (pKₐ₁ [negative logarithm of the first dissociation constant] = 4.85) and takes place principally in the acidic pH range, probably with position 1′ of the pyrimidine ring. Adsorption equilibrium is attained in <30 min. Adsorption in all soils, and in kaolinite and illite clays, could be described by a one-surface Langmuir isotherm at initial concentrations ranging from 16.3 to 995 µmol L⁻¹. Adsorption by smectite in the same range was log-linearly related to the equilibrium concentration. Extending the initial concentration range from 16.3 to 9890 µmol L⁻¹ showed that a two-surface Langmuir equation more adequately described adsorption in hydroxy-interlayered vermiculitic and chloritic-illitic soils, whereas a one-surface Langmuir equation was found to be adequate in mixed layer-smectitic soils. Only in the case of smectite clays is thiamin allowed to lie in a monolayer configuration parallel to the basal plane.  aPublisher supplied data 3akaolinite 3asoil organic matter 3agenetic soil types 3aillite 3aduration 3asoil pH 3athiamin 3aadsorption 0amineralogy1 aEvéquoz, M.1 aStuder, C.1 aOertli, J.

It is based on several different nestbox studies; the oldest one starting in 1969. During 1969 to 2012, mean spring temperatures in the study area increased by between 0.06 and 0.08°C per year, depending on the period considered. Great tits Parus major, blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus and marsh tits Poecile palustris, which generally start egg laying between the last week of April and the first week of May, all advanced laying date at a similar rate during the study period (0.25 d yr–¹). This indicates that these species were similarly affected by increasing temperatures. When accounting for mean spring temperature variation, we still found an advancement of laying date over the study period, mostly due to such relationships among marsh and blue tits. This result could reflect ongoing microevolution favouring earlier laying, but could also be a result of other factors such as increased intra‐ or inter‐specific competition for early breeding. Pied flycatchers, which generally lay during the third week of May, did not significantly advance the date of egg laying despite that the long‐term trend in the increase in ambient temperature during the 30‐d period preceding the start of egg laying was similar for pied flycatchers compared to the tit species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanistes caeruleus 3aFicedula hypoleuca 3aParus major 3aPoecile palustris 3aambient temperature 3abreeding 3ainterspecific competition 3amarshes 3aoviposition 3aspring 3aSweden1 aHasselquist, Dennis1 aHedenström, Anders1 aNord, Andreas1 aSmith, Henrik G.1 aNilsson, Jan‐Åke0 tJournal of avian biology.g2017 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.83-90dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.012873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245012100193500001900314500002000333520132500353592002801678596007501706596005901781596005901840596008401899650002601983650002402009650002202033650002402055650001302079651001002092700001502102700001602117700001602133773012202149856007302271852000902344655001202353IND60723068620221122062919.0210111e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072306862DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.132832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Kangle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6278-949510aAquatic invertebrate assemblages as potential indicators of restoration conditions in wetlands of Northeastern China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWetland restoration has been implemented widely but evaluation of the effectiveness of wetland restoration has been limited. In this study, we aimed to investigate the utility of aquatic invertebrate assemblages as potential indicators of restoration condition in wetlands of the Sanjiang Plain, Northeastern China. Results from non‐metric multidimensional scaling analysis of invertebrate assemblages showed that study wetlands (n = 16) divided into two groups: natural wetlands and wetlands that have been restored for 4 years were classified as a group, and impaired wetlands and wetlands restored for only 1 year were classified into another group. After 4 years of recovery, 47.9% of invertebrate taxa found at the natural wetlands could also be found at the restored wetlands, primarily insects with aerial dispersal capabilities for rapid colonization. Indicator species analysis identified differences in community composition among wetland types, and Amphiagrion sp. and Bezzia sp. were indicators of the restored wetlands. In Northeastern China, aquatic invertebrate assemblages and certain indicator species may provide robust measures of wetland restoration. It is urgent for further exploration to monitor restored wetlands in the long‐time series and fully assess the efficiency of the restoration.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFC0500408cNational Key Research and Development Project of China  a41671260cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41871099cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a20180101080JCcThe Science and Technology Development Program of Jilin Province 3aaquatic invertebrates 3acommunity structure 3aindicator species 3awetland restoration 3awetlands 3aChina1 aWu, Haitao1 aGuan, Qiang1 aLu, Xianguo0 tRestoration ecology.g2021 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.e13283-dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.132833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100003300150245010300183300001800286500001500304520098000319592002801299650002201327650002901349650001401378650002401392650001201416650003301428650001301461650001801474650001601492650002801508650002001536653002501556700003001581700003701611700002001648773009201668856008601760852000901846655001201855IND4465518320221121005936.0141111e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446551832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.11.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Tamires Carvalho10aOptimisation of solid state fermentation of potato peel for the production of cellulolytic enzymes  ap. 1299-1304.  a2019-12-06  aThis paper analyses the effects of water content, temperature and time on the kinetic activity of cellulolytic enzymes produced during the solid state fermentation of potato peel, using Aspergillus niger. Three main analytical steps – analysis of variance, regression analysis and plotting of response surface – were performed to obtain an optimum condition for enzymatic activity. The statistical results indicated that the best activity time for enzyme CMCase (carboxymethylcellulase) is 82.88h, with water content of 51.48% and temperature of 29.46°C; for FPase (filter paperase), the best activity time is 80.62h, water content of 50.19% and temperature at 30.00°C; for xylanase, time is 81.92h, water content is 50.72% and temperature is 28.85°C. Pareto charts have shown that all variables were significant in enzymatic activity for CMCase and xylanase. On the other hand, FPase shows that time and temperature have significant effect for this response variable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3asolid state fermentation 3axylanases 3aregression analysis 3afilters 3aresponse surface methodology 3apotatoes 3awater content 3atemperature 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 0aanalysis of variance1 aGomes, Devson Paulo Palma1 aBonomo, Renata Cristina Ferreira1 aFranco, Marcelo0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 133, no. 4 p.1299-1304dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.11.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245011200167300001400279500002000293520207100313592002802384650001702412650002902429650001302458650001902471650002502490650001102515650003102526650001102557650002302568650001302591651001802604651001902622700002202641700002302663700001902686700002202705773010602727856007302833852000902906655001202915IND60572024520221117083029.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057202452DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.012292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamoun‐Baranes, Judy10aShort distance migrants travel as far as long distance migrants in lesser black‐backed gulls Larus fuscus  ap. 49-57.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMigration strategies differ greatly among and within avian populations. The associated trade‐offs and fitness consequences of diverse strategies and how they persist are pertinent questions in migration research. Migration is a costly endeavour, presumably compensated for by better survival conditions in the non‐breeding area. One way to assess the cost of alternative strategies is to investigate the investment in movement across the entire annual cycle, an assessment made increasingly feasible with improvements in tracking technology. Our study focuses on lesser black‐backed gulls, generalist seabirds that exploit a broad range of resources, exhibit diverse migration strategies and have potentially altered migration strategies in response to human activities and climate change. We used GPS tracking to quantify lesser black‐backed gulls’ movement throughout their annual cycle and compare trade‐offs among four migration strategies. The annual cumulative distance travelled by long distance migrants wintering in west Africa, over 4000 km from their breeding colony, did not differ significantly from individuals of the same breeding colony wintering only a few hundred kilometres away in Great Britain. Short distance migrants returned to the colony first, and long distance migrants returned last. Sex and wing length were not correlated with maximum range, cumulative distance travelled or timing. Individuals spent only a small proportion of their time in flight and spent on average 17% of their time at sea throughout an annual cycle, suggesting a reliance on inland resources for many individuals. Analysing movement throughout the annual cycle can change our perspective and understanding of consequences of different migration strategies. Our study shows that a range of migration strategies coexists and we propose that the long term costs and benefits of these strategies balance out. Diversity in migration strategies may contribute to the resilience of this species in the face of ongoing anthropogenic impact on the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarus fuscus 3aanthropogenic activities 3abreeding 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental impact 3aflight 3aglobal positioning systems 3ahumans 3amigratory behavior 3aseabirds 3aGreat Britain 3aWestern Africa1 aBurant, Joseph B.1 avan Loon, E.

Brilliant Blue FCF (C.I. Food Blue 2) is a valuable dye tracer for visualizing water flow patterns. Because this dye is nontoxic, it is particularly suited for field use. Depending on pH, the dye is either neutral or dissociates to a mono- or bivalent anion. The water solubility is 200 kg m⁻³. In this study, properties of the dye that characterize the adsorbing behavior in soil were determined. Batch adsorption experiments were carried out in the laboratory, and a field experiment was conducted to compare the mobility of Brilliant Blue FCF with that of I⁻ and Br⁻. The batch studies gave distribution coefficients Kd of 0.19, 3.00, and 5.78 dm³ kg⁻¹ for three different soils. The results of the batch studies suggest that the dye forms ion pairs with Ca²⁺. The field experiment showed that the dye is retarded compared with the conservative tracer Br⁻. A comparison between Brilliant Blue FCF and I⁻ analyzed with the iodide-starch method resulted in a relative retardation of 1.2 Brilliant Blue FCF compared with I⁻.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil water movement 3alabeling techniques 3adyes 3aadsorption 3abromine 3aiodine1 aFlühler, Hannes,0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1995 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.22-27dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900010003x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01753naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008600170300001400256520068300270592002800953650001900981650002301000650002201023650001101045653001501056653001501071653002601086653002301112653002201135700002001157700002101177773011101198856008501309852000901394655001201403IND60634699420221118055911.0190325e20180610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063469942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.1032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNozawa, Wataru10aOn analytical models of optimal mixture of mitigation and adaptation investmentst  ap. 57-67.  aDetermining the optimal combination of mitigation and adaptation investments is an important topic in policy making to combat climate change.

This study aims to investigate the effect of the temporal resolution of rainfall (TRR) on urban flood modeling and to explore how high TRR is required. A routing-enhanced detailed urban stormwater (REDUS) model, which has four layers and accounts for complex urban flow paths, was developed and then applied to the campus of Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. For 30 rainfall events at 1-min resolution, the rainfall accuracy index (RAI) was used to describe the discrepancy of rainfall patterns by upscaling. Through hydrodynamic modelling, the effect of TRR was quantified by the relative error of flood volume and peak in typical areas. The results show that (1) flood peak is sensitive to TRR while flood volume is generally not; (2) with lower TRR, discharge peak is underestimated, and a power function is proposed to express the relationship between the effect of TRR and the characteristics of rainfall and underlying surfaces; and (3) rainfall data of 5-min resolution for urban areas smaller than 1 km2, or at least 15-min resolution for larger areas, are required to constrain the relative biases of flood peak within 10%.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrologic models 3ameteorological data 3arain 3astormwater 3aurban areas 3aChina1 aNi, Guangheng1 aCao, Xuejian1 aMa, You,1 aTian, Fuqiang0 tWater.g2018 July 02, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100708803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03832naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245016200163300001400325520230700339592002802646650002702674650002302701650001702724650001802741650001902759650001702778650001902795650002902814650001102843650000902854650002202863650002102885650001302906650002502919650002002944650002602964653002702990653002003017653001103037653001603048700001403064700001503078700001603093700001203109773011003121856008603231852000903317655001203326IND60761095720221118233853.0220314e20220310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076109572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2021.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yan14aThe arthrospore-related gene Acaxl2 is involved in cephalosporin C production in industrial Acremonium chrysogenum by the regulatory factors AcFKH1 and CPCR1  ap. 26-39.  aCephalosporin C (CPC) production is often accompanied by a typical morphological differentiation of Acremonium chrysogenum, involving the fragmentation of its hyphae into arthrospores. The type I integral plasma membrane protein Axl2 is a central component of the bud site selection system (BSSS), which was identified as the regulatory factor involved in the hyphal septation process and arthrospore formation. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and homologous recombination (HR), we inserted an egfp donor DNA sequence into the Acaxl2 locus, causing the generation of the deletion strain Ac-ΔAcaxl2:eGFP from Acremonium chrysogenum FC³-5-23, the industrial producer of CPC. The mycelial morphology of the deletion strain Ac-ΔAcaxl2:eGFP was mainly composed of arthrospores with a characteristic diameter of 2–8 µm, which increased from 75% at 48 h to 90% at 72 h post culture and were maintained until the end of the fermentation process. However, the deletion strain showed accelerated production of CPC, and the final titer was 5573 μg/ml, which was nearly three times higher than that of the control strain FC³-5-23. The up-regulation of genes related to the biosynthesis gene cluster in Ac-ΔAcaxl2:eGFP, especially the “late” genes, was one reason why its CPC production was higher than that of the original strain. Furthermore, compared with FC³-5-23, the more significant increase of genes involved in the BSSS (Acbud3 and Acbud4) in Ac-ΔAcaxl2:eGFP in the late stage of fermentation, may be responsible for this increase in arthrospore formation. Similarily, the transcription of the regulatory factors AcFKH1 and CPCR1 were also markedly increased at this time and may be the factors responsible for the regulation of CPC synthesis. These results indicated that Acaxl2 plays an important role in both arthrospore formation and CPC production, strongly implicating these regulatory factors as having pivotal links between mycelial morphology and secondary metabolite production in high-yielding A. chrysogenum. To the opposite, the axl2 gene knockout of wild strain CGMCC 3.3795 did not significantly influence the CPC production, which reflected the complexity of the secondary metabolic process and the differences in the function of axl2 gene in high- and low-yielding strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcremonium chrysogenum 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acephalosporins 3afermentation 3agene targeting 3ahomologous recombination 3ahyphae 3aloci 3amembrane proteins 3amultigene family 3amycelium 3anucleotide sequences 3aplasma membrane 3asecondary metabolites 0aAcremonium chrysogenum 0aCephalosporin C 0aAcaxl2 0aCRISPR/Cas91 aLiu, Ling1 aChen, Zhen1 aTian, Xiwei1 aChu, Ju0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2022 Mar. 10, v. 347 p.26-39dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2021.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04438naa a2200901 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100001700172245014800189300001600337520177200353592002802125650001902153650001802172650003802190650001202228650001002240650001302250650001402263650001302277650001502290650002802305650001802333650001902351650002502370650001702395650001602412650001202428650000902440650002502449650001202474650002202486650002902508650003702537650006702574650001302641650003402654650004102688650001002729650003302739650000902772650002702781650004002808651001102848653000702859653000902866653000802875653000802883653001102891653001602902653000902918653000702927653003802934653003002972653001903002653002103021653001303042653002803055700001703083700001703100700002003117700002403137700003003161700001803191700002003209700002403229700002603253700002203279700002103301773010603322856008703428852000903515655001203524IND50071191820221119194723.0160902e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007119182DNAL7 a240416002pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.08.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaye, Andrew10aCanadian boreal pulp and paper feedstocks contain neuroactive substances that interact in vitro with GABA and dopaminergic systems in the brain  ap. 315-325.  aPulp and paper wood feedstocks have been previously implicated as a source of chemicals with the ability to interact with or disrupt key neuroendocrine endpoints important in the control of reproduction. We tested nine Canadian conifers commonly used in pulp and paper production as well as 16 phytochemicals that have been observed in various pulp and paper mill effluent streams for their ability to interact in vitro with the enzymes monoamine oxidase (MAO), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), and bind to the benzodiazepine-binding site of the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)-BZD). These neuroendocrine endpoints are also important targets for treatment of neurological disorders such as anxiety, epilepsy, or depression. MAO and GAD were inhibited by various conifer extracts of different polarities, including major feedstocks such as balsam fir, black spruce, and white spruce. MAO was selectively stimulated or inhibited by many of the tested phytochemicals, with inhibition observed by a group of phenylpropenes (e.g. isoeugenol and vanillin). Selective GAD inhibition was also observed, with all of the resin acids tested being inhibitory. GABA(A)-BZD ligand displacement was also observed. We compiled a table identifying which of these phytochemicals have been described in each of the species tested here. Given the diversity of conifer species and plant chemicals with these specific neuroactivities, it is reasonable to propose that MAO and GAD inhibition reported in effluents is phytochemical in origin. We propose disruption of these neuroendocrine endpoints as a possible mechanism of reproductive inhibition, and also identify an avenue for potential research and sourcing of conifer-derived neuroactive natural products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies balsamea 3aPicea mariana 3aamine oxidase (flavin-containing) 3aanxiety 3abrain 3aconifers 3aeffluents 3aepilepsy 3afeedstocks 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aglutamic acid 3aphytochemicals 3apulp and paper mills 3areproduction 3aresin acids 3astreams 3awood 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBrainxmetabolism 2aTracheophytaxchemistry. 2aDopaminergic Neuronsxmetabolism 2aGlutamate Decarboxylasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aGoldfish 2aMonoamine Oxidasexmetabolism 2aNeurosecretory Systemsxdrug effects 2aPaper 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aScintillation Counting 2agamma-Aminobutyric Acidxmetabolism 0aCanada 0aDA 0aGABA 0aMAO 0aGAD 0aGABA-T 0aGABA(A)-BZD 0aGnRH 0aLH 0aPulp and paper conifer feedstocks 0aNeuroendocrine disruption 0aPhytochemistry 0aNatural products 0aDopamine 0aGamma-aminobutyric acid1 aAnnal, Malar1 aTang, Andrew1 aPicard, Gabriel1 aHarnois, Frédéric1 aGuerrero-Analco, José A.1 aSaleem, Ammar1 aHewitt, L.

In a typical preparation process, several photoelectrodes (PE) with equal thickness but different compositions were prepared. The DSSC composed of TiO2 nanofiber/nanoparticles incorporated with 15wt.% spectral convertors showed an optimal light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of 8.94%. This light-to-electricity conversion efficiency was 38.6% higher than that of the bare DSSC with TiO2 nanoparticles only. The significantly enhanced efficiency of the DSSC was attributed to the highly favored scattering effect from the TiO2 nanofibers in combination with enhanced incident light harvesting from spectral convertors.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDye-sensitized solar cells 0acomposite photoelectrode 0aspectral convertors1 aAtabaev, Timur Sh.1 aPham-Cong, De1 aHossain, Md Ashraf1 aLee, Dongyun1 aDinh, Nguyen Nang1 aCho, Chae-ryong,1 aKim, Hyŏng-guk,d1942-1 aHwang, Yoon-Hwae0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 193 p.166-171dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.02.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01379naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007000169300001600239520035200255592002800607650001700635650001600652650002800668650002300696651002100719653001000740653001700750653001500767653001600782653001100798700002200809773010400831856008500935852000901020655001201029IND60573712920221119035106.0170724e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057371292DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2017.13492062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrhan, Raşit10aThree new species of Zerconidae (Acari: Mesostigmata) from Turkey  ap. 269-276.  aThree new species, Zercon afyonensis sp. n., Zercon karacamehmeti sp. n. and Zercon soguticus sp. n., are described and illustrated based on samples collected in the Inner Aegean Region.

The biodegradation was conducted under laboratory conditions for 6 weeks. For the testing purposes, there were three variants of biopreparations that contained autochthonous strains originating from our own collection and their mixture. The testing showed that the introduction of the biopreparations to the bottom sediment resulted in a significant increase of the number of bacteria, which consequently brought about the reduction of organic compounds in the sediment. In the case of all the variants, the number of bacteria increased by order of 10² - 10⁴ CFU/g after 42 days of biodegradation. Among the tested biopreparations, the most effective one was the mixture of the autochthonous strains and those originating from the collection. After biopreparation was applied, a drop of content of carbohydrates by 66.94%, fatty matter by 83.33% and proteins by 74.42% was noted.  aPublisher supplied data 0abottom sediments 0abiopreparation 0abiodegradation1 aWierzba, Sławomir0 tPolish Journal of Chemical Technology.g2007 Oct. 19, v. 9, no. 2 p.73-77dVersitax1899-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10026-007-0031-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04028naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015900171300001600330520210900346592002802455650005802483650001102541650001202552650001102564650001202575650001402587650001602601650002902617650002102646650000902667650001302676650002202689650001102711650001902722650002902741650001702770650001602787650001702803653001302820653002002833653001302853653001102866653001502877653004602892700001602938700002102954700002102975700002402996700002803020700003103048700002503079700002003104700001903124700001903143700002103162773011303183856008503296852000903381655001203390IND60634699720221118055917.0190325e20180620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063469972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBataille, Chris12aA review of technology and policy deep decarbonization pathway options for making energy-intensive industry production consistent with the Paris Agreement  ap. 960-973.  aThe production of commodities by energy-intensive industry is responsible for 1/3 of annual global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The climate goal of the Paris Agreement, to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C, requires global GHG emissions reach net-zero and probably negative by 2055–2080. Given the average economic lifetime of industrial facilities is 20 years or more, this indicates all new investment must be net-zero emitting by 2035–2060 or be compensated by negative emissions to guarantee GHG-neutrality. We argue, based on a sample portfolio of emerging and near-commercial technologies for each sector (largely based on zero carbon electricity & heat sources, biomass and carbon capture, and catalogued in an accompanying database), that reducing energy-intensive industrial GHG emissions to Paris Agreement compatible levels may not only be technically possible, but can be achieved with sufficient prioritization and policy effort. We then review policy options to drive innovation and investment in these technologies. From this we synthesize a preliminary integrated strategy for a managed transition with minimum stranded assets, unemployment, and social trauma that recognizes the competitive and globally traded nature of commodity production. The strategy includes: an initial policy commitment followed by a national and sectoral stakeholder driven pathway process to build commitment and identify opportunities based on local zero carbon resources; penetration of near-commercial technologies through increasing valuation of GHG material intensity through GHG pricing or tradable performance based regulations with protection for competitiveness and against carbon leakage; research and demand support for the output of pilot plants, including some combination of guaranteed above-market prices that decline with output and an increasing requirement for low carbon inputs in government procurement; and finally, key supporting institutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aassets 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aclimate 3adatabases 3aelectricity 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aheat 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3aprices 3aprioritization 3aproducts and commodities 3astakeholders 3atemperature 3aunemployment 0aIndustry 0aDecarbonisation 0aPathways 0aPolicy 0aRenewables 0aCarbon capture and utilization or storage1 aÅhman, Max1 aNeuhoff, Karsten1 aNilsson, Lars J.1 aFischedick, Manfred1 aLechtenböhmer, Stefan,1 aSolano-Rodriquez, Baltazar1 aDenis-Ryan, Amandine1 aStiebert, Seton1 aWaisman, Henri1 aSartor, Oliver1 aRahbar, Shahrzad0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 June 20, v. 187 p.960-973dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010800171300001400279520161000293592002801903653001301931653000901944653001301953653001801966653001001984700002401994700002202018773010402040856008102144852000902225655001202234IND60520434320221120021818.0160520e20071019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052043432DNAL7 a10.2478/v10026-007-0032-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichalcewicz, Wiera14aThe impact of composts prepared from different organic waste on the total number of soil microorganisms  ap. 78-80.  aIn a two-factor pot experiment impact of two doses of six types of composts prepared from the municipal sewage sludge with an addition of canteen waste, wheat straw and cocoa husk on the total number of bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi in the soil were exmined. The light soil used in the experiment was taken from the Ap level of an arable field. On all the objects with composts there was mineral NPK fertilization applied, the control object was fertilized with the NPK only. The test plant was grass Festulolium which was harvested three times and after the third cut the samples of the soil were taken for microbiological analyses.The conducted research shows that the number of microorganisms in soil was dependent on the dose and the type of the compost. The second dose of the compost, in comparison with the control object, in most composts considerably increased the number of bacteria and the first dose increased the number of actinomycetes. However, the number of fungi, in most cases, with both doses of composts, was lower than in the soil from the control object. The highest number of bacteria was noticed on the object with the co-most prepared from 35% sewage sludge + 35% canteen waste + 30% straw and actinomycetes on the object with the compost prepared from 35% sewage sludge + 35% canteen waste + 30% cocoa husk. The development of the soil fungi was restrained in the highest degree by the first dose of the compost prepared from 35% sewage sludge + 35% canteen waste + 15% straw + 15% cocoa husk and by the second dose of the compost prepared from 70% sewage sludge + 30% straw.  aPublisher supplied data 0acomposts 0asoil 0abacteria 0aactinomycetes 0afungi1 aWołoszyk, Czesław1 aBalcer, Krzysztof0 tPolish Journal of Chemical Technology.g2007 Oct. 19, v. 9, no. 2 p.78-80dVersitax1899-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10026-007-0032-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245011900199500001900318500002000337520174900357592002802106650002002134650002702154650001402181650002202195650002202217650002502239650001802264650002702282650001502309650002402324700006102348700005702409700005902466700006102525700006402586773012202650856007302772852000902845655001202854IND60723069020221120224925.0210111e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072306902DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.132692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackson, Emma L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1708-477613aAn assessment of the seascape genetic structure and hydrodynamic connectivity for subtropical seagrass restoration  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSeagrass ecosystems have suffered significant declines globally and focus is shifting to restoration efforts. A key component to successful restoration is an understanding of the genetic factors potentially influencing restoration success. This includes understanding levels of connectivity between restoration locations and neighboring seagrass populations that promote natural recovery (source and sink populations), the identification of potential donor populations, and assessment of genetic diversity of restored meadows and material used for restoration. In this study, we carry out genetic surveys of 352 individuals from 13 populations using 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci to inform seagrass restoration activities by: (1) understanding levels of genetic and genotypic diversity within meadows; and (2) understanding genetic structure and patterns of connectivity among these meadows to determine which source sites may be most appropriate to assist recovery of three restoration sites. The study identified high genotypic diversity within the locations analyzed from the Port of Gladstone and Rodd's Bay region, indicating sexual reproduction is important in maintaining populations. Overall, we detected significant genetic structuring among sites with the Bayesian structure analysis identifying genetic clusters that largely conformed to a northern, central, and southern region. This suggests limited gene flow between regions, although there does appear to be some connectivity within regions. The hydrodynamic models showed that seeds were largely locally retained, while fragments were more widely dispersed. Limited gene flow between regions suggests donor material for restoration should be sourced locally where possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aecological restoration 3agene flow 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat conservation 3ahydrodynamics 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aseagrasses 3asexual reproduction1 aSmith, Timothy M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8612-86001 aYork, Paul H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3530-41461 aNielsen, Jesper1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9588-98581 aIrving, Andrew D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9763-21481 aSherman, Craig D.

We examine the environmental properties of plant factories with sunlight and plant factories with artificial light, comparing them with conventional Japanese horticulture systems. Process conditions and inventory data were extracted from demonstration factories in Chiba, Japan. We found that these plant factories reduced the use of irreplaceable resources for food production, i.e., phosphorus, water, and land area, at the expense of additional energy consumption compared with conventional Japanese horticulture systems. By employing emerging energy technology options, energy consumption can be reduced sufficiently to be competitive with that of conventional horticulture systems. The results indicate that plant factories could become a viable or competitive production technology, changing the slope factors in the nexus of food, energy, and water systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3afactories 3afood production 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahorticulture 3ainventories 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium fertilizers 3aproduction technology 3asolar radiation 3aJapan 0aHydroponic horticulture system 0aLife cycle greenhouse gas emission 0aNitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilization 0aWater use and consumption 0aLand use1 aKanematsu, Yuichiro1 aYoshikawa, Naoki1 aOkubo, Tatsuya1 aTakagaki, Michiko0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 June 10, v. 186 p.703-717dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245010000212300002000312506007600332520144400408592002801852506003701880650001901917650001501936650002001951650001901971650001501990650001002005650002202015650000902037650000902046650002102055650001302076650001102089650001702100650001202117700002802129700002102157700002702178700001802205700002102223700001702244773011302261856008602374852000902460655001202469IND60556276320221207110934.0161108e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055627632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b022422doi7 aPMC51024532pmcid7 a276761292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCobice, Diego
F.10aSpatial Localization and Quantitation of Androgens in Mouse Testis by Mass Spectrometry Imaging  ap. 10362-10367.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAndrogens are essential for male development and reproductive function. They are transported to their site of action as blood-borne endocrine hormones but can also be produced within tissues to act in intracrine and paracrine fashions. Because of this, circulating concentrations may not accurately reflect the androgenic influence within specific tissue microenvironments. Mass spectrometry imaging permits regional analysis of small molecular species directly from tissue surfaces. However, due to poor ionization and localized ion suppression, steroid hormones are difficult to detect. Here, derivatization with Girard T reagent was used to charge-tag testosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone allowing direct detection of these steroids in mouse testes, in both basal and maximally stimulated states, and in rat prostate. Limits of detection were ∼0.1 pg for testosterone. Exemplary detection of endogenous steroids was achieved by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and either Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance detection (at 150 μm spatial resolution) or quadrupole-time-of-flight detection (at 50 μm spatial resolution). Structural confirmation was achieved by collision induced fragmentation following liquid extraction surface analysis and electrospray ionization. This application broadens the scope for derivatization strategies on tissue surfaces to elucidate local endocrine signaling in health and disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aderivatization 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3aimage analysis 3aionization 3amales 3amass spectrometry 3amice 3arats 3asteroid hormones 3asteroids 3atestes 3atestosterone 3atissues1 aLivingstone, Dawn E.

It was found that the homogeneity region was limited by the composition Ba4Ca2Nb2O10.6F0.8. Structure and electrical properties of the solid solution have been investigated. Electrical conductivities were measured by varying the temperature in dry (pH2O=1.910⁻⁴atm) and wet (pH2O=1.4210⁻²atm) air. These phases are capable of dissociative dissolution of water vapour and water uptake decreases with increasing x as a result of decreasing the concentration of oxygen vacancies. Fluorine doping increases the conductivity of Ba4Ca2Nb2O11 proton conductor over the investigated temperature range of 200–1000°C, and a maximum of conductivity is observed for the fluorine content of x=0.3−0.6. The difference between un- and fluorine-doped samples is more than 0.5 order of magnitude. The effect of F⁻-doping on ionic conductivities of double perovskite Ba4Ca2Nb2O11 deals with an increase in mobility of oxygen (dry air) and protons (wet air), the increase in the mobility (consequently, conductivity) is accompanied by decrease in activation enthalpy.  aPublisher supplied data 0adouble perovskite 0aniobate 0afluorine doping 0aproton conductor1 aBaskakova, S.1 aArgirusis, Chr.1 aAnimitsa, I.0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 193 p.63-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.02.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006200138245008300200500002000283520169400303592002801997596006602025596004602091650001602137650002302153650002502176650001002201650002402211650001302235650001202248650002702260650001902287650003302306650001102339650000702350650001102357650001702368650002002385650002202405650001202427650002302439650001102462700005702473700006202530773010802592856007302700852000902773655001202782IND60790661320221119182628.0220826e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079066132DNAL7 a10.1002/pld3.2602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantiago, James P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4186-830310aPhaseolus vulgaris SUT1.1 is a high affinity sucrose‐proton co‐transporter  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlant sucrose transporters are required for phloem loading, and therefore are essential for plant growth and development. In common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) there are only two sucrose transporters functionally characterized. Through a previous RNA‐seq study, we identified a putative sucrose transporter in common bean, which we hypothesize to function in import of sucrose into plant cells. In silico analysis revealed that PvSUT1.1 is a putative sucrose‐proton co‐transporter distinct from other characterized sucrose transporters in common bean indicating that this is a previously undescribed transporter protein in beans. Further analysis revealed that PvSUT1.1 shares high protein sequence homology to the phloem loader Arabidopsis SUC2; both have 12 transmembrane domains, a typical characteristic of plant sucrose transporters. Heterologous expression in yeast further showed PvSUT1.1 to be functional and it imported sucrose into yeast cells with a Kₘ of 0.7 mM sucrose. Import of sucrose through PvSUT1.1 is also pH‐dependent with highest uptake at pH 4.0, and activity is lost in the presence of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 3‐chlorophenylhydrazone. Consistent with identification of PvSUT1.1 as a Type I transporter, PvSUT1.1 also transports esculin. Finally, PvSUT1.1 showed expression in multiple tissues and the protein was localized to the plasma membrane. The results show that PvSUT1.1 is a sucrose transporter that is probably involved in the uptake of sucrose into source and sink cells. The potential role of PvSUT1.1 in leaf phloem loading of sucrose in common beans and its importance in heat tolerance of reproductive tissues are further discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgBioResearch, Michigan State University (MSU AgBioResearch)  aGR100125cMichigan State University (MSU) 3aArabidopsis 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aamino acid sequences 3abeans 3acomputer simulation 3acyanides 3aesculin 3agrowth and development 3aheat tolerance 3aheterologous gene expression 3aleaves 3apH 3aphloem 3aplant growth 3aplasma membrane 3asequence homology 3asucrose 3atransport proteins 3ayeasts1 aWard, John M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8185-04341 aSharkey, Thomas D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4423-32230 tPlant direct.g2020 Aug., v. 4, no. 8 p.e00260-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.2603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001700159245007500176300001400251500000900265520173900274592002802013650001502041650002402056650001502080650001302095650001202108700001502120773014602135852000902281856009602290655001202386IND2045171720221118165338.0191125e199501  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204517172DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900010011x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelim, H. M.10aTransport of Reactive Solutes in Soils: A Modified Two-Region Approach  ap. 75-82.  aepub  aA modified two-region approach that accounts for chemical and physical nonequilibrium of solute behavior in soils was developed. Chemical nonequilibrium was described by a second-order two-site model, while physical nonequilibrium was represented by a two-region (mobile-immobile) approach. Model validity was based on predictions of atrazine [2-chloro-4-(ethylamino)-6-(isopropylamino-s-triazine] miscible displacement experiments in a Sharkey clay soil (very fine, montmorillonitic, nonacid, thermic Vertic Haplaquept) for different aggregate sizes, flow velocities, column lengths, and flow interruption. Independently measured model parameters from kinetic batch experiments were used in model validation. Two model formulations were evaluated. Model I was based on the classical two-region approach where the soil matrix was divided into two fractions. In Model II, we assumed that the rate of reaction within each soil region was a function of the total number of vacant sites in the soil. Thus, the partitioning coefficient f of the two-region concept, which is difficult to measure, need not be specified and the amounts retained by each soil region is solely a function of reaction rate coefficients. Model I with f = F (F = θᵐ/θ, mobile/total water contents) provided the worst atrazine predictions. Moreover, based on Model I predictions with f = 1 and f = 0, the significance of physical nonequilibrium was dependent on experimental constraints such as aggregate size and flow velocity. Based on root mean squares, however, the best overall predictions were obtained using Model II. We concluded that Model II, which requires fewer parameters, is superior to Model I in its prediction capability for transport results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3amathematical models 3aclay soils 3aatrazine 3asolutes1 aMa, Liwang0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1995 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.75-82dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900010011x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02866naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245016200165300001600327500002000343520168200363592002802045650001102073650002102084650001602105650002602121650000902147650001202156650001002168650001402178650002002192700001902212700001802231700002202249700001902271773010802290856007302398852000902471655001202480IND60572025120221117082629.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057202512DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.008652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrželková, Adéla10aEgg morphology fails to identify nests parasitized by conspecifics in common pochard: a test based on protein fingerprinting and including female relatedness  ap. 229-234.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aConspecific brood parasites lay eggs in nests of other females of the same species. A variety of methods have been developed and used to detect conspecific brood parasitism (CBP). Traditional methods may be inaccurate in detecting CBP and in revealing its true frequency. On the other hand more accurate molecular methods are expensive and time consuming. Eadie developed a method for revealing CBP based on differences in egg morphology. That method is based on Euclidean distances calculated for pairs of eggs within a clutch using standardized egg measurements (length, width and weight). We tested the applicability of this method in the common pochard Aythya ferina using nests that were identified as parasitized (39 nests) or non‐parasitized (16 nests) based on protein fingerprinting of eggs. We also analyzed whether we can distinguish between parasitic and host eggs in the nest. We found that variation in MED can be explained by parasitism but there was a huge overlap in MED between parasitized and non‐parasitized nests. MED also increased with clutch size. Using discriminant function analysis (DFA) we found that only 76.4% of nests were correctly assigned as parasitized or non‐parasitized and only 68.3% of eggs as parasitic or host eggs. Moreover we found that MED in parasitized nests increased with relatedness of the females that laid eggs in the nest. This finding was supported by positive correlation between MED and estimated relatedness in female–female pairs. Although variation in egg morphology is associated with CBP, it does not provide a reliable clue for distinguishing parasitized nests from non‐parasitized nests in common pochard.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAythya 3abrood parasitism 3aclutch size 3adiscriminant analysis 3aeggs 3afemales 3anests 3aparasites 3apeptide mapping1 aPöysä, Hannu1 aKlvaňa, Petr1 aAlbrecht, Tomáš1 aHořák, David0 tJournal of avian biology.g2017 Feb., v. 48, no. 2 p.229-234dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.008653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245013400170300001600304500001900320520070500339592002801044650002801072650001201100650001801112650001001130650002601140650001301166650001201179651001301191651002401204651001701228700002601245700002301271700001701294700002001311700001901331700002201350773012901372856008301501852000901584655001201593IND60723072020221122190331.0210112e20210111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072307202DNAL7 a10.1637/0003-0031-185.1.1452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolfkill, Jordan14aThe Prevalence of the Raccoon Roundworm, Baylisascaris procyonis, in Allegheny Woodrat Habitat in the Mid-Atlantic Region, U.S.A.  ap. 145-147.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBaylisacaris procyonis is a roundworm that is tolerated by its primary host, raccoons (Procyon lotor). However, this roundworm can be fatal to intermediate mammalian hosts and may be a contributing factor to population declines of the endangered, Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister). We used fecal flotation to determine the prevalence of B. procyonis eggs in raccoon scat found in locations that overlap with where woodrats persist in the mid-Atlantic. We determined that B. procyonis was present at two extant woodrat colonies in Maryland and Pennsylvania. We expect woodrat populations at these sites to decline, if the roundworm and other factors (e.g., forest fragmentation) are not alleviated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaylisascaris procyonis 3aNeotoma 3aProcyon lotor 3afeces 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3amammals 3aMaryland 3aMid-Atlantic region 3aPennsylvania1 aBejarano, Maria Elena1 aSerfass, Thomas L.1 aTurner, Greg1 aBrosi, Sunshine1 aFeller, Daniel1 aMahan, Carolyn G.0 tAmerican midland naturalist.g2021 Jan. 11, v. 185, no. 1 p.145-147dUniversity of Notre DamewJournal:6277x0003-00317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/0003-0031-185.1.1453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006700170300001600237520214400253592002802397650002302425650002002448650002402468650001802492650001502510650001202525650003402537650001702571650000902588650002302597650001502620650001302635650002202648650001102670650001102681653001402692653001402706653002102720653001102741653002402752653001802776700001802794700002102812700001902833700002602852700005302878773012202931856008503053852000903138655001203147IND60573713320221119033250.0170724e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057371332DNAL7 a10.1080/07315724.2016.12785662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrade, Lucia10aTen-Year Changes in Healthy Eating Attitudes in the SUN Cohort  ap. 319-329.  aObjective : The objective of this study was to assess the within-subject longitudinal changes in self-perceived healthy eating attitudes after 10 years of follow-up and to identify predictors of long-term changes in a middle-aged adult cohort. Methods : Four thousand five hundred seventy-two participants completed a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline and after 10 years of follow-up. The FFQ was expanded with a brief 10-item questionnaire about eating attitudes with 2 possible answers: yes or no. A baseline score and a 10-year score were calculated with these 10 items (range from 0 to 10). Participants were categorized into 3 groups according to this score. Linear and logistic regressions were used to examine changes at follow-up and associations between baseline characteristics and improvement in the score. Results : After 10 years of follow-up, a statistically significant favorable change (p < 0.001) was achieved in all questions about eating attitudes, particularly in these items: “Do you try to eat less sweets and pastries?” (12%), “Do you try to eat less meat?” (11.1%), and “Do you try to reduce your fat intake?” (10%). Being female (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–1.39), being 35–50 or ≥ 50 years old (OR = 1.24, 95% CI, 1.07–1.44 and OR = 1.74, 95% CI, 1.38–2.18, respectively), a high level of physical activity (OR for third vs first tertile = 1.20, 95% CI, 1.02–1.41), and a higher Mediterranean diet score (OR for second and third tertiles = 1.18, 95% CI, 1.01–1.37 and OR = 1.26, 95% CI, 1.04–1.52, respectively) were associated with a higher probability of improving the eating attitudes score, while a low body mass index (BMI; OR = 0.71, 95% CI, 0.51–1.00) and snacking between meals (OR = 0.84, 95% CI, 0.73–0.97) were associated with a lower probability of improving their score. Conclusions : The eating attitudes of the participants in the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort became more favorable after 10 years of follow-up. Certain sociodemographic or clinical variables may predict a positive change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3abody mass index 3aconfidence interval 3aeating habits 3afat intake 3afemales 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ahealthy diet 3ameat 3amiddle-aged adults 3aodds ratio 3apastries 3aphysical activity 3asnacks 3asweets 0aAttitudes 0abehaviors 0afood consumption 0acohort 0abrief questionnaire 0aeating habits1 aZazpe, Itziar1 aSantiago, Susana1 aCarlos, Silvia1 aBes Rastrollo, Maira,1 aMartínez-González, Miguel A.q(Miguel Ángel),0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2017 July 4, v. 36, no. 5 p.319-329dTaylor & Francisx1541-10877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2016.12785663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001600157245013300173300001600306520142800322592002801750650001301778650000901791650002601800650002101826650001501847650001701862650001501879650001601894650000901910650001401919650001301933650002101946650001401967653001501981653002401996653002302020653002202043653002502065653002102090700001702111700002302128700001702151700001502168700001702183700001302200773010602213856009202319852000902411655001202420IND60536689320221120043945.0190412e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053668932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Chuanfu10aEffective utilisation of trickling liquid discharged from a bio-trickling filter as a moisture conditioning agent for composting  ap. 378-387.  aPrimary fermentation experiments were carried out investigating the disposal and reuse of trickling liquid discharged from a bio-trickling filter as a moisture conditioning agent. The liquid was mixed with food waste and mushroom bran. Compared to the addition tap water (TW), the addition of trickling liquid (TL) was found to accelerate the decomposition/fermentation rate of organic waste, which is defined in terms of enhancement in heat generation and waste mass reduction. The acceleration effect may be due to the activity promotion of heterotrophic bacteria induced by the addition of TL containing high level of ammonium. The addition of TL also promoted compost maturity based on the evaluation indices. The carbon–nitrogen ratio, Q2/6, and Q4/6 of the TL treatment were 15.3, 10.7, and 7.6, respectively. These values were 8.9, 4.3, and 3.6 lower than those in the TW treatment after 15 d of primary fermentation. The germination index of the TW treatment was 22.3% lower than that of the TL treatment (79.4%), which met the criteria (80%) for maturated composting product. Furthermore, a nitrogen mass calculation indicated that mass reduction of nitrogen of the TL and the TW treatments were −9.6% and 12.2%, respectively. Therefore, reusing TL as a moisture conditioning agent for organic waste composting could enable zero discharge of TL, promote maturity, and increase the nitrogen content of compost.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abran 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acompost maturity 3acomposting 3afermentation 3afood waste 3agermination 3aheat 3amushrooms 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3atap water 0aComposting 0aMoisture adjustment 0aNitrogen evolution 0aGermination index 0aBio-trickling filter 0aTrickling liquid1 aWang, Qunhui1 aSchneewind, Sarah,1 aXue, Niantao1 aZou, Dexun1 aPan, Siliang1 aLiu, Shu0 tBiosystems engineering.g2015 Jan., v. 129 p.378-387dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014000169520127600309592002801585650001601613650001501629650000901644650001501653650002301668650001901691650001601710650002101726650001501747650001801762650001901780650002001799653002901819653002901848653001701877653002401894700001901918700002401937700001701961700001701978700002101995773012502016856008502141852000902226655001202235IND60761096420221117162129.0220228e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076109642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2021.1066422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Huanhuan10aModeling and evaluation of quality monitoring based on wireless sensor and blockchain technology for live fish waterless transportation  aLive fish waterless transportation is a novel and cost-saving strategy, which can reduce the economic cost and wastewater pollution. However, it is still technology challenging to achieve intelligent monitoring and higher survival rate. In this paper, we presented a monitoring system for capturing quality-data changes in real time and verify captured information based on flexible wireless sensor and blockchain technology. The monitoring data was uploaded to the blockchain distribution platform for encryption, thus preventing the data from being tampered with. Quality evaluation applications were conducted for correlation analysis, state estimation and survival prediction by GA-BPNN-ARMA algorithm. Furthermore, the performance of the model, sensor, and blockchain were comprehensively analyzed and evaluated. In a field case scenario (live sea bass), dynamic monitoring and survival prediction were carried out for waterless transportation of >10 h, and the survival rate of sea bass reached about 89.5%. The mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are 0.426%, 0.498% and 0.887%, respectively. This study provided an effective and reliable survival evaluation and transportation monitoring management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aalgorithms 3abass 3ablockchain 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic costs 3aelectronics 3amodel validation 3aprediction 3asurvival rate 3atransportation 3awater pollution 0aWaterless transportation 0aFlexible wireless sensor 0aGA-BPNN-ARMA 0aSurvival prediction1 aZhang, Mengjie1 aGecevska, Valentina1 aChen, Bingqi1 aSaeed, Rehan1 aZhang, Xiaoshuan0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2022 Feb., v. 193 p.106642-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.1066423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245013700181300001600318520163400334592002801968650001101996650001702007650001902024650001602043650001302059650000902072650001702081650002702098650002902125650001902154650002802173650001502201650001502216650001202231650000902243650002602252650001502278653001202293653001802305653001702323653002702340653000902367653002302376653001402399700002102413700001302434700001502447700001802462700001702480700001702497700002902514773012202543856008502665852000902750655001202759IND60573713420221119033413.0170724e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057371342DNAL7 a10.1080/07315724.2017.12807132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagashree, Rokkam Shankar10aEffect of a Diet Enriched with Fresh Coconut Saturated Fats on Plasma Lipids and Erythrocyte Fatty Acid Composition in Normal Adults  ap. 330-334.  aObjective : The objective of this study was to compare the effects of increased saturated fatty acid (SFA) (provided by fresh coconut) versus monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) intake (provided by a combination of groundnuts and groundnut oil) on plasma lipids and erythrocyte fatty acid (EFA) composition in healthy adults. Material and Methods : Fifty-eight healthy volunteers, randomized into 2 groups, were provided standardized diet along with 100 g fresh coconut or groundnuts and groundnut oil combination for 90 days in a Yoga University. Fasting blood samples were collected before and after the intervention period for the measurement of plasma lipids and EFA profile. Results : Coconut diet increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels significantly. In contrast, the groundnut diet decreased total cholesterol (TC), mainly due to a decrease in HDL levels. There were no differences in the major SFA of erythrocytes in either group. However, coconut consumption resulted in an increase in C14:0 and C24:0 along with a decrease in levels of C18:1 n9 (oleic acid). There was a significant increase in levels of C20:3 n6 (dihomo-gamma linolenic acid, DGLA). Conclusions : Consumption of SFA-rich coconut for 3 months had no significant deleterious effect on erythrocytes or lipid-related factors compared to groundnut consumption. On the contrary, there was an increase in the anti-atherogenic HDL levels and anti-inflammatory precursor DGLA in erythrocyte lipids. This suggests that coconut consumption may not have any deleterious effects on cardiovascular risk in normal subjects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood lipids 3ablood sampling 3acholesterol 3acoconuts 3adiet 3aerythrocytes 3afatty acid composition 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3alinolenic acid 3alow density lipoprotein 3aoleic acid 3apeanut oil 3apeanuts 3arisk 3asaturated fatty acids 3avolunteers 0aCoconut 0asaturated fat 0aplasma lipid 0aerythrocyte fatty acid 0aMUFA 0agas chromatography 0agroundnut1 aManjunath, N.

However, agglomerations of the nano-sized platinum and corrosions of the carbon supports degrade the performance and durability of the PEMFC during the long-term operation. Here, we present a highly active and durable catalyst for the oxygen-reduction reactions by covering carbon-supported platinum with nitrogen-doped carbons as a protective layer. The PEMFC with the NC-protected Pt/C cathode shows a power density of 1.06Wcm⿿² at 0.6V in H2-O2, comparable with 0.67Wcm⿿² of the PEMFC with a commercial Pt/C cathode. Furthermore, the durability is remarkably enhanced over 50%, compared with the commercial carbon-supported platinum cathode. It suggests that the nitrogen-doped carbons as a protective layer are effective in enhancing the catalytic activity for oxygen-reduction reactions and durability of the PEMFCs.  aPublisher supplied data 0apolymer-electrolyte membrane fuel cell 0aoxygen reduction reaction 0anitrogen-doped carbon 0acatalyst 0adurability1 aLee, Yeayeon1 aLee, Jin Goo1 aHwang, Ho Jung1 aJang, Jeongseok1 aJuon, So Mi1 aDorjgotov, Altansukh1 aShul, Yong Gun0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 193 p.191-198dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.02.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001600159245008800175300001400263500000900277520150600286592002801792650001801820650002301838650001601861650003001877700002201907773014601929852000902075856009602084655001202180IND2045172620221118165401.0191125e199501  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204517262DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900010014x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHook, W. R.10aPropagation Velocity Errors in Time Domain Reflectometry Measurements of Soil Water  ap. 92-96.  aepub  aThe determination of soil water content by time domain reflectometry (TDR) involves two steps: the measurement of the propagation velocity of an electromagnetic pulse along a transmission line and the conversion of this measurement to an estimate of soil water content. The objective of this study was to identify and quantify errors associated with propagation velocity measurements. We developed new TDR techniques, involving the use of remotely switched diodes and differential wave form detection, that can be used to quantify and minimize propagation velocity errors. These errors are presented in terms of time interval errors. We show that the dominant time interval error term relates to the transition time of reflected pulses and that absolute time interval errors cannot be assumed to be <200 ps. We identify the presence of dissolved ions and the use of long cables as major sources of additional transition time errors. For transition times >2 ns, the time interval error caused by transition time effects can be estimated as the root mean square sum of the basic 200-ps error and an error equal to 10% of the transition time. We show that although instrument time base errors are the main source of precision errors, they are less important in determining the absolute accuracy of propagation velocity measurements. We show that system costs can be reduced without compromising accuracy by using 75 Ω coaxial cable, which is not only inexpensive but is superior to standard 50 Ω cable.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil analysis 3asoil water content 3ameasurement 3atime domain reflectometry1 aLivingston, N.

The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M 38-A2 protocol (2008), and the in vitro interactions were evaluated using a checkerboard microdilution method. For the in vivo study, 20 rabbits inoculated with P. insidiosum zoospores were divided into four groups: group 1 was treated with terbinafine and itraconazole; group 2 was treated with terbinafine, itraconazole and fluvastatin; group 3 was treated with terbinafine and caspofungin; and group 4 was the control group. Combinations of terbinafine with caspofungin or ibuprofen were synergistic for 47% of the isolates, and antagonism was not observed in any of the double combinations. The triple combinations were mostly indifferent, but synergism and antagonism were also observed. In the in vivo study, the histological aspect of the lesions was similar among the groups, but group 2 showed the lowest amount of hyphae and differed significantly from the other groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPythium insidiosum 3aibuprofen 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3aitraconazole 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3arabbits 3asynergism 3azoospores 2aAnimals 2aAntifungal Agentsxpharmacology 2aDrug Interactions 2aDrug Synergism 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aEchinocandinsxpharmacology 2aFatty Acids, Monounsaturatedxpharmacology 2aIbuprofenxpharmacology 2aIndolesxpharmacology 2aItraconazolexpharmacology 2aMale 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aNaphthalenesxpharmacology 2aPythiosisxdrug therapy 2aPythiumxdrug effects 2aRabbits1 aAlves, Sydney H.1 aSilveira, Flávio1 aMaboni, Grazieli1 aZanette, Régis A.1 aCavalheiro, Ayrton S.1 aPereira, Patrique L.1 aPereira, Daniela I.B.1 aSallis, Elisa S.V.1 aPötter, Luciana1 aSanturio, Janio M.1 aFerreiro, Laerte0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2012 May 25, v. 157, no. 1-2 p.137-142dElsevier B.V.x0378-11357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003200144245011300176300001300289520156500302592002801867650002201895650001201917650003101929650001401960650002201974650002501996650001602021650002102037650001102058650001902069650001302088650001602101650002002117650001802137650001202155700002102167700002202188700002502210773010102235856007802336852000902414655001202423IND60137859420221118031418.0150525e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013785942DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2014002902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgoungoure, Viviane L. Ndam10aNatural polyphenols binding to amyloid: A broad class of compounds to treat different human amyloid diseases  ap. 8-20.  aPolyphenols are a large group of phytonutrients found in herbal beverages and foods. They have manifold biological activities, including antioxidative, antimicrobial, and anti‐inflammatory properties. Interestingly, some polyphenols bind to amyloid and substantially ameliorate amyloid diseases. Misfolding, aggregation, and accumulation of amyloid fibrils in tissues or organs leads to a group of disorders, called amyloidoses. Prominent diseases are Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease, but there are other, less well‐known diseases wherein accumulation of misfolded protein is a prominent feature. Amyloidoses are a major burden to public health. In particular, Alzheimer's disease shows a strong increase in patient numbers. Accelerated development of effective therapies for amyloidoses is a necessity. A viable strategy can be the prevention or reduction of protein misfolding, thus reducing amyloid build‐up by restoring the cellular aggretome. Amyloid‐binding polyphenols affect amyloid formation on various levels, e.g. by inhibiting fibril formation or steering oligomer formation into unstructured, nontoxic pathways. Consequently, preclinical studies demonstrate reduction of amyloid‐formation by polyphenols. Amyloid‐binding polyphenols might be suitable lead structures for development of imaging agents for early detection of disease and monitoring amyloid deposition. Intake of dietary polyphenols might be relevant to the prevention of amyloidoses. Nutraceutical strategies might be a way to reduce amyloid diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abeverages 3adisease detection 3adisease surveillance 3afood intake 3afunctional foods 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3apatients 3apolyphenols 3aprotein folding 3apublic health 3atissues1 aSchluesener, Jan1 aMoundipa, Paul F.1 aSchluesener, Hermann0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2015 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.8-20dWiley-VCHx1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2014002903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012400162300001600286500002000302520158800322592002801910650001001938650001401948650001401962650002301976650001201999650001002011650001202021650002702033650001302060650001002073650001302083650002502096650000902121700002002130700001802150773010802168856007302276852000902349655001202358IND60572025520221117082704.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057202552DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.009742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubalcaba, Juan G.10aIs offspring dispersal related to male mating status? An experiment with the facultatively polygynous spotless starling  ap. 203-208.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPatterns of natal dispersal are generally sex‐biased in vertebrates, i.e. female‐biased in birds and male‐biased in mammals. Interphyletic comparisons in mammals suggest that male‐biased dispersal occurs in polygynous and promiscuous species where local mate competition among males exceeds local resource competition among females. However, few studies have analysed sex‐biased patterns of dispersal at the individual level, and facultatively polygynous species might offer this opportunity. In the spotless starling, polygynous males exhibit their mating status during courtship carrying higher amounts of green plants to nests than monogamous males. We experimentally incorporated green plants to nests during four years to analyse long‐term consequences on breeding success and offspring recruitment rates. We unexpectedly found that experimental sons recruited farther than experimental daughters, while control daughters recruited farther than control sons. A similar pattern was found using observational information from eight years. We discuss this result in the context of local competition hypothesis and speculate that sons dispersed farther from nests controlled by polygynous males to avoid competition with relatives. The amount of green plants in nests affects female perception of male attractiveness and degree of polygyny, although little is known about proximate mechanisms linking this process with the offspring dispersal behaviour. Our results support the idea that male‐biased dispersal is related to polygyny in a facultatively polygynous bird.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3acourtship 3adaughters 3adispersal behavior 3afemales 3amales 3amammals 3amating competitiveness 3amonogamy 3anests 3apolygyny 3areproductive success 3asons1 aVeiga, José P.1 aPolo, Vicente0 tJournal of avian biology.g2017 Feb., v. 48, no. 2 p.203-208dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.009743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245011100181300001600292520094900308536027401257592002801531596010701559596010201666596013701768650002401905650002401929650002201953650001201975650001701987650001702004650001102021650001702032650001802049650000702067650001502074650001102089653002402100653002502124653003802149653002502187653002402212700002402236700002502260700002402285700002102309700002502330700002502355700002802380773014002408856008502548852000902633655001202642IND60614819720221118110044.0181002e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061481972DNAL7 a10.1080/00288233.2018.14456512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Moura Zanine, Anderson10aFermentation and chemical composition of guinea grass silage added with wheat meal and Streptococcus bovis  ap. 487-494.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of wheat meal alone or combined with Streptococcus bovis on the fermentation and chemical composition of guinea grass silage. A completely randomised design was used in the following treatments: deionised water, untreated; fresh forage plus 100 g kg⁻¹ of wheat meal; S. bovis JB1 plus 100 g kg⁻¹ of wheat meal; and S. bovis HC5 plus 100 g kg⁻¹ of wheat meal, with six replications. There were a higher number of enterobacteria, moulds and yeast populations in the untreated silage (P < .05) compared to treated silages. The association of S. bovis with wheat meal resulted in lower pH and concentration of NH₃-N (P < .05) than silages untreated and treated only with wheat meal. The use of both S. bovis JB1 and HC5 combined with 100 g kg⁻¹ wheat meal can also be a good alternative to farmers for improving the silage quality of guinea grass silage.  aThe authors thank the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa e ao Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico do Maranhão for their financial support.  aPublisher supplied data  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superiordhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002322  cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Geraisdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004901  cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa e ao Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico do Maranhãodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003758 3aMegathyrsus maximus 3aStreptococcus bovis 3aammonium nitrogen 3afarmers 3afeed quality 3afermentation 3aforage 3agrass silage 3amolds (fungi) 3apH 3awheat meal 3ayeasts 0aDry matter recovery 0afermentation profile 0ain vitro dry matter digestibility 0alactic acid bacteria 0amicrobial inoculant1 aBonelli, Emerson A.1 aFerreira, Daniele J.1 aSouza, Alexandre L.1 aSantos, Edson M.1 aPinho, Ricardo M.

This study was designed to evaluate the role of honey and royal jelly with antioxidant properties in the protection of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury in patients with cancer. Methods : Patients with cancer assigned for cisplatin chemotherapy were randomly divided into bee honey and royal jelly groups pretreated before the initiation and during cisplatin chemotherapeutic regimen and control group on cisplatin only. Serum creatinine and urea levels were measured before and after the chemotherapeutic cycle and over 2 cycles. Results : Patients on crude bee honey and royal jelly capsules showed lower serum levels of renal injury products (creatinine and urea) compared to those in the control group. The changes in kidney parameters were significantly (p < 0.05) lower when compared within the bee honey group before and after cisplatin treatment. Royal jelly was found to be effective; however, the difference in creatinine and urea levels before and after chemotherapy was not statistically significant. Conclusions : The use of bee honey and royal jelly as natural compounds is effective in reducing cisplatin nephrotoxicity and may offer a promising chance for clinically meaningful prevention.

Drying experiments were carried out at an inlet drying air temperature range of 160–230 °C, an outlet drying air temperature range of 60–100 °C and an atomisation pressure range of 294.2–588.4 kPa. The components of drying system were separately analysed and the effects of operating conditions on system components and the overall system were discussed. Improvements for the drying cabinet should be focused on for process optimisation, whereas structural improvements of the atomiser should strongly be considered for reducing investment costs. Furthermore, investment costs for the feed pump used in the drying system should be decreased or the feed pump should be replaced with a cheaper one. While results showed high inlet and low outlet air temperatures caused high effectiveness for the overall system performance, the operating costs were the most important variable due to expenses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair drying 3aair temperature 3aatomization 3aexergy 3aoperating costs 3awhite cheeses 0aDrying 0aSpray dryer 0aExergy 0aExergoeconomy 0aSPECO 0aOperating costs1 aKoca, Nurcan0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 June, v. 122 p.127-138dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01795naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245015900176300001600335520067500351592002801026653002901054653001701083653001801100653002301118653001701141700002201158700001901180700002201199700002101221700001601242773010301258856008701361852000901448655001201457IND60594049820221118114909.0180510e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059404982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.02.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, Takayuki10aCharge–discharge behavior of Sn–Ni alloy film electrodes in an intermediate temperature ionic liquid for the electrolyte of a sodium secondary battery  ap. 275-283.  aSn–Ni alloy films were prepared by annealing tin-coated nickel foils at 463K for 0–25h, and their charge–discharge characteristics as negative electrodes for sodium secondary batteries were studied in an intermediate temperature ionic liquid Na[FSA]–K[FSA] (FSA=bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide) at 363K.

The illumination settings and methods of image preparation used for a 3D visualisation of woven cloth porosity were analysed. A historic fabric of a folk costume in plain weave had uneven porosity as a result of irregular yarn thickness and the fact that the fabric was worn out. The original images of the cloth were acquired with a camera under seven different illumination settings. Three groups of images were analysed, i.e. original images, images with equalised histograms and images processed with the rolling ball algorithm. The algorithm Yen was chosen for thresholding and the definition of woven cloth porosity. Furthermore, the image analysis of pore sizes and the area covered by the pores was performed. Besides, closed and connected pores were examined. By means of the image analysis and visual evaluation, it was demonstrated that the optimal solution is the use of maps generated from the images acquired with diffuse illumination of fabric samples and processed with the rolling ball algorithm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acameras 3acultural heritage 3afabrics 3aimage analysis 3alighting 3aporosity 3arolling 3atexture 3ayarns 0aTexture 0avisualisation 0awoven fabric 0aporosity 0aimage processing1 aGabrijelčič Tomc, Helena0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2018 Oct. 3, v. 109, no. 10 p.1270-1281dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2017.14230053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03435naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013800165300001600303500001900319520181700338592002802155650002202183650001502205650001102220650001402231650001302245650003002258650003402288650001702322650002202339650001302361650002402374650001502398650001102413650002202424650001402446653002802460653000802488653000802496653001002504653001202514700001702526700001502543700001702558700001502575700001402590700001502604700002002619700001602639773012202655856008302777852000902860655001202869IND60734782520221121111452.0210624e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073478252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yuying10aHeterogeneous Ni3S2@FeNi2S4@NF nanosheet arrays directly used as high efficiency bifunctional electrocatalyst for water decomposition  ap. 300-312.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDeveloping and designing bifunctional electrocatalysts are very important for the production of hydrogen from water electrolysis. The reasonable interface modulation can effectively lead to the optimization of electronic configuration through the interface electron transfer in the heterostructures and thus resulting in the enhanced efficiency. In this work, self-supported and heterogeneous interface-rich Ni₃S₂@FeNi₂S₄@NF electrocatalyst for overall water splitting was designed and prepared through a controllable step-wise hydrothermal process. Density functional theory calculations suggest that heterogeneous interface formed between Ni₃S₂ and FeNi₂S₄ can optimize the Gibbs free energy for H* adsorption (ΔGH*). Benefiting from the open structure of the nanosheet arrays, the abundant heterogeneous interfaces in Ni₃S₂@FeNi₂S₄@NF composite, the positive synergistic effect between Ni₃S₂ and FeNi₂S₄, and the good conductivity of foamed nickel (NF) substrate, the optimized Ni₃S₂@FeNi₂S₄@NF nanoarray catalyst displayed excellent electrocatalytic activities, the overpotential is only 83 mV and 235 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm⁻², respectively. Importantly, an alkaline electrolyser directly using the Ni₃S₂@FeNi₂S₄@NF as both the anode and cathode achieved an ultralow cell voltage of 1.46 V, accompanied by outstanding stability. The performance is better than that of most other transition-metal sulfides electrocatalysts. This work may provide a useful strategy for reasonably regulating heterogeneous interfaces to effectively improve the performance of materials, thus accelerating the practical application of transition-metal sulfides electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3aanodes 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3adensity functional theory 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrolysis 3aelectron transfer 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ananosheets 3anickel 3aoxygen production 3asynergism 0aOverall water splitting 0aOER 0aHER 0aNi3S2 0aFeNi2S41 aMeng, Haixia1 aKong, Chao1 aYan, Shaohui1 aMa, Weixia1 aZhu, Hong1 aMa, Fuquan1 aWang, Chengjuan1 aHu, Zhongai0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Oct., v. 599 p.300-312dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245012300181300001600304520137800320592002801698650000801726650001701734650001701751650001901768650002301787650002001810650001401830650001001844650002501854650001601879650002001895650000901915650002501924650003601949650001701985650001102002650001002013650000902023650001402032650003902046650002702085650002202112653001902134653002002153653001302173653001202186700003302198700003502231700003002266700002602296700003102322700002602353700003002379773012202409856008502531852000902616655001202625IND60573713720221119033425.0170724e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057371372DNAL7 a10.1080/07315724.2017.12977442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChino, Xariss M.

Methods and Results : The effect of consumption of 2% or 10% cooked chickpeas on carcinogenesis-induced colon azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in ICR mice was determined. Protein oxidation and lipids were determined by colorimetric methods and oxidation of DNA through the identification of adducts 8-hydroxy-2′-desoxiguanosine and proliferation markers (proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA], Ki-67, and β-catenin), and inflammation (cyclooxygenase [COX]-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS]) were identified by immunohistochemistry reactions. The results showed the protective effect of daily consumption of rich cooked chickpeas in the carcinogenesis process, decreasing lipid, protein, and DNA oxidation and decreasing the expression of inflammatory enzymes (COX-2 and iNOS) as well as β-catenin, one of the most important oncogenic proteins in colon cancer. Animals that were fed with the 10% chickpea diet showed an inhibition in cellular proliferation (Ki-67 and PCNA expression). Conclusions : The addition of cooked chickpea seed (2% and 10%) to the daily diet is proposed as a chemopreventive agent against colon cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aazoxymethane 3abeta catenin 3acarcinogenesis 3acell proliferation 3achemoprevention 3achickpeas 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acolorimetry 3adextran sulfate 3adiet 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3alipids 3amales 3amice 3aoxidation 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprotective effect 0aCarcinogenesis 0achemopreventive 0achickpea 0alegumes1 aMartínez, Cristian Jiménez1 aGarzón, Verónica R.

Organogenesis involves two major processes, namely cell proliferation and differentiation, whereby the former contributes to increasing the cell number and the latter involves substantial increases in cell volume through cell expansion. Co-ordination between the above processes in time and space is essential for proper organogenesis. To identify regulatory factors involved in proper organogenesis, heavy-ion beam-irradiated de-etiolated (det) 3-1 seeds have been used to identify striking phenotypes in the A#26-2; det3-1 mutant. In addition to the stunted plant stature mimicking det3-1 , the A#26-2; det3-1 mutant exhibited stem thickening, increased floral organ number and a fruit shape reminiscent of clavata (clv) mutants. DNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that A#26-2; det3-1 harbors a mutation in the CLV3 gene. Importantly, A#26-2; det3-1 displayed cracks that randomly occurred on the main stem with a frequency of approximately 50%. Furthermore, the double mutants clv3-8 det3-1 , clv1-4 det3-1 and clv2-1 det3-1 consistently showed stem cracks with frequencies of approximately 97, 38 and 35%, respectively. Cross-sections of stems further revealed an increase in vascular bundle number, cell number and size in the pith of clv3-8 det3-1 compared with det3-1 . These findings suggest that the stem inner volume increase due to clv mutations exerts an outward mechanical stress; that in a det3-1 background (defective in cell expansion) resulted in cracking of the outermost layer of epidermal cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aapical meristems 3acell proliferation 3acracking 3aflowers 3agenes 3aleaves 3amechanical stress 3amutants 3amutation 3aorganogenesis 3aphenotype 3apith 3aseeds 3asequence analysis 3astem cells 3astems 0aArabidopsis 0aclavata 0adet3-1 0aMechanical stress 0aOrganogenesis 0aStem 0aStem cracking1 aGunji, Shizuka1 aHanai, Kenya1 aHirano, Tomonari1 aKazama, Yusuke1 aOhbayashi, Iwai1 aAbe, Tomoko1 aSawa, Shinichiro1 aTsukaya, Hirokazu1 aFerjani, Ali0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2014 Nov., v. 55, no. 11 p.1994-2007dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcu1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002100136024001900157040001800176100002400194245016400218300001200382500001500394506007600409520175400485592002802239506003702267650002202304650003502326650002102361650001302382650001202395650001402407650001602421650002002437650002202457650002402479650002002503650001102523650002802534650002002562653001102582700002502593700002002618700001902638700001602657773010302673856008802776852000902864655001202873IND60119469420221207072316.0141214e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011946942DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2002-3-5-research00212doi7 aPMC1152232pmcid7 a120496622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllikian, Michael J10aDoxycycline-induced expression of sense and inverted-repeat constructs modulates phosphogluconate mutase (Pgm) gene expression in adult Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 440.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: A tetracycline-regulated (conditional) system for RNA interference (RNAi) would have many practical applications. Such a strategy was developed using RNAi of the gene for phosphogluconate mutase (Pgm). Pgm is a candidate lifespan regulator: PgmSallele frequency is increased by selection for increased lifespan, whereas Pgmᴹand PgmFallele frequencies are decreased. RESULTS: The Pgm alleles were cloned and sequenced and were found to differ by amino-acid substitutions consistent with the relative electrophoretic mobilities of the proteins. The 'tet-on' doxycycline-regulated promoter system was used to overexpress PgmSin a wild-type (Pgmᴹ) background. Enzyme activity increases of two- to five-fold were observed in five independent transgenic lines. Tet-on was also used to drive expression of an inverted-repeat fragment of Pgm coding region. The inverted-repeat transcript was expected to form a dsRNA hairpin, induce RNAi, and thereby reduce endogenous Pgm gene expression at the RNA level. Endogenous Pgm RNA levels in adult flies were found to be reduced or eliminated by doxycycline treatment in five independent inverted-repeat transgenic lines. Our results show that doxycycline-regulated expression of inverted-repeat constructs can cause a conditional reduction in specific gene expression. The effect of sense and inverted-repeat construct expression on lifespan was assayed in multiple transgenic lines. Under the conditions tested, altered Pgm gene expression had no detectable effect on adult Drosophila lifespan. CONCLUSIONS: A system for conditional RNAi in Drosophila adults shows promise for assay of gene functions during aging. Our results indicate that Pgm does not have a simple strong effect on longevity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asequence analysis 3agenetically modified organisms 3aRNA interference 3aproteins 3aalleles 3alongevity 3adoxycycline 3agene expression 3amolecular cloning 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aelectrophoresis 3aimagos 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aenzyme activity 0aadults1 aDeckert-Cruz, Denise1 aRose, Michael R1 aLandis, Gary N1 aTower, John0 tGenome biology.g2002 Apr., v. 3, no. 5 p.440-440dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2002-3-5-research00213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100002500194245008400219506007600303520166900379592002802048506003702076650001102113650001502124650001402139650001302153650001902166650002102185650001602206650001402222650001402236650002402250650002202274653002402296653001202320653001602332653002102348653002102369700002402390700002602414773013402440856008802574852000902662655001202671IND60676614820221207093447.0200509e20200310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067661482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1355662doi7 aPMC69809962pmcid7 a317672952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHyldegaard, Bente H.10aTransformation of tetrachloroethylene in a flow-through electrochemical reactor  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aElectrochemical transformation of harmful tetrachloroethylene (PCE) is evaluated as a method for management of groundwater plumes to protect the drinking water resource, its consumers and the environment. In contrast to previous work that reported transformation of trichloroethylene, a byproduct of PCE, this work focuses on transformation of PCE in a saturated porous matrix and the influence of design parameters on the removal performance. Design parameters investigated were electrode configuration, catalyst load, electrode spacing, current intensity, orientation of reactor and flow through a porous matrix. A removal of 86% was reached in the fully liquid-filled, horizontally oriented reactor at a current of 120 mA across a cathode → bipolar electrode → anode arrangement with a Darcy velocity of 0.03 cm/min (150 m/yr). The palladium load on the cathode significantly influenced the removal. Enhanced removal was observed with increased electrode spacing. Presence of an inert porous matrix improved PCE removal by 9%-point compared to a completely liquid-filled reactor. Normalization of the data indicated, that a higher charge transfer per contaminant mass is required for removal of low PCE concentrations. No chlorinated intermediates were formed. The results suggest, that PCE can be electrochemically transformed in reactor designs replicating that of a potential field-implementation. Further work is required to better understand the reduction and oxidation processes established and the parameters influencing such. This knowledge is essential for optimization towards testing in complex conditions and variations of contaminated sites.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanodes 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3adrinking water 3aelectrochemistry 3agroundwater 3aoxidation 3apalladium 3atetrachloroethylene 3atrichloroethylene 0aChlorinated ethenes 0aRemoval 0aGroundwater 0aElectrochemistry 0aDesign screening1 aOttosen, Lisbeth M.1 aAlshawabkeh, Akram N.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 10, v. 707 p.135566-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1355663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005500145245010600200300002000306520132300326592002801649650001601677650002601693650001401719650001701733650001001750700001801760773014201778856007901920852000901999655001202008IND60620171220221119222751.0181106e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062017122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b034592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Gibaek1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2900-001510aCharacteristics of Tire Wear Particles Generated by a Tire Simulator under Various Driving Conditions  ap. 12153-12161.  aPhysicochemical properties of pure tire wear particles (TWPs) were investigated in a laboratory. A tire simulator installed in an enclosing chamber was employed to eliminate artifacts caused by interfering particles during the generation and measurement of TWPs. TWP particulate matter (PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀) was correlated with tire speed (r > 0.94) and load (r > 0.99). Their mass size distributions showed that TWP mode diameters ranged between 3 and 4 μm (unimodal). Tire wear caused by slip events resulted in an increase in the number concentration (ca. 8.4 × 10⁵ cm–³) of particles (mainly ultrafine particles (UFPs)) at low PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ values (1 and 2 μg m–³, respectively). During braking events, UFPs were emitted at an early stage, with an increase in number concentration (up to 1.1 × 10⁷ cm–³); a high mass concentration (3.6 mg m–³) was observed at a later stage via the coagulation of early emitted UFPs and condensation. On the basis of morphology and elemental composition, TWPs generally had elongated (micrometer-scale) and round/irregular (submicrometer-scale) shapes and they were classified into C/Si-rich, heavy metal-containing, S-containing, and mineral-containing particles. This study determined that TWP emissions can vary with changes in driving condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoagulation 3aelemental composition 3aemissions 3aparticulates 3atires1 aLee, Seokhwan0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Oct. 02, v. 52, no. 21 p.12153-12161dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b034593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008700170500002200257520087900279592002801158650001501186650001701201650002601218650002801244650001101272650001101283650001501294653001501309653002301324653002601347653002401373653002501397700001701422700002901439700010201468700002301570773009101593856008301684852000901767655001201776IND60619550920221118193158.0191024s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061955092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2018.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVvedenskaya, Olga10aAnalytical challenges in human plasma lipidomics: A winding path towards the truth  aPre-press version  aHuman plasma lipidome has been extensively studied in many pathophysiological contexts with the hope of identifying biomarkers for early diagnostics and monitoring the progression and treatment of a broad spectrum of diseases. However, despite remarkable progress in lipidomics technologies, the concordance of lipidomics measurements between independent laboratories remains limited and not fulfilling the criteria of common laboratory diagnostics. Here we highlighted a few critical aspects of epidemiological studies of the plasma lipidome, including the selection of study cohorts, collection of plasma samples as well as extraction, identification and quantification of lipids. We argue that reporting the abundances of plasma lipids as molar concentrations is a key turning point during the transition of research lipidomics into a common tool of clinical diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood lipids 3adiagnostic techniques 3aepidemiological studies 3ahumans 3alipids 3amonitoring 0aLipidomics 0aHuman blood plasma 0aMolecular diagnostics 0aBiomarker discovery 0aLipid quantification1 aWang, Yuting1 aAckerman, Jacobo Miranda1 aKnittelfelder, Oskar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1565-7238 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1565-72381 aShevchenko, Andrej0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2018, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2018.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245006400159300001600223520127200239592002801511650002701539650001901566650001901585650001101604650001801615650002001633650001901653650001701672650001801689650001701707650003501724650001601759650001601775700002401791700002001815773012601835856007501961852000902036655001202045IND60657832320221121022653.0190823e20130702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065783232DNAL7 a10.1039/c3bm60063g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Neil, Alison10aStabilizing viral nano-reactors for nerve-agent degradation  ap. 881-886.  aVirus like particles, and other naturally occurring protein containers, have emerged as excellent building blocks for nanomaterials design and synthesis. Here we exploit a directed assembly and encapsulation approach to sequester multiple copies of a phosphotriesterase (PTE) enzyme within the capsid of bacteriophage P22. Phosphotriesterase, from Brevundimonas diminuta, is an intriguing enzyme as it is highly active against a wide range of harmful insecticides and nerve agents such as Soman and Sarin. However, difficulty in expressing large quantities of the active recombinant enzyme has limited efforts to scale-up its use. Additionally, as a mesophilic enzyme its low heat tolerance and susceptibility to proteolysis makes it a less than ideal candidate as a practical bioremediation tool. Through encapsulation of the PTE within the P22 capsid, we demonstrate a greatly enhanced thermal tolerance of the enzyme, maintaining 50% of its activity to 60 °C. Additionally, the P22 capsid confers protection to the enzyme from proteases, as well as stabilizing the enzyme against desiccation. Thus, our engineered P22 encapsulation system greatly enhances the stability of the mesophilic phosphotriesterase and results in a robust and active nanoparticle reactor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrevundimonas diminuta 3abacteriophages 3abioremediation 3acapsid 3aencapsulation 3aenzyme activity 3aheat tolerance 3ainsecticides 3ananoparticles 3anerve agents 3aphosphoric triester hydrolases 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis1 aPrevelige, Peter E.1 aDouglas, Trevor0 tBiomaterials science.g2013 July 2, v. 1, no. 8 p.881-886dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3bm60063g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03689naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006600153245020800219520182300427592002802250650001202278650001202290650001902302650001602321650001202337650002002349650002502369650001402394650001002408650005002418650001502468650002302483650001102506650003002517650002502547650001102572651001002583651001302593653000902606653003002615653002202645653001902667653001602686653003002702653002202732653001602754700006202770700006202832700002502894773011902919856008803038852000903126655001203135IND60676614920221120182646.0200509e20200310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067661492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1355672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVirdis, Salvatore G.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3927-949410aEstimation of satellite-derived lake water surface temperatures in the western Mediterranean: Integrating multi-source, multi-resolution imagery and a long-term field dataset using a time series approach  aLake surface water temperature (LSWT) is a key parameter to help study the environmental and ecological impacts of climate change. In this work, we measured the LSWT of 1 natural and 23 artificial lakes located on the island of Sardinia in the western Mediterranean, which is a region where changes in climate are projected to have significant impacts. By integrating multi-source and multi-resolution datasets of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat and long-term in situ temperature observations, we detected, measured, and analysed the LSWT trends during the period of 2000–2018 across all the investigated lakes.Methodologically, we demonstrated that a simplified approached based on Planck's equation for Landsat thermal infrared (TIR) data could be a valid alternative to radiative transfer equation retrieval methods for the retrieval of LSWT without loss of accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrated that rescaled and independently validated MOD112A-derived LSWT showed good accuracy, efficiently filled the spatial and temporal gaps in long-term in situ LSWT, and could be used for long-term LSWT trend detection and measurement.All 24 lakes showed an annual warming trend of +0.010 °C/y, warming winter trend of +0.013 °C/y, and cooling summer trend of −0.038 °C/y during the period of 2000–2018. This study demonstrated that the measured trend rates could be explained by and were strongly correlated with the climatology of Italy for the 2000–2018 period. Finally, we demonstrated the key role and the importance of the availability of long-term in situ temperature datasets. The approach used in this study is up-scalable to other medium to low-resolution TIR sensors as well as to other long-term monitoring sites, such as LTER-Italy, LTER-Europe, or ILTER sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimatology 3acooling 3adata collection 3aenvironmental impact 3aequations 3alakes 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3aradiative transfer 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3atime series analysis 3awinter 3aItaly 3aSardinia 0aLSWT 0aIn situ long-term dataset 0aMediterranean Sea 0aClimate change 0aTime series 0aNash-Sutcliffe efficiency 0aMann-Kendall test 0aSen's slope1 aSoodcharoen, Nooch1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9199-00941 aLugliè, Antonella1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6382-42081 aPadedda, Bachisio M.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 10, v. 707 p.135567-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1355673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001600158245012300174300001400297520172500311592002802036650002102064650001402085650001602099650001202115650002702127650001102154650002002165650001002185650001502195650000902210650001002219650001402229650002202243650002502265650002802290650002002318650002102338650001602359650002302375650002402398650000902422651001102431700001502442773009202457856004002549852000902589655001202598IND50072291320221118064506.0140125e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007229132DNAL7 a241282592pmid7 a10.1111/mec.125062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShohami, D.10aFire‐induced population reduction and landscape opening increases gene flow via pollen dispersal in Pinus halepensis  ap. 70-81.  aPopulation reduction and disturbances may alter dispersal, mating patterns and gene flow. Rather than taking the common approach of comparing different populations or sites, here we studied gene flow via wind-mediated effective pollen dispersal on the same plant individuals before and after a fire-induced population drop, in a natural stand of Pinus halepensis. The fire killed 96% of the pine trees in the stand and cleared the vegetation in the area. Thirteen trees survived in two groups separated by ~80 m, and seven of these trees had serotinous (closed) prefire cones that did not open despite the fire. We analysed pollen from closed pre and postfire cones using microsatellites. The two groups of surviving trees were highly genetically differentiated, and the pollen they produced also showed strong among-group differentiation and very high kinship both before and after the fire, indicating limited and very local pollen dispersal. The pollen not produced by the survivors also showed significant prefire spatial genetic structure and high kinship, indicating mainly within-population origin and limited gene flow from outside, but became spatially homogeneous with random kinship after the fire. We suggest that postfire gene flow via wind-mediated pollen dispersal increased by two putative mechanisms: (i) a drastic reduction in local pollen production due to population thinning, effectively increasing pollen immigration through reduced dilution effect; (ii) an increase in wind speeds in the vegetation-free postfire landscape. This research shows that dispersal can alleviate negative genetic effects of population size reduction and that disturbances might enhance gene flow, rather than reduce it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus halepensis 3agene flow 3aimmigration 3akinship 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apollen 3apopulation size 3atrees 3avegetation 3awind 2aFires 2aGene Flow 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPinusxgenetics 2aPollenxgenetics 2aPollination 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aWind 0aIsrael1 aNathan, R.0 tMolecular ecology.g2014 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.70-81dBlackwell Sciencex0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.12506  aDNAL 7aarticle04106naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002600156245007600182300001600258500002000274500001500294520192300309592002802232650001902260650002102279650002802300650003502328650002402363650002702387650001102414650001302425650001702438650001602455650001802471650000902489650001102498650001402509650001602523650002202539650002602561650002102587650001202608650002602620650001902646650001602665650004402681650003402725650001402759650003602773650004402809650001702853650002202870650001702892650001002909650002302919651001202942653002202954700002202976700001902998700002703017700002003044700002703064700002703091700002903118773013003147852000903277856007403286655001203360IND4418173020221123004418.0180321e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441817302DNAL7 a193231782pmid7 a10.1890/07-1876.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriffiths, Natalie A.10aRapid decomposition of maize detritus in agricultural headwater streams  ap. 133-142.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aHeadwater streams draining agricultural landscapes receive maize leaves (Zea mays L.) via wind and surface runoff, yet the contribution of maize detritus to organic‐matter processing in agricultural streams is largely unknown. We quantified decomposition and microbial respiration rates on conventional (non‐Bt) and genetically engineered (Bt) maize in three low‐order agricultural streams in northwestern Indiana, USA. We also examined how substrate quality and in‐stream nutrient concentrations influenced microbial respiration on maize by comparing respiration on maize and red maple leaves (Acer rubrum) in three nutrient‐rich agricultural streams and three low‐nutrient forested streams. We found significantly higher rates of microbial respiration on maize vs. red maple leaves and higher rates in agricultural vs. forested streams. Thus both the elevated nutrient status of agricultural streams and the lability of maize detritus (e.g., low carbon‐to‐nitrogen ratio and low lignin content) result in a rapid incorporation of maize leaves into the aquatic microbial food web. We found that Bt maize had a faster decomposition rate than non‐Bt maize, while microbial respiration rates did not differ between Bt and non‐Bt maize. Decomposition rates were not negatively affected by genetic engineering, perhaps because the Bt toxin does not adversely affect the aquatic microbial assemblage involved in maize decomposition. Additionally, shredding caddisflies, which are known to have suppressed growth rates when fed Bt maize, were depauperate in these agricultural streams, and likely did not play a major role in maize decomposition. Overall, the conversion of native vegetation to row‐crop agriculture appears to have altered the quantity, quality, and predictability of allochthonous carbon inputs to headwater streams, with unexplored effects on stream ecosystem structure and function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aorganic matter 3asoil respiration 3aagricultural watersheds 3aplant-incorporated protectants 3asoil microorganisms 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aleaves 3aZea mays 3aforest trees 3aAcer rubrum 3acrop residues 3acorn 3alignin 3afood webs 3agrain crops 3atransgenic plants 3aaquatic invertebrates 3acell respiration 3astreams 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3abiodegradation 2aAgriculture 2aBacterial Proteinsxanalysisxgenetics. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aEcosystem 2aEndotoxinsxanalysisxgenetics. 2aHemolysin Proteinsxanalysisxgenetics. 2aPlant Leaves 2aRiversxchemistry 2aTime Factors 2aWater 2aZea maysxgenetics 3aIndiana 0aaquatic organisms1 aTank, Jennifer L.1 aRoyer, Todd V.1 aRosi-Marshall, Emma J.1 aWhiles, Matt R.1 aChambers, Catherine P.1 aFrauendorf, Therese C.1 aEvans-White, Michelle A.0 tEcological applications.g2009 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.133-142dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-1876.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle00986naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245009400164300001600258520019100274592002800465650001700493650001000510651001100520773011700531856007500648852000900723655001200732IND60643729820221117003650.0190513e20141121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064372982DNAL7 a10.5586/am.1976.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkirgiello, Alina,10aContributions to the knowledge of the geographical distribution of higher fungi in Europe  ap. 155-189.  aThe distribution of the localities of 25 species of higher fungi from series "3" typed for charting in Europe by CMME was analysed.

Building a stable and robust solid state electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Li-anode surface is regarded as a promising strategy to overcome the dendrite issues. In this work, we report a simple strategy to engineer the interface chemistry of Li-metal anodes by using tiny amounts of dimethyl sulfate (DMS, C₂H₆SO₄) as the SEI-forming additive. With the preferential reduction of DMS, an SEI layer composed of Li₂S/Li₂O forms on the Li surface. This inorganic SEI layer features high structural modulus and low interfacial resistant, enabling a dense and dendrite-free Li deposition as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and in situ optical images. In addition, this SEI layer can prevent the deposited Li from direct contact with corrosive electrolytes, thus rendering an improved cycling stability of Li anodes with an average Coulombic efficiency of 97% for up to 150 cycles. When the DMS additive is introduced into a Li/NCM full cell, the cycle life of Li-metal batteries can be also improved significantly. This work demonstrates a feasible route to suppress Li dendrite growth by designing appropriate film-forming additives to regulate the interfacial properties of the SEI layer, and also the sulfonyl-based derivatives revealed in this work represent a large variety of new film-forming molecules, providing a broad selectivity for constructing high efficiency and cycle-stable Li anodes to address the intrinsic problems of rechargeable Li-metal batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aanodes 3aatomic force microscopy 3abatteries 3adendrites 3adimethyl sulfate 3aelectrolytes 3alithium 3amaterials science 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolids 0alithium metal anode 0asolid electrolyte interphases 0adendrite growth 0asulfate additives 0aLi-metal batteries1 aGuo, Feihu1 aLi, Hui1 aCao, Yuliang1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6092-56521 aAi, Xinping1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8280-08661 aQian, Jiangfeng1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6758-93371 aLi, Yangxing1 aYang, Hanxi0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 10, no. 1 p.593-601dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b146623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03476naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002100136024001900157040001800176100002200194245009800216300001200314506007600326520204600402592002802448506003702476650002702513650002502540650001902565650001702584650002502601650002102626650002502647650001002672650001602682650002502698650002902723650001702752650002302769650001302792700002502805773010302830856008802933852000903021655001203030IND60119469720221207103516.0141214e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011946972DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2002-3-5-research00252doi7 aPMC1152272pmcid7 a120496662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCopley, Shelley D10aLateral gene transfer and parallel evolution in the history of glutathione biosynthesis genes  ap. 444.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Glutathione is found primarily in eukaryotes and in Gram-negative bacteria. It has been proposed that eukaryotes acquired the genes for glutathione biosynthesis from the alpha-proteobacterial progenitor of mitochondria. To evaluate this, we have used bioinformatics to analyze sequences of the biosynthetic enzymes γ-glutamylcysteine ligase and glutathione synthetase. RESULTS: γ-Glutamylcysteine ligase sequences fall into three groups: sequences primarily from gamma-proteobacteria; sequences from non-plant eukaryotes; and sequences primarily from alpha-proteobacteria and plants. Although pairwise sequence identities between groups are insignificant, conserved sequence motifs are found, suggesting that the proteins are distantly related. The data suggest numerous examples of lateral gene transfer, including a transfer from an alpha-proteobacterium to a plant. Glutathione synthetase sequences fall into two distinct groups: bacterial and eukaryotic. Proteins in both groups have a common structural fold, but the sequences are so divergent that it is uncertain whether these proteins are homologous or arose by convergent evolution. CONCLUSIONS: The evolutionary history of the glutathione biosynthesis genes is more complex than anticipated. Our analysis suggests that the two genes in the pathway were acquired independently. The gene for γ-glutamylcysteine ligase most probably arose in cyanobacteria and was transferred to other bacteria, eukaryotes and at least one archaeon, although other scenarios cannot be ruled out. Because of high divergence in the sequences, the data neither support nor refute the hypothesis that the eukaryotic gene comes from a mitochondrial progenitor. After acquiring γ-glutamylcysteine ligase, eukaryotes and most bacteria apparently recruited a protein with the ATP-grasp superfamily structural fold to catalyze synthesis of glutathione from γ-glutamylcysteine and glycine. The eukaryotic glutathione synthetase did not evolve directly from the bacterial glutathione synthetase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3abioinformatics 3abiosynthesis 3aconvergent evolution 3aeukaryotic cells 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3agenes 3aglutathione 3aglutathione synthase 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3amitochondria 3aparallel evolution 3aproteins1 aDhillon, Jasvinder K0 tGenome biology.g2002 Apr., v. 3, no. 5 p.444-444dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2002-3-5-research00253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245010400175300001600279500002000295520176100315592002802076650002202104650002502126650001902151650001702170650001902187650002102206650002202227650001302249650002102262650001402283650001402297650002802311650001902339650002302358650002602381650001102407650001402418650001202432650002302444650001402467650001702481650002202498651001102520651001502531651001502546651001102561700001702572700002102589700001902610700001602629700001902645773013002664852000902794856007402803655001202877IND4418173520221123004332.0180321e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441817352DNAL7 a193231812pmid7 a10.1890/07-2006.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHudiburg, Tara10aCarbon dynamics of Oregon and Northern California forests and potential land‐based carbon storage  ap. 163-180.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNet uptake of carbon from the atmosphere (net ecosystem production, NEP) is dependent on climate, disturbance history, management practices, forest age, and forest type. To improve understanding of the influence of these factors on forest carbon stocks and flux in the western United States, federal inventory data and supplemental field measurements at additional plots were used to estimate several important components of the carbon balance in forests in Oregon and Northern California during the 1990s. Species‐ and ecoregion‐specific allometric equations were used to estimate live and dead biomass stores, net primary productivity (NPP), and mortality. In the semiarid East Cascades and mesic Coast Range, mean total biomass was 8 and 24 kg C/m², and mean NPP was 0.30 and 0.78 kg C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹, respectively. Maximum NPP and dead biomass stores were most influenced by climate, whereas maximum live biomass stores and mortality were most influenced by forest type. Within ecoregions, mean live and dead biomass were usually higher on public lands, primarily because of the younger age class distribution on private lands. Decrease in NPP with age was not general across ecoregions, with no marked decline in old stands (>200 years old) in some ecoregions. In the absence of stand‐replacing disturbance, total landscape carbon stocks could theoretically increase from 3.2 ± 0.34 Pg C to 5.9 ± 1.34 Pg C (a 46% increase) if forests were managed for maximum carbon storage. Although the theoretical limit is probably unattainable, given the timber‐based economy and fire regimes in some ecoregions, there is still potential to significantly increase the land‐based carbon storage by increasing rotation age and reducing harvest rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperate forests 3aprimary productivity 3acarbon dioxide 3agas exchange 3aphotosynthesis 3aclimatic factors 3aforest management 3atree age 3aforest inventory 3aallometry 3aequations 3adry matter accumulation 3asemiarid zones 3aold-growth forests 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3adead wood 2aBiomass 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aEcosystem 2aTime Factors 2aTreesxphysiology 3aOregon 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia 0aOregon1 aLaw, Beverly1 aTurner, David P.1 aCampbell, John1 aDonato, Dan1 aDuane, Maureen0 tEcological applications.g2009 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.163-180dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-2006.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02465naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245004700202300001400249506007600263520124600339592002801585506003701613650001501650650002501665650002201690650002001712650001101732650002401743650003301767650001701800700002001817700001901837700002401856773010301880856007501983852000902058655001202067IND60532791520221207104933.0160728e20140113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053279152DNAL7 a10.1021/bm401302v2doi7 aPMC38959292pmcid7 a242747292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLangdon, Blake
B.10aInterfacial Protein–Protein Associations  ap. 66-74.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhile traditional models of protein adsorption focus primarily on direct protein–surface interactions, recent findings suggest that protein–protein interactions may play a central role. Using high-throughput intermolecular resonance energy transfer (RET) tracking, we directly observed dynamic, protein–protein associations of bovine serum albumin on polyethylene glycol modified surfaces. The associations were heterogeneous and reversible, and associating molecules resided on the surface for longer times. The appearance of three distinct RET states suggested a spatially heterogeneous surface – with areas of high protein density (i.e., strongly interacting clusters) coexisting with mobile monomers. Distinct association states exhibited characteristic behavior, i.e., partial-RET (monomer–monomer) associations were shorter-lived than complete-RET (protein-cluster) associations. While the fractional surface area covered by regions with high protein density (i.e., clusters) increased with increasing concentration, the distribution of contact times between monomers and clusters was independent of solution concentration, suggesting that associations were a local phenomenon, and independent of the global surface coverage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadsorption 3abovine serum albumin 3achemical elements 3aenergy transfer 3amodels 3apolyethylene glycol 3aprotein-protein interactions 3asurface area1 aKastantin, Mark1 aWalder, Robert1 aSchwartz, Daniel K.0 tBiomacromolecules.g2014 Jan. 13, v. 15, no. 1 p.66-74dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm401302v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01848naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002100135024001900156040001800175100001800193245006300211300001200274506007600286520069600362592002801058506003701086650002001123650001001143650002001153650001101173650002601184650001401210650001401224650001701238700002001255773010301275856008701378852000901465655001201474IND60119469820221207115716.0141214e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011946982DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2002-3-5-comment20052doi7 aPMC1393552pmcid7 a120496582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRing, Brian Z10aMicroarrays and molecular markers for tumor classification  ap. 296.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman cancers have traditionally been classified according to their tissue of origin, histological characteristics and, to some extent, molecular markers. Clinical studies have associated different tumor classes with differences in prognosis and in response to therapy. Measurement of the expression of thousands of genes in hundreds of cancer specimens has begun to reveal novel molecularly defined subclasses of tumor; some of these classes appear to predict clinical behavior, while others may define tumor types that are ripe for directed development of therapeutics. Unfortunately, at present, differences between studies of similar tumor types can be as striking as their similarities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclinical trials 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahumans 3amicroarray technology 3aneoplasms 3aprognosis 3atherapeutics1 aRoss, Douglas T0 tGenome biology.g2002 Apr., v. 3, no. 5 p.296-296dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2002-3-5-comment20053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012900170300001600299520162400315592002801939650002001967650001401987650002002001650001802021650003002039650001402069653003002083653002802113653003602141653003902177653002802216700001802244700001702262700001502279773010202294856008602396852000902482655001202491IND60585819020221121040414.0171114e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058581902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2015.05.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ya-Ping10aExperimental investigation on performances of trisection helical baffled heat exchangers for oil/water–water heat transfer  ap. 460-469.  aThe trisection helical baffled shell-and-tube heat exchangers have structural features of more suitable to the equilateral triangular tube layouts and less baffle parts. In particular the circumferential overlap trisection helical baffled shell-and-tube heat exchangers are of anti-shortcut structure that accommodates one row tubes in each circumferential overlapped zone between adjacent baffles for dampening shortcut leakage. The performance tests were conducted on both oil–water and water–water heat transfer in heat exchangers with equilateral triangle tube layout of 16 tubes including five helical baffle schemes with incline angles of 12°, 16°, 20°, 24°, 28° and a segmental baffled one for comparison. The test results show that both the shell side heat transfer coefficient ho and pressure drop Δpo increase but the comprehensive index ho/Δpo decreases with the increase of the mass flow rate of all schemes; and that the shell side heat transfer coefficient, pressure drop and the comprehensive index ho/Δpo decrease with the increase of the baffle incline angle at certain mass flow rate, except that the curves of comprehensive index ho/Δpo of 12° and 16° helical baffle schemes are almost coincide. The average values of shell side heat transfer coefficient, the comprehensive index ho/Δpo of the 12° helical baffled scheme are about 50% higher than those of the segmental one with almost same pressure drop. The correlation equations for shell side Nusselt number and axial Euler number are presented varying with axial Reynolds number, Prandtl number and helical baffle incline angle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aequations 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3aheat transfer coefficient 3amass flow 0aHeat transfer enhancement 0aPerformance experiments 0aHelical baffled heat exchangers 0aCircumferential overlap of baffles 0aIncline angle of baffle1 aWang, Weihan,1 aWu, Jia-Feng1 aDong, Cong0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 101 p.460-469dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.05.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04535naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003600135040001800171100001200189245013000201300001200331506007600343520214100419592002802560596001902588596001902607596001902626596007502645596006202720596006202782596014102844506003702985650003203022650001403054650001903068650001903087650001903106650002803125650001903153650001903172650002203191650002103213650001403234650001603248650002203264650001803286650002003304650001603324650000903340650003403349650001503383650000903398650002403407700001703431700001603448700001203464700001303476700001403489700002703503700001403530700001603544700001703560700001503577773012903592856008303721852000903804655001203813IND60688717320221207052426.0220709e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068871732DNAL7 aPMC71581592pmcid7 a322934082pmid7 a10.1186/s12906-020-02905-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lin10aInvestigation of cardiovascular protective effect of Shenmai injection by network pharmacology and pharmacological evaluation  ap. 112.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Shenmai injection (SMI) has been used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as heart failure, myocardial ischemia and coronary heart disease. It has been found to have efficacy on doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy. The aims of this study were to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of SMI treatment on CVD by using network pharmacology and its protective effect on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by in vitro and in vivo experiment based on network pharmacology prediction. METHODS: Network pharmacology method was used to reveal the relationship between ingredient-target-disease and function-pathway of SMI on the treatment of CVD. Chemical ingredients of SMI were collected form TCMSP, BATMAN-TCM and HIT Database. Drugbank, DisGeNET and OMIM Database were used to obtain potential targets for CVD. Networks were visualized utilizing Cytoscape software, and the enrichment analysis was performed using IPA system. Finally, cardioprotective effects and predictive mechanism confirmation of SMI were investigated in H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes and DOX-injured C57BL/6 mice. RESULTS: An ingredient-target-disease & function-pathway network demonstrated that 28 ingredients derived from SMI modulated 132 common targets shared by SMI and CVD. The analysis of diseases & functions, top pathways and upstream regulators indicated that the cardioprotective effects of SMI might be associated with 28 potential ingredients, which regulated the 132 targets in cardiovascular disease through regulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling. In DOX-injured H9c2 cardiomyocytes, SMI increased cardiomyocytes viability, prevented cell apoptosis and increased PI3K and p-Akt expression. This protective effect was markedly weakened by PI3K inhibitor LY294002. In DOX-treated mice, SMI treatment improved cardiac function, including enhancement of ejection fraction and fractional shortening. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the protective effects of SMI on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity are possibly related to the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, as the downstream of G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data  a81774017cNSFC  a81803959cNSFC  a81973624cNSFC  a2017KJ140cScientific Research Project of Tianjin Education Commission  a19JCYBJC28200cNatural Science Foundation of Tianjin City  a18JCQNJC83300cNatural Science Foundation of Tianjin City  aTD13-5050cTraining Program Foundation for Innovative Research Team of Higher Education in Tianjin during the 13th Five-Year Plan Period0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aapoptosis 3acardiac output 3acardiomyocytes 3acardiomyopathy 3acardioprotective effect 3acardiotoxicity 3acell viability 3acomputer software 3acoronary disease 3adatabases 3adoxorubicin 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aheart failure 3ain vivo studies 3aingredients 3amice 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aprediction 3arats 3asignal transduction1 aYang, Dongli1 aLi, Jinghao1 aNiu, Lu1 aChen, Ye1 aZhao, Xin1 aOduro, Patrick Kwabena1 aWei, Chun1 aXu, Zongpei1 aWang, Qilong1 aLi, Yuhong0 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.112-112dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-020-02905-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008700162300001400249520136500263592002801628650002001656650001401676650001401690650002401704650001501728650002101743650002301764700002101787700002201808700002001830700002301850700002301873700002401896773010301920856007502023852000902098655001202107IND60532791620221119173126.0160728e20140113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053279162DNAL7 a10.1021/bm40130562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThayer, Patrick
S.10aCellularized Cylindrical Fiber/Hydrogel Composites for Ligament Tissue Engineering  ap. 75-83.  aElectrospun meshes suffer from poor cell infiltration and limited thickness, which restrict their use to thin tissue applications. Herein, we demonstrate two complementary processes to overcome these limitations and achieve elastomeric composites that may be suitable for ligament repair. First, C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells were incorporated into electrospun meshes using a hybrid electrospinning/electrospraying process. Second, electrospun meshes were rolled and formed into composites with an interpenetrating polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel network. Stiffer composites were formed from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) meshes, while softer and more elastic composites were formed from poly(ester-urethane urea) (PEUUR) meshes. As-spun PLGA and PEUUR rolled meshes had tensile moduli of 19.2 ± 1.9 and 0.86 ± 0.34 MPa, respectively, which changed to 11.6 ± 4.8 and 1.05 ± 0.39 MPa with the incorporation of a PEG hydrogel phase. In addition, cyclic tensile testing indicated that PEUUR-based composites deformed elastically to at least 10%. Finally, C3H10T1/2 cells incorporated into electrospun meshes survived the addition of the PEG phase and remained viable for up to 5 days. These results indicate that the fabricated cellularized composites are support cyclic mechanical conditioning, and have potential application in ligament repair.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrospraying 3ahydrogels 3aligaments 3apolyethylene glycol 3astem cells 3atensile strength 3atissue engineering1 aDimling, Anna F.1 aPlessl, Daniel S.1 aHahn, Mariah R.1 aGuelcher, Scott A.1 aDahlgren, Linda A.1 aGoldstein, Aaron S.0 tBiomacromolecules.g2014 Jan. 13, v. 15, no. 1 p.75-83dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm40130563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01431naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003100141245019300172300001600365520040300381592002800784650002500812650002700837650001500864650001000879650001100889650001700900650001100917773011700928856007501045852000901120655001201129IND60643730020221116234229.0190513e20141121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064373002DNAL7 a10.5586/am.1976.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaciejowska-Pokacka, Zofia10aYeasts occurring on wheat seeds.

These stages include an herbaceous stage, two shrub stages, and two forest stages. A portion of their land is kept in primary forest. This study presents the Lacandon traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) for agroforestry and quantitatively describes the plant community and the associated soil ecology of each successional stage. Also documented is the knowledge of the Lacandon regarding the immediate use of plant species and plant species useful for soil fertility enhancement. Woody plant diversity increases during the successional stages of the Lacandon system, and by the beginning of the first forest stage, the diversity is similar to that of the primary forest. In all stages, Lacandon use 60% of the available plant species for food, medicine, and raw materials. Approximately 45% of the woody plant species present in each fallow stage were thought by the Lacandon to enhance soil fertility. Total soil nitrogen and soil organic matter increased with successional stage and with time from intentional burn. Nutrient and soil nematode dynamics in shrub stages related to the presence of introduced and managed plants, indicating engineered soil enhancement by the Lacandon. The effects on biodiversity and soil ecology coupled with productivity for agricultural subsistence indicate that Lacandon TEK may offer tools for environmental conservation that would provide for a family's basic needs while maintaining a biodiverse rain forest ecosystem. Tools such as these may offer options for regional restoration and conservation efforts such as the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor in Mexico and Central America, where attainment of environmental goals must include methods to provide resources to local inhabitants.  aPublisher supplied data 3atropical rain forests 3aethnobotany 3aagroforestry 3asoil ecology 3aindigenous knowledge 3aecosystem management 3asoil fertility 3aprescribed burning 3asoil nematodes 3asoil organic matter 3abotanical composition 3aintroduced species 3afallow 3aenvironmental protection 3aplant communities 3anitrogen 3aecological succession 3aindigenous peoples 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aHumans 2aPlantsxclassificationxmetabolism. 2aPopulation Groups 2aSoil 3aMexico 3aCentral America 0aCentral America 0avegetation1 aMartin, Jay F.0 tEcological applications.g2009 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.254-266dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0176.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02915naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245023100163300001400394520144200408592002801850650002101878650002101899650002401920650001601944650002201960650002001982650001102002650002102013650002202034650000902056653004302065653001102108653001102119653002202130653002402152700001602176700001602192700001302208700001602221700001402237700001402251773008702265856008402352852000902436655001202445IND60544835120221119042147.0160901e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054483512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2014.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chao14aThe extremely low-frequency magnetic field exposure differently affects the AMPAR and NMDAR subunit expressions in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and prefrontal cortex without effects on the rat spatial learning and memory  ap. 74-80.  aIn the present study, we investigated the effects of chronic exposure (14 and 28 days) to a 50Hz, 0.5mT extremely low-frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) on the NMDAR and AMPAR subunit expressions and rat spatial learning and memory. Using the Western blotting method, we found ELF-MF exposure specifically decreased the expressions of GluA2 in the EC post 28 day exposure and GluA3 of AMPAR subunits in the PFC after 14 day exposure, while it did not affect the AMPAR subunit expression in the hippocampus at both time points. As for NMDAR subunits, 14 day ELF-MF exposure significantly increased the levels of GluN2A and GluN2B in the hippocampus. Moreover, the levels of GluN1 and GluN2A were enhanced in the EC and PFC after two weeks of ELF-MF exposure. Interestingly, 28 day ELF-MF exposure induced a different expression pattern for NMDAR subunits. The increased GluN2A expression observed at 14 day post ELF-MF exposure was recovered after prolonged exposure in the hippocampus and PFC. In the EC, the increased expression of GluN1 achieved to control level and, specifically, a decrease in GluN2A level was observed. Surprisingly, neither 14 nor 28 day ELF-MF did affect the rat spatial reference memory as assessed by water maze. These results indicate that the dynamic and brain-region specific changes in ionotropic glutamate receptor expression induced by ELF-MF are insufficient to influence the rat spatial learning ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3achronic exposure 3aglutamate receptors 3ahippocampus 3along term effects 3amagnetic fields 3amemory 3aperfluorocarbons 3aprefrontal cortex 3arats 0aExtremely low frequency magnetic field 0aNMDARs 0aAMPARs 0aEntorhinal cortex 0aLearning and memory1 aXie, Meilan1 aLuo, Fenlan1 aHe, Chao1 aWang, Jiali1 aTan, Gang1 aHu, Zhian0 tEnvironmental Research.g2014 Oct., v. 134 p.74-80dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2014.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245009300179300001400272500001500286520127200301650002101573650001401594650001501608650001601623650001201639650002801651650002401679650002101703650001101724650002201735650002001757650001001777650002201787650001701809650002001826650001301846650001601859650001501875650001001890650001401900651001101914653002401925653001801949653001001967653002201977653002801999700001802027773006702045852000902112930003302121945002502154946001302179655001202192IND4432207020221118110045.0100202e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443220702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Ten species of trees and two species of bamboo, which had tightly clustered tall stems and spreading branches resembling trees in shape, were chosen for the study. In the summer of 2007, we measured leaf and canopy characteristics of each species. The microclimate conditions under the tree canopies and an unshaded open space were measured repeatedly at middays without precipitation. In comparison with the nearby unshaded open space, air temperatures under the canopies were 0.64 to 2.52 °C lower, whereas the surface-soil temperatures were 3.28 to 8.07 °C lower. Regression analysis revealed the relative contributions to air cooling effect by the plant's leaf color lightness, foliage density, leaf thickness, and leaf texture (surface roughness) in decreasing order. Foliage density had the greatest contribution to surface-soil cooling followed by leaf thickness, leaf texture, and leaf color lightness in that order. Regression analysis also revealed that solar radiation, wind velocity, and vapor pressure at the site had significant effects on temperature reduction attributable to shade trees or bamboo. 3asoil temperature 3athickness 3asubtropics 3aurban areas 3adensity 3ainterspecific variation 3asurface temperature 3aornamental trees 3aleaves 3asurface roughness 3asolar radiation 3aparks 3arelative humidity 3amicroclimate 3aair temperature 3abranches 3ashade trees 3awind speed 3acolor 3aoverstory 3aTaiwan 0aspecies differences 0aprecipitation 0astems 0aornamental bamboo 0aornamental woody plants1 aLin, Yann-Jou0 tHortScience.g2010 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.83-86x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20100323b20100403c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/03/01  aOther US 7aarticle02721naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245008200142300002100224520165900245650001101904650001101915650002201926650001501948650001501963650001101978650002401989650001702013650002402030651001002054651001602064700001402080700001302094700001702107773011902124852000902243930003302252945002502285946001302310655001202323IND4432204820221118105942.0100202e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443220482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGanora, D.13aAn approach to estimate nonparametric flow duration curves in ungauged basins  ap. W10418 (10 p.  aA distance‐based regionalization model is developed for the estimation of dimensionless flow duration curves (FDC) in sites with no or limited available data. The curves are dimensionless because they are preliminarily normalized by an index value (e.g., the mean annual runoff). The model aims at representing the FDC as a nonparametric object rather than providing a parametric representation and trying to relate the parameter values to basin descriptors. The regional approach considers the (dis)similarity between all possible pairs of curves and uses distance measures that can be related to basin descriptors, taken among geographic, geomorphologic, and climatic parameters. The (dis)similarity between curves is computed using a predefined metric based on a linear norm and produces a distance matrix. This matrix is then related, by means of linear regression models, to analogous matrices composed of the difference between all possible values of each descriptor within the set of basins. After identification of significant descriptors, a cluster analysis is applied so that the basins can be grouped together. Each region is supposed to be characterized by a single dimensionless flow duration curve. The procedure is applied to 95 basins located in northwestern Italy and Switzerland. The performance in the regional estimation is assessed by means of a cross‐validation procedure through comparison with “standard” parametric regional approaches based on two‐ and three‐parameter models. In most of the cases, the distance‐based model produces better estimates of the flow duration curves using only few catchment descriptors. 3agauges 3abasins 3ahydrologic models 3aestimation 3awater flow 3arunoff 3aregression analysis 3acase studies 3awatershed hydrology 3aItaly 3aSwitzerland1 aClaps, P.1 aLaio, F.1 aViglione, A.0 tWater resources research.g2009 Oct., v. 45, no. 10 p.W10418 (10 p-W10418 (10 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20100325b20100403c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/03/25  aOther US 7aarticle03169naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001900180245005600199300001400255500001500269520128000284650000901564650002801573650003201601650001101633650001201644650002201656650002301678650002601701650002301727650000701750650001901757650002101776650001601797650002601813650001801839650002401857650002801881650004201909650005601951650002702007650002102034650002202055650003102077650005502108650002202163650001002185650002102195653002202216700002002238700001802258700001602276700002002292700002102312773008202333852000902415930003302424945002502457946001302482655001202495IND4432216220221118105550.0100202e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443221622DNAL7 a200512062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDong, Qingfang10aReduction of Patulin in Apple Cider by UV Radiation  ap. 69-74.  a2019-12-04  aThe presence of the mycotoxin patulin in processed apple juice and cider presents a continual challenge to the food industry as both consumer health and product quality issues. Although several methods for control and/or elimination of patulin have been proposed, no unifying method has been commercially successful for reducing patulin burdens while maintaining product quality. In the present study, exposure to germicidal UV radiation was evaluated as a possible commercially viable alternative for the reduction and possible elimination of the patulin mycotoxin in fresh apple cider. UV exposure of 14.2 to 99.4 mJ/cm2 resulted in a significant and nearly linear decrease in patulin levels while producing no quantifiable changes in the chemical composition (i.e., pH, Brix, and total acids) or organoleptic properties of the cider. For the range of UV doses tested, patulin levels decreased by 9.4 to 43.4%; the greatest reduction was achieved after less than 15 s of UV exposure. The method of UV radiation (the CiderSure 3500 system) is an easily implemented, high-throughput, and cost-effective method that offers simultaneous UV pasteurization of cider and juice products and reduction and/or elimination of patulin without unwanted alterations in the final product. 3abrix 3afood processing quality 3adetoxification (processing) 3aapples 3apatulin 3atoxigenic strains 3asensory evaluation 3asecondary metabolites 3atitratable acidity 3apH 3afood pathogens 3afood irradiation 3aapple cider 3aultraviolet radiation 3amolds (fungi) 2aBeveragesxanalysis 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aDose-Response Relationship, Radiation 2aFood Contaminationxanalysisxprevention & control. 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Irradiation 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aMalusxchemistryxmicrobiologyxradiation effects. 2aPatulinxanalysis 2aTaste 2aUltraviolet Rays 0afood preservation1 aManns, David C.1 aFeng, Guoping1 aYue, Tianli1 aChurey, John J.1 aWorobo, Randy W.0 tJournal of food protection.g2010 Jan., v. 73, no. 1 p.69-74x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20100223b20100305c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/02/16  aOther US 7aarticle03388naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100002200178245009100200300001600291520190400307650002102211650002702232650001902259650001702278650002302295650000902318650002402327650001702351650002102368650001102389650001502400650001302415650002102428650001302449650001802462650002002480650001302500650001502513650001702528650002002545650002102565700002302586700002002609700002202629700002202651773006902673852000902742930003302751945002502784946001302809655001202822IND4432211320221118105611.0100202e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443221132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVietor, Donald M.10aEffect of Alum Treatments on Turfgrass Coverage and Runoff Losses during Establishment  ap. 119-124.  aIncorporation or top-dressing of composted biosolids (CB) can enhance turfgrass establishment and sod properties at harvest, but soil phosphorus (P) and nitrogen must be managed to protect water quality. Alum treatment of CB could reduce soluble P concentrations in amended soil and limit runoff loss of P. The objective was to evaluate CB and Alum effects on turfgrass coverage of soil and runoff losses during ‘Tifway’ bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. var. dactylon x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davey] establishment from sprigs or transplanted sod. Three replications of eight treatments comprised a complete randomized design. Four treatments were composed of ‘Tifway’ sprigged in soil with and without incorporation of CB and Alum. Four remaining treatments were sods harvested from ‘Tifway’ grown with and without top-dressed CB that were transplanted with and without a surface spray of Alum. Surface coverage of ‘Tifway’ sprigged in soil mixed with inorganic fertilizer or CB was comparable to transplanted sod 25 days after planting. In contrast, Alum incorporation acidulated soil, slowed coverage rates of sprigged ‘Tifway’, and increased NH4-N runoff loss during early establishment in treatments without CB. Incorporation of Alum with CB or inorganic fertilizer in soil before sprigging reduced soil water-extractable P (WEP) more than 38% and reduced runoff loss of soluble reactive P (SRP) in three of four establishment treatments. Although SRP runoff loss from CB-amended sod was greatest among treatments, the Alum spray minimized SRP loss after transplanting. Alum effectively reduced runoff loss of SRP from CB, soil, and turfgrass sources during establishment from sprigs or sod. Additional field research is needed, but incorporated or surface sprays of Alum offer a potential new practice for mitigating runoff loss of SRP from establishing turfgrass. 3aCynodon dactylon 3aCynodon transvaalensis 3alawns and turf 3aturf grasses 3abiosolids composts 3aalum 3aplant establishment 3aplant growth 3avegetation cover 3arunoff 3aphosphorus 3anitrogen 3alosses from soil 3aleaching 3awater quality 3asoil amendments 3aplanting 3asod strips 3agrass sprigs 3aturf management 3aland application1 aSchnell, Ronnie W.1 aProvin, Tony L.1 aWhite, Richard H.1 aMunster, Clyde L.0 tHortScience.g2010 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.119-124x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20100323b20100403c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/03/01  aOther US 7aarticle02768naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002500161245012700186300001600313500001500329520143900344650000901783650001101792650001301803650001301816650001101829650001501840650001801855650001201873650001601885650002201901650001501923650002801938650001001966650002301976650001601999650001902015651001502034653001702049653002702066653002002093773006902113852000902182930003302191945002502224946001302249655001202262IND4432213620221118105612.0100202e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443221362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Love) Barkworth] and California barley [Hordeum brachyantherum Nevski ssp. californicum (Covas & Stebbins) Bothmer, N. Jacobsen & Seberg], were compared with a conventional grass cover crop, ‘Blando’ brome (Bromus hordeaceus L.), as well as resident (weedy) vegetation and a clean cultivated control for effects on growth and yield of cultivated grape (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Barbera). Statistical analyses did not reveal yield differences between treatments with floor vegetation (the native grasses, ‘Blando’ brome, and resident vegetation) and clean cultivation, the cover crop treatments (the native grasses and ‘Blando brome’) and clean cultivation, nor the native grass treatments versus treatments with non-native floor vegetation (‘Blando’ brome and resident vegetation). However, there was a significant difference between the two native grasses with the average yield of nodding needlegrass 26.2% higher than that of California barley. Treatments did not differ in °Brix, berry weight, or pruning weight. At the end of the study, vine trunk diameter was 7.1% higher under the cover crop treatments than resident vegetation. Given these results, in vineyards where a neutral effect on growth or yield is desired, nodding needlegrass would be suitable as a permanent cover crop, whereas California barley would not. 3abrix 3aweight 3aNassella 3adiameter 3agrapes 3aperennials 3agreen manures 3aHordeum 3acover crops 3aBromus hordeaceus 3acrop yield 3adry matter accumulation 3aweeds 3aindigenous species 3afruit crops 3aVitis vinifera 3aCalifornia 0aplant growth 0aHordeum brachyantherum 0aNassella cernua0 tHortScience.g2010 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.154-156x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20100323b20100403c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/03/01  aOther US 7aarticle03313naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178100001900195245014500214300001600359500001500375520167800390650003202068650001202100650002502112650001202137650001502149650001402164650001902178650001302197650002402210651001302234653002202247653001602269700001902285700001802304700001802322700001902340700001602359700001602375700001602391700001502407700001602422700001402438700001902452700001702471700001602488700001502504700001602519773008402535852000902619930003302628945002502661946001302686655001202699IND4432217320221118110203.0100202e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443221732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aO'Connor, A.M.14aThe REFLECT Statement: Methods and Processes of Creating Reporting Guidelines for Randomized Controlled Trials for Livestock and Food Safety  ap. 132-139.  a2019-12-04  aThe conduct of randomized controlled trials in livestock with production, health, and food-safety outcomes presents unique challenges that may not be adequately reported in trial reports. The objective of this project was to modify the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to reflect the unique aspects of reporting these livestock trials. A two-day consensus meeting was held on November 18-19, 2008 in Chicago, Ill, United States of America, to achieve the objective. Prior to the meeting, a Web-based survey was conducted to identify issues for discussion. The 24 attendees were biostatisticians, epidemiologists, food-safety researchers, livestock production specialists, journal editors, assistant editors, and associate editors. Prior to the meeting, the attendees completed a Web-based survey indicating which CONSORT statement items may need to be modified to address unique issues for livestock trials. The consensus meeting resulted in the production of the REFLECT (Reporting Guidelines for Randomized Control Trials) statement for livestock and food safety (LFS) and 22-item checklist. Fourteen items were modified from the CONSORT checklist, and an additional sub-item was proposed to address challenge trials. The REFLECT statement proposes new terminology, more consistent with common usage in livestock production, to describe study subjects. Evidence was not always available to support modification to or inclusion of an item. The use of the REFLECT statement, which addresses issues unique to livestock trials, should improve the quality of reporting and design for trials reporting production, health, and food-safety outcomes. 3alivestock and meat industry 3afunding 3alivestock production 3asurveys 3aguidelines 3alivestock 3aworld wide web 3aInternet 3aon-farm food safety 3aIllinois 0aweb-based surveys 0afood safety1 aSargeant, J.M.1 aGardner, I.A.1 aDickson, J.S.1 aTorrence, M.E.1 aDewey, C.E.1 aDohoo, I.R.1 aEvans, R.B.1 aGray, J.T.1 aGreiner, M.1 aKeefe, G.1 aLefebvre, S.L.1 aMorley, P.S.1 aRamirez, A.1 aSischo, W.1 aSmith, D.R.0 tJournal of food protection.g2010 Jan., v. 73, no. 1 p.132-139x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20100225b20100305c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/02/16  aOther US 7aarticle02759naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245009200177300001600269500002400285520128700309650000801596650001301604650001301617650001601630650003101646650002501677650001901702650001801721650001401739650001801753650001301771650001601784650006601800650002801866650003401894650002701928651001501955653003301970653001302003653002902016700001702045700001802062700001302080773010302093852000902196856004802205655001202253IND4449490220221118105543.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444949022DNAL7 a209634912pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-010-9523-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yong10aBacillus beringensis sp. nov., a psychrotolerant bacterium isolated from the Bering Sea  ap. 551-557.  aIncludes references  aPsychrotolerant Bacillus-like strains BR035T and BR011 were isolated from seawater of the Bering Sea and were characterized by means of a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that these strains were related to the members of the genus Bacillus and had the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Bacillus korlensis ZLC-26T. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments confirmed that strains BR035T and BR011 belonged to the same species and were distinct from their closest relatives. The cells were Gram-positive, rods, motile, spore-forming and psychrotolerant. The temperature range for growth was 4-42°C. The main respiratory quinone was MK-7. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, an unknown aminolipid and two unknown phospholipids. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C15:0, anteiso-C15:0, iso-C14:0 and C16:1ω7c alcohol. The diagnostic diamino acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan was meso-diaminopimelic acid. The genomic DNA G + C content was 37.6-37.8 mol%. On the basis of the phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis and DNA-DNA relatedness data, a novel species Bacillus beringensis is proposed and the type strain is BR035T (=CGMCC 1.9126T=DSM 22571T). 3aDNA 3aalcohols 3abacteria 3afatty acids 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptidoglycans 3aphospholipids 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3aseawater 3atemperature 2aBacillusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology 3aBering Sea 0aBacillus beringensis sp. nov 0aBacillus 0aPsychrotolerant bacteria1 aLi, Hui-Rong1 aZeng, Yin-Xin1 aChen, Bo0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2011 Mar., v. 99, no. 3 p.551-557dSpringer Netherlandsx0003-60727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-010-9523-4 7aarticle02978naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100003200136245008600168300001600254500002400270520198900294650002602283650001102309650001102320650001102331650002402342650000902366650001902375650001102394650001502405651001002420700001402430700001602444773010802460852000902568856003902577655001202616IND4401662020221118105611.0080217e20080229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440166202DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.66412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBracken ' née Bull ', L.J.14aThe relationship between rainfall inputs and flood generation in south-east Spain  ap. 683-696.  aIncludes references  aRainfall and flood data are relatively sparse in semi-arid areas; hence there have been relatively few investigations into the relationships between rainfall inputs and flood generation in these environments. Previous work has shown that flood properties are influenced by a combination of precipitation characteristics including amount, intensity, duration and spatial distribution. Therefore floods may be produced by high intensity, short duration storms, or longer duration, low intensity rainfall. Most of this research has been undertaken in small catchments in either hyper-arid or relatively high rainfall Mediterranean climates. This paper presents results from a 6 year data record in south-east Spain from research conducted in two basins, the Rambla Nogalte (171 km²) and the Rambla de Torrealvilla (200 km²). Data cover an area of approximately 500 km² and an annual average rainfall of 300 mm. At coarse temporal resolutions gauges spread over large areas record similar patterns of rainfall, although spells of rain show much more complexity; pulses of rain within storms can vary considerably in total rainfall, intensity and duration over the same area. The analysis for south-east Spain shows that most storms occur over a period of less than 24 h, but that the number of rainfall events declines as the duration exceeds 8 h. This is at odds with data on floods for the study area suggesting that they are produced by storms lasting longer than 18 h. However, one flood event was produced by a very short (15 min) storm with high intensity rainfall. Most floods tended to occur in May/June or September, which coincides with wetter months of the year (September, October, December and May). Floods are also more highly related to the total rainfall occurring in a spell of rain, than to intensity. The complexity of storm rainfall increases with the storm total, which makes it difficult to generalize on the importance of rainfall intensity for flood generation. 3aMediterranean climate 3abasins 3afloods 3agauges 3ameteorological data 3arain 3arain intensity 3astorms 3awatersheds 3aSpain1 aCox, N.J.1 aShannon, J.0 tHydrological processes.g2008 Feb. 29, v. 22, no. 5 p.683-696dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.6641 7aarticle03440naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002000179245011200199300001800311500002400329506007600353520150600429506003701935650002301972650002501995650001802020650002702038650002302065650003102088650002102119650001602140650001802156650001802174650002602192650003602218650005202254650005502306650002702361650002102388650003902409650004202448650004102490700002702531700002402558700002102582700002702603700001902630700002402649773011402673852000902787856007802796655001202874IND4437751320221207141243.0100528e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443775132DNAL7 a203638682pmid7 aPMC28778922pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/erq0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOndřej, Vladan10aRecondensation level of repetitive sequences in the plant protoplast nucleus is limited by oxidative stress  ap. 2395-2401.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProtoplast cultures are remarkable examples of plant cell dedifferentiation. The state of dedifferentiation is evidenced by changes in cell morphology, genome organization, as well as by the capability of protoplasts to differentiate into multiple types of cells (depending on the type of the stimulus applied). The first change in the genome structure is connected with large-scale chromatin decondensation, affecting chromocentres involving various types of these repetitive sequences. This paper describes not only the de- and recondensation of satellite DNA type I and 5S rDNA repetitive sequences, but it also compares the recondensation level of chromatin with the levels of oxidative stress which were decreased by using an antioxidant, as well as the capabilities of the antioxidative systems within protoplasts, during the first 72 h of their culture. It is demonstrated that the treatment of protoplasts with ascorbic acid not only decreased the level of oxidative stress but also positively stimulated the expression of the ascorbate peroxidase and catalase. It also led to a greater recondensation of the chromatin (when compared to the untreated protoplasts); in addition, it supported cell proliferation. It is concluded that large-scale genome relaxation is more directly connected with oxidative stress than with large changes in the expression of genes; and further, that its recondensation is related to the start of (as well as the level of) protection by the antioxidative systems.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aascorbic acid 3acell dedifferentiation 3acell proliferation 3agene expression regulation 3aoxidative stress 3aprotoplasts 3aribosomal DNA 3asatellite DNA 2aAscorbate Peroxidases 2aCatalasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Nucleusxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCucumis sativusxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aOxidative Stress 2aPeroxidasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtoplastsxenzymologyxmetabolism.1 aNavrátilová, Božena1 aProtivánková, Iva1 aPiterková, Jana1 aSedlářová, Michaela1 aLuhová, Lenka1 aLebeda, A.q(Aleš)0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2010 May, v. 61, no. 9 p.2395-2401dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq0673Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03103naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245014600169300001800315500002400333520195200357650001202309650001702321650002602338650001202364650002502376650002602401650001302427650001502440650001302455650001402468650001202482651001002494700002702504700001902531773011002550852000902660856004802669655001202717IND4420643920221118104942.0090515e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442064392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-008-9477-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMortelliti, Alessio10aSpecies' surrogacy for conservation planning: caveats from comparing the response of three arboreal rodents to habitat loss and fragmentation  ap. 1131-1145.  aIncludes references  aThe use of surrogate species in conservation planning has been applied with disappointing results on relatively large sets of species. It could still prove useful for optimizing conservation efforts when considering a small set of species with similar ecological requirements, however few field tests of this nature have been carried out. The aim of this research is to compare the response of three arboreal rodent species--the fat dormouse (Glis glis), the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) and the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris)--to habitat loss and fragmentation, with the aim of identifying priorities for conservation and evaluating possible optimization of conservation efforts under different scenarios: habitat restoration and selection of focal patches. We studied the distribution of the three species in a sample of patches in a highly fragmented landscape in central Italy, using a patch-landscape scale approach. The distribution was studied by using hair tubes, nestboxes and nocturnal surveys. The three species showed analogous responses to increasing isolation and decreasing size of habitat patches; what differed however, was the magnitude of responses. Our results show possible application of surrogacy within this restricted group of species, however several caveats arise depending on the conservation strategy and available funding. If habitat restoration is the objective, then the fat dormouse should be the target species for guiding size and isolation of patches. On the other hand, the magnitude of the differences and patch requirements for this species, question the feasibility of these conservation actions. If selection of focal patches for conservation is the objective then selecting the fat dormouse as a focal/umbrella species would overlook areas suitable for the other two species. Feasible optimisation of conservation efforts may be possible only between the red squirrel and the hazel dormouse. 3aSciurus 3abiogeography 3afield experimentation 3afunding 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aplanning 3asquirrels 3asurveys 3aItaly1 aSantulli Sanzo, Giulia1 aBoitani, Luigi0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2009 May, v. 18, no. 5 p.1131-1145dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-008-9477-2 7aarticle03507naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245008200176300001800258500002400276500001500300520232800315650002002643650001202663650002502675650001102700650005002711650001502761650001202776650000902788650001202797650001502809650002102824650002502845651001402870653001502884700002202899773011202921852000903033856005503042655001203097IND4444732620221118105133.0101105e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444473262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01883.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerón, Santiago R.10aDesertification alters the response of vegetation to changes in precipitation  ap. 1233-1241.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  a1. Desertification is of critical concern because it may affect 40% of the global land area inhabited by more than 1 billion people. During the process of desertification, defined as land degradation in arid, semi‐arid and dry subhumid areas, drylands shift to a state of reduced biological productivity that may lead to widespread loss of human well‐being. Despite recent advances, we need a better understanding of the response of ecosystems to desertification to improve the assessment and monitoring of desertification. 2. We used a published physiognomic description, MODIS monthly NDVI data for 2000-2005 and rain gauge data to characterize the long‐term effects of degradation for an area of 128 000 ha located in western Patagonia. 3. We focused on three aspects of vegetation dynamics: radiation interception, precipitation use efficiency (PUE) and the sensitivity of vegetation to interannual changes in precipitation (i.e. the slope of the relationship between the above‐ground net primary productivity and precipitation, the precipitation marginal response, PMR). In particular, we analysed the response of PMR and PUE to long‐term changes in vegetation structure due to grazing. 4. On average, NDVI decreased by 28%, ranging between 35% (grass or grass-shrub steppes to semi‐deserts) and 22% (grass or grass‐shrub steppes to low cover grass steppes) suggesting that, in Patagonia, desertification may imply a reduction in the above‐ground net primary productivity. 5. Additionally, PMR and PUE captured the functional modifications associated with vegetation structure caused by desertification. In general, grass and grass‐shrub steppes had the highest average PUE and PMR. Shrub steppes and semi‐deserts had the lowest PMR and PUE. These results support the hypothesis that PUE is more sensitive to changes in total plant cover and PMR to changes in plant functional type composition. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that the precipitation marginal response could complement current desertification assessments based only on precipitation use efficiency thereby improving our ability to monitor desertification. Enhanced monitoring programmes could provide an early warning signal for the onset of desertification allowing for timely management action. 3adesertification 3agrasses 3aprimary productivity 3ashrubs 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aarid lands 3agrazing 3arain 3asteppes 3aecosystems 3aland degradation 3avegetation structure 3aArgentina 0avegetation1 aParuelo, José M.0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2010 Dec., v. 47, no. 6 p.1233-1241dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-89017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01883.x 7aarticle02656naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002400148245011300172300001800285500002400303520160000327650001701927650001101944650002301955650001501978650001701993650001102010650001502021650001702036650001602053651001402069700001902083700002502102773010702127852000902234856005102243655001202294IND4407001520221118104521.0080620e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440700152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2008.04.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcdonald, Robert I.14aThe implications of current and future urbanization for global protected areas and biodiversity conservation  ap. 1695-1703.  aIncludes references  aDue to human population growth and migration, there will be nearly 2 billion new urban residents by 2030, yet the consequences of both current and future urbanization for biodiversity conservation are poorly known. Here we show that urban growth will have impacts on ecoregions, rare species, and protected areas that are localized but cumulatively significant. Currently, 29 of the world's 825 ecoregions have over one-third of their area urbanized, and these 29 ecoregions are the only home of 213 endemic terrestrial vertebrate species. Our analyses suggest that 8% of terrestrial vertebrate species on the IUCN Red List are imperiled largely because of urban development. By 2030, 15 additional ecoregions are expected to lose more than 5% of their remaining undeveloped area, and they contain 118 vertebrate species found nowhere else. Of the 779 rare species with only one known population globally, 24 are expected to be impacted by urban growth. In addition, the distance between protected areas and cities is predicted to shrink dramatically in some regions: for example, the median distance from a protected area to a city in Eastern Asia is predicted to fall from 43km to 23km by 2030. Most protected areas likely to be impacted by new urban growth (88%) are in countries of low to moderate income, potentially limiting institutional capacity to adapt to new anthropogenic stresses on protected areas. In short, trends in global ecoregions, rare species, and protected areas suggest localized but significant biodiversity degradation associated with current and upcoming urbanization. 3abiodiversity 3acities 3aconservation areas 3aecoregions 3ahuman growth 3aincome 3aprediction 3aurbanization 3avertebrates 3aEast Asia1 aKareiva, Peter1 aForman, Richard T.T.0 tBiological conservation.g2008 June, v. 141, no. 6 p.1695-1703dElsevier Science Ltd.x0006-32077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2008.04.025 7aarticle03680naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001800168245013300186300001800319500002400337520136700361650001501728650001401743650001301757650003401770650002901804650002301833650002001856650003101876650001201907650002301919650001101942650001401953650001801967650001401985650002201999650001302021650001502034650003202049650001702081650002702098650001202125650002102137650002002158650004002178650003402218650004302252650002102295650001402316650000902330650005002339650002402389650003802413650004302451650001502494650004202509650001802551700002002569700001602589700002902605700001502634700001902649700001402668700002002682700001602702700001702718773011402735852000902849856005202858655001202910IND4444253620221118104911.0101029e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444425362DNAL7 a201384942pmid7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Jia-jie10aDifferent mechanisms of cis-9,trans-11- and trans-10,cis-12- conjugated linoleic acid affecting lipid metabolism in 3T3-L1 cells  ap. 1099-1105.  aIncludes references  aConjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been shown to reduce body fat mass in various experimental animals. It is valuable to identify its influence on enzymes involved in energy expenditure, apoptosis, fatty acid oxidation and lipolysis. We investigated isomer-specific effects of high dose, long treatment of CLA (75.4 μmol/L, 8 days) on protein and gene expression of these enzymes in cultured 3T3-L1 cells. Proteomics identified significant up- or down-regulation of 52 proteins by either CLA isomer. Protein and gene expression of uncoupling protein (UCP) 1, UCP3, perilipin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α increased whereas UCP2 reduced for both CLA isomers. And eight-day treatment of trans-10,cis-12 CLA, but not cis-9,trans-11 CLA, significantly up-regulated protein and mRNA levels of PKA (P<.05), CPT-1 and TNF-α (P<.01). Compared to protein expression, both isomers did not significantly influence the mRNA expression of HSL, ATGL, ACO and leptin. In conclusion, high-dose, long treatment of cis-9,trans-11 CLA did not promote apoptosis, fatty acid oxidation and lipolysis in adipocytes, but may induce an increase in energy expenditure. trans-10,cis-12 CLA exhibited greater influence on lipid metabolism, stimulated adipocyte energy expenditure, apoptosis and fatty acid oxidation, but its effect on lipolysis was not obvious. 3aadipocytes 3aapoptosis 3abody fat 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3aenergy expenditure 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aisomers 3alaboratory animals 3aleptin 3alipolysis 3amessenger RNA 3aoxidation 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2a3T3-L1 Cells 2aAdipocytesxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCarrier Proteins 2aDown-Regulation 2aIon Channelsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLeptinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxmetabolism 2aLipid Metabolism 2aLipolysis 2aMice 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPPAR alphaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhosphoproteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProteomics 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aUp-Regulation1 aLiu, Zhao-liang1 aLi, Jie-mei1 aChen, J.

Although phytochrome action on cotyledon expansion is evident only after 36 h from sowing, the photoresponse escapes from reversibility at about 15 h from sowing. The time lag of 21 h between loss of photoreversibility and the onset of photoregulated cotyledon expansion indicates the existence of long-lived components in the phytochrome-triggered signal chain. Phytochrome-regulated cotyledon expansion does not require the involvement of photosynthesis, as application of SAN 9789, an inhibitor of chloroplast biogenesis, did not affect cotyledon expansion. The role of turgor pressure-related cellular parameters such as osmotic potential (pi), cell wall extensibility (m), hydraulic conductivity (L) and yield threshold (Y) for cell expansion were examined during photoregulated cotyledon expansion. Using the general equation of cell growth dv/dt = [Lm/(L + m)](delta pi - Y), where dv/dtis the rate of volumetric growth, it was demonstrated that the light-mediated cotyledon expansion results from an increase in cell wall extensibility (m). These results are discussed in relation to the photoregulation of cotyledon expansion. 3aSinapis alba 3acotyledons 3aphytochrome 3acell growth 3aturgor 3aosmotic pressure1 aSharma, R.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1988 Oct., v. 39, no. 207 p.1355-1366x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02301naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011600129300001800245520142600263650001301689650001401702650001601716650001001732650001201742650001501754650001601769653001101785700001701796700001701813773009201830852000901922930003301931946001101964655001201975IND8806192720221118105321.0881213e198810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880619272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, T.A.10aSalt stress causes acceleration of purine catabolism and inhibition of pyrimidine salvage in Zea mays root tips  ap. 1389-1395.  aNucleotide metabolism was studied in apical 5.0 mm root tips of cornplants (Zea mays L., cv. Pioneer 3906) hydroponically cultured for 7 d and thensalinized for 19 d at a rate calculated to reduce the osmotic potential (psi0) of the solutions by 0.1 MPad-1 to a final psi0 = -0.4 MPa. Saline treatments with two different molar ratios of Ca2+/Na+ were employed, viz., 0.03 (2.5 mol m-3 CaCl2 + 86.5 mol m-3 NaCl) for the NaCl treatment and 0.73 (31.5 mol m-3 CaCl2 + 43.1 mol m-3 NaCl) for the NaCl + CaCl2 treatment. Both salt treatmentsreduced root growth by more than 30%. The capacity of roots to provide purine nucleotides either by de novo synthesis or by re-utilization of existing bases,e.g. salvage of hypoxanthine to adenine nucleotides, was not affected by eithersalt treatment. However, catabolism of hypoxanthine was accelerated more than 3.5-fold by both salt treatments, demonstrating an increased capacity for purine catabolism which would shift the normal 1:1 ratio of synthesis:degradation of purine nucleotides observed for the roots of healthy control plants to less than 0.2 during salt stress. The ratio of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis: degradation was also reduced. In this case, the unfavourable shift toward nucleotide degradation resulted because both salt treatments reduced salvage capacity by more than 25%, but had no compensating effect on de novo synthesis or catabolism of pyrimidines. 3aZea mays 3aroot tips 3apyrimidines 3asalts 3apurines 3ametabolism 3anucleotides 0astress1 aLovatt, C.J.1 aNieman, R.H.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1988 Oct., v. 39, no. 207 p.1389-1395x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04014naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245021900125300001800344520306800362650001503430650001903445650001903464650001903483650001103502650001103513650002503524700001803549773009203567852000903659939003303668946001103701655001203712IND8806192820221118105301.0881213e198810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880619282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobe, W.E.10aC3 and CAM photosynthetic characteristics of the submerged aquatic macrophyte Littorella uniflora: regulation of leaf internal CO2 supply in response to variation in rooting substrate inorganic carbon concentration  ap. 1397-1410.  aThe relationships between CO2 concentrating mechanisms, photosynthetic efficiency and inorganic carbon supply have been investigated for the aquatic macrophyte Littorella uniflora. Plants were obtained from Esthwaite Water or a local reservoir, with the latter plants transplanted into a range of sediment types to alter CO2 supply around the roots. Free CO2 in sediment-interstitial-water ranged from 1.01 mol m-3 (Esthwaite), 0.79 mol m-3 (peat), 0.32 mol m-3 (silt) and 0.17 mol m-3 (sand), with plants maintained under PAR of 40 micromol m-2 s-1. A comparison of gross morphology of plants maintained under these conditions showed that the peat-grown plants with high sediment CO2 had larger leaf fresh weight (0.69 g) and total surface area (223 cm2 g-1 fr. wt. including lacunal surface area) than the sand-grown plants (0.21 g and 196 cm2 g-1) fr. wt. respectively). Root fresh weights were similar forall treatments. In contrast, leaf internal CO2 concentration [CO2]i was highestin the sand-grown plants (2.69 mol m-3, corresponding to approximately 6.5% CO2in air) and lowest in the Esthwaite plants (1.08 mol m-3). Expression of CAM intransplants was also greatest in the low CO2 regime, with deltaH+ (measured as dawn-dusk titratable acidity) of 50 micromol g-1 fr. wt., similar to Esthwaite plants in natural sediment. Assuming typical CAM stoichiometry, decarboxylationof malate could account largely for the measured [CO2]i and would make a major contribution to daytime CO2 fixation in vivo. A range of leaf sections (0.2, 1 .0, 5.0 and 17.0 mm) was used to evaluate diffusion limitation and to select a suitable size for comparative studies of photosynthetic O2 evolution. The longer leaf sections (17.0 mm), which were sealed and included the leaf tip, were diffusion-limited with a linear response to incremental addition of CO2 and 1.0 mol m-3 exogenous CO2 was required to saturate photosynthesis. Shorter leaf sections were less diffusion-limited, with the greatest photosynthetic capacity (36 micromol O2 g-1 fr. wt. h-1) obtained from the 1.0 mm size and were not infiltrated by the incubating medium. Comparative studies with 1.0 mm sections from plants grown in the different sediment types revealed that the photosynthetic capacity of the sand-grown plants was greatest (45 micromol O2 g-1 fr. wt. h-1) with a K0.5 of 80 mmol m-3. In terms of light response, saturation of photosynthesis in tissue slices occurred at 850-1000 micromol m-2s-1 although light compensation points (6- 11 micromol m-2 s-1) and chlorophylla:b ratios (1.3) were low. While CO2 and PAR responses were obtained using varying numbers of sections with a constant fresh weight, the relationships between photosynthetic capacity and CO2 supply or PAR were maintained when the data were expressed on a chlorophyll basis. It is concluded that under low PAR,CO2 concentrating mechanisms interact in intact plants to maintain saturating CO2 levels within leaf lacunae, although the responses of the various components of CO2 supply to PAR require further investigation. 3aLittorella 3aaquatic plants 3acarbon dioxide 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaves 3acarbon 3abiochemical pathways1 aGriffiths, H.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1988 Oct., v. 39, no. 207 p.1397-1410x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03087naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100001500155245010300170300001800273500002400291520150700315650001701822650003001839650002101869650002301890650001801913650001701931650001401948650003101962650005201993650003302045650003502078650002602113650002102139650003702160650001802197650002102215650001102236650003302247650003102280700001902311700002002330700002302350700001702373700002402390773010702414852000902521856003902530655001202569IND4445763220221118105307.0101126e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444576322DNAL7 a205645022pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.32132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaria, Ana10aBlueberry anthocyanins and pyruvic acid adducts: anticancer properties in breast cancer cell lines  ap. 1862-1869.  aIncludes references  aThe purpose of this study was to investigate the anticancer properties of an anthocyanin‐pyruvic acid adduct extract, which is being developed aiming to be further applied in the food industry. An anthocyanin extract from blueberry (extract I) and an anthocyanin‐pyruvic acid adduct extract (extract II) were tested on two breast cancer cell lines (MDA‐MB‐231 and MCF7). Proliferation was assessed by SRB assay and ³H‐thymidine incorporation. Caspase‐3 activity was determined in the presence of both extracts. Their capacity as chemoattractants and their invasive potential were also assayed. In both cell lines, extracts I and II significantly reduced cell proliferation at 250 μg/mL, after 24 h of cell incubation. Caspase‐3 activity was not altered by the extracts (250 μg/mL) in either cell line, with the exception of extract II in MCF‐7, which increased its activity, probably explaining its effects on cell proliferation. Both extracts (250 μg/mL) demonstrated significant antiinvasive potential in both cell lines. Furthermore, they did not demonstrate any capacity for chemotaxis. In conclusion, blueberry anthocyanins and the respective anthocyanin‐pyruvic acid adducts demonstrated anticancer properties by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and by acting as cell antiinvasive factors and chemoinhibitors. The anthocyanin‐pyruvic acid adduct extract showed a more pronounced effect in MDA‐MB‐231, suggesting an effect independent of estrogen receptors. 3aanthocyanins 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3abreast neoplasms 3acell proliferation 3afood industry 3apyruvic acid 3areceptors 2aAnthocyaninsxpharmacology 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxpharmacology 2aBlueberry Plantsxchemistry. 2aBreast Neoplasmsxdrug therapy 2aCaspase 3xmetabolism 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCell Survival 2aFruitxchemistry 2aHumans 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPyruvic Acidxpharmacology1 aPestana, Diogo1 aTeixeira, Diana1 ade Freitas, Victor1 aMateus, Nuno1 aCalhau, Conceição0 tPhytotherapy research.g2010 Dec., v. 24, no. 12 p.1862-1869dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.3213 7aarticle03126naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002200181245016800203300001800371500002400389506007600413520144000489506003701929650002201966650001701988650002602005650001302031650001702044650001502061650002102076650001302097650003002110650003702140650001802177650001402195650001602209651001102225700002002236700002002256700001702276700002102293700002202314700002402336700002302360773013602383852000902519856008002528655001202608IND4420231320221207141300.0090508e20090515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442023132DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02730-082doi7 aPMC26816602pmcid7 a192867872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJørgensen, Hanne10aCandicidin Biosynthesis Gene Cluster Is Widely Distributed among Streptomyces spp. Isolated from the Sediments and the Neuston Layer of the Trondheim Fjord, Norway  ap. 3296-3303.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA large number of Streptomyces bacteria with antifungal activity isolated from samples collected in the Trondheim fjord (Norway) were found to produce polyene compounds. Investigation of polyene-containing extracts revealed that most of the isolates produced the same compound, which had an atomic mass and UV spectrum corresponding to those of candicidin D. The morphological diversity of these isolates prompted us to speculate about the involvement of a mobile genetic element in dissemination of the candicidin biosynthesis gene cluster (can). Eight candicidin-producing isolates were analyzed by performing a 16S rRNA gene-based taxonomic analysis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, PCR, and Southern blot hybridization with can-specific probes. These analyses revealed that most of the isolates were related, although they were morphologically diverse, and that all of them contained can genes. The majority of the isolates studied contained large plasmids, and two can-specific probes hybridized to a 250-kb plasmid in one isolate. Incubation of the latter isolate at a high temperature resulted in loss of the can genes and candicidin production, while mating of the "cured" strain with a plasmid-containing donor restored candicidin production. The latter result suggested that the 250-kb plasmid contains the complete can gene cluster and could be responsible for conjugative transfer of this cluster to other streptomycetes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSouthern blotting 3aStreptomyces 3aantifungal properties 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3acandicidin 3amultigene family 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3atemperature 3aNorway1 aFjærvik, Espen1 aHakvåg, Sigrid1 aBruheim, Per1 aBredholt, Harald1 aKlinkenberg, Geir1 aEllingsen, Trond E.1 aZotchev, Sergey B.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2009 May 15, v. 75, no. 10 p.3296-3303dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02730-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04553naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245011500185300001600300500002400316520235800340650001002698650002402708650002702732650001002759650002402769650002002793650001802813650002102831650002402852650002002876650001802896650002302914650002402937650000902961650002202970650002102992650001403013650001103027650002203038650001403060650001803074650000903092650001803101650002103119650001703140650004503157650001203202650001403214650001803228650003803246650003603284650004903320650002803369650002403397650002003421650001903441650005203460651001803512700001703530700001803547700002203565700001803587700001703605773012803622852000903750856004803759655001203807IND4419051920221118105751.0090410e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441905192DNAL7 a191654102pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-008-9281-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFairchild, J.

Herbicides are frequently applied as weed control measures in forest and rangeland ecosystems that frequently overlap with critical habitats of threatened and endangered fish species. However, there is little published chronic toxicity data for herbicides and fish that can be used to assess ecological risk of herbicides in aquatic environments. We conducted 96-h flowthrough acute and 30-day chronic toxicity studies with swim-up larvae and juvenile rainbow trout (Onchorhyncus mykiss) exposed to the free acid form of 2,4-D. Juvenile rainbow trout were acutely sensitive to 2,4-D acid equivalent at 494 mg/L (95% confidence interval [CI] 334-668 mg/L; 96-h ALC₅₀). Accelerated life-testing procedures, used to estimate chronic mortality from acute data, predicted that a 30-day exposure of juvenile rainbow trout to 2,4-D would result in 1% and 10% mortality at 260 and 343 mg/L, respectively. Swim-up larvae were chronically more sensitive than juveniles using growth as the measurement end point. The 30-day lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC) of 2,4-D on growth of swim-up larvae was 108 mg/L, whereas the 30-day no observable effect concentration (NOEC) was 54 mg/L. The 30-day maximum acceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) of 2,4-D for rainbow trout, determined as the geometric mean of the NOEC and the LOEC, was 76 mg/L. The acute:chronic ratio was 6.5 (i.e., 494/76). We observed no chronic effects on growth of juvenile rainbow trout at the highest concentration tested (108 mg/L). Worst-case aquatic exposures to 2,4-D (4 mg/L) occur when the herbicide is directly applied to aquatic ecosystems for aquatic weed control and resulted in a 30-day safety factor of 19 based on the MATC for growth (i.e., 76/4). Highest nontarget aquatic exposures to 2,4-D applied following terrestrial use is calculated at 0.136 mg/L and resulted in a 30-day safety factor of 559 (e.g., 76/0.163). Assessment of the exposure and response data presented herein indicates that use of 2,4-D acid for invasive weed control in aquatic and terrestrial habitats poses no substantial risk to growth or survival of rainbow trout or other salmonids, including the threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus). 3a2,4-D 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aSalvelinus confluentus 3aacids 3aaquatic environment 3aaquatic habitat 3aaquatic weeds 3achronic toxicity 3aconfidence interval 3acontrol methods 3adose response 3aendangered species 3aexposure assessment 3afish 3aforest ecosystems 3ainvasive species 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3along term effects 3amortality 3anoxious weeds 3arisk 3asafety factor 3atoxicity testing 3aweed control 2a2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acidxtoxicity 2aAnimals 2aEcosystem 2aEcotoxicology 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aHerbicidesxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aLife Cycle Stagesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aLongevityxdrug effects 2aOncorhynchus mykiss 2aRisk Assessment 2aToxicity Tests 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxtoxicity. 3aUnited States1 aFeltz, K.

Comparison of geochemical results with World Health Organization, United States Environmental Protection Agency, and Indian Standard Institution drinking water standards shows that all groundwater samples except few are suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes. The major groundwater pollutions are nitrate and phosphate ions due to sewage effluents and fertilizer applications. The study reveals that the groundwater quality changed due to anthropogenic and natural influence such as agricultural, natural weathering process. 3adrinking 3aions 3agroundwater contamination 3awater quality 3airrigation 3afertilizer application 3awatersheds 3aphosphates 3asewage effluent 3aanthropogenic activities 3adrinking water 3aWorld Health Organization 3agroundwater 3anitrates 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aRiversxchemistry 2aWater Movements 2aWater Supplyxanalysis. 3aUnited States 3aIndia 0aIndia 0aGroundwater quality assessment 0aGeochemical process 0aMajor ions 0aEnvironmental Protection Agency 0aManimuktha River basin 0aHydrogeochemistry1 aRammohan, V.1 aSahayam, J.

Light intensity is one of the main factors affecting photosynthate production and allocation, and grain yield. This study was conducted to determine whether cultivars varying in grain number per spike and grain weight respond differently to pre-anthesis shading (PRE) and post-anthesis shading (POST), and to characterize the responses in production and allocation of photosynthate, yield and yield components, and spike traits. Both PRE and POST caused a decrease in both dry matter (DM) accumulation and allocation to grain. Cultivar Lumai 22, which has a large spike and large grains, was more sensitive to either PRE or POST. PRE reduced photosynthate production and partitioning to the spike in Lumai 22 at anthesis. In contrast, PRE had little influence on these parameters in the small-spike, small-grain cultivar Yannong 15. POST reduced the partitioning to the grain, especially in Lumai 22, for which marked reductions in biomass and grain yield were found for both the PRE and POST treatments. Changes in yield components attributable to shading varied with cultivars. The number of spikes m(−2) was not affected by either PRE or POST. Lumai 22 was more seriously affected by shading than Yannong 15 in terms of grain number per spike and weight per grain. The decreases in grain number or weight per spikelet in both the PRE and POST treatments took place mainly in the upper and basal spikelets, especially in Lumai 22. We concluded that the adaptability of the small-spike, small-grain cultivar Yannong 15 to either PRE or POST was much greater than that of the large-spike, large-grain cultivar Lumai 22 in terms of many characteristics closely related to grain yield. Hence, we suggest that, in areas where low light intensity often occurs, the small-spike, small-grain cultivar would be more likely to produce high, stable grain yields. 3acultivars 3agrain yield 3alight intensity 3aphotosynthates 3ashade 3awheat 3ayield components1 aYin, Y.1 aHe, M.1 aZhang, Y.1 aLu, S.1 aLi, Q.1 aShi, S.0 tJournal of agronomy and crop science.g2003 Oct., v. 189, no. 5 p.280-285dBlackwell Wissenschafts-Verlagx0931-22507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-037X.2003.00041.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02964naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245011500170300001400285500002400299520176200323650002002085650001202105650001102117650001602128650001002144650001602154650001302170650001202183650001302195650001202208650001102220650002102231650001302252650001002265650001102275700001602286700001402302773012502316852000902441856009202450655001202542IND4474920420221118105528.0131213s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447492042DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-037X.2003.00009.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFornasier, F.10aVariation in Crown and Root Organic Reserves Among Lucerne Genotypes of Different Morphology and Flower Colour  ap. 63-70.  aIncludes references  aPrevious evidence indicates that differences in the concentration of underground organic reserves can drive the survival and growing ability of lucerne under cold and defoliation stresses. In order to provide the selection process with further information on compounds that may influence plant performance under grazing, we assessed variations in cold-season concentrations of nitrogen and carbon reserves on genotypes that had been identified for morphological features that possibly enhance grazing tolerance. The selected genotypes encompassed distinct morphological patterns (defined as ‘models’) and different taxa within the Medicago sativa complex, as shown by different flower colours. Crown concentrations of reserves were determined on 90 genotypes, whereas root concentrations were measured on a subsample of 15 genotypes. Wide intergenotypic variation was observed for all reserve substances. Comparisons among models and among flower colour classes highlighted the high concentrations of crown carbohydrates and root and crown-soluble proteins of the model coded as ‘D1’, characterized by prostrate, rhizomatous habit and long dormancy, which largely corresponded to plants with yellow or variegated flowers, typical of ssp. falcata and × varia, respectively. There was a strong ‘flower colour × storage organ’ interaction for sugar concentration, and the results suggested a preferential compartment of sugars in the roots of purple-flowered genotypes that belonged to the ssp. sativa. A rank correlation analysis indicated a positive relationship between persistence after two years under grazing of half-sib progenies deriving from 19 genotypes out of the 90 and crown concentrations of carbohydrates of the 19 mother plants. 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3acarbon 3acold season 3acolor 3adefoliation 3adormancy 3aflowers 3agenotype 3agrazing 3amodels 3anitrogen content 3aproteins 3aroots 3asugars1 aPecetti, L.1 aPiano, E.0 tJournal of agronomy and crop science.g2003 Apr., v. 189, no. 2 p.63-70dBlackwell Wissenschafts-Verlagx0931-22507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-037X.2003.00009.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02087naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245005900169300001600228500002400244520105300268650002201321650002501343650001901368650002001387650001701407650002601424650001601450650002001466700001701486700001801503773012701521852000901648856009201657655001201749IND4475036520221118105605.0131219s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447503652DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-037X.2002.00575.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuroszek, P.10aPhotocontrol of weed germination of arable annual weed  ap. 389-397.  aIncludes references  aField studies were conducted to test the effect of light during soil tillage on the emergence of common weed species.

The average reduction of weed density attributable to photocontrol was 28.4 %. Results of field trials in the literature suggest that the emergence of Chenopodium album, Matricaria species and Stellaria media is especially reduced by nighttime tillage practices, but photocontrol had almost no effect on the emergence of Galium aparine and Polygonum convolvulus. The level of reduction of weed emergence after nighttime tillage was very variable. Important factors affecting this variation were: (1) the different light sensitivities of weed species, (2) the different light sensitivities of populations within one species, (3) the dormancy status of the seeds in a natural seed bank, and (4) the variation of light sensitivity of seeds. 3aChenopodium album 3aFallopia convolvulus 3aGalium aparine 3aStellaria media 3aannual weeds 3afield experimentation 3agermination 3areduced tillage1 aGerhards, R.1 aKühbauch, W.0 tJournal of agronomy and crop science.g2002 Dec., v. 188, no. 6 p.389-397dBlackwell Wissenschafts-Verlagx0931-22507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-037X.2002.00575.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02288naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245007700169300001600246500002400262520134100286650001501627650001501642650001801657650001501675650001901690650001401709650001201723650001101735773012701746852000901873856009201882655001201974IND4474920820221118105548.0131213s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447492082DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-037X.2003.00010.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPassos, L.P.10aEffects of Osmotic Stress on the Growth of Etiolated Mung Bean Seedlings  ap. 105-112.  aIncludes references  aThe alterations in growth and water status of dark-grown mung bean tissues following sudden osmotic stress were investigated. Photographic measurements of hypocotyl elongation revealed that stress (−0.2 to −0.8 MPa) induced growth cessation within one minute, with resumption occurring at lower rates after a latent period; periods which tended to increase in accordance with whether the seedlings were 4, 5 or 6 days old. Tissue water status was related to growth as water and osmotic potentials were highest in the expanded root region and the lowest in the growing hypocotyl region. These rankings were not verified under osmotic stress, and values were reduced in the course of 24 h. Turgor levels were similar in all tissues and were not altered by stress. The responses were not caused by substantial water loss, which was detected only after 24 h of stress, and could have resulted from the accumulation of osmotic solutes. The results indicate that plants exposed to sudden osmotic stress, besides exhibiting rapid growth cessation, show growth resumption at lower rates and no subsequent short-term changes in any water status measure of the growing region. Because growth resumes without further detectable turgor increments, water status alterations are unlikely to be the cause of the observed immediate growth stoppage. 3aetiolation 3ahypocotyls 3alatent period 3amung beans 3aosmotic stress 3aseedlings 3asolutes 3aturgor0 tJournal of agronomy and crop science.g2003 Apr., v. 189, no. 2 p.105-112dBlackwell Wissenschafts-Verlagx0931-22507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-037X.2003.00010.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02468naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002100141245011000162300001400272500002400286520127000310650001201580650001201592650001601604650002001620650001801640650001901658650002301677650002101700650002201721650001801743650001601761650001901777650002001796773010601816852000901922856008101931856007002012655001202082IND4475039920221118105547.0131220s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447503992DNAL7 a10.1300/J064v23n02_062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWichelns, Dennis10aPolicy recommendations to enhance farm-level use of fertilizer and irrigation water in sub-Saharan Africa  ap. 53-77.  aIncludes references  aFood production per capita has declined in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years, as population has increased faster than agricultural production. The causes of slow growth in agricultural productivity include poor soil fertility, insufficient use of chemical and organic supplemental fertilizer, and inadequate investments in irrigation systems and other infrastructure. In addition, government policies that have taxed agriculture heavily have limited the farm-level accumulation of capital and discouraged farmers from making the investments needed to enhance productivity. This paper describes public policies and investments that will enhance the farm-level availability and use of fertilizer and water resources, with the ultimate goals of improving food production and rural incomes, and enhancing food security. Examples include enabling farmers to obtain market prices for their output, requiring them to pay per-unit prices for irrigation water and fertilizer, and supporting investments in infrastructure and institutions that will enhance the delivery of water and fertilizer to remote, rural areas. Public investments and policies that lead to higher rates of growth in agricultural productivity may generate substantial public benefits in many countries. 3acapital 3afarmers 3afertilizers 3afood production 3afood security 3ainfrastructure 3airrigation systems 3airrigation water 3aissues and policy 3amarket prices 3arural areas 3asoil fertility 3awater resources0 tJournal of sustainable agriculture.g2003, v. 23, no. 2 p.53-77dFood Products Pressx1044-00467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J064v23n02_063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://10.1300/J064v23n02_063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03046naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002100141245010500162300001600267500002400283520169400307650001202001650002802013650001002041650001202051650003002063650001402093650001302107650001302120650001302133650001602146650001102162650001802173650001802191650001002209650001502219650001902234700002202253700002302275700002202298773010802320852000902428856008102437856007002518655001202588IND4475040220221118105615.0131220s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447504022DNAL7 a10.1300/J064v23n02_092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRitchey, K.

Use of goats (Capra hircus) at high stocking densities to clear unwanted shrubs from abandoned pasture during renovation increases the probability of multiple depositions of urine. We hypothesized that applying limestone early in the pasture restoration process would favor ammonia (NH3) volatilization. This would increase the area over which N was distributed and reduce the potential for localized nitrate pollution, although atmospheric NH3 loading would be increased. To study the effect of surface limestone application on NH3 generation, we collected 32 soil profile columns with intact vegetation from an abandoned pasture in southern WV. Urine was applied 18 weeks after surface application of 6720 kg/ha (6000 lb/ac) limestone. Columns received one, two, or three applications of 100 mL goat urine, adding a total of 9.8, 31.7, and 66.4 g/m2 N, respectively. The amount of NH3 increased markedly with increased urine application. Ammonia production decreased exponentially with time after each addition. Overall, limed columns generated 132% more NH3 than unlimed columns. Dry matter production was highest in the treatment receiving two urine applications and lowest in the control receiving no urine. Three urine applications damaged plants; this scorching was correlated with amount of NH3 generated. With time, plant cover in damaged treatments recuperated, with broadleaf plants tending to replace grass. Surface limestone application increased the amount of urine N transformed to NH3 gas, especially where there were multiple urine deposits. 3aammonia 3adry matter accumulation 3agoats 3agrasses 3agroundwater contamination 3alimestone 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apastures 3aprobability 3ashrubs 3asoil profiles 3astocking rate 3aurine 3avegetation 3avolatilization1 aBoyer, Douglas G.1 aTurner, Kenneth E.1 aSnuffer, J.

The developmental stage of the crop exposed to increased temperatures will determine the severity of possible damage experienced by the plant. It is not known whether or not the damaging effects of heat episodes occurring at different phenological stages are additive. In the present study, the interaction of high-temperature events applied at the stages of double ridges and anthesis in Triticum aestivum (L.) cv. Chablis was investigated. Biomass accumulation of control plants and that of plants experiencing high temperatures during the double-ridge stage were similar and were reduced by 40 % when plants were subjected to a heat event at anthesis. Grain number on the main and side tillers declined by 41 %, and individual grain weight declined by 45 % with heat stress applied at the double-ridge stage and anthesis or at anthesis alone. The harvest index was reduced from 0.53 to 0.33. Nitrogen contents in leaves were reduced by 10 % at the double-ridge stage and by 25 % at anthesis. The maximum rates of CO(2) assimilation increased with heat stress at the double-ridge stage and higher rates were maintained throughout the growing season. The results clearly indicate that an extreme heat event at the double-ridge stage does not affect subsequent growth or the response of wheat to heat stress at anthesis. 3aflowering 3anitrogen content 3awheat 3aheat stress 3agrowing season 3aTriticum aestivum 3aharvest index 3abiomass production 0adevelopmental stages1 aPorter, J.R.1 aSchellberg, J.0 tJournal of agronomy and crop science.g2003 June, v. 189, no. 3 p.142-150dBlackwell Wissenschafts-Verlagx0931-22507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-037X.2003.00025.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02094naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245005700157300001600214500002400230520112600254650001201380650002601392650001601418650001101434650001501445650002401460650002201484700001801506700001701524700001701541773010801558852000901666856008101675655001201756IND4475047620221118105621.0131220s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447504762DNAL7 a10.1300/J064v22n01_092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, O.H.10aProduction of humic acid from pineapple leaf residue  ap. 113-124.  aIncludes references  aThe study was carried out with the following objectives: (i) to quantify the amount of humic acid (HA) that could be extracted from composted pineapple leaf residue using potassium hydroxide (KOH) produced from pineapple leaf residue, and (ii) to compare the elemental composition, functional groups, and spectral characteristics of HA extracted from composted pineapple leaf using 0.1 M KOH from pineapple leaf and that of analytical grade (0.1 M KOH). The 0.1 M KOH from pineapple leaf residue extracted 20% HA from composted pineapple leaf residue while that of the analytical grade (0.1 M KOH) extracted 30%. The elemental composition (C, H, N, O, and S), functional groups (carboxylic, phenolic OH, and total acidity), and spectral characteristics of the HA extracted using the 2 extractants were generally similar. Potassium hydroxide from pineapple leaves can be used to extract some reasonable amount of HA without appreciably altering the elemental and functional groups constitution as well as the spectral characteristics.

A simple four hour test (the Solvita® maturity test) that measures CO2 evolution and ammonia emission from compost samples was compared to a traditional three-day, 25°C, CO2 evolution rate procedure and to measurements of ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations in manure composts to assess the reliability of this test. Three composts - 1) Dairy manure amended with wheat straw, 2) The same dairy manure but amended with sawdust and 3) Swine manure amended with sawdust and ground wood pallets - were composted in windrows for 120 days. Samples were removed weekly to biweekly. CO2 evolution rates of the three composts decreased from initial means (n=6) of 3.41, 3.42 and 9.35 to 0.63, 0.76 and 0.31 mg CO2-C g-1 VS day-1, for the dairy manure-straw, dairy manure-sawdust, hog manure composts, respectively. The corresponding mean Solvita CO2 test values for these composts increased from 3.4, 3.0 and 3.2 to 6.8, 6.5 and 7.0, respectively. Correlation analysis between CO2 evolution rates and Solvita CO2 test values gave linear correlation coefficients (r) of −0.82, −0.78, and −0.87 for the straw-amended dairy manure, the sawdust-amended dairy and the hog manure composts, respectively. The Solvita NH3 test gave highly significant correlations (p<0.0001) with ammoniacal-N concentrations (correlation coefficients (r) = −0.43, −0.64 and −0.65, respectively). The Solvita® maturity index, a combination of Solvita CO2 and NH3 values, correlated significantly with both CO2 evolution rate and ammoniacal-N concentrations. However, the Solvita CO2 index alone was the best predictor of compost CO2 evolution rate or stability. The Solvita Maturity test, which combines the Solvita CO2 and NH3 tests, provided useful information about the potential for the development of a toxic response in plants due to excessive concentrations of ammoniacal-N present in some stable compost samples that would not have been detected if the CO2 stability test were used by itself. We conclude that the Solvita maturity test provided a simple, inexpensive relative test of compost stability and NH3 emission for diverse samples of composted manures. Even so, it did not accurately predict their CO2 evolution rates measured by respirometry nor their ammoniacal-N concentrations. The test would be most useful for on-farm applications. 3aammonia 3acarbon dioxide 3acompost stability 3acomposted manure 3acorrelation 3adairy manure 3afarmers 3anitrogen content 3apallets 3apig manure 3asawdust 3atoxicity 3awheat straw 3awood1 aWang, P.1 aWatson, M.E.1 aHoitink, H.A.J.1 aMichel, F.C.

May DMWs averaged across three years were 4650, 3130, 1300, 707, and 247 kg/ha for the September 2, 16, October 1,16, and November 3 plantings, respectively. 3aVicia villosa 3abiomass 3afurrow irrigation 3aplanting date 3aspring 3asteppes 3aNew Mexico 3aRocky Mountain region1 aMartin, Charles A.0 tJournal of sustainable agriculture.g2003, v. 22, no. 3 p.17-23dFood Products Pressx1044-00467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J064v22n03_043Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03059naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001600142245004500158300001500203500002400218520156500242650001601807650001701823650001101840650001001851650003101861650001501892650002701907650001401934650001301948650002801961650001001989650001701999651001502016651001102031700001702042700001802059700001802077700001602095700001602111700002002127700001702147700001602164700001702180700002002197700001602217700001402233700001602247700001402263700001802277773010702295852000902402856008202411655001202493IND4475042920221118110137.0131220s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447504292DNAL7 a10.1300/J064v22n03_0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancis, C.10aAgroecology: the ecology of food systems  ap. 99-118.  aIncludes references  aWe present a compelling rationale for defining agroecology as the ecology of food systems. Our purpose is to provide a framework that will guide research, education, and action in the multiple and interacting facets of an increasingly complex global agriculture and food system. To accomplish such goals, it is essential to build bridges and connections among and beyond our disciplines in production agriculture, as well as beyond the farm gate into the rural landscape and community. Fields of sociology, anthropology, environmental sciences, ethics, and economics are crucial to the mix. They provide additional vantage points from which we can view the food system anew, as well as insights on how to establish valuation criteria beyond neoclassical economics. Examples from Mexico, California, and the Nordic Region are used to illustrate the successful implementation of this educational strategy in universities. Design of individual farms using principles of ecology is expanded to the levels of landscape, community, and bioregion, with emphasis on uniqueness of place and the people and other species that inhabit that place. We conclude that defining agroecology as the ecology of food systems will foster the development of broader interdisciplinary research teams and attractive systems-based courses for tomorrow's best students. In contrast to the narrow focus on crop-soil interactions, this definition will help us raise higher-level research questions whose solutions will advance the development of a sustainable agriculture and food system. 3aagroecology 3aanthropology 3aethics 3afarms 3ainterdisciplinary research 3alandscapes 3aneoclassical economics 3asociology 3astudents 3asustainable agriculture 3ateams 3auniversities 3aCalifornia 3aMexico1 aLieblein, G.1 aGliessman, S.1 aBreland, T.A.1 aCreamer, N.1 aHarwood, R.1 aSalomonsson, L.1 aHelenius, J.1 aRickerl, D.1 aSalvador, R.1 aWiedenhoeft, M.1 aSimmons, S.1 aAllen, P.1 aAltieri, M.1 aFlora, C.1 aPoincelot, R.0 tJournal of sustainable agriculture.g2003, v. 22, no. 3 p.99-118dFood Products Pressx1044-00467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J064v22n03_0103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01849naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001700141245011400158300001400272500002400286520074100310650001901051650001101070650001901081650001901100650002801119650001401147650003301161650002201194650002201216651001701238700001701255700001901272773010601291852000901397856008101406655001201487IND4475044920221118110139.0131220s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447504492DNAL7 a10.1300/J064v22n02_062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelcher, Ken13aAn agroecosystem scale evaluation of the sustainability implications of carbon tax and carbon credit policies  ap. 75-97.  aIncludes references  aThis paper uses an agroecosystem simulation model to evaluate the impact of carbon tax and carbon credit policies on both the sustainability of a regional agroecosystem and the net emission of carbon dioxide from the agroecosystem.

The A-horizon of the Alfisol at the site had a coarse texture which was rapidly degraded by continuous cropping. A split-plot experiment with 4 replications, which was established in 1989, was used for the study. The fallow systems comprising natural fallow, Pueraria phaseoloides and Leucaena leucocephala were mainplots whereas 25, 33, 50 and 100% cropping intensities were subplots. During the continuous cropping or 1-year cropping after 1-year to 3-year fallow periods, intercrops of maize (cv. DMR-SR-W TZ8843) and cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz, cv. TMS 30572) were cultivated. Surface (0-15 cm depth) soil bulk density, soil strength, aggregate stability, and water retention were measured. Also, intercropped maize root density, and grain yields were evaluated. Surface soil bulk density ranged from 1.18 g cm"3 (25% cropping intensity) to 1.31 g cm−3 (100% cropping intensity), with significant differences between the 100% and 25% and between the 100% and 33% cropping intensities. Soil aggregate stability and soil strength followed a similar trend of low to high rating as cropping intensities increased. Although soil water retention was generally similar, the fractal dimensions of soil pore, D, between 2.92 and 2.93 indicated high irregularities of the pores. This irregularity was attributed to low stability of soil of the aggregates of the coarse-textured soil. The effects of fallow were obscured by the coarse-textured surface soil, and might not be noticed at all if the topmost layer (0-5 cm) of soil was not sampled. Intercropped maize grain yields ranging from 2.6 to 3.8 t ha−1 with 25% cropping intensity, between 1.7 and 2.0 t ha−1 with 33% cropping intensity and from 0.6 to 1.3 t ha−1 with continuous cropping were observed. Crop growth and yield were enhanced by low cropping intensities (25 and 33%) of any of the fallow management systems. 3aAlfisols 3aLeucaena leucocephala 3aManihot esculenta 3aPueraria phaseoloides 3aZea mays 3aaggregate stability 3acassava 3acoarse-textured soils 3acontinuous cropping 3acorn 3afallow 3afractal dimensions 3agrain yield 3aintercropping 3amanagement systems 3asoil aggregates 3asoil density 3asoil pore system 3asoil strength 3asoil water retention 3atexture 3aNigeria0 tJournal of sustainable agriculture.g2003, v. 22, no. 2 p.133-147dFood Products Pressx1044-00467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J064v22n02_093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01910naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002300142245017200165300001600337500002400353520080100377650002701178650002001205650000901225650001201234650002301246650001001269650001901279650001301298651000901311700002101320700002501341773010301366852000901469856008201478655001201560IND4474908920221118110138.0131213s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447490892DNAL7 a10.1080/089419203091872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDougherty, Erin M.14aThe Influence of Gender on the Relationship Between Wildlife Value Orientations, Beliefs, and the Acceptability of Lethal Deer Control in Cuyahoga Valley National Park  ap. 603-623.  aIncludes references  aThis study examines how wildlife value orientations, attitudes, and gender influence acceptance of lethal actions to control deer in Cuyahoga Valley National Park in Ohio.

Forage Production in a Cool Maritime Climate  ap. 273-279.  aIncludes references  aGrowing barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in the year of forage establishment is a common agronomic practice in marginal growing regions, but is often not recommended to growers. We examined the effect of silage barley production over an establishing timothy (Phleum pratense L.)-clover (Trifolium pratense L.; Trifolium hybridum L.) forage sward in a 4-year study near St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada. The experiment compared two barley varieties differing in plant height (semidwarf Chapais and Leger), three barley seeding rates and the effect of a forage understorey on forage (barley) production in the establishment year and forage (timothy-clover) production in the subsequent year. The taller Leger yielded similar forage biomass to Chapais in the year of forage establishment, which (when planted at 375 plants m(−2)) was roughly twice that of a pure-stand timothy-clover mix. Increasing the barley seeding rate from 125 to 375 plants m(−2) resulted in a linear increase in forage yield in the year of planting. The production of barley forage in the establishment year resulted in reduced timothy-clover forage yield in the year following barley planted at 125 and 375 seeds m(−2), but not for barley planted at 250 seeds m(−2). Companion planting also altered forage species composition in that higher barley seeding rates resulted in 12–18 % less timothy and 2–4 % lower fibre levels in the year following planting. Barley seeded at rates of 250–375 seeds m(−2) and undersown with a timothy-clover mixture (harvested at mid-milk) resulted in greater forage yield of poorer quality than pure-stand timothy-clover in the planting year, and a barley seeding rate of 250 seeds m(−2) did not impede forage production in the subsequent year. 3aHordeum vulgare 3aPhleum pratense 3aTrifolium hybridum 3aTrifolium pratense 3abarley 3abiomass 3acompanion crops 3aforage 3aforage production 3aforage yield 3agrowers 3amaritime climate 3aplanting 3aseeds 3asilage 3asowing 3aspecies diversity 3asward 3aunderstory 3aCanada1 aTodd, A.G.0 tJournal of agronomy and crop science.g2003 Oct., v. 189, no. 5 p.273-279dBlackwell Wissenschafts-Verlagx0931-22507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-037X.2003.00038.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02669naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005600126300001600182500016700198500002400365500001500389520116700404650000901571650002401580650002601604650001701630650001601647650001701663650002801680650002101708650002301729650002401752650001401776650001201790650001101802650002201813650002001835650001401855650003401869651001001903653001701913700001801930700001801948773012401966852000902090856008802099655001202187IND4474854920221118110154.0131211s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447485492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilardi, G.10aNew diseases of wild and cultivated rocket in Italy  ap. 569-572.  aPaper presented at the Fifth International Symposium on Brassicas and Eighteenth Crucifer Genetics Workshop, held November 12 - November 16, 2012, Catania, Italy.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aDuring the past ten years several diseases caused by soil-borne and foliar pathogens were observed for the first time in Italy on wild (Diplotaxis tenuifolia) and cultivated (Eruca sativa) rocket grown in intensive cropping systems for fresh cut production. This sector is particularly exposed to the risk of the emergence of new diseases as a consequence of its dynamism, specialization and use of intensive cultivation techniques. Two Fusarium wilts have been observed in Italy on wild and cultivated rocket. Among soil-borne pathogens, attacks of Rhizoctonia solani, and Pythium spp. were increasingly observed. Among foliar diseases, downy mildew of wild rocket and a leaf spot of wild and cultivated rocket caused by Alternaria japonica were recently observed. A new leaf spots caused by Fusarium equiseti, was observed for the first time in the world on Eruca sativa. During spring 2012, symptoms of an unusual leaf spot caused by Plectosphaerella cucumerina were observed in several commercial greenhouses near Salerno (southern Italy) on plants of D. tenuifolia.

Here we report the map-based cloning of Crr1a, a gene conferring resistance to clubroot in Brassica rapa. Crr1a(G004) encoded a Toll-Interleukin-1 receptor / nucleotide-binding site / leucine-rich repeat (TIR-NB-LRR) protein expressed mainly in the stele or cortex of hypocotyl and roots, in leaves, and in apical meristem, but not in root hairs. Compared with the resistant allele Crr1a(G004), the susceptible allele Crr1a(A9709) appeared to encode a truncated NB-LRR protein lacking more than half of the TIR domain. Transgenic Arabidopsis harboring Crr1a(G004) cDNA showed pathotype-specific resistance to P. brassicae isolates similar to that of untransformed B. rapa with a homozygous Crr1 locus. This study provides a basis for further analysis of molecular mechanisms underlying Brassica-P. brassicae interactions and contributes significantly to breeding of highly resistant cultivars of Brassica vegetables. 3aArabidopsis 3aBrassica rapa 3aPlasmodiophora brassicae 3aalleles 3aapical meristems 3abreeding 3acole crops 3acomplementary DNA 3acortex 3acultivars 3ahypocotyls 3aleaves 3aloci 3amolecular cloning 3aquantitative trait loci 3aroot hairs 3astele 3avegetables1 aTomita, R.N.1 aKato, T.1 aNunome, T.1 aFukuoka, H.1 aMatsumoto, S.1 aSuwabe, K.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Sept., , no. 1005 p.621-626dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1005/1005_77.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02863naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002600110245007400136300001800210500013200228500002400360520155400384650001901938650002501957650001201982650001201994650002102006650001302027650001802040650002102058650001102079650002302090650001802113650001602131650002602147650001102173700001802184700002802202773012502230852000902355856008902364655001202453IND4474846120221118101700.0131210s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447484612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Rangel, J.C.10aProduction of nutraceuticals in carrot bagasse using abiotic stresses  ap. 1475-1479.  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Postharvest Symposium, held June 25, 2012 - June 29, 2012, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  aIncludes references  aThe processing of plant foods results in the production of many by-products, which are normally considered as waste. For instance, the bagasse is the main processing by-product during the production of fruit and vegetables juices. Plant tissues such as the bagasse can respond to abiotic stresses (i.e., UV-light, temperature, wounding) synthesizing phenolic compounds (PC), which are chemicals of high pharmaceutical and nutraceutical value. The PC can be used for the prevention of different chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular. Therefore, it is interesting to explore the possibility of using the bagasse as starting material for the production of PC. The present project objective was to determine if the application of abiotic stresses such as wounding, UV-light and temperature can induce the accumulation of PC in bagasse, using carrot bagasse as a model system. The bagasse was exposed to UV-C light (30, 60 and 120 min), and then incubated at 25°C for 48 h. During storage, the total phenolics (Folin-Ciocalteu assay) and the antioxidant activity (ORAC value) were determined. The samples stored for 48 h showed higher accumulation of PC, where the PC of the control increased ~600% compared with time 0 h samples. Likewise, the highest ORAC value was observed on the bagasse treated with UV-light for 120 min, and 48 h of incubation, with an increase of ~183% compared with time 0 h samples. These results indicate that the application of abiotic stresses in carrot bagasse can be used to produce nutraceuticals. 3aabiotic stress 3aantioxidant activity 3abagasse 3acarrots 3achronic diseases 3adiabetes 3afruit growing 3afunctional foods 3ajuices 3aphenolic compounds 3aplant tissues 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastes1 aBenavides, J.1 aJacobo-Velázquez, D.A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Nov., , no. 1012 p.1475-1479dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1012/1012_199.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02997naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006300129300001800192500013200210500002400342520186800366650002302234650001602257650001902273650001202292650001302304650001802317650001802335650002402353650001602377700001502393700001602408773012502424852000902549856008902558655001202647IND4474846420221118101618.0131210s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447484642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaniagua, A.C.10aEffects of delays in cooling on blueberry quality outcomes  ap. 1493-1498.  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Postharvest Symposium, held June 25, 2012 - June 29, 2012, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  aIncludes references  aRapid cooling of fresh produce after harvest is widely accepted as an important process in maintaining product quality. However, in the industrial context, rapid cooling can be inhibited by the requirement to initially aggregate and transport produce, and later by the throughput capacity of either the cooling or packing line facilities. In order to achieve rapid cooling and yet address packing line constraints, when blueberries arrive at the packhouse, fruit are cooled from harvest to an intermediary temperature of 10°C prior to packing and later cooled to the optimal storage temperature of 0°C after packing. While these activities are conducted as fast as possible, it is not known whether delays that interrupt this operation result in reduced product quality when the product reaches the marketplace. In order to address this question a delayed cooling experiment was conducted in which rabbiteye blueberries (Vaccinium ashei Reade ‘Maru’) were subjected to extended periods of time at 20°C (to simulate delays before cooling) and 10°C (to simulate delays before final chilling). A full matrix of 2 delay times at 20°C and 3 delay times at 10°C was investigated. The firmness and weight loss were measured weekly during a subsequent 3 week period at 0°C. The results indicated that minimal differences in firmness or weight loss are observed when comparing a 6 h delay to a 2 h delay at 20°C, while a 20 h delay at 10°C resulted in significantly softer fruit than those delayed for 4 or 8 h at 10°C. In addition, the firmness losses observed were found to correlate to the cumulative weight loss from the fruit. The results indicate that delays of up to 6 h at 20°C and 8 h at 10°C do not result in significantly reduced fruit quality 3 weeks later in comparison to the most rapid practicable cooling times (2 h at 20°C, 4 h at 10°C). 3aVaccinium virgatum 3ablueberries 3acold treatment 3acooling 3afirmness 3afresh produce 3afruit quality 3astorage temperature 3aweight loss1 aEast, A.R.1 aHeyes, J.A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Nov., , no. 1012 p.1493-1498dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1012/1012_202.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02608naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245011600133300001600249500002400265500002300289520139800312650001301710650001001723650002101733650001101754650001901765650002901784650001801813650001901831650001601850650001901866700001501885700002001900700001701920700002101937773014701958852000902105856010802114655001202222IND4474847120150421000000.0131210s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447484712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiguchi, Hidetoshi10aEffects of vitamin E supplementation on cellular α-tocopherol concentrations of neutrophils in Holstein calves  ap. 120-125.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aThe effects of vitamin E supplementation on cellular α-tocopherol concentrations of neutrophils from Holstein calves and the mechanism of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI)-mediated uptake of α-tocopherol were examined. Cellular α-tocopherol concentrations in vitamin E-treated calves increased from 3.5 ± 0.38 to 7.2 ± 0.84 μg/10(7) cells, respectively, within 14 d after vitamin E supplementation; these concentrations were significantly higher than those of control calves (P < 0.01). The expression indices of SR-BI [a major receptor that recognizes high-density lipoprotein (HDL)] mRNA in neutrophils were two to five times higher (P < 0.01) in neutrophils obtained from vitamin E-supplemented calves compared with those from control calves, and anti-SR-B1 antibody, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 μg/mL, significantly (P < 0.01) decreased cellular α-tocopherol concentrations of neutrophils. Cytochalasin D and latrunculin B, major inhibitors of actin polymerization of neutrophils, significantly decreased cellular α-tocopherol concentrations of neutrophils (P < 0.01). Our results demonstrated that in vitamin E-supplemented calves: 1) α-tocopherol is mainly distributed with HDL, 2) α-tocopherol within HDL is recognized by SR-BI on the surface of neutrophils, and 3) rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is a crucial step for the uptake of α-tocopherol by neutrophils. 3aHolstein 3aactin 3aalpha-tocopherol 3acalves 3acytochalasin D 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3amessenger RNA 3amicrofilaments 3aneutrophils 3apolymerization1 aIto, Erina1 aIwano, Hidetoma1 aOikawa, Shin1 aNagahata, Hajime0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g2013 Apr., v. 77, no. 2 p.120-125aCanadian journal of veterinary research (Online)x0830-90007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://pubmedcentral.com/tocrender.fcgi?action=archive&journal=1333Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02616naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002900143245006400172300001800236500002400254520155000278650002001828650001801848650001901866650001901885650000901904650001801913650002601931700002201957700002401979700002102003700001802024700002002042773010002062852000902162856008302171655001202254IND4474850520221118101621.0131210s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447485052DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.74.11.13922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColeman, Amanda Erickson10aEvaluation of a rapid pressor response test in healthy cats  ap. 1392-1399.  aIncludes references  aObjective—To evaluate angiotensin I and angiotensin II rapid pressor response tests in healthy cats. Animals—6 purpose-bred sexually intact male cats. Procedures—Telemetric blood pressure (BP) implants were placed in all cats. After 2 weeks, cats were anesthetized for challenge with exogenous angiotensin I or angiotensin II. Continuous direct arterial BP was recorded during and immediately after IV administration of boluses of angiotensin I or angiotensin II at increasing doses. Blood pressure responses were evaluated for change in systolic BP (SBP), change in diastolic BP (DBP), and rate of increase of SBP by 4 observers. Results—Following IV angiotensin I and angiotensin II administration, transient, dose-dependent increases in BP (mean ± SEM change in SBP, 25.7 ± 5.2 and 45.0 ± 9.1; change in DBP, 23.4 ± 4.7 mm Hg and 36.4 ± 7.8 mm Hg; for 100 ng of angiotensin I/kg and angiotensin II/kg, respectively) and rate of increase of SBP were detected. At angiotensin I and II doses < 2.0 ng/kg, minimal responses were detected, with greater responses at doses ranging from 20 to 1,000 ng/kg. A significant effect of observer was not found. No adverse effects were observed. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—The rapid pressor response test elicited dose-dependent, transient increases in SBP and DBP. The test has potential as a means of objectively evaluating the efficacy of various modifiers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in cats. Ranges of response values are provided for reference in future studies. 3aadverse effects 3aangiotensin I 3aangiotensin II 3ablood pressure 3acats 3adose response 3aintravenous injection1 aSchmiedt, Chad W.1 aJenkins, Tiffany L.1 aGarber, Emily D.1 aReno, Lisa R.1 aBrown, Scott A.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2013 Nov., v. 74, no. 11 p.1392-1399x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.74.11.13923Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03635naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002800184245011900212300001800331500002400349506007600373520174200449506003702191650003202228650001902260650001102279650002302290650001802313650001702331650001902348650002202367650002002389650001002409650001102419650001202430650000902442650001302451650003002464650002102494650001002515650003502525650003002560650002902590650002602619650001202645700002002657700002602677700002502703700002402728700003002752700002602782700002102808773010002829852000902929856008302938655001203021IND4474851020221207143017.0131210s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447485102DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.74.11.14212doi7 aPMC40387152pmcid7 a241683082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEckstrand, Christina D.10aGenetic variability and in vitro transcriptional permissibility of primary ovine beta-retrovirus promoter isolates  ap. 1421-1427.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aObjective—To assess genomic sequence conservation and variation in the proviral promoter of enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV) and Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) in tissue samples from 3 sheep with nasal adenocarcinoma associated with ENTV and 3 sheep with pulmonary adenocarcinoma associated with JSRV and to identify a cell culture system that supports transcriptional activity of the ENTV and JSRV viral promoters. Animals—6 adult sheep. Procedures—Standard PCR procedures for detection of the ENTV and JSRV long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter region were performed on samples from the 3 nasal adenocarcinomas and 3 pulmonary adenocarcinomas, respectively. The LTRs were cloned into shuttle vectors, amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. The cloned LTR regions were transferred into reporter plasmids and multiple human and ruminant cell lines, and primary cells were transfected with the promoter-reporter plasmids. The viral promoter activity was evaluated by use of an in vitro β-galactosidase reporter assay. Results—Each isolate had a unique nucleotide sequence. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were the most common LTR mutation and rarely occurred at transcription factor binding sites. Relative to ENTV, the JSRV promoter isolates had a conserved 66-bp U3 insertion, including the lung-specific transcription factor HNF-3β binding site. Among the cell lines used, human embryonic kidney (293T) and goat synovial membrane cells supported promoter transcription. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—The LTRs of ENTV and JSRV have extensive blocks of sequence conservation. Human 293T and goat synovial membrane cell lines may be suitable in vitro cell culture systems for further research of viral promoter functions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aJaagsiekte sheep retrovirus 3aadenocarcinoma 3aadults 3abeta-galactosidase 3abinding sites 3acell culture 3acell membranes 3agenetic variation 3agenetic vectors 3agoats 3ahumans 3akidneys 3anose 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apromoter regions 3asheep 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aterminal repeat sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3aviruses1 aCastillo, Diego1 aMcDonnel, Samantha J.1 aHillman, Chadwick N.1 aVapniarsky, Natasha1 aShanthalingam, Sundarvili1 aHeras, Marcelo de las1 aMurphy, Brian G.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2013 Nov., v. 74, no. 11 p.1421-1427x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.74.11.14213Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02614naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245014200160300001600302500002400318520138600342650001101728650003201739650001601771650002101787650001401808650001201822650001401834650001201848650002601860650001901886650001201905651001001917700002001927700001701947700001801964700001801982773011002000852000902110856008502119655001202204IND4474848120221118101643.0131210s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447484812DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797030012732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulz, S.10aAlternatives to Mucuna for soil fertility management in Southern Benin: farmer perception and use of traditional and exotic grain legumes  ap. 267-278.  aIncludes references  aIn southern Bénin, the legume cover crop Mucuna pruriens var. utilis has been widely promoted for soil fertility improvement. Recent findings have shown, however, that the majority of farmers have not adopted it, and that alternative technologies are needed that are both attractive to farmers and beneficial in terms of soil fertility. A survey was carried out in southern Bénin to determine farmer perception and use of traditional grain legumes and to assess the adoption potential of new low-harvest-index grain legumes. Grain legumes were shown to be integral components of traditional cropping systems and constituted farmers' most important technology for soil fertility maintenance. More than 80% of respondents expressed interest in testing new, low-harvest-index varieties. Preferred grain characteristics and farmers' culinary preferences for grain legumes varied between locations and need to be taken into account if new germplasm is to be introduced. It is argued that farmers' interest and experience in legume cultivation provide an opportunity for the introduction of alternative legume-based technologies such as low-harvest-index grain legumes and techniques for the detoxification of mucuna seed. In addition, efforts should be made to increase the productivity of current legume production systems and to develop mucuna cultivars with reduced L-dopa content. 3aL-dopa 3aMucuna pruriens var. utilis 3acover crops 3acropping systems 3acultivars 3afarmers 3agermplasm 3alegumes 3aproduction technology 3asoil fertility 3asurveys 3aBenin1 aHonlonkou, A.N.1 aCarsky, R.J.1 aManyong, V.M.1 aOyewole, B.D.0 tExperimental agriculture.g2003 July, v. 39, no. 3 p.267-278dCambridge University Pressx0014-47977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797030012733Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03195naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011600169300001800285500002400303520162800327650001301955650001801968650001901986650002102005650001102026650001802037650002002055650001102075650002002086650001002106650002002116650001102136650001502147650001702162650001502179650001302194650001102207650001302218651000902231651001802240700002202258700002502280700001702305700002002322700002102342700002202363700002602385700001802411773011802429852000902547856008502556655001202641IND4474849420221118101626.0131210s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447484942DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.243.11.15612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChipman, Richard B.10aCosts of raccoon rabies incidents in cattle herds in Hampshire County, West Virginia, and Guernsey County, Ohio  ap. 1561-1567.  aIncludes references  aObjective—To determine direct and indirect costs associated with raccoon rabies incidents involving cattle herds in Hampshire County, WV, in 2008 and Guernsey County, Ohio, in 2010. Design—Ex post cost analysis. Animals—1 cattle herd in Hampshire County, WV, in 2008 and 1 cattle herd in Guernsey County, Ohio, in 2010. Procedures—Data were collected for each incident through telephone and email interviews with 16 federal, state, and county agency personnel involved in the case investigations and coordinated responses for rabies in the cattle herds. To characterize the economic impact associated with rabies in the 2 cattle herds, cost analysis was conducted with 7 cost variables (salary and benefits for personnel involved in the response, human postexposure prophylaxis, indirect patient costs, rabies diagnostic testing, cattle carcass disposal, market value of euthanized cattle, and enhanced rabies surveillance). Estimates of direct costs were determined on the basis of agency records and other relevant data obtained from notes and reports made by agency staff at the time of the incident and from a review of the literature. Results—Primary costs included the market value of euthanized cattle ($51,461 in West Virginia; $12,561 in Ohio), human postexposure prophylaxis ($17,959 in West Virginia; $11,297 in Ohio), and salary and benefits for personnel involved in the response ($19,792 in West Virginia; $14,496 in Ohio). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—These results should provide a basis for better characterization of the economic impact of wildlife rabies in cattle in the United States. 3aGuernsey 3aProcyon lotor 3abeef carcasses 3acarcass disposal 3acattle 3acost analysis 3adisease control 3ae-mail 3aeconomic impact 3aherds 3ahuman resources 3ahumans 3ainterviews 3amarket value 3amonitoring 3apatients 3arabies 3awildlife 3aOhio 3aWest Virginia1 aCozzens, Tyler W.1 aShwiff, Stephanie A.1 aBiswas, Rita1 aPlumley, Jewell1 aO'Quin, Jeanette1 aAlgeo, Timothy P.1 aRupprecht, Charles E.1 aSlate, Dennis0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 243, no. 11 p.1561-1567x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.243.11.15613Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01527naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009800126300001600224500016700240500002400407520043700431650002100868650002500889650001000914650001200924650001100936700001500947700001500962700001500977773012400992852000901116856008801125655001201213IND4474830820221118101621.0131209s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447483082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmeri, R.10aNatural Indigo from Isatis Tinctoria L. for the reassessment of Sicilian crops - a minireview  ap. 341-347.  aPaper presented at the Fifth International Symposium on Brassicas and Eighteenth Crucifer Genetics Workshop, held November 12 - November 16, 2012, Catania, Italy.  aIncludes references  aThe renewed and increasing interest in the naturally sourced products, among these the indigo can be considered one of the most important dye.

A further reason for a widerspread of this crop might arise from the exploitation of secondary products (like flour and cake) useful in various application fields. In 2010-2011, thanks to the Project EXTRAVALORE the agronomic evaluations were carried out on 38 cultivars of rape. The screening of the genotypes was performed in three different localities of Italy: in the North (Palazzolo - UD), Centre (Osimo - AN) and South Italy (Cassibile - SR). The environments significantly influenced the morpho-phenological traits and the production of the studied varieties. The best performances were obtained in Central Italy, where the rape, on average of genotypes, flowered before than in North and South Italy; moreover the plant height resulted higher. These results confirm the good adaptability to this environment for this crop. Among the cultivars, Zoom and Albatross showed yields close to 4.8 t ha-1; other fifteen varieties have exceeded the average value. In regards to the seed oil content, two cultivars ('Katabatic' and 'Adriana') showed an average value of 48%. In northern Italy it has been obtained intermediate yields, with a more marked delay in flowering. DK Expower Hornet, Hybriswing and Fregat were the most productive (3.0 t ha-1). The highest oil content was recorded in Albatross and Primus, (48%). In Sicily, because of the weather condition some cultivars ('Kutiba', 'Ilia', 'Tassilo', 'Adriana' and 'Anaconda') have not been able to flower, probably for the lack of low temperatures. The seed yields and the seed oil content, lower than 45%, resulted the lowest compared to the other environments. 3aBrassica napus 3aVespidae 3abiofuels 3acakes 3acultivars 3aflour 3aflowering 3agenotype 3alipid content 3ascreening 3aseed oils 3aseed yield 3atemperature 3aweather 3aItaly 3aSicily1 aPieri, S.1 aMangoni, L.1 aRaccuia, S.A.1 aArgento, S.1 aSignor, M.1 aFoppa Pedretti, E.1 aToscano, G.1 aMengarelli, C.1 aDuca, D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Sept., , no. 1005 p.411-418dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1005/1005_49.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01766naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245007700130300001600207500016700223500002400390520064300414650001801057650001201075650002101087650002001108650002701128650001301155700002001168700001501188700001601203773012401219852000901343856008801352655001201440IND4474828620221118101541.0131209s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447482862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArtemyeva, A.M.10aAssociation mapping of agronomically important traits in brassica Rapa L  ap. 173-179.  aPaper presented at the Fifth International Symposium on Brassicas and Eighteenth Crucifer Genetics Workshop, held November 12 - November 16, 2012, Catania, Italy.  aIncludes references  aAn association mapping approach was used to find marker-phenotype associa-tions in the VIR core collection of 96 Brassica rapa accessions representing various morphotypes of different geographical origin.

The Latin texts describing plants and their uses are several, but generally there are difficulties to identify plants from the author’s descriptions. This may be because there are problems in translation, or more simply the writer did not describe the plant accurately or with enough details. Among the plants known by the Romans, the Brassicaceae played an important role, partly because many of these species are native to the Mediterranean basin. With the aim to achieve as much information as possible on the Romans botanical knowledge on Brassicaceae species, the operas of eight Latin authors were studied and species were listed in a specific data base. For every identified species we listed the Latin name, family, origin and uses. The latter have been classified into 5 groups: food, medicinal, magical, ornamental, and others. Specifically, 30 taxa belonging to 19 genera were identified. Romans committed particular attention to the Brassica genera and other Brassicaceae species. The main use is medicinal (83.3%); other plants of the family are used for food (40.0%), magical and ornamental purposes. 3aBrassica 3adatabases 3aindigenous species 3ainformation sources1 aScuderi, D.1 aTribulato, A.1 aRomano, D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Sept., , no. 1005 p.205-212dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1005/1005_21.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01802naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010900125300001600234500016700250500002400417520055200441650001300993650001301006650001601019650001401035650002201049650002701071650001401098650001901112651001001131700001501141700001801156700001901174700001401193773012401207852000901331856008801340655001201428IND4474828820221118101519.0131209s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447482882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBranca, F.10aGenetic relationships of brassica vegetables and wild relatives in southern Italy determined by five SSR  ap. 189-196.  aPaper presented at the Fifth International Symposium on Brassicas and Eighteenth Crucifer Genetics Workshop, held November 12 - November 16, 2012, Catania, Italy.  aIncludes references  aFive Simple Sequence Repeat were used to assess the genetic similarity between 50 B. oleracea cultivars and wild Brassica species, belonging to two varietal groups (cauliflower and broccoli).

The phylogenetic analysis grouped the wild species within the same cluster. 3aBrassica 3abroccoli 3acauliflower 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeny 3awild relatives 3aItaly1 aRagusa, L.1 aTribulato, A.1 aDi Gaetano, C.1 aCalì, F.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Sept., , no. 1005 p.189-196dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1005/1005_19.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02522naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009400126300001600220500016700236500002400403520123000427650002201657650003701679650001301716650001101729650001401740650001701754650001001771650002201781650001301803650000901816650003001825700001701855700002701872700001601899773012401915852000902039856008802048655001202136IND4474829420221118101546.0131209s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447482942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlier, J.10aOn the way to the identification of a downy mildew resistance gene in Brassica oleracea L  ap. 233-237.  aPaper presented at the Fifth International Symposium on Brassicas and Eighteenth Crucifer Genetics Workshop, held November 12 - November 16, 2012, Catania, Italy.  aIncludes references  aWe have recently mapped the dominant and monogenically inherited downy mildew resistance locus Pp523 to the chromosome C8 of Brassica oleracea L. and constructed a physical-map of the genomic region of this locus. Presently, we are constructing a BAC genomic library of a downy mildew resistant S4 line derived from the broccoli accession originally found to harbor the Pp523 locus and using STS markers derived from the previously constructed physical map in order to identify a contig of BAC clones which sequencing could allow the isolation and cloning of this resistance locus. The new BAC library contains 17280 clones with an average insert size of 125 Kbp, which represent approximately 3.5 equivalents of the broccoli genome. To date, 18 clones from this new library were selected and assembled in a contig (with two small gaps) that covers the major part of the previously physically mapped region. The overlapping between BAC clones has been identified by PCR and confirmed by sequencing of the PCR products. The precise positioning of BAC clones in the genome has been made possible through the alignment of the BAC-end sequences with the genomic sequences of B. oleracea available at the Brassica database (BRAD). 3aBrassica oleracea 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3abroccoli 3aclones 3adatabases 3adowny mildew 3agenes 3agenomic libraries 3agenomics 3aloci 3apolymerase chain reaction1 aAlabaça, C.1 aPousada, C.

White cauliflower was characterized by a weight loss around 8% after 5 days of storage in the perforated film, while the Violet-pigmented exceeded 22%. Packaging in the permeable film was effective at reducing the weight loss for both varieties to about 0.3%. The colorimetric analysis on racemes from both varieties did not reveal significant differences during storage, while important changes were observed on the cut surfaces of the White cultivar. Packaging in the permeable film allowed cauliflower, irrespective of the variety, to reach a steady-state O2 level ranging from 11 to 13% and a CO2 level of 8.5% after 72 hours. Although the initial mesophilic bacteria counts in both cultivars were high, all the analyzed samples were in compliance with the recommended microbial limits of total plate counts (8 log cfu/g). Count values for molds and yeasts reached the limit values (5 log cfu/g) after a few days of storage, especially for the White-type packaged in the perforated film, while a different behaviour was shown by Enterobacteriaceae, which evidenced a higher load throughout the considered storage period in samples packaged in the permeable film. The use of a non-perforated, permeable packaging determines a suitable atmosphere, limiting moisture loss. Violet cauliflower is more suitable for minimal processing due to a higher color stability on the cut surface area, however, microbial quality of raw materials represents a crucial aspect for the shelf life extension. 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3abacteria 3acarbon dioxide 3acauliflower 3acold storage 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3acultivars 3ainflorescences 3amicrobiological quality 3aoxygen 3apackaging 3aplate count 3araw materials 3ashelf life 3astorage time 3asurface area 3aweight loss 3ayeasts1 aMuratore, G.1 aSpagna, G.1 aBranca, F.1 aRagusa, L.1 aCaggia, C.1 aRandazzo, C.1 aRestuccia, C.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Sept., , no. 1005 p.301-308dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1005/1005_34.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03002naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008400127300001600211500016700227500002400394520158400418650002202002650002102024650001402045650002002059650001302079650001902092650001602111650002402127650000902151650001402160650000902174650001902183650001602202651001002218651001102228700001802239700001502257700001602272700001902288700001602307773012402323852000902447856008802456655001202544IND4474832720221118101518.0131209s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447483272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnastasi, U.10aPhenology, grain yield and quality of Ethiopian mustard grown in Southern Italy  ap. 487-494.  aPaper presented at the Fifth International Symposium on Brassicas and Eighteenth Crucifer Genetics Workshop, held November 12 - November 16, 2012, Catania, Italy.  aIncludes references  aThe knowledge of the behaviour of Ethiopian mustard genotypes on different sites and seasons is a key step of the research to assess the opportunity of spreading this multifunctional species (food and non-food) in farming systems of southern Italy. For these reasons, a two-year experiment was carried out in two Sicilian areas. Three cultivars of Brassica carinata (ISCI 7, CT 207, CT 204) were compared in a randomised-blocks replicated three times. During the trials, weather data were recorded and the main phenological stages of the plants were observed. Grain yield was determined at harvest, and seed samples were analysed for oil, protein and glucosinolate contents. The tested cultivars evidenced a satisfactory adaptation to the semi-arid environmental conditions of Sicily, although, thermal regime and rainfall were rather variable from year-to-year. The earlier genotypes, CT 204 and to a minor extent ISCI 7, attained better performance in terms of grain, oil, protein and glucosinolate yields. Nevertheless, owing to the combined effect among the studied factors (years, sites and genotypes), the biological and productive behaviour of the genotypes was markedly conditioned by the climatic conditions. Therefore, it has been concluded that the choice of genotype is a crucial aspect for Ethiopian mustard cultivation in Sicily, but further studies need to define the optimal sowing time and seeding rate, and to explore the intra-specific variability to enhance the productivity of the crop and adjust seed composition in view of different industrial destination. 3aBrassica carinata 3aclimatic factors 3acultivars 3afarming systems 3agenotype 3aglucosinolates 3agrain yield 3ameteorological data 3aoils 3aphenology 3arain 3asemiarid zones 3asowing date 3aItaly 3aSicily1 aCosentino, S.1 aCopani, V.1 aSortino, O.1 aVirgilliot, S.1 aLazzeri, L.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Sept., , no. 1005 p.487-494dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1005/1005_59.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02467naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245008200131300001600213520155800229650000901787650001501796650002001811650000901831650001001840650001501850650001501865650000901880700001601889700001401905700001801919700001801937700002001955773007501975852000902050939003302059946001302092655001202105IND8806190520221118101806.0881209e198702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880619052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, J.H.

Ninety 8 week old female rats were with 3H-tetracycline and fed a purified low calcium egg white diet (EWD) for 8 weeks. The dietary groups were as follows: EWD containing 4.5, 10, 100 or 200 mg Zn/kg diet plus vitamin D3 and EWD plus 4.5, 10, 100 or 200 mg Zn/kg diet plus 1,25(OH)2D3. The results show that the form of vitamin D3 affected zinc uptake by the femur. Bone zinc concentrations were consistently higher when 1,25(OH)2D3 instead of cholecalciferol was the source of vitamin D3 steroid. Elevating dietary zinc up to 100 or 200 mg/kg diet resulted in increased bone resorption as measured by the 3H-tetracycline loss. Resorption of bone calcium was reduced when 1,25(OH)2D3 was fed with either 4.5 or 10 ppm zinc. High levels of dietary zinc caused increased bone resorption and counteracted the reduction of bone catabolism seen with 1,25(OH)2D3 at low or required zinc levels. Serum 1,25(OH)2D3 was significantly elevated with increased dietary zinc. These data indicate that high but non-toxic dietary levels of zinc may be an additional factor enhancing bone loss when calcium intake is low. The vitamin D3 steroid, 1,25(OH)2D3, had a marked inhibitory effect on bone resorption and appears to enhance the accumulation of zinc and calcium in bone of young adult female rats. 3adiet 3acalcitriol 3acholecalciferol 3azinc 3abones 3ametabolism 3aresorption 3arats1 aSherman, S.1 aSinha, R.1 aBeecher, G.R.1 aBodwell, C.E.1 aSmith, J.C.

Two natural populations of this insect from the North of Tunisia were evaluated, in the field, for their virulence, based on response developed by bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars carrying H3, H5, H6, H7H8, H11, H13 and H16 resistance genes. H11, H13 and H16 showed a high effectiveness against both populations; therefore, their implication in Hessian fly breeding programs would be of interest. The level of infestation, as well as the yield loss, was assessed, based on the percentage of infested plants and variation in growth parameters due to infestation. The percentage of infested plants, over a 2-yr period in Mateur, averaged 18.82% for durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum (Desf.) Husn.) and 32.50% for bread wheat. For the improved durum wheat cv. Karim used as reference, the plant height, number of internodes, number of productive tillers per plant, and 100-seed weight were negatively affected by infestation, while the number of tillers per plant was positively affected. Aiming to update information about the annual number of the fly generations occurring on wheat, we surveyed infestation in Jédéida. At least three Hessian fly generations were detected on bread wheat and durum wheat. Continued regular surveying of Hessian fly populations in terms of virulence, impact on yield and annual generations is required for optimal deployment of resistance genes and integrated management of Hessian fly across all wheat production areas. 3aMayetiola destructor 3aTriticum aestivum 3aTriticum turgidum 3abreeding programs 3acrop production 3acultivars 3adurum wheat 3ainsects 3ainternodes 3apests 3aphenology 3aplant height 3aresistance genes 3asurveys 3atillers 3avirulence 3aTunisia1 aBouktila, Dhia1 aMezghani, Maha1 aMakni, Mohamed0 tChilean journal of agricultural research.g2011 , v. 71, no. 3 p.401-405wJournal:17877x0718-58397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0718-583920110003000093Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0718-583920110003000093Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111115  aNon-US 7aarticle02545naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100003400110245013000144300001600274500002400290520125100314650002001565650002501585650001801610650001801628650001401646650001001660650001501670650001101685650001401696650001701710650002001727650001101747650001101758651001101769700003101780700003601811700002401847773010901871852000901980856007801989939003302067946001102100655001202111IND4462929220221118101917.0120319e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446292922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVera-Guzmán, Araceli Minerva10aPhytochemical evaluation of wild and cultivated pepper (Capsicum annuum L. and C. pubescens Ruiz & Pav.) from Oaxaca, México  ap. 577-585.  aSummary in Spanish.  aReports of the last decade show that some types of food and spices included in the human diet, such as pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) can have a positive effect on human health. The Mexican pepper germplasm is poorly documented with regard to variety and the amount of phytochemical compounds that it contains. In the present study, the variation of phytochemical compounds was evaluated in nine fruit variants (morphotypes) of wild and cultivated pepper grown in Oaxaca. ANOVA detected significant differences among pepper morphotypes and ripeness stages of fruits; vitamin C, total phenols, flavonoids, beta-carotene, coordinated chromatic of color, and capsaicinoids. The highest values of vitamin C were found in 'Tabaquero', 'Güero' and 'Costeño' morphotypes (151.6 to 183.2 mg 100 g-1). With regard to total phenols and flavonoids, 'Piquín' and 'Solterito' had the highest levels. Coordinates of color a* and b*, and chroma presented a positive correlation with phenol and flavonoid contents. The evaluated morphotypes differed in capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin; C. annuum had higher capsaicin content (4.9 to 142 micrograms mL-1) than dihydrocapsaicin (1.5 to 65.5 micrograms mL-1) and C. pubescens Ruiz & Pav. showed the opposite pattern. 3aCapsicum annuum 3aanalysis of variance 3aascorbic acid 3abeta-carotene 3acapsaicin 3acolor 3aflavonoids 3afruits 3agermplasm 3ahuman health 3ahuman nutrition 3amorphs 3apepper 3aMexico1 aChávez-Servia, José Luis1 aCarrillo-Rodríguez, José Cruz1 aLópez, Mercedes G.0 tChilean journal of agricultural research.g2011 , v. 71, no. 4 p.577-585wJournal:17877x0718-58397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.chileanjar.cl/current.php3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120319  aNon-US 7aarticle02575naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002100151245008400172300001600256500002400272520122600296650002201522650001801544650001801562650001401580650001501594650000901609650002201618650001401640650001701654650001201671650000901683650001501692650002801707650001001735650002101745700001901766773010901785852000901894856009101903856009101994939003302085946001102118655001202129IND4462929920221118101904.0120319e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446292992DNAL7 a10.4067/S0718-583920110004000192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeim, Juan Pablo10aNutritional strategies to improve nitrogen use efficiency by grazing dairy cows  ap. 623-633.  aSummary in Spanish.  aGrazing dairy cows are characterized by converting a low proportion of dietary N into milk N. This low N use efficiency (NUE) is mainly due to an excessive supply of crude protein (CP) of pasture with regard to animal requirements. Excess N in the diet has negative effects for the animal; it alters the organoleptic characteristics of milk and pollutes the environment through N excretions. The aim of this review was to analyze the available information on nutritional strategies to improve NUE by grazing dairy cows, such as diluting the dietary N through supplementation, synchronizing ruminal carbohydrate (CHO), and N fermentation rates, and using pastures with a high water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) content. There is a beneficial effect of carbohydrate supplementation on NUE, with an increase in milk yield (MY) of 0.83 ± 0.34 kg milk kg-1 supplement and a reduction of ammonia N (NH3-N) in the rumen. A better synchrony between CHO and rumen N does not improve MY and NUE. However, a positive effect on NUE was identified as a result of increasing the WSC/CP ratio. The use of cultivars with high WSC content increases the dry matter intake (DMI), MY, and milk N production, with no consistent effect on NUE. 3aammonium nitrogen 3acarbohydrates 3acrude protein 3acultivars 3adairy cows 3adiet 3adry matter intake 3aexcretion 3afermentation 3agrazing 3amilk 3amilk yield 3anutrient use efficiency 3arumen 3awater solubility1 aAnrique, René0 tChilean journal of agricultural research.g2011 , v. 71, no. 4 p.623-633wJournal:17877x0718-58397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0718-583920110004000193Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0718-583920110004000193Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120319  aNon-US 7aarticle03262naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002100151245010100172300001600273500002400289520171300313650001902026650002402045650001702069650001002086650001402096650001302110650001502123650001102138650001302149650004302162650001202205650002102217650001202238650001202250650002302262650002302285650002502308700002102333700001602354700001702370700002502387773010902412852000902521856009102530856009102621939003302712946001102745655001202756IND4462285020221118101859.0111115e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446228502DNAL7 a10.4067/S0718-583920110003000162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInfante, Rodrigo10aPostharvest sensory and phenolic characterization of ‘Elegant Lady’ and ‘Carson’ peaches  ap. 445-451.  aSummary in Spanish.  aHigh quality fruits are increasingly demanded along with the need to ensure this attribute to consumers. Thus, this study was aimed at characterizing a melting ('Elegant Lady') and a non-melting flesh ('Carson') peach (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) varieties by considering both their bioactive compound contribution and their sensory quality in ripe fruit at harvest and after of cold storage. Cultivars were evaluated at harvest (F0) and after 30 d of cold storage (F30), as well as after a maturation period at 20 °C for both F0 and F30 (R0 and R30, respectively). Fruit weight, flesh firmness, soluble solid content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), and background color (Hue) were recorded at each stage. Furthermore, total phenol content was measured and a phenolic characterization by HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography) was performed for both varieties to detect the major low molecular weight phenolic compounds present in the fruit. Finally, a trained panel assessed the main sensorial parameters at R0 and R30. Total phenol content did not change significantly as a result of cold storage and differences were probably attributed only to genotype. Low molecular weight phenolic compounds were detected in 'Elegant Lady' and 'Carson', 15 and 12, respectively; (+)-catechin was the major compound found in both cultivars, but in higher concentrations in 'Elegant Lady'. In the phenolic characterization, 'Elegant Lady' was observed more closely than ‘Carson’ for flavonoids. After 30 d of cold storage, 'Elegant Lady' was unacceptable for consumption due to the appearance of physiological disorders such as wooliness while ‘Carson’ showed a mean score within the acceptability range. 3aPrunus persica 3abioactive compounds 3acold storage 3acolor 3acultivars 3afirmness 3aflavonoids 3afruits 3agenotype 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amelting 3amolecular weight 3apeaches 3aphenols 3asensory properties 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids1 aContador, Loreto1 aRubio, Pía1 aAros, Danilo1 aPeña-Neira, Álvaro0 tChilean journal of agricultural research.g2011 , v. 71, no. 3 p.445-451wJournal:17877x0718-58397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0718-583920110003000163Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0718-583920110003000163Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111115  aNon-US 7aarticle02534naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002200151245008000173300001600253500002400269520099500293650001501288650001401303650001701317650002201334650002601356650001601382650001501398650002201413650001601435650002201451650001801473650001001491650001201501650001801513650001101531650001801542650001301560650001701573651001301590700001801603700002701621700002401648773010901672852000901781856009101790856009101881939003301972946001102005655001202016IND4462285820221118101855.0111115e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446228582DNAL7 a10.4067/S0718-583920110003000212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Hafiz Haider10aMethods to break seed dormancy of Rhynchosia capitata, a summer annual weed  ap. 483-487.  aSummary in Spanish.  aDormancy of weed seeds is a significant feature contributing to their survival rate since it helps the weeds to avoid herbicides and other weeding practices along with unfavorable environmental conditions. We investigated the effects of different dormancy breaking treatments on the germination of Rhynchosia capitata, a common summer annual weed, which is emerging as a weed threat in Pakistan. Seeds were soaked in thiourea, KNO3, HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4, and they were also mechanically scarified (sandpaper). Results indicated that R. capitata seeds show signs of physical dormancy that is mainly due to the impermeability of their coat. Mechanical scarification and acid scarification (soaking of seeds in H2SO4 for 60 and 80 min and in HCl for 12 and 15 h) were very efficient in breaking dormancy and promoting germination. Seed soaking in HNO3 for 1 to 5 d showed little effect whereas various concentrations of thiourea and KNO3 were ineffective in breaking R. capitata seed dormancy. 3aRhynchosia 3aabrasives 3aannual weeds 3adormancy breaking 3aenvironmental factors 3agermination 3aherbicides 3ahydrochloric acid 3anitric acid 3apotassium nitrate 3aseed dormancy 3aseeds 3asoaking 3asulfuric acid 3asummer 3asurvival rate 3athiourea 3aweed control 3aPakistan1 aTanveer, Asif1 aNadeem, Muhammad Ather1 aAsghar, Hafiz Naeem0 tChilean journal of agricultural research.g2011 , v. 71, no. 3 p.483-487wJournal:17877x0718-58397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0718-583920110003000213Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0718-583920110003000213Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111115  aNon-US 7aarticle02666naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002200179245009800201300001600299506007600315520143400391506003701825650000801862650001101870650002301881650004401904700001901948700002501967700003301992700002102025773008002046852000902126856007802135930003302213946001102246990002302257655001202280IND4432074020221207142039.0100129e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443207402DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkp9562doi7 aPMC28110242pmcid7 a199067142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNozinovic, Senada10aHigh-resolution NMR structure of an RNA model system: the 14-mer cUUCGg tetraloop hairpin RNA  ap. 683-694.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe present a high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution structure of a 14-mer RNA hairpin capped by cUUCGg tetraloop. This short and very stable RNA presents an important model system for the study of RNA structure and dynamics using NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and RNA force-field development. The extraordinary high precision of the structure (root mean square deviation of 0.3 Å) could be achieved by measuring and incorporating all currently accessible NMR parameters, including distances derived from nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) intensities, torsion-angle dependent homonuclear and heteronuclear scalar coupling constants, projection-angle-dependent cross-correlated relaxation rates and residual dipolar couplings. The structure calculations were performed with the program CNS using the ARIA setup and protocols. The structure quality was further improved by a final refinement in explicit water using OPLS force field parameters for non-bonded interactions and charges. In addition, the 2'-hydroxyl groups have been assigned and their conformation has been analyzed based on NOE contacts. The structure currently defines a benchmark for the precision and accuracy amenable to RNA structure determination by NMR spectroscopy. Here, we discuss the impact of various NMR restraints on structure quality and discuss in detail the dynamics of this system as previously determined.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aFürtig, Boris1 aJonker, Hendrik R.A.1 aRichter, Christianc(Lawyer)1 aSchwalbe, Harald0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Jan., v. 38, no. 2 p.683-694x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp9563Available from publisher's Web site  a20100129b20100205c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02882naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001800179245011200197300001200309506007600321520146900397506003701866650000801903650001601911650001301927650001101940650001601951650002301967650003301990650002902023700002102052700002302073700002202096700002702118700001902145700002602164773008002190852000902270856007802279930003302357946001102390990002302401655001202424IND4432074320221207142047.0100129e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443207432DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkp8992doi7 aPMC28110122pmcid7 a198975492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuinn, Amy M.12aA homogeneous method for investigation of methylation-dependent protein-protein interactions in epigenetics  ap. e11.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMethylation of lysine residues on the tails of histone proteins is a major determinant of the transcription state of associated DNA coding regions. The interplay among methylation states and other histone modifications to direct transcriptional outcome is referred to as the histone code. In addition to histone methyltransferases and demethylases which function to modify the methylation state of lysine sidechains, other proteins recognize specific histone methylation marks essentially serving as code readers. While these interactions are highly specific with respect to site and methylation state of particular lysine residues, they are generally weak and therefore difficult to monitor by traditional assay techniques. Herein, we present the design and implementation of a homogeneous, miniaturizable, and sensitive assay for histone methylation-dependent interactions. We use AlphaScreen, a chemiluminescence-based technique, to monitor the interactions of chromodomains (MPP8, HP1β and CHD1), tudor domains (JMJD2A) and plant homeodomains (RAG2) with their cognate trimethyllysine histone partners. The utility of the method was demonstrated by profiling the binding specificities of chromo- and tudor domains toward several histone marks. The simplicity of design and the sensitive and robust nature of this assay should make it applicable to a range of epigenetic studies, including the search for novel inhibitors of methylation-dependent interactions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aepigenetics 3ahistones 3alysine 3amethylation 3amethyltransferases 3aprotein-protein interactions 3atranscription (genetics)1 aBedford, Mark T.1 aEspejo, Alexsandra1 aSpannhoff, Astrid1 aAustin, Christopher P.1 aOppermann, Udo1 aSimeonov, A.q(Anton)0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Jan., v. 38, no. 2 p.e11-e11x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp8993Available from publisher's Web site  a20100129b20100205c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02530naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001500161245004300176300001600219500001500235520086800250650001701118650001101135650002301146650001501169650002501184650001001209650001501219650002101234650001901255650002301274650001501297650004601312650002501358650002401383650001701407650005601424650001101480650003301491650002301524650001901547653001601566653001601582700001601598700001601614700001701630700001601647700001301663700001701676773008701693852000901780856008201789930003301871945001301904946001101917655001201928IND2326340720221118102235.0020403e200107  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232634072DNAL7 a114693182pmid7 a10.1080/026520301205712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCabras, P.10aFenhexamid residues in grapes and wine  ap. 625-629.  a2019-12-04  aThe behaviour of the fungicide, fenhexamid, on grapes, and during wine-making, as well as its effect on the microflora of alcoholic and malolactic fermentation has been studied.

At harvest, in the wine obtained by vinification without skins, the fungicide residue decreased on average by 49%, while in the wine obtained by vinification with skins, the decrease was on average 62%. The presence of this fungicide on grapes and in the wine did not affect alcoholic and malolactic fermentation, nor did fermentation cause any degradation of the fungicide. A simple and rapid gas chromatographic method (GC-NPD) for the determination of fenhexamid residues in grapes, must and wine is described. 3afermentation 3agrapes 3afood contamination 3afungicides 3alactic acid bacteria 3awines 3awinemaking 3afood composition 3awine cultivars 3afungicide residues 3agrape must 2aAminophenolsxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aChromatography, Gas 2aFermentation 2aFungicides, Industrialxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aHumans 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aRosalesxchemistry 2aWinexanalysis 0afood safety 0agrape skins1 aAngioni, A.1 aGarau, V.L.1 aPirisi, F.M.1 aCabitza, F.1 aPala, M.1 aFarris, G.A.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2001 July, v. 18, no. 7 p.625-629x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520301205713Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle04329naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001500161245007500176300001600251500001500267520220200282650001102484650001202495650001102507650000902518650000902527650001402536650001502550650001002565650001002575650001202585650002702597650000802624650001302632650001102645650001402656650001202670650002302682650002302705650001202728650000902740650001502749650001002764650001602774650000902790650001202799650002602811650001002837650002102847650002902868650004802897650001102945650001102956650002302967650003302990650004703023650001103070650001103081650000903092650001603101650001603117651001803133653002003151653002503171653001103196653002503207653001603232700001703248773008603265852000903351856008203360930003303442945001303475946001103488655001203499IND2326777120221118101746.0020428e200105  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232677712DNAL7 a113581812pmid7 a10.1080/026520301198932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJensen, E.10aExposure assessment of dioxins/furans consumed in dairy foods and fish  ap. 395-403.  a2019-12-04  aDioxins/furans are ubiquitous environmental contaminants whose primary route of human exposure occurs via the consumption of fatty foods of animal origin. The US FDA conducted a market basket survey of dairy products and commercial fish and shellfish to obtain data on levels of 17 dioxin/furan congeners (2, 3, 7, 8-congeners) in the US. The dairy products sampled included various cheeses (American, cheddar, Swiss, cottage), ice cream, yogurt, butter, and milk. The finfish and shellfish (molluscs and crustacea) sampled are those marine species consumed in the greatest amounts and include canned tuna, shrimp, cod, blue crab, and oysters. Catfish was sampled because it is the dominant aquaculture species. Samples were collected in 1995/96 and analysis for 17 dioxin/furan congeners was performed by high-resolution gas chromatography following extraction and clean-up. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for each congener in each food were reported. Point estimates of exposure were calculated using a 3-day (1-day diary plus 2-day recall) food consumption survey for eaters-only and for the general population (USDA/CSFII, 1989-92). Toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs) developed by the World Health Organization (1997) were used to derive overall dioxin/furan toxicity equivalents (TEQ) for each sample food. Mean estimates of TEQ exposure for each food were derived using five values for non-detects (ND = 0; ND = 1/2 LOD or LOQ; ND = LOD or LOQ) on both a total sample and eaters-only basis. Using zero and the LOD provide lower and upper bounds on the range of estimated exposure, respectively. The bounds on mean dioxin intakes (pg/person/day) calculated for consumers of specific foods were estimated as follows (using zero or LOD for non-detects): butter (0.5-11), cheese (1.6-3.2), ice cream (4-19), yogurt (0.8-28), catfish (148-150), fish (other than catfish) (0.03-9), crustacea (32-35), mollusks (16.1-16.6), and shrimp (0.09-4.5). Exposure estimates derived by the five ND-methods are strongly dependent on the LOD and LOQ and represent upper bound estimates of exposure. Uncertainty in the exposure estimates is reduced with refinements in the analytical method. 3abutter 3aelderly 3afurans 3amilk 3afish 3ashellfish 3aestimation 3agirls 3awomen 3adioxins 3aenvironmental exposure 3amen 3achildren 3ayogurt 3aice cream 3ainfants 3afood contamination 3agender differences 3acheeses 3aboys 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aAnimals 2aCatfishesxmetabolism 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aDairy Productsxanalysis 2aDioxinsxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aEating 2aFemale 2aFishesxmetabolism 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFuransxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSex Factors 3aUnited States 0aage differences 0amarket basket survey 0aintake 0atoxicity equivalents 0afood safety1 aBolger, P.M.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2001 May, v. 18, no. 5 p.395-403x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520301198933Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02290naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137072001700155072001700172072001700189100001500206245004100221300001600262500001500278520002700293520076800320650003601088650002501124650001201149650002301161650004001184650004301224650004001267650003101307650004301338650002601381650002201407653002301429653001101452700001401463700001401477700001401491773012801505852000901633856007301642930003301715945002501748946001101773655001201784IND4378826720221118102115.0060315e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437882672DNAL7 a163116312pmid7 a10.1039/b514045p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Although their molecular backbone consists only of two phenylpropane (C₆–C₃) units, lignans show an enormous structural diversity. There is a growing interest in lignans and their synthetic derivatives due to applications in cancer chemotherapy and various other pharmacological effects. This review deals with lignans possessing anticancer, antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities, and comprises the data reported in more than 100 peer-reviewed articles, so as to highlight the recently reported bioactive lignans that could be a first step towards the development of potential new therapeutic agents. 3achemical constituents of plants 3amedicinal properties 3alignans 3achemical structure 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxpharmacology 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aImmunosuppressive Agentsxpharmacology 2aLignansxpharmacology 2aPlantsxchemistry 0aliterature reviews 0aplants1 aKim, H.J.1 aAli, M.S.1 aLee, Y.S.0 tNatural product reports.g2005 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.696-716dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26900x1460-47527nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b514045p3Available from publisher's site  a20060405b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03153naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001400163245009700177300001600274520175400290650001702044650001102061650001802072650002002090650001002110650001502120650001402135650002402149650001902173650001702192650002402209650003502233650003802268650003802306650003402344650000902378650002002387650001702407651001202424651001002436700001802446773010302464852000902567930003302576945002502609946001302634655001202647IND4368262620221118102246.0050407e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436826262DNAL7 a157581042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZhang, X.10aCharacterizing land surface erosion from Cesium-137 profiles in lake and reservoir sediments  ap. 514-523.  aRecognition of the threat to the sustainable use of the earth's resources posed by soil erosion and associated off-site sedimentation has generated an increasing need for reliable information on global rates of soil loss. Existing methods of assessing rates of soil loss across large areas possess many limitations and there is a need to explore alternative approaches to characterizing land surface erosion at the regional and global scale. The downcore profiles of 137Cs activity available for numerous lakes and reservoirs located in different areas of the world can be used to provide information on land surface erosion within the upstream catchments. The rate of decline of 137Cs activity toward the surface of the sediment deposited in a lake or reservoir can be used to estimate the rate of surface lowering associated with eroding areas within the upstream catchment, and the concentration of 137Cs in recently deposited sediment provides a basis for estimating the relative importance of surface and channel, gully, and/or subsurface erosion as a source of the deposited sediment. The approach has been tested using 137Cs data from several lakes and reservoirs in southern England and China, spanning a wide range of specific suspended sediment yield. The results obtained are consistent with other independent evidence of erosion rates and sediment sources within the lake and reservoir catchments and confirm the validity of the overall approach. The approach appears to offer valuable potential for characterizing land surface erosion, particularly in terms of its ability to provide information on the rate of surface lowering associated with the eroding areas, rather than an average rate of lowering for the entire catchment surface. 3asoil erosion 3acesium 3aradionuclides 3areservoir soils 3alakes 3awatersheds 3asediments 3asediment deposition 3asediment yield 3acase studies 3amathematical models 2aCesium Radioisotopesxanalysis 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aSoil 2aWater Movements 2aWater Supply 3aEngland 3aChina1 aWalling, D.E.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2005 , v. 34, no. 2 p.514-523wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20050816b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/04/20  aOther US 7aarticle02993naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002500154245015800179300001600337500002400353500001500377520149600392650001701888650001401905650002001919650001601939650002401955650002501979650002702004650001102031650001502042650002602057650002202083650001602105650002502121650002102146651001302167653002402180700002302204700002402227700002102251700001702272773013102289852000902420856009402429655001202523IND4460553920221118101726.0110729s1999    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446055392DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1999.tb01894.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRUMSEY, FREDERICK J.10aPopulation structure and conservation biology of the endangered fern Trichomanes speciosum Willd.

T. speciosum is unique amongst European pteridophytes in that both phases of the life cycle are perennial and capable of vegetative propagation. Within sites no variation was revealed by allozyme electrophoresis, even where both generations were growing together. In contrast, diversity was observed among sites, with seven different multilocus phenotypes (MLPs) present in the area. Two of these MLPs covered large areas while the others were restricted to one, or few localities. Asexual reproduction of the gametophyte via gemmae is assumed to be the main means of dispersal in recent times, allowing single clones to become widespread, while the overall genetic variability may be attributed to sexual reproduction and spore dispersal in historic times under more favourable climatic conditions. We suggest that it is not inbreeding, nor lack of genetic variation that limits sporophyte production, but rather the prevailing climatic conditions. The sporophyte is extremely rare and vulnerable. However, when the gametophyte is considered, the species is neither threatened with extinction, nor does it appear to face the danger of marked genetic erosion, because the long-lived gametophyte stage contains all of the genetic variability present in the area and can be regarded as a valuable ‘seed-bank'. 3agametophytes 3aphenotype 3aspore dispersal 3aTrichomanes 3awildlife management 3aasexual reproduction 3avegetative propagation 3aclones 3ainbreeding 3aferns and fern allies 3agenetic variation 3asporophytes 3apopulation structure 3aclimatic factors 3aScotland 0asexual reproduction1 aVOGEL, JOHANNES C.1 aRussell, Stephen J.1 aBarrett, John A.1 aGibby, Mary.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1999 Mar., v. 66, no. 3 p.333-344dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw2224x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1999.tb01894.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02162naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245007200174300001600246500002400262520103400286650001701320650001801337650001701355650001101372650002501383650001301408651001101421651001201432700002401444700002201468700001801490700002101508700002501529773013101554852000901685856009401694655001201788IND4460552820221118101723.0110729s1999    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446055282DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1999.tb01886.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLourie, Sara A.14aThe taxonomy of Vietnam's exploited seahorses (family Syngnathidae)  ap. 231-256.  aIncludes references  aSeahorses (Hippocampus spp) are heavily exploited in Vietnam, but conservation and management measures are currently limited by the ambiguous taxonomic definitions of the genus in the region. Seven species of seahorse are identified in this paper as inhabiting the coastal waters of Vietnam. We used morphometric and DNA sequence data (from the cytochrome b region of the mitochondrial genome) to delimit the species. Species descriptions are put forward and we provide illustrations and an identification key to the species. The species are provisionally assigned to Hippocampus spinosissimus Weber 1913, H. comes Cantor 1850, H. trimaculatus Leach 1814, H. kuda Bleeker 1852, H. kelbggi Jordan and Snyder 1902, H. mohnikei Bleeker 1854 and H. histrix Kaup 1856. The current level of confusion in seahorse nomenclature means that some of these distinct species in Vietnam (in particular H. spinosissimus, H. kuda, H. kelloggi and H. mohnikei) may have to be renamed once a comprehensive revision of the genus has been completed. 3aSyngnathidae 3acoastal water 3acytochrome b 3agenome 3anucleotide sequences 3ataxonomy 3aJordan 3aVietnam1 aPRITCHARD, JANET C.1 aCASEY, STEPHEN P.1 aTRUONG, SI KY1 aHall, Heather J.1 aVINCENT, AMANDA C.J.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1999 Feb., v. 66, no. 2 p.231-256dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw2199x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1999.tb01886.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02383naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002100154245008600175300001600261500002400277520139400301650001201695650002401707650001201731650002601743650001301769650001001782650001901792700002401811773013101835852000901966856009401975655001202069IND4460553120221118101720.0110729s1999    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446055312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1999.tb01919.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPEDERSEN, JES S.10aGenetic analysis of colony structure in polydomous and polygynous ant populations  ap. 115-144.  aIncludes references  aMost interactions between individuals of social insects occur in colonies. The correct identification of colonies is therefore crucial for most empirical studies which aim to test evolutionary theories based on properties at the colony level. In many ant populations, the identification of colonics is hampered by polydomy, i.e. that single colonics occupy several, spatially separated nests. Only few attempts have been made so far to develop genetical methods for analysing the structure of specific colonics. Three methods to solve this problem are presented: rare genotype sisterhoods (tracking rare genotypes or alleles), G-distance (a measure of genotypic heterogeneity derived from G-statistics), and neighbour relatcdness (estimates of genetic relatcdness for specific nest pairs). Our methods quantify the likelihood of nest pairs being con-colonial or non-colonial, and given sufficient genetical resolution, statistical tests can be applied. The methods proposed here arc applied to a highly polygynous population of the red ant, Myrmica sulcinodis. In this population single colonics are found to inhabit 1-4 nests, and both monodomous and polydomous colonies coexist in dense clusters of nests. This result is discussed with respect to the functional significance of polydomy. Further, the general application of the methods for determination of colony structure is discussed. 3aMyrmica 3aSolenopsis geminata 3aalleles 3agenetic heterogeneity 3agenotype 3anests 3asocial insects1 aBOOMSMA, JACOBUS J.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1999 Jan., v. 66, no. 1 p.115-144dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw2204x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1999.tb01919.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02286naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245011900172300001600291500002400307520111700331650002801448650001601476650001301492650001201505650002701517650002201544650001301566650001401579650000901593650002401602650001601626700001501642700002101657773013101678852000901809856009401818655001201912IND4460552620221118101741.0110729s1999    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446055262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1999.tb01884.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPARKASH, RAVI10aGeographical variation in AdhF and alcoholic resource utilization in Indian populations of Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 205-214.  aIncludes references  aIndian geographical populations of Drosophila melanogaster, collected at latitude 10-32.3 oN, longitude 76.1-80.1 oE and altitude 16-2050 m, were analysed for changes in Adh¹ frequency and utilization potential of diverse alcoholic resources. Until now, there have been limited data on climatic association of correlated changes on these aspects in continental populations of D. melanogaster. Indian populations demonstrate an increase in AdhF frequency by 0.04 per degree latitude and significantly higher utilization of ethanol (9.0-15.2%), acetic acid (8.1-12.5%), n-propanol (2.55-4.25%), 2-propanol (1.5-3.5%), n-butanol (2.15 3.5%) and 2-butanol (0.68-1.2%). Data also revealed significant correlation with latitude as well as altitude. Regression analysis of climatic data from collection sites confirmed the observed clinal variation of AdhF as well as alcoholic utilization in D. melanogaster. On the Indian subcontinent, variation in AdhF frequency and alcoholic resource utilization along increasing latitude as well as altitude are due to climatic selection factors such as temperature and rainfall. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aacetic acid 3aaltitude 3aethanol 3ageographical variation 3aisopropyl alcohol 3alatitude 3alongitude 3arain 3aregression analysis 3atemperature1 aKARAN, DEV1 aMUNJAL, ASHOK K.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1999 Feb., v. 66, no. 2 p.205-214dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw2199x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1999.tb01884.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03305naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001600180245009500196300001600291520153200307650002401839650001701863650002701880650001901907650000901926650001701935650001101952650000901963650000901972650002501981650001102006650002402017650001802041650001802059650001502077650001302092650003302105650002902138650003402167650003102201650002402232650001802256650003102274650003102305651001502336653002102351653002302372653003202395653003802427700001902465700001702484773008602501852000902587930003302596945002502629946001302654655001202667IND4367000920221118102039.0050208e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436700092DNAL7 a156475572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBurton, Ed.10aGeochemical partitioning of copper, lead, and zinc in benthic, estuarine sediment profiles  ap. 263-273.  aThe geochemical partitioning of copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) was examined in benthic sediment profiles (0- to 20-cm depth interval) composed of relatively coarse (65-90% sand-sized particles), noncohesive, suboxic material (Eh +120 to +260 mV). Total Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations ranged from 8.3 to 194, 16.3 to 74.8, and 30.1 to 220 mg/kg, respectively, and were related to vertical trends in sediment texture. The observed distribution coefficients describing solid-solution partitioning were in the range of 100 to 1000 L/kg. The geochemical partitioning of solid-phase Cu, Pb, and Zn between six operationally defined fractions was examined with a sequential extraction scheme. The association of Cu, Pb, and Zn with amorphous oxides, crystalline oxides, and organic matter was linearly dependent on the abundance of each respective phase. For retention by amorphous oxide minerals, the observed stoichiometry ranged from 5.2 to 23.7 mg/g for Cu, 12.8 to 21.5 mg/g for Pb, and 23.1 to 85.7 mg/g for Zn. Corresponding values for association with crystalline oxides were an order of magnitude less than those for amorphous oxides, indicating a lesser affinity of trace metals for crystalline oxides. The stoichiometric relationships describing association with organic matter ranged from 17.6 to 54.0 mg/g for Cu, 6.1 to 9.6 mg/g for Pb, and 6.4 to 16.4 mg/g for Zn. The results from this study provide an insight into processes controlling trace metal partitioning in coarse-textured, suboxic, estuarine sediments. 3aestuarine sediments 3abenthic zone 3asediment contamination 3asoil pollution 3asand 3asoil texture 3acopper 3alead 3azinc 3aspatial distribution 3aoxides 3asoil organic matter 3astoichiometry 3afractionation 3aextraction 3asorption 2aCopperxanalysisxchemistry. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aLeadxanalysisxchemistry. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aParticle Size 2aWater Pollutantsxanalysis 2aZincxanalysisxchemistry. 3aQueensland 0aamorphous oxides 0acrystalline oxides 0asolid-solution partitioning 0asequentiual extraction techniques1 aPhillips, I.R.1 aHawker, D.W.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2005 , v. 34, no. 1 p.263-273x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20050818b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/03/10  aOther US 7aarticle02885naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180100001700197245009700214300001300311500001500324520113300339650002001472650001301492650001301505650002201518650001501540650002201555650001001577650001801587650000901605650003001614650001501644650002101659650001801680650001601698650002401714650002001738650002901758650001101787650002501798650002401823650002401847650002601871650001101897650002401908650003101932650004201963651001002005653002502015700001302040700001902053773008302072852000902155930003302164945002502197946001302222655001202235IND4367519320221118102208.0050309e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436751932DNAL7 a149643532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Under scrutiny is atrazine (1-chloro-3-ethylamino-5-isopropylamino-2,4,6-triazine), a commonly used herbicide in corn (Zea mays L.) and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] production. Concentrations of soluble and adsorbed atrazine losses sometimes exceed the safe drinking water standard of 3 microgram L(-1) established by the USEPA. This study assesses the protective implications of runoff control structures and alternative crop farming practices to minimize atrazine losses. Using a computerized simulation model, APEX, the following four practices were the most effective with respect to the average atrazine loss as a percent of the amount applied: (i) constructing sediment ponds, 0.09%; (ii) establishing grass filter strips, 0.14%; (iii) banding a 25% rate of atrazine, 0.40%; and (iv) constructing wetlands, 0.45%. Other atrazine runoff management options, including adoption of alternative tillage practices such as conservation and no-till as well as splitting applications between fall and spring, were marginally effective. 3awater pollution 3aatrazine 3aZea mays 3asimulation models 3ano-tillage 3apollution control 3aponds 3agrain sorghum 3acorn 3abest management practices 3awatersheds 3alosses from soil 3afilter strips 3agrain yield 3aalternative farming 3aSorghum bicolor 3aplant cultural practices 3arunoff 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aAtrazinexchemistry 2aComputer Simulation 2aHerbicidesxchemistry 2aHumans 2aModels, Theoretical 2aWater Pollutants, Chemical 2aWater Pollutionxprevention & control 3aTexas 0aconservation tillage1 aWang, E.1 aWilliams, J.R.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2004 , v. 33, no. 1 p.7-12x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20060413b20060529c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/04/11  aOther US 7aarticle02775naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001600180245009000196300001400286500009100300520095100391650002101342650001901363650001901382650002701401650001401428650001901442650002301461650003001484650001001514650001901524650002501543650001401568650001401582650001801596650001101614650002001625650001601645650001601661650001201677650002801689650001601717650001101733650001101744650002001755650002201775650002701797650003501824653002301859653002501882653001701907700002001924773010101944852000902045930003302054945002502087946001302112655001202125IND4366996420221118102141.0050208e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436699642DNAL7 a156475332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Management of these risks requires an understanding of sources, concentrations, and removal by processes that may be used to treat the wastes; survival in the environment; and exposure to sensitive populations. The major sources are animal feeding operations, municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents, biosolids, and on-site treatment systems. More than 150 known enteric pathogens may be present in the untreated wastes, and one new enteric pathogen has been discovered every year over the past decade. There has been increasing demand that risks associated with the land treatment and application be better defined. For risks to be quantified, more data are needed on the concentrations of pathogens in wastes, the effectiveness of treatment processes, standardization of detection methodology, and better quantification of exposure. 3aland application 3awaste disposal 3asoil pollution 3apoint source pollution 3apathogens 3amicroorganisms 3aenvironmental fate 3aanimal feeding operations 3afeces 3aanimal manures 3awastewater treatment 3aeffluents 3abiosolids 3asewage sludge 3arunoff 3arisk assessment 2aAgriculture 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxpathogenicity 2aFertilizers 2aHumans 2aManure 2aRisk Assessment 2aSoil Microbiology 2aVirusesxpathogenicity 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 0aliterature reviews 0amunicipal wastewater 0ahuman wastes1 aSmith, J.E.

  1 aGodfree, A.10aProcesses for managing pathogens  ap. 105-113.  aPaper presented at the 2004 Sustainable Land Application Conference, Orlando, Florida.  aWastewater contains human, animal, and plant pathogens capable of causing viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections. There are several routes whereby sewage pathogens may affect human health, including direct contact, contamination of food crops, zoonoses, and vectors. The range and numbers of pathogens in municipal wastewater vary with the level of endemic disease in the community, discharges from commercial activities, and seasonal factors. Regulations to control pathogen risk in the United States and Europe arising from land application of biosolids are based on the concept of multiple barriers to the prevention of transmission. The barriers are (i) treatment to reduce pathogen content and vector attraction, (ii) restrictions on crops grown on land to which biosolids have been applied, and (iii) minimum intervals following application and grazing or harvesting. Wastewater treatment reduces number of pathogens in the wastewater by concentrating them with the solids in the sludge. Although some treatment processes are designed specifically to inactivate pathogens, many are not, and the actual mechanisms of microbial inactivation are not fully understood for all processes. Vector attraction is reduced by stabilization (reduction of readily biodegradable material) and/or incorporation immediately following application. Concerns about health risks have renewed interest in the effects of treatment (on pathogens) and advanced treatment methods, and work performed in the United States suggests that Class A pathogen reduction can be achieved less expensively than previously thought. Effective pathogen risk management requires control to the complete chain of sludge treatment, biosolids handling and application, and post-application activities. This may be achieved by adherence to quality management systems based on hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) principles. 3awastewater 3apathogens 3asewage effluent 3asewage sludge 3asewage treatment 3awastewater treatment 3abiosolids 3aland application 3awaste disposal 3arisk management 3apollution control 3alaws and regulations 3aanaerobic digestion 3aliming 3acomposting 3apasteurization 2aAgriculture 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aEnvironment 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxprevention & control 2aHumans 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aVirusesxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Microbiology 2aZoonoses 3aUnited States 3aUnited Kingdom 0aliterature reviews1 aFarrell, J.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2005 , v. 34, no. 1 p.105-113x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20050818b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/03/08  aOther US 7aarticle02595naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180100001200197245009100209300001500300500009100315520097100406650001401377650001001391650001401401650002001415650002101435650002301456650002001479650001401499650001501513650001901528650002201547650002301569650003801592650002901630650002301659650001101682650002001693650002601713650004101739653002301780700001701803700001201820700001501832773010201847852000901949930003301958945002501991946001302016655001202029IND4366997120221118102214.0050208e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436699712DNAL7 a156475382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Once conveyed to wastewater treatment plants, PPCPs can remain unchanged or undergo partial or complete transformation during wastewater treatment processes before discharge into the environment via effluent and biosolids for land application. Biosolids can be a major sink for some PPCPs. Previous investigations have indicated that land application of biosolids may be a potential important route through which PPCPs enter the environment. However, no information is available on exactly how closely the concentrations of PPCPs in the environmental media are related to the land application of PPCP-containing biosolids. This paper reviews currently available information on the occurrence of PPCPs in biosolids, methods of analysis, the potential fate of PPCPs in biosolids-applied soils, and composting as a potential means for removal of PPCPs from biosolids. 3acosmetics 3adrugs 3abiosolids 3asoil amendments 3aland application 3aenvironmental fate 3awaste treatment 3aeffluents 3acomposting 3asoil pollution 3apollution control 3aanalytical methods 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aHousehold Products 2aHumans 2aRisk Assessment 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 0aliterature reviews1 aBhandari, A.1 aDas, K.1 aPillar, G.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2005 , v. 34, no. 1 p.91-104wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20050818b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/03/08  aOther US 7aarticle02661naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001700163245008800180300001600268500001500284520107400299650002701373650002701400650002301427650000901450650001701459650002501476650000901501650001401510650001501524650000901539650001601548650001801564650001801582650001501600650001401615650002901629650003901658650001901697650002801716650000901744650002901753651001101782653002501793653001901818700001701837700001801854700001601872773010301888852000901991930003302000945002502033946001302058655001202071IND4366999020221118102156.0050208e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436699902DNAL7 a156475492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSteinnes, E.10aAtmospheric supply of trace elements studied by peat samples from ombrotrophic bogs  ap. 192-197.  a2019-12-05  aConcentrations of Fe and 12 trace elements in peat from ombrotrophic bogs were used to estimate the atmospheric deposition of these elements on a temporal and spatial scale. Peat samples were collected at 21 different sites in Norway encompassing large geographical differences in marine influence and air pollution. The study demonstrates that surface peat is an excellent medium to study geographical differences in heavy metal deposition, provided that effects of the surface plant cover are properly considered. Long-range atmospheric transport of pollutants is the main source for As, Cd, Pb, Sb, and Zn, and to a lesser extent for Cu and Se. Biogenic emissions from the ocean appear to be the main source of Se to the peat. The metals Co, Cr, Fe, and Ni are mainly associated with windblown local soil dust. Surface enrichment of Mn, and in part Zn, is mainly caused by nutrient circulation between the surface peat and vascular plants growing on it. Deposition of marine salts appears to be the main reason for lower Mn concentrations in the peat near the coast. 3achemical concentration 3aatmospheric deposition 3atemporal variation 3apeat 3aheavy metals 3aspatial distribution 3airon 3apeatlands 3asoil depth 3abogs 3aash content 3aair pollution 2aAir Movements 2aAtmosphere 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysis 2aIronxanalysis 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aSoil 2aTrace Elementsxanalysis 3aNorway 0avetical distribution 0atrace elements1 aHvatum, O.O.1 aBølviken, B.1 aVarskog, P.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2005 , v. 34, no. 1 p.192-197wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20050818b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/03/09  aOther US 7aarticle03119naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001200163245009800175300001400273520145200287650003201739650001801771650002101789650001801810650001801828650001301846650002101859650002101880650001001901650001501911650001901926650001201945650001801957650002501975650001302000650002302013650002102036650002902057650001202086650002102098650002902119650001102148650002202159650002102181650002202202650002302224650002802247650003502275700001402310700001702324773008402341852000902425930003302434945002502467946001302492655001202505IND4367520420221118102146.0050309e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436752042DNAL7 a149643562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHao, X.10aCarbon, nitrogen balances and greenhouse gas emission during cattle feedlot manure composting  ap. 37-44.  aCarbon and N losses reduce the agronomic value of compost and contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study investigated GHG emissions during composting of straw-bedded manure (SBM) and wood chip-bedded manure (WBM). For SBM, dry matter (DM) loss was 301 kg Mg(-1), total carbon (TC) loss was 174 kg Mg(-1), and total nitrogen (TN) loss was 8.3 kg Mg(-1). These correspond to 30.1% of initial DM, 52.8% of initial TC, and 41.6% of initial TN. For WBM, DM loss was 268 kg Mg(-1), TC loss was 154 kg Mg(-1), and TN loss was 1.40 kg Mg(-1), corresponding to 26.5, 34.5, and 11.8% of initial amounts. Most C was lost as CO2 with CH4 accounting for <6%. However, the net contribution to greenhouse gas emissions was greater for CH4 since it is 21 times more effective at trapping heat than CO2. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were 0.077 kg N Mg(-1) for SBM and 0.084 kg N Mg(-1) for WBM, accounting for 1 to 6% of total N loss. Total GHG emissions as CO2-C equivalent were not significantly different between SBM (368.4 +/- 18.5 kg Mg(-1)) and WBM (349.2 +/- 24.3 kg Mg(-1)). However, emission of 368.4 kg C Mg(-1) (CO2-C equivalent) was greater than the initial TC content (330.5 kg Mg(-1)) of SBM, raising the question of the net benefits of composting on C sequestration. Further study is needed to evaluate the impact of composting on overall GHG emissions and C sequestration and to fully investigate livestock manure management options. 3agas production (biological) 3aair pollution 3agreenhouse gases 3agas emissions 3acattle manure 3afeedlots 3alitter (bedding) 3acomposted manure 3astraw 3awood chips 3acarbon dioxide 3amethane 3anitrous oxide 3acarbon sequestration 3anitrogen 3adry matter content 3alosses from soil 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aCarbon Dioxidexanalysis 2aCattle 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aManurexanalysis 2aMethanexanalysis 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aNitrous Oxidexanalysis 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods1 aChang, C.1 aLarney, F.J.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2004 , v. 33, no. 1 p.37-44x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20060413b20060529c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/04/11  aOther US 7aarticle03380naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180100001800197245009800215300001400313520165200327650001401979650001901993650001902012650002302031650001702054650002402071650003702095650001902132650001902151650001902170650002102189650001702210650002302227650002202250650001902272650001802291650002502309650003402334650001102368650002802379650002202407650002402429650000902453650002202462650003202484651001202516700002602528700001602554700002002570773008402590852000902674930003302683945002502716946001302741655001202754IND4367520820221118101636.0050309e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436752082DNAL7 a149643572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKoivula, T.T.10aPyrene degradation in forest humus microcosms with or without pine and its mycorrhizal fungus  ap. 45-53.  aThe mineralization potential of forest humus and the self-cleaning potential of a boreal coniferous forest environment for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds was studied using a model ecosystem of acid forest humus (pH = 3.6) and pyrene as the model compound. The matrix was natural humus or humus mixed with oil-polluted soil in the presence and absence of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and its mycorrhizal fungus (Paxillus involutus). The rates of pyrene mineralization in the microcosms with humus implants (without pine) were initially insignificant but increased from Day 64 onward to 47 microgram kg(-1) d(-1) and further to 144 microgram kg(-1) d(-1) after Day 105. In the pine-planted humus microcosms the rate of mineralization also increased, reaching 28 microgram kg(-1) d(-1) after Day 105. The 14CO2 emission was already considerable in nonplanted microcosms containing oily soil at Day 21 and the pyrene mineralization continued throughout the study. The pyrene was converted to CO2 at rates of 0.07 and 0.6 microgram kg(-1) d(-1) in the oily-soil implanted microcosms with and without pine, respectively. When the probable assimilation of 14CO2 by the pine and ground vegetation was taken into account the most efficient microcosm mineralized 20% of the 91.2 mg kg(-1) pyrene in 180 d. The presence of pine and its mycorrhizal fungus had no statistically significant effect on mineralization yields. The rates of pyrene mineralization observed in this study for forest humus exceeded the total annual deposition rate of PAHs in southern Finland. This indicates that accumulation in forest soil is not to be expected. 3apetroleum 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3aconiferous forests 3aforest soils 3asoil organic matter 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3amineralization 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3aPinus sylvestris 3aforest trees 3aPaxillus involutus 3amycorrhizal fungi 3acarbon dioxide 3agas emissions 3aenvironmental models 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aHumans 2aMycorrhizaexmetabolism 2aPinusxmetabolism 2aPyrenesxmetabolism 2aSoil 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism 3aFinland1 aSalkinoja-Salonen, M.1 aPeltola, R.1 aRomantschuk, M.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2004 , v. 33, no. 1 p.45-53x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20060413b20060529c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/04/11  aOther US 7aarticle03903naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001600180245011400196300001400310500001500324520221400339650001402553650002202567650002102589650001102610650002302621650003202644650001902676650001202695650001202707650002602719650001302745650001402758650001902772650001802791650001902809650002202828650001602850650001102866650004102877650003102918650002302949650002402972650004502996650001603041651001203057653002203069653001703091700001703108773008403125852000903209930003303218945002503251946001303276655001203289IND4367521320221118101647.0050309e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436752132DNAL7 a149643602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aScheutz, C.10aEnvironmental factors influencing attenuation of methane and hydrochlorofluorocarbons in landfill cover soils  ap. 72-79.  a2019-12-05  aThe influence of different environmental factors on methane oxidation and degradation of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) was investigated in microcosms containing soil sampled at Skellingsted Landfill, Denmark. The soil showed a high capacity for methane oxidation resulting in a maximum oxidation rate of 104 microgram CH4 g(-1) h(-1) and a low affinity of methane with a half-saturation constant of 2.0% v/v. The hydrochlorofluorocarbons HCFC-21 (dichlorofluoromethane) and HCFC-22 (chlorodifluoromethane) were rapidly oxidized and the oxidation occurred in parallel with the oxidation of methane. The maximal HCFC oxidation rates were 0.95 and 0.68 microgram g(-1) h(-1) for HCFC-21 and HCFC-22, respectively. Increasing concentrations of HCFCs resulted in decreased methane oxidation rates. However, compared with typical concentrations in landfill gas, relatively high HCFC concentrations were needed to obtain a significant inhibition of methane oxidation. In general, the environmental factors studied influenced the degradation of HCFCs in almost the same way as they influenced methane oxidation. Temperature had a strong influence on the methanotrophic activity giving high Q10 values of 3.4 to 4.1 over the temperature range of 2 to 25 degrees C. Temperature optimum was around 30 degrees C; however, oxidation occurred at temperatures as low as 2 degrees C. A moisture content of 25% w/w yielded the maximum oxidation rate as it allowed good gas transport together with sufficient microbial activity. The optimum pH was around neutrality (pH = 6.5-7.5) showing that the methanotrophs were optimally adapted to the in situ pH, which was 6.9. Copper showed no inhibitory effect when added in relatively high concentrations (up to 60 mg kg(-1)), most likely due to sorption of copper ions to soil particles. At higher copper concentrations the oxidation rates decreased. The oxidation rates for methane, HCFC-21, and HCFC-22 were unaltered in ammonium-amended soil up to 14 mg kg(-1). Higher ammonium concentrations inhibited the oxidation process. The most important parameters controlling oxidation in landfill cover soil were found to be temperature, soil moisture, and methane and oxygen supply. 3alandfills 3areaction kinetics 3asoil temperature 3acopper 3asoil water content 3agas production (biological) 3abioremediation 3asoil pH 3amethane 3aenvironmental factors 3aaluminum 3aoxidation 3abiodegradation 3amethanotrophs 3apolluted soils 2aCopperxchemistry 2aEnvironment 2aHumans 2aHydrocarbons, Halogenatedxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMethanexchemistry 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxchemistry 2aTemperature 3aDenmark 0apollution control 0ahydrocarbons1 aKjeldsen, P.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2004 , v. 33, no. 1 p.72-79x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20060413b20060529c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/04/11  aOther US 7aarticle03037naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001700180245008000197300001800277520150100295650002401796650001501820650001901835650002101854650002001875650002101895650001701916650001801933650002301951650001501974650003001989650002602019650002802045650001102073650002402084650002502108650003002133650002002163650004102183651001202224700001602236700001802252700002502270700002002295773008802315852000902403930003302412945002502445946001302470655001202483IND4363148220221118101653.0040629e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436314822DNAL7 a146745222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aUusitalo, R.10aContribution of particulate phosphorus to runoff phosphorus bioavailability  ap. 2007-2016.  aRunoff P associated with eroded soil is partly solubilized in receiving waters and contributes to eutrophication, but the significance of particulate phosphorus (PP) in the eutrophying P load is debatable. We assessed losses of bioavailable P fractions in field runoff from fine-textured soils (Cryaquepts). Surface runoff at four sites and drainflow at two of them was sampled. In addition to dissolved molybdate-reactive phosphorus (DRP) losses, two estimates of bioavailable PP losses were made: (i) desorbable PP, assessed by anion exchange resin-extraction (AER-PP) and (ii) redox-sensitive PP, assessed by extraction with bicarbonate and dithionite (BD-PP). Annual losses of BD-PP and AER-PP were derived from the relationships (R2=0.77-0.96) between PP and these P forms. Losses of BD-PP in surface runoff (94-1340 g ha-1) were typically threefold to fivefold those of DRP (29-510 kg ha-1) or AER-PP (13-270 g ha-1). Where monitored, drainflow P losses were substantial, at one of the sites even far greater than those via the surface pathway. Typical runoff DRP concentration at the site with the highest Olsen-P status (69-82 mg kg-1) was about 10-fold that at the site with the lowest Olsen P (31-45 mg kg-1), whereas the difference in AER-PP per mass unit of sediment was only threefold, and that of BD-PP 2.5-fold. Bioavailable P losses were greatly influenced by PP runoff, especially so on soils with a moderate P status that produced runoff with a relatively low DRP concentration. 3aagricultural runoff 3aphosphorus 3asoil nutrients 3awater solubility 3abioavailability 3alosses from soil 3aeroded soils 3awater erosion 3asediment transport 3aclay soils 3anonpoint source pollution 2aAnion Exchange Resins 2aBiological Availability 2aHumans 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aFinland1 aTurtola, E.1 aPuustinen, M.1 aPaasonen-Kivekas, M.1 aUusi-Kampaa, J.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2003 , v. 32, no. 6 p.2007-2016x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20050928b00000000c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/08/25  aOther US 7aarticle02888naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001900180245008800199300001800287520130000305650001501605650001901620650003001639650001901669650002201688650001301710650001601723650002001739650001901759650001801778650001901796650002501815650001401840650001901854650002001873650003401893650005001927650003301977650002002010650002402030650003202054650004402086653002102130700001502151773008802166852000902254930003302263945002502296946001302321655001202334IND4363783620221118100537.0040809e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436378362DNAL7 a152541012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

To help alleviate such environmental contamination, we investigated a coupled abiotic¡biotic treatment scheme for remediating TNT-contaminated soil in slurry solutions. Two types of soil were used (sandy and silt loam) to simulate different soils that might be found at actual sites. These soils were subsequently contaminated with 5000 mg kg-1 TNT. Mineralization of TNT was initially optimized for minimum reactant use (Fe3+ and H2O2) and maximum soil slurry percentage (percent solids) using modified Fenton reactions conducted in the absence of light followed by the addition of an uncharacterized aerobic biomass. Greater than 97% TNT degradation was observed under optimum reaction conditions for both soils. Using two optimum reactant concentrations for each soil, coupled abiotic-biotic reactions showed an increase in TNT mineralization, from 41 to 73% and 34 to 64% in the sandy soil (10 and 20% slurry, respectively, 1470 mM H2O2), and increases from 12 to 23% and 13 to 28% in the silt loam soil (5% slurry, 294 and 1470 mM H2O2, respectively). These results show promise in the use of combined abiotic-biotic treatment processes for soils contaminated with high concentrations of TNT. 3aexplosives 3asoil pollution 3agroundwater contamination 3amineralization 3areaction kinetics 3aslurries 3asandy soils 3asilt loam soils 3abioremediation 3asoil bacteria 3abiodegradation 3achemical degradation 3aperoxides 3asoil chemistry 3atrinitrotoluene 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxprevention & control 2aHydrogen Peroxidexchemistry 2aIronxchemistry 2aOxidantsxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aTrinitrotoluenexchemistryxmetabolism. 0aFenton chemistry1 aHess, T.F.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2004 , v. 33, no. 4 p.1202-1209x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20041018b20041101c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/10/18  aOther US 7aarticle03028naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002000144245015300164300001800317500001500335520166700350650001402017650001502031650001802046650003202064650001802096650002502114650001302139650002002152650001802172650002602190650001102216651001102227653001702238653001902255700001902274700001602293700001502309700001902324700001802343773010502361852000902466930003302475945002502508946001302533655001202546IND4363153420221118100556.0040629e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436315342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

[Erratum: 2004 Jan-Feb, v. 33, no. 1, p. 411.]  ap. 2414-2420.  a2019-12-05  aImproved understanding of the importance of different surfaces in supporting attached nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria is essential if we are to optimize the N removal capacity of treatment wetlands. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the nitrifying and denitrifying capacity of different surfaces in a constructed treatment wetland and to assess the relative importance of these surfaces for overall N removal in the wetland. Intact sediment cores, old pine and spruce twigs, shoots of Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.), and filamentous macro-algae were collected in July and November 1999 in two basins of the wetland system. One of the basins had been constructed on land that contained lots of wood debris, particularly twigs of coniferous trees. Potential nitrification was measured using the isotope-dilution technique, and potential denitrification was determined using the acetylene-inhibition technique in laboratory microcosm incubations. Nitrification rates were highest on the twigs. These rates were three and 100 times higher than in the sediment and on Eurasian watermilfoil, respectively. Potential denitrification rates were highest in the sediment. These rates were three times higher than on the twigs and 40 times higher than on Eurasian watermilfoil. The distribution of denitrifying bacteria was most likely due to the availability of organic material, with higher denitrification rates in the sediment than on surfaces in the water column. Our results indicate that denitrification, and particularly nitrification, in treatment wetlands could be significantly increased by addition of surfaces such as twigs. 3asediments 3amacroalgae 3aforest litter 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3anitrification 3aconstructed wetlands 3abranches 3adenitrification 3awetland soils 3aMyriophyllum spicatum 3ashoots 3aSweden 0aplant litter 0amicroorganisms1 aEriksson, P.G.1 aMartins, I.1 aNeto, J.M.1 aLeonardson, L.1 aTonderski, K.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2003 , v. 32, no. 6 p.2414-2420wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20050928b00000000c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/08/25  aOther US 7aarticle03607naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001100180245008600191300001800277500001500295520180500310650002102115650002002136650002602156650001402182650001402196650001502210650001902225650002702244650001902271650002402290650002902314650002002343650002302363650003702386650001902423650001602442650001202458650001902470650001202489650003402501650002902535650001602564650003402580650002902614650002602643650004302669651001402712653001702726700001602743700001302759700001702772773008802789852000902877930003302886945002502919946001302944655001202957IND4363784320221118100842.0040809e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436378432DNAL7 a152541022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aXu, R.10aApplication of a slow-release fertilizer for oil bioremediation in beach sediment  ap. 1210-1216.  a2019-12-05  aA 105-d field experiment was conducted to determine the potential of the slow-release fertilizer, Osmocote (Scotts, Marysville, OH), to stimulate the indigenous microbial biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in an oil-spiked beach sediment on an intertidal foreshore in Singapore. Triplicate microcosms containing 80 kg of weathered sediment, spiked with 5% (w/w) Arabian light crude oil and 1.2% (w/w) Osmocote pellets, were established, together with control microcosms minus Osmocote. Relative to the control, the presence of the Osmocote sustained a significantly higher level of nutrients (NH4+ -N, NO3- -N, and PO4(3-)-P) in the sediment pore water over the duration of the experiment. The metabolic activity of the indigenous microbial biomass, as measured using an intracellular dehydrogenase enzyme assay, was also significantly enhanced over the duration of the experiment in amended sediments. The loss of total recoverable petroleum hydrocarbons (TRPH) and biodegradation of total n-alkanes (C10-C33), branched alkanes (pristane and phytane), as well as total target polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (two- to six-ring), in both the control and Osmocote-amended sediments, followed a first-order biodegradation model. The first-order loss rate of total recoverable petroleum hydrocarbons was 2.57 times greater than that of the control. The hopane-normalized rate constants for total n-alkane, branched alkane, and total target PAH biodegradation in the Osmocote-treated sediments were 3.95-, 5.50-, and 2.45-fold higher than the control, respectively. Overall, the presence of Osmocote was able to significantly enhance and accelerate the biodegradation of aliphatics and PAHs in oil-contaminated sediments under natural field conditions in an intertidal foreshore environment. 3asoil pore system 3asoil amendments 3afield experimentation 3asediments 3apetroleum 3aoil spills 3asoil pollution 3afertilizer application 3abioremediation 3asoil microorganisms 3aslow-release fertilizers 3aenzyme activity 3amicrobial activity 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asoil nutrients 3abeach soils 3aalkanes 3abiodegradation 3aalkenes 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFertilizers 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aHydrocarbonsxmetabolism 2aPetroleumxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism 3aSingapore 0ahydrocarbons1 aLau, N.L.A.1 aNg, K.L.1 aObbard, J.P.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2004 , v. 33, no. 4 p.1210-1216x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20041018b20041101c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/10/18  aOther US 7aarticle03460naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180100001800197245009100215300001800306500001500324520153100339650001201870650002301882650001501905650002101920650001101941650002001952650002601972650001501998650001902013650002102032650002002053650001702073650001802090650002102108650001302129650002202142650002302164650001602187650000902203650001702212650001502229650001302244650002702257650000902284650001602293650001202309650001102321650002402332650002502356650002002381650003202401650001002433650000902443650002602452651001002478653002402488700001602512700001802528773008802546852000902634930003302643945002502676946001302701655001202714IND4363785220221118100919.0040809e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436378522DNAL7 a152541032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMarchetti, R.10aSimulating nitrogen dynamics in agricultural soils fertilized with pig slurry and urea  ap. 1217-1229.  a2019-12-05  aWithin the framework of an interregional project in the Emilia Romagna region of northern Italy, the coupled MACRO¡SOILN model was chosen to estimate soil protective capacity against pollutants. The aim of our study was to evaluate the model to better identify key parameters and processes that influence N losses in agricultural soils. Nitrate N content was monitored in soil under corn (Zea mays L.) fertilized with urea and/or pig slurry, in two field experiments performed on four different soils: a Fienili clay, a Barco-like silt, a Sant'Omobono silt loam, and a La Boaria silty clay soil. Measurements were compared with model predictions. For all soils, nitrate content was underestimated on average by 24 to 88% at lower N rates; it was overestimated by 1 to 104% at higher N rates. The root mean square error (RMSE) was equal to 81.1%. Simulation of crop N uptake and soil water flow, estimation of the ammonia losses at pig slurry spreading, and N transformation parameter setting were considered as possible error sources. The calibration of crop N uptake gave rise to good model efficiency index values. The RMSE for the simulation of soil water content varied between 9.8 and 20.2%. A more accurate setting of the ammonia losses and of the feces transformation parameter values could allow the RMSE for the simulation of soil nitrate content to be reduced by no more than 10 to 15%. It is possible for the model not to include the simulation of processes that could have relevant effects on the soil N dynamics. 3aammonia 3aagricultural soils 3asoil depth 3amodel validation 3acarbon 3asilt loam soils 3afield experimentation 3apig manure 3asoil pollution 3anitrate nitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3abulk density 3asoil horizons 3alosses from soil 3aZea mays 3asimulation models 3asoil water content 3asilty soils 3acorn 3asoil texture 3aclay soils 3anitrogen 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3aurea 2aAgriculture 2aAnimals 2aManure 2aModels, Theoretical 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aRisk Assessment 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aSwine 2aUrea 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 3aItaly 0amathematical models1 aPonzoni, G.1 aSpallacci, P.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2004 , v. 33, no. 4 p.1217-1229x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20041018b20041101c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/10/18  aOther US 7aarticle03012naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002000180245005900200300001800259520128500277650001701562650000901579650001401588650002001602650002001622650002101642650001601663650002101679650001001700650001101710650001201721650001901733650001701752650001001769650002201779650002801801650003001829650005401859650001701913650003201930650001101962650002101973650002301994650002802017650002902045650004902074653002102123653002302144700001702167700001702184773010502201852000902306930003302315945002502348946001302373655001202386IND4363151120221118100906.0040629e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436315112DNAL7 a146745462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMackowiak, C.L.10aBiogeochemistry of fluoride in a plant-solution system  ap. 2230-2237.  aFluoride (F-) pollutants can harm plants and the animals feeding on them. However, it is largely unknown how complexing and chelating agents affect F bioavailability. Two studies were conducted that measured F- bioavailability and uptake by rice (Oryza sativa L.). In the first study, rice was grown in solution culture (pH 5.0) with 0, 2, or 4 mM (F-) as KF to compare the interaction of F- with humic acid (HA) and with a conventional chelating agent, N-hydroxyethylenthylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA). In the second study, F was supplied at 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mM KF with an additional 2 mM F-treatment containing solution Ca at 2X (2 mM Ca) the level used in the first study, to test the effect added Ca had on F- availability and uptake. Total biomass was greatest with HEDTA and F- < 1 mM. Leaf and stem F concentrations increased exponentially as solution F- increased linearly, with nearly no F partitioning into the seed. Results suggest that F was taken up as HF(0) while F- uptake was likely restricted. Additionally, F- competed with HA for Ca, thus preventing the formation of Ca-HA flocculents. The addition of soluble Ca resulted in the precipitation of CaF2 solids on the root surface, as determined by tissue analysis and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3afluorides 3abioavailability 3abioaccumulation 3asoilless culture 3ahumic acids 3achelating agents 3astems 3aleaves 3acalcium 3asoil pollution 3aplant growth 3aroots 3ahydrofluoric acid 2aBiological Availability 2aCalciumxpharmacokinetics 2aEdetic Acidxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aFluoridation 2aFluoridesxpharmacokinetics 2aHumans 2aHumic Substances 2aOryzaxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aPlant Shootsxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxpharmacokinetics 0asolution culture 0apotassium fluoride1 aGrossl, P.R.1 aBugbee, B.G.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2003 , v. 32, no. 6 p.2230-2237wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20050928b00000000c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/08/25  aOther US 7aarticle02951naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180100002100197245009300218300001800311500001500329520133500344650001901679650002401698650002301722650001401745650001901759650001301778650002401791650001901815650002501834650001601859650001501875650001501890650003401905650003501939650001101974650003901985650003502024650003602059650003002095650004102125653001702166700001702183700001702200773008802217852000902305930003302314945002502347946001302372655001202385IND4363150720221118100858.0040629e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436315072DNAL7 a146745432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The mineralization and degradation of these products were also investigated during a 56-d experiment under controlled laboratory conditions. Adsorption patterns indicated initial fast adsorption reactions occurring within 4 h for both parathion and paraoxon. We also observed the formation of nonextractable residues. The paraoxon was more intensively degraded than the parathion, and production of p-nitrophenol and other metabolites was observed. A kinetic model was developed to describe the sorption and biodegradation rates of parathion, taking into account the production, retention, and biodegradation of paraoxon, the main metabolite of parathion. After fitting the parameters of the model we made a simulation of the kinetics of the appearance and disappearance of paraoxon. From the simulation we predicted a quantity of metabolite in the liquid phase amounting to 1% of the quantity of parathion initially applied. This is in agreement with the experimental data. 3amineralization 3amathematical models 3aagricultural soils 3aparathion 3asoil pollution 3aparaoxon 3asoil microorganisms 3abiodegradation 3ainsecticide residues 3ametabolites 3aadsorption 2aAdsorption 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCarbon Radioisotopesxanalysis 2aHumans 2aInsecticidesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aParaoxonxanalysisxchemistry. 2aParathionxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 0ainsecticides1 aBruckler, L.1 aBarriuso, E.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2003 , v. 32, no. 6 p.2207-2215x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20050928b00000000c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/08/25  aOther US 7aarticle03228naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001700146245011700163300001800280500001500298520163300313650002701946650001301973650002201986650001502008650001502023650001802038650001602056650001402072650002302086650002702109650001102136650003102147650002802178650003202206650003002238650003002268650001502298651001502313651001502328653002602343653001302369653002802382653002802410700002002438700001902458700001702477773008802494852000902582930003302591945002502624946001302649655001202662IND4363152520221118100843.0040629e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436315252DNAL7 a146745602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Liquid phase transformations  ap. 2354-2363.  a2019-12-05  aSubstantial amounts of self-boiling, Al-rich, hyperalkaline, and saline high-level waste fluids (HLWF) were deposited to the vadose zone at the Hanford Site, in Washington State. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of similar fluids on the extent of dissolution and precipitation in the sediments. Metal- and glass-free systems were used to conduct batch experiments at 323 K under CO2 and O2 free conditions. Base-induced dissolution of the soil minerals was rapid in the first 48 h as indicated by immediate releases of Si and Fe into the soil solution. Potassium release lagged behind and dissolution of K-bearing minerals (mica and K-feldspar) proceeded faster only after 2 to 3 d of the experiment. Silicon and Fe release exhibited high dependence on aqueous [Al] (rate orders <-1), because Al decreased free OH concentration in the contact solution and probably inhibited soil mineral dissolution. Initial K release exhibited low dependence on [Al] (fractional rate orders). Initial dissolution rates calculated based on Si release varied with aqueous [Al] from 29.47 to 4.35 x 10(-12) mol m(-2) s(-1). Aluminum participated in the formation of the secondary phases (precipitation rates of 10(-8) mol s(-1)) but the overall precipitation rate of alumino-silicate secondary phases was probably controlled by aqueous [Si] (rates of 10(-9), and rate constants between 0.0054 and 0.0084 h(-1)). The changes in the soil solution chemistry (release of K, Si, Fe, and other elements) may play a significant role in the fate of radionuclides and contaminants like Cs, Sr, Cr, and U in the Hanford sediments. 3achemical precipitation 3aaluminum 3aindustrial wastes 3aalkalinity 3asolubility 3anuclear power 3avadose zone 2aAccidents 2aAluminumxanalysis 2aChemical Precipitation 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aRadioactive Wastexanalysis 2aSodium Chloridexanalysis 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aSolubility 0aWashington 0aWashington 0aindustrial wastewater 0afeldspar 0aspent nuclear fuel rods 0ahigh level waste fluids1 aAinsworth, C.C.1 aSzecsody, J.E.1 aOafoku, O.S.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2003 , v. 32, no. 6 p.2354-2363x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20050928b00000000c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/08/25  aOther US 7aarticle03342naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001500163245008500178300001800263500001500281520157900296650002701875650001801902650001701920650001401937650002201951650001901973650001101992650003702003650001402040650000902054650001302063650002002076650001002096650001302106650001102119650001102130650004302141650002402184650003602208650004802244650004502292650001102337650005202348650001202400650004602412653001002458653002702468700001802495700001702513700001802530773008802548852000902636930003302645945002502678946001302703655001202716IND4363151420221118100809.0040629e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436315142DNAL7 a146745492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Data concerning the behavior of radionuclides in fruits are limited. Strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne) plants were contaminated on the aboveground part by sprinkling an aqueous solution of 134Cs and 85Sr at three growing stages: predormancy, anthesis, and beginning of ripening. Intercepted activity was more affected by the posture and physical orientation of leaves rather than by leaf area or biomass. Fruit interception ranges from 0.2 to 1.2% of the sprinkled activity. Translocation coefficients from leaf to fruit are on the order of 10(-4) for 134Cs and 10(-5) for 85Sr. Translocation reaches its highest intensity between anthesis and ripening. If deposition occurs when plants are bearing fruits, the fruit activity will be affected by the activity initially deposited on the fruit surfaces. This is important for 85Sr as it is not translocated in the phloem. The loss of the dead leaves at the resumption of growth causes high plant decontamination, but a fraction of both radionuclides remains in the storage organs, roots, and shoots, which is retranslocated to fruits in the following spring. The values of the environmental half-time, t(w), after deposition at predormancy are 114 d for 134Cs and 109 d for 85Sr. Cesium-134 tends to be allocated to fruits, while 85Sr remains in leaves and crowns. Translocation of radionuclides to roots results in soil contamination. 3aatmospheric deposition 3aradionuclides 3astrawberries 3aflowering 3aFragaria ananassa 3asoil pollution 3acesium 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3astrontium 3arain 3aripening 3aleaf abscission 3aroots 3afruiting 3aleaves 3ashoots 2aCesium Radioisotopesxpharmacokinetics 2aCrops, Agricultural 2aFood Contamination, Radioactive 2aFragariaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aFruitxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSeasons 2aStrontium Radioisotopesxpharmacokinetics 0acrown 0afruits (plant anatomy)1 aBrambilla, M.1 aMitchell, N.1 aOuld-Dada, Z.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2003 , v. 32, no. 6 p.2254-2264x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20050928b00000000c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/08/25  aOther US 7aarticle03447naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001600163245009800179300001800277500001500295520177300310650001102083650002202094650001702116650002102133650001902154650001902173650002202192650001902214650001602233650001102249650002102260650001502281650003402296650001202330650003902342650002102381650003802402650001402440650001102454650002402465650002302489650002002512650002102532650002102553653001302574653002502587700002102612700001402633700001802647773008802665852000902753930003302762945002502795946001302820655001202833IND4363152920221118100819.0040629e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436315292DNAL7 a146745632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMondini, C.13aAn integrated chemical, thermal, and microbiological approach to compost stability evaluation  ap. 2379-2386.  a2019-12-05  aThe evaluation of compost stability is of the utmost importance for the reliability of composting as a recycling strategy. To date there is no single parameter that can give a sure indication of the stability of composts from different starting materials. This paper investigates different methods of evaluating the dynamics of transformation of materials and the stability level of the end products in a composting process. The following parameters were determined on compost samples of different ages from cotton (Gossypium herbaceum L.) cardings and yard wastes: humification index (HI), degree of humification (DH), thermogravimetry (TG) microbial biomass C (Bc), and ninhydrin-reactive N (B(NIN)). Finally, from TG, derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermal stability parameters were deduced. Humification parameters in the end products (0.2 and 81% for HI and DH, respectively) showed the effective stability reached by the organic matter (OM). Thermal analysis evidenced the presence of two main organic pools with different thermal stability. During composting a relative increase in the more stable organic pool was indicated by the variation of the thermostability index R1 from 0.41 to 0.74. The parameter R1 was significantly correlated with both HI (r = -0.94; P < 0.05) and DH (r = 0.97; P < 0.05). Microbial biomass content dynamics reflected the availability of readily decomposable substrates. The ratio between B(NIN) and total N in the end product was 0.96%, indicating a good stability level. The simultaneous application of different approaches, considering different properties of composting materials, provides a more complete description of the stability and quality reached by the organic materials. 3acotton 3acompost stability 3ahumification 3anitrogen content 3aorganic matter 3aheat stability 3aorganic compounds 3amicroorganisms 3ayard wastes 3acarbon 3aprocessing waste 3acomposting 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiomass 2aCalorimetry, Differential Scanning 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aGossypium 2aHumans 2aModels, Theoretical 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aRefuse Disposal 2aSulfurxanalysis 2aThermogravimetry 0acomposts 0acotton carding waste1 aDell'Abate, M.T.1 aLeita, L.1 aBenedetti, A.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2003 , v. 32, no. 6 p.2379-2386x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20050928b00000000c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/08/25  aOther US 7aarticle02713naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001400161245008600175300001600261500001500277520091400292650001201206650002501218650001701243650002201260650001301282650000901295650002301304650002601327650001001353650001201363650001301375650002101388650001601409650001301425650002001438650001101458650002001469650002101489650002401510650001801534650002201552650002001574650001101594650002801605650001501633650003201648650001601680653001001696653001701706653001801723653001601741653001501757700001701772700001501789773008701804852000901891856008201900930003301982945001302015946001102028655001202039IND2326777920221118100947.0020428e200104  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232677792DNAL7 a113392602pmid7 a10.1080/026520301200642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrews, C.14aThe effects of domestic cooking on the levels of 3-monochloropropanediol in foods  ap. 271-280.  a2019-12-04  aThe results are reported of a study to determine the effect of domestic cooking procedures on the level of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) in selected foods. Samples of 23 foods comprising stock cubes, gravies, a cake mix, batters, breads, cheese and meats were subjected to a range of cooking procedures including grilling, toasting and microwaving. The resulting levels of 3-MCPD were compared with those present in the foods before cooking. Grilling and toasting produced substantial increases in the 3MCPD content of bread, forming up to 0.3 mg/kg, and of most cheeses, resulting in levels of up to about 0.1 mg/kg. Microwave cooking produced elevated 3MCPD levels in some cheeses. Frying laboratory-produced batters increased 3-MCPD levels to about 0.1 mg/kg whereas a retail batter contained no detectable 3-MCPD when fried. The remaining foods showed little or no discernible increase on cooking. 3abatters 3achemical composition 3apropanediols 3amicrowave cooking 3atoasting 3ameat 3afood contamination 3ahome food preparation 3agravy 3acheeses 3aduration 3afood composition 3acarcinogens 3agrilling 3acooking quality 3abreads 2aBreadxanalysis 2aCheesexanalysis 2aChromatography, Gas 2aFood Analysis 2aFood Preservation 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aMeat Productsxanalysis 2aMicrowaves 2aPropylene Glycolsxanalysis 2aWeight Loss 0afoods 0afood quality 0aweight losses 0astock cubes 0acake mixes1 aBrereton, P.1 aDavies, A.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2001 Apr., v. 18, no. 4 p.271-280x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520301200643Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03589naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001600161245014400177300001600321500001500337520203900352650001702391650002202408650002402430650001402454650002302468650001902491650001802510650001302528650001602541650001902557650001502576650005002591650001402641650001902655650001102674650002702685650002502712650002902737650003102766653002402797700001502821773008702836852000902923856008202932930003303014945001303047946001103060655001203071IND2326778820221118101006.0020428e200104  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232677882DNAL7 a113392692pmid7 a10.1080/026520301167022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Brien, A.10aPolymer additive migration to foods--a direct comparison of experimental data and values calculated from migration models for polypropylene  ap. 343-355.  a2019-12-04  aTo reduce the amount of compliance testing for food contact polymers the use of migration modelling is under discussion and being evaluated by an EU Commission funded project (Evaluation of Migration Models No. SMT4-CT98-7513). The work reported in this paper was exclusively funded by industry to provide data for the independent evaluation of a diffusion based model using eight different samples of polypropylene (PP) covering the range of polymers specification and five commonly used plastics additives. One hundred and fifty experimental migration data have been obtained in triplicate and used to evaluate a Fickian-based migration model in the prediction of specific migration of five additives into olive oil. All tests were conducted using olive oil, representing the most severe case for fatty foods, with test conditions of 2 h at 121 degrees C, 2 h at 70 degrees C and 10 days at 40 degrees C, representing short term exposures at high temperatures and room temperature storage. Predicted migration values were calculated using the Piringer 'Migratest Lite' model by entering the measured initial concentration of additive in the polymers(Cp,0) in to the equations together with known variables such as additive molecular weight, temperature and exposure time. Where necessary the data generated in this study have been used to update the model. The results indicate the Piringer migration model, using the 'exact' calculations of the Migratest Lite program, predicted migration values into olive oil close to, or in excess of, the experimental results for > 97% of the migration values generated in this study. For all measurements, the predicted migration from the Migratest Lite program was greater than 70% of the observed value. This study has identified the possibility that random co-polymers of propylene and ethylene give higher migration than other grades of polypropylenes and could be treated as a separate case. However, further work on more samples of random co-polymers is required to confirm this finding. 3aplastic film 3asimulation models 3apackaging materials 3aadditives 3afood contamination 3afood packaging 3adata analysis 3aduration 3atemperature 3apolypropylenes 3aprediction 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aDiffusion 2aFood Packaging 2aHumans 2aMathematical Computing 2aPlant Oilsxanalysis 2aPolypropylenesxanalysis 2aReproducibility of Results 0amathematical models1 aCooper, I.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2001 Apr., v. 18, no. 4 p.343-355x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520301167023Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02150naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001700161245006900178300001600247520082400263650001901087650002401106650001701130650001101147650001201158650001201170650001001182650002401192650001901216650002201235650001101257650002201268650002701290651001001317653001601327653001801343700001501361700001501376700001301391700001701404773008701421852000901508856008201517930003301599945001301632946001101645655001201656IND2326778920221118100627.0020428e200104  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232677892DNAL7 a113392702pmid7 a10.1080/026520301190992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirayama, K.10aAnalysis of plasticizers in cap-sealing resins for bottled foods  ap. 357-362.  aA survey of plasticizers in cap-sealing resins for bottled foods has been undertaken.

In the period 1993-1999, of the other plasticizers diacetyl lauroyl glycerol (DALG) was only detected in domestic samples whereas diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP) and diisononyl phthalate (DINP) were only in imported samples. It was observed overall that DEHP and DEHA were restricted to use in cap-sealing resins for bottled foods. Whilst phthalates, DEHA or DALG were detected in samples in 1993 and 1995, the investigation in 1997-1999 showed fewer samples in which these plasticizers were found. 3afood packaging 3apackaging materials 3aplasticizers 3aresins 3abottles 3aimports 3afoods 2aChromatography, Gas 2aFood Packaging 2aFood Preservation 2aHumans 2aMass Spectrometry 2aPlasticizersxanalysis 3aJapan 0abottle caps 0abottled foods1 aTanaka, H.1 aKawana, K.1 aTani, T.1 aNakazawa, H.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2001 Apr., v. 18, no. 4 p.357-362x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520301190993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03245naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001200180245007900192300001800271520167500289650002201964650001901986650001602005650002002021650001102041650002102052650001902073650001302092650001802105650002202123650002502145650002502170650001602195650001202211650001102223650002602234650003302260650001502293650000902308650001102317650002202328650003602350650003602386650001902422700001402441700001502455700001702470773008802487852000902575930003302584945002502617946001302642655001202655IND4373262120221118100606.0050812e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437326212DNAL7 a159988672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHao, X.10aInfluence of canola and sunflower diet amendments on cattle feedlot manure  ap. 1439-1445.  aCattle (Bos taurus) producers can replace a part of the traditional diet of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) grain/silage with sunflower (Helianthus annus L.) seeds or canola meal (Brassica napus L.)/oil to enhance conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) content in milk and meat for its positive health benefits. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of feeding sunflower or canola to finishing steers on cattle manure chemical properties and volatile fatty acid (VFA) content. The control diet contained 84% rolled barley and 15% barley silage, which provided only 2.6% lipid. The other six treatments had 6.6 to 8.6% lipid delivered from sources such as hay, sunflower seed (SS), canola meal/oil, and SS forage pellets. Manure samples (a mixture of cattle urine, feces, and woodchip bedding materials) were collected and analyzed after cattle had been on these diets for 113 d. The dietary source and level of lipid had no effect on organic N and nitrate N content in manure, but significantly affected ammonia N and VFA. Inclusion of SS forage pellets, hay, or canola meal/oil in cattle diets had no significant impact on manure characteristics, but SS significantly reduced the pH and increased propionic, isobutyric, and isovaleric content. In addition, N loss after excretion (mainly from urine N) increases with the pH and N levels in both feed and manure. The combination of SS with barley silage resulted in a lower VFA and NH3 content in manure and should be a more attractive option. To better manage N nutrient cycles and reduce NH3 related odor problems, feed and manure pH should be one of the factors to consider when determining feed mix rations. 3aHelianthus annuus 3aBrassica napus 3acanola meal 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3afeed supplements 3acattle feeding 3afeedlots 3acattle manure 3achemical analysis 3avolatile fatty acids 3achemical composition 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFatty Acids, Monounsaturated 2aHelianthus 2aMale 2aManure 2aMethanexanalysis 2aNitrogenxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aOdorantsxprevention & control. 2aVolatilization1 aMir, P.S.1 aShah, M.A.1 aTravis, G.R.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2005 , v. 34, no. 4 p.1439-1445x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20060114b20060202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/08/30  aOther US 7aarticle03643naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002000163245014100183300001800324520174600342650001302088650000902101650002702110650002202137650001402159650001902173650001102192650002302203650002502226650003602251650001102287650001002298650001502308650002502323650003302348650003102381650004602412650001102458650002502469650004102494650002302535650002202558650002402580650002802604650002702632650004402659650003402703650003502737700001702772700001702789700001502806700001602821773008802837852000902925930003302934945002502967946001302992655001203005IND4375344620221118100544.0051020e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437534462DNAL7 a160916032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPoerschmann, J.10aMolecular composition of leaves and stems of genetically modified Bt and near-isogenic non-Bt maize--characterization of lignin patterns  ap. 1508-1518.  aTransformation of crops, including maize (Zea mays L.), with the cry1Ab gene from Bacillus thuringiensis to combat lepidopteran pests results in pleiotropic effects regarding lignin biosynthesis. Lignin patterns in stems and leaves of two genetically modified Bt-maize varieties (Novelis T and Valmont T) were studied along with their non-Bt near-isolines (Nobilis and Prelude, respectively). Molecular-level based thermochemolysis using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to quantitate the total lignin contents and to identify monomeric lignin subunits including p-hydroxyphenyl (P), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) moieties. The results were supplemented and confirmed by cupric oxide oxidation. The stems of the transgenic lines had higher concentrations of total lignin than the respective isogenic lines: Valmont T/Prelude by 18% and Novelis T/Nobilis by 28%. In contrast, differences in the total lignin concentration of leaves between the transgenic and the respective near-isogenic lines were marginal. There were significant modifications in the ratio of p-hydroxyphenyl/guaiacyl/syringyl molecular marker units of stem lignin between transgenic and isogenic lines. The guaiacyl units (in particular the G18 marker) accounted chiefly for the higher total lignin contents in the transgenic lines. The leaf lignin patterns did not show significant differences in molecular markers between isogenic and transgenic lines. TMAH-induced thermochemolysis-conducted in both the on-line and off-line modes-provided detailed information on the molecular composition of lignin, thus proving superior to the established "wet chemistry" methods of lignin determination. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3atransgenic plants 3avarieties 3aisogenic lines 3alignin 3achemical structure 3achemical composition 3achemical constituents of plants 3aleaves 3astems 3abiomarkers 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Toxinsxgenetics 2aChemistry Techniques, Analyticalxmethods 2aCopper 2aEndotoxinsxgenetics 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHemolysin Proteins 2aLigninxchemistry 2aPhenolsxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPlant Stemsxchemistry 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxchemistry 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compounds 2aZea maysxchemistryxgenetics.1 aGathmann, A.1 aAugustin, J.1 aLanger, U.1 aGorecki, T.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2005 , v. 34, no. 5 p.1508-1518x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/11/01  aOther US 7aarticle02889naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002300161245009000184300001800274500001500292520170100307650001902008650001102027650000902038650000902047650001702056650001802073650002002091650001902111650001302130650001402143650001902157653001502176653002902191700002002220700001802240773010502258852000902363930003302372945002502405946001302430655001202443IND4373255820221118100604.0050812e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437325582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study investigated the ability of biosolid colloids to transport metals associated with organic waste amendments through subsurface soil environments with leaching experiments involving undisturbed soil monoliths. Biosolid colloids were fractionated from a lime-stabilized, an aerobically digested, and a poultry manure organic waste and applied onto the monoliths at a rate of 0.7 cm/h. Eluents were monitored for Cu, Zn, Pb, and colloid concentrations over 16 to 24 pore volumes of leaching. Mass-balance calculations indicated significantly higher (up to 77 times) metal elutions in association with the biosolid colloids in both total and soluble fractions over the control treatments. Eluted metal loads varied with metal, colloid, and soil type, following the sequences Zn = Cu > Pb, and ADB > PMB > LSB colloids. Colloid and metal elution was enhanced by decreasing pH and colloid size, and increasing soil macroporosity and organic matter content. Breakthrough curves were mostly irregular, showing several maxima and minima as a result of preferential macropore flow and multiple clogging and flushing cycles. Soil- and colloid-metal sorption affinities were not reliable predictors of metal attenuation/elution loads, underscoring the dynamic nature of transport processes.

  1 aMathews, B.W.10aPhosphorus in Hawaiian kikuyugrass pastures and potential phosphorus release to water  ap. 1214-1223.  aPasture systems in Hawaii are based primarily on kikuyugrass (Pennisetum clandestinum Hochst. ex Chiov.). Relationships among kikuyugrass P concentration, animal P requirements, and various soil P determinations are needed to help identify source areas for implementing pasture management strategies to limit P loss via overland flow. A total of 51 rotationally stocked kikuyugrass pastures (>20 yr old) with contrasting soil chemical properties were sampled. A satisfactory predictive relationship between modified-Truog (MT)-extractable phosphorus (P(MT)) and dissolved (<0.45-micrometer pore diameter), molybdate-reactive phosphorus (DRP) desorbed from soil in a water extract (DRP(WE)) was found when 0- to 4-cm-depth data for the soil orders with medium to high DRP(WE) (two Mollisols and an Inceptisol) were pooled separately from those with low DRP(WE) (five Andisols, three Ultisols, and an Oxisol). The oxalate phosphorus saturation index (PSI(ox)) procedure was the best predictor of DRP(WE) across soil orders when oxalate-extractable molybdate-reactive phosphorus (RP(ox)) was used to calculate PSI(ox) (PSI(ox)RP) rather than when total oxalate-extractable phosphorus (TP(ox)) was used (PSI(ox)TP). There was little DRP(WE) until PSI(ox)RP exceeded 6% or PSI(ox)TP exceeded 8%. A more empirical dilute-acid phosphorus saturation index (PSI(MT)) was also calculated using P(MT) and MT-extractable iron (Fe(MT)) and aluminum (Al(MT)). The PSI(MT) procedure showed some utility in predicting DRP(WE), was positively related to the PSI(ox) procedures, and can be more readily performed in agronomic soil testing laboratories than PSI(ox). The present research suggests that while Hawaiian kikuyugrass pastures tend to be sufficient to high in forage P, potential soil P release to water only appeared to be a possible environmental concern for the Mollisol and Inceptisol sites. 3asurface water 3awater pollution 3apastures 3agrasses 3aPennisetum clandestinum 3aphosphorus 3asoil chemical properties 3alosses from soil 3achemical constituents of plants 3agenetic soil types 3asoil depth 3asoil texture 3aoxalates 3aextraction 3aprediction 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aPennisetumxchemistry 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aPlants, Edible 2aSoil 3aHawaii 0aHawaii1 aCarpenter, J.R.1 aSollenberger, L.E.1 aTsang, S.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2005 , v. 34, no. 4 p.1214-1223wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20060114b20060202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/08/29  aOther US 7aarticle03164naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002000180245008800200300001800288500001500306520169100321650002002012650002202032650001402054650002002068650001302088650002102101650002502122650001302147650001602160650002002176650002502196650002402221650001702245650003002262650001502292651001102307653002402318700001602342700001802358700001902376700001402395700001602409700001702425773008802442852000902530930003302539945002502572946001302597655001202610IND4373256420221118100830.0050812e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437325642DNAL7 a159420362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLindahl, A.M.L.10aStochastic modeling of diffuse pesticide losses from a small agricultural catchment  ap. 1174-1185.  a2019-12-05  aThe objective of this study was to identify the main sources of variation in pesticide losses at field and catchment scales using the dual permeability model MACRO. Stochastic simulations of the leaching of the herbicide MCPA (4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid) were compared with seven years of measured concentrations in a stream draining a small agricultural catchment and one year of measured concentrations at the outlet of a field located within the catchment. MACRO was parameterized from measured probability distributions accounting for spatial variability of soil properties and local pedotransfer functions derived from information gathered in field- and catchment-scale soil surveys. At the field scale, a single deterministic simulation using the means of the input distributions was also performed. The deterministic run failed to reproduce the summer outflows when most leaching occurred, and greatly underestimated pesticide leaching. In contrast, the stochastic simulations successfully predicted the hydrologic response of the field and catchment and there was a good resemblance between the simulations and measured MCPA concentrations at the field outlet. At the catchment scale, the stochastic approach underestimated the concentrations of MCPA in the stream, probably mostly due to point sources, but perhaps also because the distributions used for the input variables did not accurately reflect conditions in the catchment. Sensitivity analyses showed that the most important factors affecting MACRO modeled diffuse MCPA losses from this catchment were soil properties controlling macropore flow, precipitation following application, and organic carbon content. 3awater pollution 3asimulation models 3aequations 3asoil properties 3aleaching 3aMCPA (herbicide) 3astochastic processes 3adrainage 2aAgriculture 2aData Collection 2aHerbicidesxanalysis 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPermeability 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aSolubility 3aSweden 0amathematical models1 aKreuger, J.1 aStenstrom, J.1 aGardenas, A.I.1 aAlavi, G.1 aRoulier, S.1 aJarvis, N.J.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2005 , v. 34, no. 4 p.1174-1185x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20060114b20060202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/08/29  aOther US 7aarticle03597naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001400180245013900194300001800333500001500351520207200366650002002438650002302458650001902481650002402500650001302524650002302537650001502560650001302575650002402588650001602612650002502628650002702653650003302680650001102713650003002724650004102754651002102795651002102816653003002837700001402867700001802881773008802899852000902987930003302996945002503029946001303054655001203067IND4373256720221118100838.0050812e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437325672DNAL7 a159420372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWan, M.T.10aResidues of endosulfan and other selected organochlorine pesticides in farm areas of the Lower Fraser Valley, British Columbia, Canada  ap. 1186-1193.  a2019-12-05  aCrop soils, ditch sediments, and water flowing from several farm areas to salmon tributary streams of the Fraser River in the Lower Fraser Valley (LFV) of British Columbia, Canada, were sampled in 2002-2003 to quantify for residues of an organochlorine cyclodiene pesticide, endosulfan (END = alpha-endosulfan + beta-endosulfan + endosulfan sulfate). Residues from historical use of other selected organochlorine pesticides, namely, cyclodienes (aldrin, alpha-chlordane, gamma-chlordane, dieldrin, endrin, endrin aldehyde, heptachlor, and heptachlor epoxide), hexachlorocyclohexanes [alpha-benzene-hexachloride (alpha-BHC), beta-BHC, delta-BHC, and gamma-BHC (lindane)], and DDT-related compounds (p,p-DDT, p,p-DDD, p,p-DDE, and methoxychlor) were also determined. Reference and background levels of these pesticides in ditches leading to fish streams were obtained from pristine watershed areas. Varying amounts of END residues were detected in soils (<0.02-5.60 mg kg(-1) dry wt.) and ditch sediments (<0.02-3.33 mg kg(-1) dry wt.) in mainly three of five farm areas sampled. Likewise, residues (excluding END) of other selected organochlorine compounds such as aldrin, BHC, chlordane, endrin, p,p-DDT, methoxychlor, and their respective major transformation products (endosulfan sulfate, dieldrin, endrin aldehyde, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, p,p-DDD, and p,p-DDE) were found in crop soils (<0.02-16.2 mg kg(-1) dry wt.) and sediments (<0.02-9.73 mg kg(-1) dry wt.). Most of these pesticides (END: <0.01-1.86 microgram L(-1); other selected organochlorine pesticides: <0.0.1-1.50 microgram L(-1)) were also found in ditch water leading to salmon streams in several farms. The END levels of crop soils from the same LFV study farms in 1994 and 2003 indicated an estimated decline of 22% to 1.35 mg kg(-1) dry wt. during that period. This reduction was probably due to the increasing use of alternate pesticides (e.g., organophosphorus compounds). Some possible biological implications of these pesticide residues on nontarget organisms in the LFV are discussed. 3awater pollution 3aagricultural soils 3asoil pollution 3aagricultural runoff 3aleaching 3apesticide residues 3aendosulfan 3atoxicity 3anontarget organisms 2aAgriculture 2aEndosulfanxanalysis 2aInsecticidesxanalysis 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aRivers 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aBritish Columbia 0aBritish Columbia 0aorganochlorine pesticides1 aKuo, J.N.1 aPasternak, J.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2005 , v. 34, no. 4 p.1186-1193x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL  a20060114b20060202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/08/29  aOther US 7aarticle01491naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008100128300001600209520066300225650002800888650000900916650001600925650002000941650002600961650003100987700001601018773008901034852000901123930003301132945001301165946001101178655001201189IND2036138220221118100921.0931207e199306  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203613822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonaghy, J.A.10aProduction and properties of an alkaline protease by Aureobasidium pullulans  ap. 662-666.  aA strain of the yeast-like fungus Aureobasidium pullulans was grown on whey to produce an extracellular protease.

This endotoxin was activated at high alkaline pH without causing alkaline injury to the erythrocytes. The assay is carried out on blood agarose plates, prepared in MOPS-buffered saline (0.01 mol l-1), pH 7.0. The threshold dose for toxicity of Bti HD-567 was 8 ng protein and that of Bti H-14 and IPS-82 standard were 6 ng and 4 ng protein respectively. The assay is rapid, sensitive, quantitative and applicable to different Bti formulations to assess the toxicity of the products. Only the activated toxin is detected by this method and has good correlation with insect bioassay. The percentage toxicity dose of different Bti preparations agrees well with percentages of LC50 values when the second instar larvae of Aedes aegypti were tested. 3aBacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis 3aendotoxins 3acytotoxicity 3aerythrocytes 3aassays 3apH 0ain vitro 0aovicides and larvicides1 aRao, K.K.1 aChhatpar, H.S.0 tJournal of applied bacteriology.g1993 June, v. 74, no. 6 p.645-648x0021-88477nnas  aDNAL  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02513naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245010200207300002000309506007600329520109000405506003701495650001001532650001401542650001101556650001901567650001301586650001601599700001601615700001901631700002201650700002101672700002101693700001801714700001801732700001901750700001701769773017601786852000901962856008301971946001302054655001202067IND4441561620221207143018.0100820e20100817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444156162DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10079281072doi7 aPMC29304072pmcid7 a206792412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoolgar, Alexandra10aFluid intelligence loss linked to restricted regions of damage within frontal and parietal cortex  ap. 14899-14902.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTests of fluid intelligence predict success in a wide range of cognitive activities. Much uncertainty has surrounded brain lesions producing deficits in these tests, with standard group comparisons delivering no clear result. Based on findings from functional imaging, we propose that the uncertainty of lesion data may arise from the specificity and complexity of the relevant neural circuit. Fluid intelligence tests give a characteristic pattern of activity in posterolateral frontal, dorsomedial frontal, and midparietal cortex. To test the causal role of these regions, we examined fluid intelligence in 80 patients with focal cortical lesions. Damage to each of the proposed regions predicted fluid intelligence loss, whereas damage outside these regions was not predictive. The results suggest that coarse group comparisons (e.g., frontal vs. posterior) cannot show the neural underpinnings of fluid intelligence tests. Instead, deficits reflect the extent of damage to a restricted but complex brain circuit comprising specific regions within both frontal and posterior cortex.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3acognition 3acortex 3aimage analysis 3apatients 3auncertainty1 aParr, Alice1 aCusack, Rhodri1 aThompson, Russell1 aNimmo-Smith, Ian1 aTorralva, Teresa1 aRoca, María.1 aAntoun, Nagui1 aManes, Facundo1 aDuncan, John0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Aug. 17, v. 107, no. 33 p.14899-14902dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10079281073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02894naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245012000202300002000322506007600342520162400418506003702042650001502079650002102094650001402115650001202129650002002141700001802161700001902179700002602198700001502224773017602239852000902415856008302424946001302507655001202520IND4441561420221207143112.0100820e20100817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444156142DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10075431072doi7 aPMC29304212pmcid7 a206792322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Mingming10aDirect inhibition of P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels by Gem does not require a direct Gem/Cavβ interaction  ap. 14887-14892.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Rem, Rem2, Rad, and Gem/Kir (RGK) family of small GTP-binding proteins potently inhibits high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca²⁺ channels, providing a powerful means of modulating neural, endocrine, and muscle functions. The molecular mechanisms of this inhibition are controversial and remain largely unclear. RGK proteins associate directly with Ca²⁺ channel β subunits (Cavβ), and this interaction is widely thought to be essential for their inhibitory action. In this study, we investigate the molecular underpinnings of Gem inhibition of P/Q-type Ca²⁺ channels. We find that a purified Gem protein markedly and acutely suppresses P/Q channel activity in inside-out membrane patches, that this action requires Cavβ but not the Gem/Cavβ interaction, and that Gem coimmunoprecipitates with the P/Q channel α₁ subunit (Cavα₁) in a Cavβ-independent manner. By constructing chimeras between P/Q channels and Gem-insensitive low voltage-activated T-type channels, we identify a region encompassing transmembrane segments S1, S2, and S3 in the second homologous repeat of Cavα₁ critical for Gem inhibition. Exchanging this region between P/Q and T channel Cavα₁ abolishes Gem inhibition of P/Q channels and confers Cavβ-dependent Gem inhibition to a chimeric T channel that also carries the P/Q I-II loop (a cytoplasmic region of Cavα₁ that binds Cavβ). Our results challenge the prevailing view regarding the role of Cavβ in RGK inhibition of high voltage-activated Ca²⁺ channels and prompt a paradigm in which Gem directly binds and inhibits Cavβ-primed Cavα₁ on the plasma membrane.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aG-proteins 3acalcium channels 3achimerism 3amuscles 3aplasma membrane1 aBuraei, Zafir1 aLuo, Huai-Rong1 aLevenson-Palmer, Rose1 aYang, Jian0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Aug. 17, v. 107, no. 33 p.14887-14892dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10075431073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle04820naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010800124500019200232500002400424500001500448520278900463650001403252650002303266650001003289650002703299650001803326650001703344650002603361650001603387650001503403650001303418650002603431650001303457650001403470650001403484650001203498650001203510650001203522650001403534650001003548650000903558650001403567650001403581650001803595650000903613650001103622650001703633650001803650650002103668650002503689650001203714650001203726650001003738650002603748650001203774650002303786650002203809650002403831650001303855650001603868651001103884653001203895773011203907852000904019856008204028655001204110IND4464932420221117213241.0130215s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446493242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDudai, N.10aDomestication and breeding of wild medicinal and aromatic plants - thirty years of experience in Israel  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Medicinal, Aromatic and Nutraceutical Plants from Mountainous Areas, MAP-Mountain 2011, held July 6-9, 2011, Saas-Fee, Switzerland.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThere are many traditional medicinal and aromatic plants endemic to the Levant. The great climatic variations in Israel, in a relatively small area, create a wide range of natural habitats and high biodiversity of wild plants. The increased demand by industry for uniform and high quality raw material, together with the modern developments that fewer and fewer people still collect plants from the wild, and that some of the wild species plants are protected, has necessitated the cultivation of various species. This shortage of raw material has encouraged seed companies, researchers and farmers to select cultivars that could substitute for the raw material that once came from the wild. The first step in the domestication and breeding of wild plants is a survey of their dispersion according to existing distribution databases. Seed or vegetative propagation material of the target crops are systematically collected as representative of their natural diversity, and are grown in experimental fields in the Newe Ya’ar Research Center under intensive conditions - irrigation, fertilization and several harvests per year. Selection of new cultivars is somewhat different if the plant is annual or perennial and depends on the propagation methods as well. With annual species, propagation is usually done by seeds but with perennial species it could be done also by cuttings. Some of the most important annual aromatic species come from the Umbelliferae family (caraway, coriander, dill, etc.) but also from other families such as the - Labiatae (basil), Fabaceae (fenugreek), Brassicaceae (mustard) and Compositae (chamomile). In breeding a new cultivar, single plants with high performance (yield and quality) are selected from as many sources as possible. These single plants are tested in the same soil and climate conditions that later on will be the place of commercial production. The next step is to produce "families", by self-pollination, from each one of the selected plants, and again to choose only the best ones during 4 to 7 generations until a uniform line is obtained. Thus a new cultivar is "born". In perennial species, if there is a possibility of using vegetative propagation, the selection time could be shorter. The selected plants can be tested in plots after they are propagated by cuttings, as is necessary - before commercialization. This method has been used for oregano, thyme, onion, artemisia and others. Hybridization can be conducted through artificial crossing when the selection process alone does not produce a cultivar that has all the characteristics that are needed for commercial production. The next areas of study are physiology, the effects of environmental factors, and optimization of agro-technical methods of the selected cultivars. 3aArtemisia 3aCoriandrum sativum 3abasil 3avegetative propagation 3araw materials 3aBrassicaceae 3afield experimentation 3awild plants 3airrigation 3aindustry 3apropagation materials 3aFabaceae 3afenugreek 3adatabases 3aclimate 3aannuals 3acaraway 3acultivars 3aseeds 3adill 3achamomile 3aLamiaceae 3ahybridization 3asoil 3aonions 3abiodiversity 3adomestication 3aself-pollination 3abusiness enterprises 3afarmers 3asurveys 3athyme 3aenvironmental factors 3aoregano 3aindigenous species 3acommercialization 3aessential oil crops 3ahabitats 3aresearchers 3aIsrael 0amustard0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Aug., , no. 955dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://actahort.org/books/955/955_25.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03062naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010600127500019200233500002400425520163400449650001402083650001402097650001402111650002502125650001402150650001602164650001002180650001302190650001902203650001202222650001002234650004302244650002302287650002102310650001302331650001602344650001502360650001002375650001002385650001802395773011202413852000902525856008202534655001202616IND4464936220221117213226.0130215s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446493622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManukyan, A.10aBioactive compounds and health-promoting capacity of some Caucasian endemic and rare medicinal plants  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Medicinal, Aromatic and Nutraceutical Plants from Mountainous Areas, MAP-Mountain 2011, held July 6-9, 2011, Saas-Fee, Switzerland.  aIncludes references  aDespite the growth of the synthetic medicine production, there is a growing demand for herbal remedies for the world market. At the same time, in the last decades there has been a sharp increase of anthropogenic influence on the flora; particularly some rare and endangered herbs are more and more collected from wild populations in many regions of the world, also in Caucasian region, for local demand and export. The Caucasus is one of the richest and most threatened mountainous reservoirs of plant and animal life on Earth. The aim of this work is to study the content and the composition of biologically active compounds (essential oils, carotenoids, polyphenols, alkaloids and dianthrone derivatives) and their antioxidant capacity, as well as the lipid peroxidation potential of different eco races of some Caucasian endemic, rare, endangered and valuable medicinal plants as thyme (Thymus transcaucasicus), St John’s-wort (Hypericum eleonorae) and knapweed (Centaurea hajastana). The metabolite profiles of these herbs were analyzed by GC/MS and HPLC. Bioactive compounds were quantified and their health-promoting properties were analyzed in bioassays. It was shown that the content, composition, antioxidant activity and lipid peroxidation potential of studied biologically active compounds significantly depends on plant provenances (eco races). Such research can provide new important knowledge about the bioactive compounds and their pharmacological effects of the most promising ecotypes of selected Caucasian endemic and rare species. It can also make significant contribution in discovering new effective drugs. 3aCentaurea 3aHypericum 3aalkaloids 3aantioxidant activity 3abioassays 3acarotenoids 3adrugs 3aecotypes 3aessential oils 3aexports 3aflora 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alipid peroxidation 3amedicinal plants 3amedicine 3apolyphenols 3aprovenance 3araces 3athyme 3aworld markets0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Aug., , no. 955dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://actahort.org/books/955/955_51.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02576naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245008500164300001800249520114000267650002301407650003201430650005601462650004801518650005201566650004901618650001101667650002701678650002401705650005101729650008101780651002501861651002601886700001301912700001401925700001401939700001701953773009201970852000902062930003302071945001302104946001302117655001202130IND2057227320221117213300.0970520e199606  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205722732DNAL7 a87351122pmid7 aPMC2290562pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, H.C.10aSubspecies typing of Vibrio parahaemolyticus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  ap. 1535-1539.  aVibrio parahaemolyticus is one of the most important food-borne pathogens in Taiwan, Japan, and other coastal regions. We report on the development of a pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method for the molecular typing of this pathogen. Genomic DNA was digested with SfiI, and the fragments were resolved on 1% agarose with a contour-clamped homogeneous electric field apparatus set at 190 V and a pulse time of 3 to 80 s. A total of 130 selected isolates obtained from outbreaks during 1993 and 1994 on Taiwan were also characterized by this PFGE method. These isolates were grouped into 14 PFGE types which consisted of one to six patterns, and a total of 39 patterns were identified. Most of these domestic clinical isolates could be clustered into several major types (types A, B, C, and G). These major types showed relatively low degrees of similarity to several foreign strains and other domestic but environmental strains. Strain CCRC12863, which originated from Japan, was close to the group consisting of F, G, and H PFGE types, suggesting a clonal relationship between this Japanese strain and other domestic isolates. 3afood contamination 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aDNA, Bacterialxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Fieldxmethods 2aFoodborne Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aGastroenteritisxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aHumans 2aMolecular Epidemiology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVibrio Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aVibrio parahaemolyticusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 0aJapanxepidemiology. 0aTaiwanxepidemiology.1 aLu, K.T.1 aPan, T.M.1 aLee, C.L.1 aShih, D.Y.C.0 tJournal of clinical microbiology.g1996 June, v. 34, no. 6 p.1535-1539x0095-11377nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle02599naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005400127500019200181500002400373520133300397650002101730650002101751650001401772650001201786650002801798650001901826650001201845650001501857650001101872650001801883650001001901651001601911651001601927700001501943700002101958700001901979773011201998852000902110856008202119655001202201IND4464935820221117213307.0130215s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446493582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarron, C.A.10aAchillea collina 'Spak': optimal harvesting stage  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Medicinal, Aromatic and Nutraceutical Plants from Mountainous Areas, MAP-Mountain 2011, held July 6-9, 2011, Saas-Fee, Switzerland.  aIncludes references  aAchillea collina is cultivated in the European Alps for its chamazulene-containing essential oil. In Switzerland, 'Spak' is a homogenous and productive cultivar that was developed by Agroscope to match the local climatic conditions. Up to now, Swiss producers used to harvest at the BBCH stage 65 (>50% of plants blooming) and at 15-20 cm from the ground in order to exclude the colourless basal leaves and the ligneous stems. However, as a result of harvest procedure, the amount of non-ligneous stems in the dry matter tends to become too high, and plants with longer stems were shown to have lower essential oil and chamazulene contents. In 2009 and 2010, the influence of phenological stages on yield and quality was studied. The maximum dry weight was achieved at full-bloom stage. However, the leave/stem ratio of 35% in 2010 was too low due to a cutting height at 20 cm above ground. The highest essential oil content in the leaves and flowers was obtained at the 'early-bloom' stage. In contrast, the chamazulene content in the essential oil was not influenced by the harvest stages. In conclusion, harvesting the upper 60 cm horizon of the plants at 'early-bloom' to 'full-bloom' stages (20-50% of blooming plants) is recommended for A. collina. This represents the best compromise between dry matter yield and quality. 3aAchillea collina 3aclimatic factors 3acultivars 3acutting 3adry matter accumulation 3aessential oils 3aflowers 3aharvesting 3aleaves 3alipid content 3astems 3aAlps region 3aSwitzerland1 aLebleu, F.1 aVouillamoz, J.F.1 aBaroffio, C.A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Aug., , no. 955dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://actahort.org/books/955/955_48.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01736naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001500141245008500156300001600241520086900257650001801126650002001144650000901164650001401173700001701187700001701204773007701221852000901298856008101307930003301388946001301421655001201434IND4369169920221117213227.0050421e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436916992DNAL7 a10.1093/jhered/esi0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, D.10aSex-linked Markers Facilitate Genetic Parentage Analyses in Knobbed Whelk Broods  ap. 108-113.  aTo explore the potential of sex-linked polymorphisms for genetic parentage analyses in natural populations, we have employed a recently discovered "X-linked" microsatellite marker (in conjunction with polymorphic autosomal loci) to deduce biological paternity and maternity for large numbers of encapsulated embryos within individual broods of the knobbed whelk (Busycon carica). Empirical findings illustrate how such sex-linked genetic tags can in special instances find at least three novel utilities in genetic dissections of large-clutch species: clarification of paternity assignments that had remained ambiguous from di-locus autosomal data alone; elucidation of linkage relationships among pairs of autosomal loci; and illumination of maternity (and thereby paternity also) in broods for which neither biological parent was known from independent evidence. 3aencapsulation 3agenetic markers 3aloci 3apaternity1 aPower, A.

Heynh. Precursors used in the experiment were 13C- and 2H (D)-labeled [8-13C, 3-OCD3]ferulic acid and [8-13C, 3,5-OCD3]sinapic acid. The incorporation of labeled precursor into lignin was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the products of derivatization followed by reductive cleavage. Crude extracts of differentiating xylem or stems from these plants were also assayed for 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL; EC 6.2.1.12) activity using sinapic acid and ferulic acid as substrates. In robinia and oleander, 4CL activity toward sinapic acid was detected, and labeled sinapic acids were incorporated into syringyl lignin. These results indicate that robinia and oleander have a pathway that produces sinapyl alcohol from sinapic acid via sinapoyl-CoA. By contrast, in magnolia and Arabidopsis, 4CL activity toward sinapic acid could not be detected, and labeled sinapic acid was not incorporated into lignin. These results suggest that syringyl lignin biosynthesis in angiosperms operates via multiple pathways that depend on the species. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3ainterspecific variation 3aisotope labeling 3astems 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon 3aligases 3aMagnolia kobus 3acell differentiation 3axylem 3astable isotopes 2aAcyl Coenzyme Axmetabolism 2aMagnoliopsidaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aCoumaric Acidsxmetabolism 2aEnzymesxmetabolism 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aLigninxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aMagnoliaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aNeriumxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRobiniaxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aspecies differences1 aYasuda, S.1 aHamada, K.1 aTsutsumi, Y.1 aFukushima, K.0 tPlanta.g2003 Jan., v. 216, no. 3 p.496-501x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03452naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245013300144300001600277520136600293650001901659650001401678650002201692650001201714650001001726650001301736650002101749650002501770650001901795650001901814650002801833650002301861650002101884650002001905650001701925650001701942650002901959650002201988650002102010650002302031650002502054650006602079650005302145650003502198650004302233650005702276650004102333650001702374650005902391653005202450653003902502653002702541700001602568700001802584700001502602700001402617700001602631773006502647852000902712930003302721945001302754946001102767655001202778IND2333119220221117213130.0030619e200302  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233311922DNAL7 a125694142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarker, M.10aCo-ordinate regulation of sterol biosynthesis enzyme activity during accumulation of sterols in developing rape and tobacco seed  ap. 707-715.  aThe activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, sterol methyl transferase 1 and sterol acyltransferase, key enzymes involved in phytosterol biosynthesis were shown to be co-ordinately regulated during oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) seed development. In both plants, enzyme activities were low during the initial stages of seed development, increasing towards mid-maturation where they remained stable for a time, before declining rapidly as the oilseeds reached maturity. During seed development, the level of total sterols increased 12-fold in tobacco and 9-fold in rape, primarily due to an increase in steryl ester production. In both seed tissues, stages of maximum enzyme activity coincided with periods of high rates of sterol production, indicating developmental regulation of the enzymes to be responsible for the increases in the sterol content observed during seed development. Consistent with previous studies the data presented suggest that sterol biosynthesis is regulated by two key steps, although there may be others. The first is the regulation of carbon flux into the isoprenoid pathway to cycloartenol. The second is the flux from cycloartenol to 5-end-product sterols. The implications of the results in terms of enhancing seed sterol levels by genetic modification are also discussed. 3aBrassica napus 3aoil crops 3aNicotiana tabacum 3atobacco 3aseeds 3aoilseeds 3aseed development 3adevelopmental stages 3aplant extracts 3aplant proteins 3aalcohol oxidoreductases 3amethyltransferases 3aacyltransferases 3aenzyme activity 3aphytosterols 3abiosynthesis 3aphysiological regulation 3alipid composition 3atriacylglycerols 3achemical structure 3abiochemical pathways 2aBrassica napusxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aHydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductasesxmetabolism 2aMethyltransferasesxmetabolism 2aPhytosterolsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aSeedsxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSterol O-Acyltransferasexmetabolism 2aTime Factors 2aTobaccoxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0a3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase 0asterol methyltransferase 1 protein 0asterol acyltransferase1 aHellyer, A.1 aClayton, J.C.1 aDuvoix, A.1 aLanot, A.1 aSafford, R.0 tPlanta.g2003 Feb., v. 216, no. 4 p.707-715x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdRSC  aNon-US 7aarticle03578naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245007300148300001600221500001500237520162200252650001501874650001701889650001401906650002501920650001001945650001901955650001401974650002201988650001702010650001802027650001902045650002002064650001102084650002202095650002102117650001602138650004602154650003802200650002502238650003502263650004202298650005902340650002302399650001702422650006202439653004302501653001802544653002702562653002202589653001002611653001802621653004202639653001902681700001502700700001602715700001502731700001502746773006502761852000902826930003302835945001302868946001102881655001202892IND2333118820221117213159.0030619e200302  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233311882DNAL7 a125694132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurnbull, K.M.10aEarly expression of grain hardness in the developing wheat endosperm  ap. 699-706.  a2019-12-05  aSeeds from near-isogenic hard and soft wheat lines were harvested at regular intervals from 5 days post-anthesis to maturity and examined for hardness using the single kernel characterisation system (SKCS). SKCS analysis revealed that hard and soft lines could be distinguished from 15 days post-anthesis (dpa). This trend continued until maturity where the difference between the hard and soft lines was most marked. SKCS could not be applied to the small 5- and 10-dpa wheat kernels. Fresh developing endosperm material was examined using light microscopy and no visible differences between the cultivars were detected. When air-dried material was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) differences between soft and hard lines were visible from as early as 5 dpa. Accumulation of puroindoline a and puroindoline b was investigated in developing seeds using both Western blotting and ELISA. Low levels of puroindoline a could be detected in the soft cultivar from 10 dpa, reaching a maximum at 32 dpa. In the hard cultivar, puroindoline a levels were negligible throughout grain development. Puroindoline b accumulates in both the soft and hard cultivars from 15 dpa, but overall contents were higher in the soft cultivar. These findings indicate that endosperm hardness is expressed very early in developing grain when few starch granules and storage proteins were deposited in the endosperm cells. Further, the near-isogenic soft and hard Heron lines could be differentiated by SEM at a stage in development when the accumulation of puroindolines could not be detected by the methods used in this study. 3afood crops 3abiosynthesis 3ahistology 3adevelopmental stages 3awheat 3aplant extracts 3aendosperm 3aTriticum aestivum 3aseed quality 3awheat protein 3aultrastructure 3aprotein content 3adrying 3alight microscopes 3aseed development 2aDesiccation 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aStarchxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 2aTriticumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 0atriticum aestivum puroindoline protein 0askcs analysis 0agrain softness protein 0aendosperm texture 0aseeds 0aseed hardness 0asingle kernel characterization system 0agrain hardness1 aMarion, D.1 aGaborit, T.1 aAppels, R.1 aRahman, S.0 tPlanta.g2003 Feb., v. 216, no. 4 p.699-706x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdRSC  aNon-US 7aarticle02629naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002600141245015600167300001400323520135900337650003401696650001501730650002301745650003901768650001001807650002001817650001601837650001401853650003101867650001801898650001301916650002001929650002901949700001401978700001601992773007502008852000902083856008102092930003302173946001302206655001202219IND4370688020190612000000.0050529e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437068802DNAL7 a10.1093/jhered/esi0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Piñón, M.

The karyotype (2n = 38) consists of three submetacentric-metacentric, one submetacentric, one subtelocentric-submetacentric, and 14 subtelocentric pairs. The 18S-28S rDNA maps at the centromeric level of two subtelocentric pairs, but not more than two nucleolus organizer region (NOR)-bearing chromosomes were transcriptionally active. The 5S rDNA seems to show a conventional tandem arrangement with a repeat unit of about 450 bp and it maps at the pericentromeric region of the long arm of one subtelocentric pair. Two-color FISH demonstrated that 18S-28S rDNA and 5S rDNA are not syntenic. Sequential FISH/Giemsa staining and subsequent chromosome pairing allow us to propose that pairs 9 and 12 carry the 18S-28S rDNA and pair 13 carries the 5S rDNA. All chromosomes are characterized as containing constitutive heterochromatin at the centromeric region. The data provided are the first contribution toward construction of the molecular karyotype of H. distortus and will be useful in assessing evolutionary relationships within scallops. 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aPectinidae 3achromosome pairing 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3aheterochromatin 3akaryotyping 3ametaphase 3anucleolus organizer region 3aribosomal DNA 3ascallops 3asilver staining 3atranscription (genetics)1 aInsua, A.1 aMéndez, J.0 tJournal of heredity.g2005 Jan., v. 96, no. 1 p.52-58x0022-15037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esi0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20050811b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04845naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001900141245008500160300001600245520344200261650001803703650001303721650001103734650001503745650001503760650001103775650002503786650001703811650000903828650002103837650001103858650001203869650001103881650001403892650001903906650002103925650001903946650001403965650001303979650002503992650001404017650002104031650001404052650001404066650002604080773007304106852000904179856008104188930003304269946001304302655001204315IND4370688820221117212848.0050529e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437068882DNAL7 a10.1093/jhered/esi0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGehring, W. J.10aNew Perspectives on Eye Development and the Evolution of Eyes and Photoreceptors  ap. 171-184.  aRecent experiments on the genetic control of eye development have opened up a completely new perspective on eye evolution. The demonstration that targeted expression of one and the same master control gene, that is, Pax6 can induce the formation of ectopic eyes in both insects and vertebrates, necessitates a reconsideration of the dogma of a polyphyletic origin of the various eye types in all the animal phyla. The involvement of Pax6 and six1 and six3 genes, which encode highly conserved transcription factors, in the genetic control of eye development in organisms ranging from planarians to humans argues strongly for a monophyletic origin of the eye. Because transcription factors can control the expression of any target gene provided it contains the appropriate gene regulatory elements, the conservation of the genetic control of eye development by Pax6 among all bilaterian animals is not due to functional constraints but a consequence of its evolutionary history. The prototypic eyes postulated by Darwin to consist of two cells only, a photoreceptor and a pigment cell, were accidentally controlled by Pax6 and the subsequent evolution of the various eye types occurred by building onto this original genetic program. A hypothesis of intercalary evolution is proposed that assumes that the eye morphogenetic pathway is progressively modified by intercalation of genes between the master control genes on the top of the hierarchy and the structural genes like rhodopsin at the bottom. The recruitment of novel genes into the eye morphogenetic pathway can be due to at least two different genetic mechanisms, gene duplication and enhancer fusion.In tracing back the evolution of eyes beyond bilaterians, we find highly developed eyes in some box-jellyfish as well as in some Hydrozoans. In Hydrozoans the same orthologous six genes (six1 and six3) are required for eye regeneration as in planarians, and in the box jellyfish Tripedalia a pax B gene, which may be a precursor of Pax6, was found to be expressed in the eyes. In contrast to the adults, which have highly evolved eyes, the Planula larva of Tripedalia has single- celled photoreceptors similar to some unicellular protists. For the origin of photoreceptor cells in metazoa, I propose two hypotheses, one based on cellular differentiation and a more speculative one based on symbiosis. The former assumes that photoreceptor cells originated from a colonial protist in which all the cells were photosensitive and subsequent cellular differentiation to give rise to photoreceptor cells. The symbiont hypothesis, which I call the Russian doll model, assumes that photosensitivity arose first in photosynthetic cyanobacteria that were subsequently taken up into red algae as primary chloroplasts. The red algae in turn were taken up by dinoflagellates as secondary chloroplasts and in some species evolved into the most sophisticated eye organelles, as found, for example, in some dinoflagellates like Erythropsis and Warnovia, which lack chloroplasts. Because dinoflagellates are commonly found as symbionts in cnidarians, the dinoflagellates may have transferred their photoreceptor genes to cnidarians. In cnidarians such as Tripedalia the step from photoreceptor organelles to multicellular eyes has occurred. These two hypotheses, the cellular differentiation and the symbiont hypothesis, are not mutually exclusive and are the subject of further investigations. 3aCyanobacteria 3aHydrozoa 3aMiozoa 3aRhodophyta 3aTripedalia 3aadults 3acell differentiation 3achloroplasts 3aeyes 3agene duplication 3ahumans 3ainsects 3amodels 3amonophyly 3aphotoreceptors 3aphotosensitivity 3aphotosynthesis 3apolyphyly 3aprotists 3aregulatory sequences 3arhodopsin 3astructural genes 3asymbionts 3asymbiosis 3atranscription factors0 tJournal of heredity.g2005 , v. 96, no. 3 p.171-184x0022-15037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esi0273Available from publisher's Web site  a20050529b20050604c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02355naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008300129300001800212500028100230500002400511520089100535650001701426650002401443650001101467650002001478650002201498650001701520650001301537650001401550650000901564650001701573650001601590650001001606650001501616650001801631700001601649700001301665700001601678773014301694852000901837856008701846655001201933IND4464936820221117212526.0130215s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446493682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumitrascu, M.10aStudies regarding the behavior of some ornamental plants in large parking lots  ap. 1089-1092.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Advances in Ornamentals, Landscape and Urban Horticulture, volume 2, Organized on the Occasion of the 28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People, held August 22-27, 2010, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  aTrees in urban environments have important ecological functions. Parking lots often restrict ornamental plant growth. Low soil cover and planting volume, high temperature, limited water availability and pollution are main factors with negative influence on vegetation. This case study looked at the growth conditions of different ornamental plants in parking lots of a shopping center. Green areas in large parking lots are either isolated blocks or narrow strips. Drip irrigation was provided only for strips. Tree stress was monitored for tree length, crown diameter, live crown ratio, crown volume, crown density, foliage transparency, trunk diameter, leaf size, and leaf water content. Climatic stress affects plants by decreasing leaves surface area and plant growth rhythm. Trees planted in blocks are obviously more affected by available soil volume than trees planted in strips. 3acase studies 3aecological function 3aleaves 3amicroirrigation 3aornamental plants 3aplant growth 3aplanting 3apollution 3asoil 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atrees 3avegetation 3awater content1 aManescu, C.1 aGala, R.1 aStanica, F.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Sept., , no. 937 p.1089-1092dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/937/937_135.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02036naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002100154245009600175300001600271520111400287650002801401650001401429650001001443650001601453650001601469653001501485700002001500773009201520852000901612856005701621939003301678946001101711655001201722IND8800504020221117212821.0880506e198803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880050402DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0875552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrongkongsin, K.10aPhotoperiod and temperature effects on late developmental stages of Stylosanthes guianensis  ap. 283-288.  aSeedlings of Stylosanthes guianensis var. guianensis cv. Cook and S. guianensis var. pauciflora cv. Bandeirante were defoliated and placed in a naturally lit glasshouse at 23/18 °C, 28/23 °C or 33/28 °C (day/night). After exposure to 14 h days and after floral induction with 30 cycles of 11 h, plants were allocated to 11, 12, 13 or 14 h during flowering and seed formation. Floral initiation occurred after 10–15 short-day cycles. Flower appearance was hastened by warm temperatures and spike number per plant at 20 d after flower appearance was negatively related to temperature and greater in Cook than in Bandeirante. Exposure to 13- and 14-h days reduced the continued differentiation of inflorescences in Bandeirante, and in Cook in warm temperatures. Floret number per spike was greatest at 23/18 °C and a higher proportion of florets aborted in Bandeirante at 33/ 28 °C. Variations in seed setting of the bi-articulate loment of Bandeirante are described. Highest potential seed yield occurred if after floral induction 11 or 12 h days were maintained with 23/18 °C or 28/23 °C temperatures. 3aStylosanthes guianensis 3aflowering 3aseeds 3aphotoperiod 3atemperature 0ainitiation1 aHumphreys, L.R.0 tAnnals of botany.g1988 Mar., v. 61, no. 3 p.283-288wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a087555  a00000000b19880506c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01837naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002700128245007800155300001600233500008800249500001500337520031800352650002400670650000900694650003500703650002000738650002000758650001500778650006400793650000900857650002200866650001100888650006100899650004000960650004701000653001201047653002301059653002301082653001201105653001501117653002601132653002501158773009401183852000901277930003301286945001301319946001101332655001201343IND2062581820221117212741.0980319e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206258182DNAL7 a85248932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFairweather-Tait, S.J.10aIron-zinc and calcium-Fe interactions in relation to Zn and Fe absorption  ap. 465-473.  aPaper presented at the symposium on "Micronutrient interactions," August 2-5, 1994.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper reviews and evaluates what is known about iron-zinc and calcium-iron interactions and their potential effects on health.

We have identified, sequenced, and quantified the induction of a number of transcripts that are up-regulated by a brief (2-h) exposure to 25 micrometer cadmium chloride, including one transcript which is also highly responsive to iron (Fe) deficiency. These transcripts represent both nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded genes, and include both novel genes and genes with known or suspected functions. Among these is a gene with significant homology to HCR1, a high-CO2- and Fe-deficiency-inducible gene from Chlorococcum littorale. We further characterized the regulation of the HCR1-like gene (H43) and found that this transcript is also induced by Fe-depletion of the medium. Heterologous expression of H43 in the Fe-uptake mutant fet3fet4 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in partial suppression of the slow-growth phenotype of this mutant in minimal medium, and resulted in a 2-fold increase in Fe accumulation per cell. Our results demonstrate the utility of Chlamydomonas cw(-) strains for functional genomics studies of metal stress. The magnitudes of induction and functional analyses suggest possible utility for these genes in the study of metal stress sensing in green plants and development of novel Fe acquisition and phytoremediation strategies. 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3acadmium 3airon 3agene expression 3anutrient uptake 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3aquantitative analysis 3achloroplast DNA 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCadmiumxpharmacology 2aCadmium Chloridexpharmacology 2aCarbon Dioxidexpharmacology 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aIronxpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 0amolecular sequence data1 aSiripornadulsil, S.1 aGao-Rubinelli, F.1 aSayre, R.T.0 tPlanta.g2002 May, v. 215, no. 1 p.1-13x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01488naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245003800145300001600183500009400199500001500293520032300308650002300631650001800654650002200672650002200694650001200716650002500728650004400753650001100797650002700808650003000835653002300865653001500888653001500903773009400918852000901012930003301021945001301054946001101067655001201078IND2062583920221117213017.0980319e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206258392DNAL7 a85248982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyd, C.A.R.10aIntestinal oligopeptide transport  ap. 519-523.  aPaper presented at the symposium on "Nitrogen transactions in the gut," August 2-5, 1994.  a2019-12-05  aThis article reviews intestinal transport of peptides.

BY-2 cells were examined. The number of BY-2 cells decreased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner after being exposed to micromolar concentrations of iPA. This decrease was mainly due to a loss of cell viability, since no substantial changes in cell cycle progression were revealed by flow-cytometric analysis. Dying cells exhibited the typical morphological and biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis, including cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and degradation of nuclear DNA to nucleosomal size fragments. Caspase-1-like and caspase-3-like proteases also became activated, the former being dominant. Inhibitor-sensitivity studies revealed that although synthetic caspase inhibitors failed to prevent cell death they markedly reduced cell death in tobacco BY-2 cells, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, a specific inhibitor for caspase-1, being the most effective. Our results indicate that caspase-like proteases, and particularly caspase-1-like protease, might be critically implicated in iPA-induced apoptosis of BY-2 cells. Finally, the outcome of inhibiting adenosine kinase by 4-amino-3-iodo-1(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)pyrazolo [3,4-d]-pyrimidine revealed that intracellular phosphorylation of iPA is required for its cytotoxicity to develop. 3aviability 3aproteinases 3aDNA 3acell division 3aNicotiana tabacum 3achromatin 3acell lines 3aplant morphology 3aapoptosis 2aAmino Acid Chloromethyl Ketonesxpharmacology 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCaspase 1xmetabolism 2aCaspase 3 2aCaspase Inhibitors 2aCaspasesxmetabolism 2aCells, Cultured 2aCytokininsxpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEndopeptidasesxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aIsopentenyladenosinexpharmacology 2aOligopeptidesxpharmacology 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aTobaccoxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 0acultured cells1 aProchazka, S.0 tPlanta.g2002 May, v. 215, no. 1 p.158-166x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03002naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245021500143300001400358500001500372520110600387650001501493650001101508650002801519650002201547650002501569650002501594650001501619650001101634650002001645650001601665650003001681650003201711650003601743650004401779650002401823650004001847650002301887650002501910650002401935650002601959650003301985650002602018650004002044650003002084653001802114700001602132700001702148700001802165700001502183700001502198700001802213700001702231773006202248852000902310930003302319945001302352946001102365655001202376IND2333362420221117213032.0030708e200205  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233336242DNAL7 a120122442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitra, A.10a4-Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase/lyase, an enzyme of phenylpropanoid cleavage from Pseudomonas, causes formation of C6-C1 acid and alcohol glucose conjugates when expressed in hairy roots of Datura stramonium L  ap. 79-89.  a2019-12-05  a4-Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase/lyase (HCHL), a crotonase homologue of phenylpropanoid catabolism from Pseudomonas fluorescens strain AN103, led to the formation of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde metabolites when expressed in hairy root cultures of Datura stramonium L. established by transformation with Agrobacterium rhizogenes. The principal new compounds observed were the glucoside and glucose ester of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, together with 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol-O-beta-D-glucoside. In lines actively expressing HCHL, these together amounted to around 0.5% of tissue fresh mass. No protocatechuic derivatives were found, although a trace of vanillic acid-beta-D-glucoside was detected. There was no accumulation of 4-hydroxybenzaldehydes, whether free or in the form of their glucose conjugates. There was some evidence suggesting a diminished availability of feruloyl-CoA for the production of feruloyl putrescine and coniferyl alcohol. The findings are discussed in the context of a diversion of phenylpropanoid metabolism, and the ability of plants and plant cultures to conjugate phenolic compounds. 3ametabolism 3alyases 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aDatura stramonium 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3abiochemical pathways 3aglucosides 3aesters 3aenzyme activity 3ametabolites 2aBenzaldehydesxmetabolism 2aDatura stramoniumxgenetics 2aEnoyl-CoA Hydratasexmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aHydro-Lyasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLigninxmetabolism 2aParabensxmetabolism 2aPhenolsxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPropanolsxmetabolism 2aPseudomonas fluorescensxenzymology 2aVanillic Acidxmetabolism 0acarbohydrates1 aMayer, M.J.1 aMellon, F.A.1 aMichael, A.J.1 aNarbad, A.1 aParr, A.J.1 aWaldron, K.W.1 aWalton, N.J.0 tPlanta.g2002 May, v. 215, no. 1 p.79-89x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02808naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010400128300001400232500002400246500002300270520163500293650001101928650001001939650001301949650001101962650001201973650002201985650001602007650002202023650002602045650001902071650002202090650000902112650001002121650001302131650002102144700002202165773009402187852000902281856010802290655001202398IND4464926820221117212435.0130213s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446492682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRam, Jason I.10aDextran sulfate protects porcine but not bovine cultured endothelial cells from free radical injury  ap. 81-87.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aPrevious studies demonstrated that the polyanion dextran sulfate (DS) protects rat coronary and porcine aortic endothelium (PAE) from oxygen-derived free radical (OFR) injury due to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XO). To determine if DS has a similar protective effect in bovine aortic endothelium (BAE) and bovine brain microvascular endothelium (BBME), H2O2 or X/XO was added to confluent cultures. Cell injury was assessed 1 d later by measuring the percentage of viable cells (by trypan blue exclusion) and the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the medium. After H2O2 doses of 6.0 mM for BAE and BBME and 0.8 mM for PAE, and after X doses of 10 μM and XO doses of 0.3 U/mL for all cell types, approximately 50% of cells were viable. Cultures were pretreated with DS (0.001 to 500 μg/mL) 24 to 26 h prior to H2O2 or X/XO exposure. Pretreatment at concentrations of 0.5, 5, and 50 μg/mL significantly increased the percentage of viable cells and reduced LDH release in cultures of PAE, but not BAE or BBME, treated with H2O2. Similarly, pretreatment with DS concentrations of 5 and 50 μg/mL significantly increased the percentage of viable cells and reduced LDH release in cultures of PAE, but not BAE or BBME, treated with X/XO. Thus, DS protected porcine but not bovine endothelium. Catalase (10 U/mL) increased the percentage of viable cells and reduced LDH release in H2O2-treated BAE and BBME, suggesting that DS likely acts by a different mechanism and does not neutralize H2O2. These results suggest that the protective effect of DS on OFR-injured endothelium is species-dependent. 3aanions 3abrain 3acatalase 3acattle 3adextran 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelium 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aneutralization 3aprotective effect 3arats 3aswine 3axanthine 3axanthine oxidase1 aHiebert, Linda M.0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g2003 May, v. 67, no. 2 p.81-87x0830-90007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://pubmedcentral.com/tocrender.fcgi?action=archive&journal=1333Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle00992naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245004500115300001600160520017000176650000900346650001800355650001700373650001500390650002100405650002300426650001800449650002800467653001000495773011000505852000900615939003300624945000800657946001300665655001200678991619010130742620221117212414.0930303e199210  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930009282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aEating right: it's easier than you think  ap. 652-653.  aThis article outlines moderate but consistent dietary changes that can improve an individuals diet.

In an earlier study, which evaluated sampling tools for use with bulls, it was observed that the sensitivity of the diagnostic test was higher for 2nd samples collected from the right side of the prepuce than it was for samples collected 1st from the left side. The study described in this paper was conducted to evaluate which of these factors was responsible for the effect on diagnostic sensitivity. Twenty-nine bulls infected with T. foetus were repeatedly sampled in a 2-factor cross-over design. Samples taken from the right side of the prepuce were 4 times as likely to be positive as samples taken from the left side (P = 0.03). Other factors did not have a significant effect on the outcome of the diagnostic test. Unexpected factors may affect the sensitivity of the diagnostic test for T. foetus. 3aTritrichomonas foetus 3abulls 3across-over studies 3adiagnostic sensitivity 3aprepuce 3at-test1 aCampbell, John1 aRibble, Carl1 aGajadhar, Alvin0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g2003 May, v. 67, no. 2 p.138-141x0830-90007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://pubmedcentral.com/tocrender.fcgi?action=archive&journal=1333Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01486naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002400115245005900139300001400198500001500212520043800227650001500665650001300680650001500693650002000708650003000728653002300758653001500781653002700796711017200823773009200995852000901087939003301096945000801129946001101137655001201148991619006910742620221117212843.0860319e198502  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860100562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevinsky, Roland J.10aFactors influencing intestinal uptake of food antigens  ap. 81-86.  a2019-12-05  aA review of recent literature findings summarizes and discusses various factors that influence the intestinal uptake of food antigens.

Control animals received an intracerebral collagenase injection followed by intraperitoneal (IP) saline injection. Sham operated animals received saline only (IC, IP). Forty-eight hours following the surgeries, the brains were removed from the euthanized animals. Cerebral hemispheres were separated and the 4 coronal sections (antero-posterior plane) were weighed. Each slice was dried for 24 h (100°C) and weighed again to establish brain water content. In hematoma-induced saline treated rats, significant differences in brain water content were observed when compared to sham operated animals. Rats treated with 1 mg/kg dexamethasone had a significant brain water content decrease; however, no significant differences were observed with higher doses of dexamethasone. In conclusion, low doses of dexamethasone seem to be beneficial for the treatment of cerebral trauma. 3aanimal models 3abrain 3acollagenase 3adexamethasone 3ahematoma 3arats 3asurgery 3awater content1 aMoreau, Jean-Pierre0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g2003 May, v. 67, no. 2 p.157-159x0830-90007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://pubmedcentral.com/tocrender.fcgi?action=archive&journal=1333Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02317naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245006500144300001600209520064800225650002800873650001300901650002800914650002000942650001400962650002100976650003300997650005701030650004101087650002001128650003901148650003501187650003601222650002201258650002501280650003401305650005401339650005201393653001101445653002401456700001901480700001801499700001601517700001401533700001601547700001501563700001701578700002501595773006501620852000901685930003301694945001301727946001101740655001201751IND2332515120221117211730.0030512e200301  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233251512DNAL7 a125203302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMimura, T.10aRapid increase of vacuolar volume in response to salt stress  ap. 397-402.  aSuspension-cultured cells of mangrove [Bruguiera sexangula (Lour.)

The rapid increase in the vacuolar volume was an active process, which followed the activation of the tonoplast H(+)-ATPase and the vacuolar acid phosphatase. The same phenomenon was observed in barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Doriru) root meristematic cells under salt stress but not in pea (Pisum sativum L.). Increases in vacuolar volume could potentially protect the cytoplasm by decreasing the cytoplasmic volume during the initial phases of salt stress. 3acell suspension culture 3asalinity 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aenzyme activity 3acytoplasm 3aapplication rate 2aAcid Phosphatasexmetabolism 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aAvicenniaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCells, Cultured 2aHordeumxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aOsmotic Pressurexdrug effects 2aPeasxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPlant Development 2aPlantsxdrug effects 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aVacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPasesxmetabolism 2aVacuolesxdrug effectsxenzymologyxphysiology. 0astress 0abruguiera sexangula1 aKura-Hotta, M.1 aTsujimura, T.1 aOhnishi, M.1 aMiura, M.1 aOkazaki, Y.1 aMimura, M.1 aMaeshima, M.1 aWashitani-Nemoto, S.0 tPlanta.g2003 Jan., v. 216, no. 3 p.397-402x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02839naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008300124500019200207500002400399520142500423650002401848650001701872650001401889650002501903650001601928650001601944650001501960650001601975650004401991650001102035650001302046650002602059650002302085650001202108650001502120650001602135700001802151700001702169700001702186773011202203852000902315856008102324655001202405IND4464930620221117211721.0130215s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446493062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbet, C.10aChemical constituents of Phyteuma Orbiculare, a forgotten food plant of Valais  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Medicinal, Aromatic and Nutraceutical Plants from Mountainous Areas, MAP-Mountain 2011, held July 6-9, 2011, Saas-Fee, Switzerland.  aIncludes references  aNumerous wild plants have been used as foods in the past by local Alpine populations. Most of these have fallen into oblivion, and very little is known about their constituents and biological properties. We recently initiated a project to identify forgotten plants which could potentially be taken into cultivation and re-established as food plants with interesting sensory properties and a phytochemical composition which might have beneficial effects on health. Based on an ethnobotanical survey in the Lower Valais region, and on considerations concerning the feasibility of large scale cultivation, the round-headed rampion (Phyteuma orbiculare, Campanulaceae), a perennial herb that was eaten in the past as a salad, was selected for a detailed phytochemical investigation. Different extracts of the aerial parts were submitted to a comprehensive metabolite profiling using a combination of TLC, HPLC-UV, HPLC-MS and off-line microprobe NMR analysis. Various secondary metabolites including saponins and flavonoids were detected in the aerial parts of P. orbiculare, and two saponins with structurally unique aglycons were isolated and characterized. Preliminary data on nutritionally valuable substances such as carotenes and fatty acids were obtained for a specimen collected near Orsières (Valais). Further investigations on samples collected at different locations and at various vegetation stages are planned. 3aPhyteuma orbiculare 3aaerial parts 3acarotenes 3achemical composition 3aethnobotany 3afatty acids 3aflavonoids 3afood plants 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asalads 3asaponins 3asecondary metabolites 3asensory properties 3asurveys 3avegetation 3awild plants1 aHamburger, M.1 aPotterat, O.1 aSlacanin, I.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Aug., , no. 955dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://actahort.org/books/955/955_7.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02765naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245012000163300001600283520159500299650001301894650002801907650002501935650001801960650002001978650001201998650004902010650007002059650001102129650002402140700001802164700001402182700001302196773009002209852000902299930003302308945001302341946001302354655001202367IND2057463020221117211825.0970603e199701  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205746302DNAL7 a89689102pmid7 aPMC2295412pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeele, D.10aComparison of identifications of human and animal source gram-negative bacteria by API 20E and crystal E/NF systems  ap. 213-216.  aThis study compared the abilities of API 20E and BBL Crystal E/NF identification systems to correctly identify human and animal source gram-negative bacilli of known identifications, as provided by the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md., and the Research Diagnostic and Investigative Laboratory, Columbia, Mo. Also addressed in the comparison are the cost, the relative ease of performing and interpreting the tests, and the potential problems surrounding each system. The two systems were comparable in terms of their respective costs and abilities to identify the bacteria tested. The cost per test was calculated as $4.69 for API 20E and $4.62 for Crystal E/NF. Of the animal source bacteria tested, Crystal E/NF identified 68% to the correct genus and species and 90% to the correct genus or group. The remaining 10% of the animal source bacteria were unidentified by Crystal. Human source bacteria tested by BBL Crystal E/NF gave very similar results: 47% correctly identified to genus and species, 90% correctly identified to genus or group, 7% unidentified, and 3% incorrectly identified. API 20E results were as follows for animal source bacteria: 53% correctly identified to genus and species, 76% correctly identified to genus or group, and 24% unidentified; the results for human source bacteria were as follows: 40% correctly identified to genus and species, 83% correctly identified to genus or group, and 17% unidentified. API 20E has a slightly more labor-intensive protocol for setting up the test than BBL Crystal E/NF but produced fewer questionable results. 3amedicine 3ahuman health and safety 3abacterial infections 3aanimal health 3aanimal diseases 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Typing Techniquesxinstrumentation 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aHumans 2aSpecies Specificity1 aBradfield, J.1 aPryor, W.1 aVore, S.0 tJournal of clinical microbiology.g1997 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.213-216x0095-11377nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle03287naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002300128245008000151300001600231500001500247520138900262650002501651650001701676650001401693650001701707650001201724650002001736650002201756650001301778650002001791650001501811650002101826650002601847650001301873650001701886650001001903650002001913650002301933650003501956650001101991650005702002650003002059650003102089650003302120650001102153650002602164653001902190653001002209653001502219653001702234653004102251653002702292653001102319653001302330653001202343700001602355700001502371700001402386700001702400700001302417773007902430852000902509930003302518945001302551946001302564655001202577IND2180539220221117211937.0981019e199803  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218053922DNAL7 a94827662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJensen-Jarolim, E.10aHot spices influence permeability of human intestinal epithelial monolayers  ap. 577-581.  a2019-12-05  aIndirect evidence suggests that hot spices may interact with epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract to modulate their transport properties. Using HCT-8 cells, a cell line from a human ileocoecal carcinoma, we studied the effects of spices on transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), permeability for fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextrans with graded molecular weight, and morphological alterations of tight junctions by immunofluorescence using an anti-ZO-1 antibody, a marker for tight junction integrity. Two different reactivity patterns were observed: paprika and cayenne pepper significantly decreased the TER and increased permeability for 10-, 20- and 40-kDa dextrans but not for -70 kDa dextrans. Simultaneously, tight junctions exhibited a discontinuous pattern. Applying extracts from black or green pepper, bay leaf or nutmeg increased the TER and macromolecular permeability remained low. Immunofluorescence ZO-1 staining was preserved. In accordance with the above findings, capsaicin transiently reduced resistance and piperine increased resistance, making them candidates for causing the effects seen with crude spice extracts. The observation that Solanaceae spices (paprika, cayenne pepper) increase permeability for ions and macromolecules might be of pathophysiological importance, particularly with respect to food allergy and intolerance. 3achemical composition 3ablack pepper 3acapsaicin 3aalpha-pinene 3apaprika 3atight junctions 3aintestinal mucosa 3aCapsicum 3apolysaccharides 3acell lines 3amolecular weight 3aelectrical resistance 3axanthine 3apermeability 3aPiper 2aCells, Cultured 2aElectric Impedance 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Mucosaxcytologyxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aPermeabilityxdrug effects 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aSpices 2aTumor Cells, Cultured 0acayenne pepper 0acells 0abay leaves 0achili pepper 0atransepithelial electrial resistance 0aanatomy and morphology 0aspices 0apiperine 0anutmegs1 aGajdzik, L.1 aHaberl, I.1 aKraft, D.1 aScheiner, O.1 aGraf, J.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1998 Mar., v. 128, no. 3 p.577-581x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03353naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001700136245016200153300001800315520205700333650001602390650002002406650002202426650001502448650003102463650001302494650001602507650000702523650001302530650002702543650001802570650002902588650001502617650001002632700002002642700002602662773011402688852000902802856007602811930003302887946001102920655001202931IND4411424820221117212003.0081010e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441142482DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.14102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuepper, Uta12aA fully validated isotope dilution HPLC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of succinylcholine and succinylmonocholine in serum and urine samples  ap. 1344-1352.  aA high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous detection of succinylcholine (SUX) and its metabolite succinylmonocholine (SMC) in serum and urine is presented. For internal standardization using isotope dilution, the deuterated compounds SUX-d₁₈ and SMC-d₃ were employed. Full validation was performed according to international guidelines. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) of acidified samples was accomplished using Strata-X polymeric reversed phase cartridges together with heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) as ion-pairing reagent. Separation was achieved within 13 min on a Phenomenex Synergi Hydro RP C18 column (4 μm, 150 x 2 mm) using a gradient of 5 mM ammonium formate buffer pH 3.5 and acetonitrile.To ensure the method's applicability in forensic as well as clinical toxicology, the specific demands of both research fields were taken into account, and the method was thus validated for a low and high concentration range. For both serum and urine as sample matrix, the validation revealed good intraday and interday precisions, consistently ranging below 15% for the lowest and below 10% for elevated concentrations. Accuracy was likewise good and never exceeded 10%. Extraction recovery was excellent, ranging between 88.1 and 103.9% for SUX and SMC in both tested matrices. Matrix effects were significant, the otherwise optimized extraction and detection methods, however, allowed for a very satisfactory sensitivity of the described method: For serum, the limits of detection and quantitation were determined to be 1.9 and 6.0 ng/ml for SUX, as well as 2.5 and 8.6 ng/ml for SMC, respectively; for urine, the corresponding values were established to be 1.4 and 4.0 ng/ml (SUX), as well as 1.5 and 4.9 ng/ml (SMC).The presented method was successfully applied to authentic samples of two forensic cases investigated in the institute of forensic medicine in Bonn, allowing the diagnosis of SUX intoxications.

Rats trained to meal feed were divided into two groups and fed a diet containing 3 mg Zn/kg [a low zinc (LZ group)] or pair-fed (PF controls a zinc-adequate diet (30 mg Zn/kg). At 5 wk, the body weight (352 +/- 5 g, mean +/- SD) of LZ rats was 98.5% of that of PF rats (357 +/- 8 g). Rats with lymph cannula were infused at 3 mL/h via a duodenal catheter with a lipid emulsion consisting of 568 micromol triolein, 3.56 micromol alpha-tocopherol (alpha TP) and 396 micromol Na+-taurocholate in 24 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.4). Lymph was collected hourly for 8 h. The amounts of alpha TP absorbed into the lymph were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The hourly rate of alpha TP absorption was significantly lower in LZ than in PF rats. A marked difference (P < 0.05) was clearly evident even at 1 h (1.8 +/- 1.2 nmol/h in LZ vs. 8.5 +/- 3.0 nmol/h in PF). The peak rate of absorption was significantly lower in LZ rats (67.1 +/- 16.7 nmol/h at 5 h) than in PF rats (95.9 +/- 7.7 nmol/h at 4 h). The total amounts of alpha TP absorbed in 8 h in LZ and PF rats were 391.1 +/- 54.4 nmol (11.0 +/- 1.5% dose) and 613.9 +/- 105.8 nmol (17.2 +/- 3.0% dose), respectively. The lymphatic absorption of alpha TP was correlated with the amounts of PL (r = 0.77, P < 0.05) released into the mesenteric lymph. The hourly outputs of phospholipid and oleic acid also were significantly lower in LZ rats than in PF rats up to 4 h (P < 0.05). The cumulative lymphatic outputs of phospholipid (PL) were 20.1 +/- 3.7 micromol/8 h in LZ and 27.0 +/- 3.9 micromol/8 h in PF rats (P < 0.05). These results show that the intestinal absorption of vitamin E is affected by the zinc status of rats. This observation along with our earlier finding of a lower intestinal absorption of retinol suggests that zinc nutriture has a profound effect on the intestinal absorption and body status of lipid soluble vitamins. 3alymphatic system 3anutritional status 3ablood serum 3aliver 3azinc 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3aexperimental diets 3abody weight 3anutrient deficiencies 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aintestinal absorption 3aanimal models 3arats 3aoleic acid 3aphospholipids 2aAnimals 2aDiet 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aLymphatic Systemxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aOleic Acidxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aVitamin Exbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aZincxbloodxdeficiencyxpharmacology. 0adiet 0atrace element deficiencies1 aNoh, S.K.1 aKoo, S.I.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1998 Feb., v. 128, no. 2 p.265-270x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle04234naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245013200144300001600276500001500292520218700307650001502494650001602509650001202525650001602537650002402553650001202577650002002589650002402609650001802633650002302651650001702674650001602691650002202707650001302729650002102742650001202763650000902775650002302784650001802807650003202825650004202857650001202899650003002911650002802941650003902969650002503008650004303033650003903076650000903115650002003124650000903144650001703153650001703170650002503187653001603212653001403228653000903242653001203251653000903263653001303272700001503285700001503300700001403315773007903329852000903408930003303417945001303450946001303463655001203476IND2180536820221117211524.0981019e199803  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218053682DNAL7 a94827572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFickova, M.10aDietary (n-3) and (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids rapidly modify fatty acid composition and insulin effects in rat adipocytes  ap. 512-519.  a2019-12-05  aThe influence of dietary (n-3) compared with (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on the lipid composition and metabolism of adipocytes was evaluated in rats over a period of 1 week. Isocaloric diets comprised 16.3 g/100 g protein, 53.8 g/100 g carbohydrate and 21.4 g/100 g lipids, the latter containing either (n-3) PUFA (32.4 mol/100 mol) or (n-6) PUFA (37.8 mol/100 mol) but having identical contents of saturated, monounsaturated and total unsaturated fatty acids and identical polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratios and double bond indexes. Despite comparable food intake, significantly smaller body weight increments and adipocyte size were observed in rats of the (n-3) diet group after feeding for 1 wk. Rats fed the (n-3) diet also had significantly lower concentrations of serum triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin compared with those fed the (n-6) diet, although levels of serum glucose and free fatty acids did not differ in the two dietary groups. In the (n-6) diet group, the (n-6) and (n-3) PUFA contents of plasma triglycerides, free fatty acids and phospholipids were 30-60% higher and 60-80% lower, respectively, than in the (n-3) diet group, whereas adipocyte plasma membrane phospholipids showed a significantly higher unsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio and greater fluidity. Glycerol release in response to noradrenaline was significantly higher in the adipocytes of rats fed the (n-3) diet, whereas the antilipolytic effect of insulin generally did not differ in the two groups. Finally, insulin stimulated the transport of glucose and its incorporation into fatty acids to a lesser extent in adipocytes of (n-3) diet fed rats compared with (n-6) diet fed rats. This reduction in the metabolic effects of insulin in rats fed a (n-3) diet for 1 wk could be related to smaller numbers and a lower binding capacity of the insulin receptors on adipocytes and/or to a lesser degree of phosphorylation of the 95 kDa beta subunit of the receptor. In conclusion, dietary intake for 1 wk of (n-3) rather than (n-6) PUFA is sufficient to induce significant differences in the lipid composition and metabolic responses to insulin of rat adipocytes. 3aadipocytes 3adietary fat 3aliquids 3alipogenesis 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aglucose 3aplasma membrane 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aphospholipids 3anutrient transport 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3ahormone receptors 3aglycerol 3atriacylglycerols 3ainsulin 3arats 3aexperimental diets 3aanimal models 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 2aAdipocytesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xpharmacology 2aFatty Acids, Omega-6 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxpharmacology 2aInsulinxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aMale 2aPhosphorylation 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aTime Factors 2aTyrosinexmetabolism 0afatty acids 0aresponses 0asize 0abinding 0adiet 0afluidity1 aHubert, P.1 aCremel, G.1 aLeray, C.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1998 Mar., v. 128, no. 3 p.512-519x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03538naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245013400147300001600281500001500297520178300312650002902095650002102124650002802145650001602173650001002189650001802199650001202217650001902229650002002248650001602268650001102284650002102295650001202316650002202328650001902350650001002369650001102379650001902390650004302409650001202452650001102464650002402475650002802499650002702527650002402554650003502578650000902613650003402622653002502656653001302681653001402694653002702708700001802735773007902753852000902832930003302841945001302874946001302887655001202900IND2180536620221117211448.0981019e199803  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218053662DNAL7 a94827562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEisemann, J.H.10aChange in insulin sensitivity or responsiveness is not a major component of the mechanism of action of ractopamine in beef steers  ap. 505-511.  a2019-12-05  aOur objective was to determine whether the beta-adrenergic agonist ractopamine altered sensitivity or responsiveness to insulin. We used the hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp approach in five multicatheterized beef steers to evaluate insulin sensitivity (ED50) and responsiveness (R(max) or R(min)) during control or ractopamine feeding (80 mg/kg feed). Steers had blood vessel catheters and ultrasound flow probes that allowed measurement of net uptake and release of glucose and insulin by portal-drained viscera (PDV), liver and hindlimb. Steers ate meals of equal size every 2 h. Steers were fed at 1.8 times calculated maintenance energy. The design was a single reversal. Two rates of insulin infusion followed a base-line period on each of three sample days. Insulin was infused into a mesenteric vein at 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 mU/(h.kg body weight). During the base-line period, arterial concentrations of glucose, oxygen, nonesterified fatty acids and insulin were not different between control and ractopamine feeding. Arterial urea was lower during ractopamine than during control feeding (5.02 vs. 6.20 mmol/L, respectively, P < 0.01). Net release of glucose by liver and net uptake of glucose by the hindlimb were not affected by treatment. Similarly, net release of insulin by PDV and net uptake of insulin by liver were not affected by treatment. The R(max) and ED50 for steady-state glucose infusion rate, total glucose entry, hepatic glucose production and hindlimb glucose uptake did not differ between treatments. There was a trend for a lower ED50 in hindlimb with ractopamine treatment (P < 0.13). These data do not support a change in sensitivity or responsiveness of tissues to insulin as a major component of the mechanism of action of ractopamine. 3abeta-adrenergic agonists 3agrowth promotion 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3afatty acids 3aliver 3adose response 3aglucose 3afeed additives 3anutrient uptake 3ametabolites 3asteers 3anutrient balance 3ainsulin 3ablood circulation 3alimbs (animal) 3ablood 3aoxygen 3aanimal tissues 2aAdrenergic beta-Agonistsxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlucose Clamp Technique 2aHyperinsulinismxblood 2aInsulinxmetabolism 2aInsulin Resistancexphysiology 2aMale 2aPhenethylaminesxpharmacology 0anutrition physiology 0ahindlimb 0aresponses 0aportal drained viscera1 aBristol, D.G.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1998 Mar., v. 128, no. 3 p.505-511x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03334naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245008700146300001600233520182800249650001502077650001402092650001502106650002002121650001002141650001402151650002402165650001802189650001602207650001502223650002302238650001002261650001002271650000902281650003702290650001102327650005302338650002202391650001102413650002602424650004402450650002102494653003102515653003002546700002302576700001702599700001702616773007902633852000902712930003302721945001302754946001302767655001202780IND2180400320221117211514.0981009e199802  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218040032DNAL7 a94468442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaudill, M.A.10aFolate catabolism in pregnant and nonpregnant women with controlled folate intakes  ap. 204-208.  aMeasurement of the urinary folate catabolites, para-aminobenzoylglutamate (pABG) and the more predominant acetylated form, acetamidobenzoylglutamate (apABG), has been used to assess folate requirements in both pregnant and nonpregnant women. Folate catabolite excretion has been reported to be significantly higher in pregnant women (second trimester) compared with nonpregnant controls. The primary goals of this study were to determine if pregnant women in a controlled metabolic study excreted higher quantities of urinary folate catabolites than nonpregnant controls and if catabolite excretion was influenced by folate intake. We evaluated the effect of gestation and folate intake on the urinary excretion of apABG and pABG in pregnant women (n = 12; wk 14-26 gestation) and nonpregnant controls (n = 12) assigned to consume folate levels approximating the current (400 micrograms/d) and previous (800 micrograms/d) RDA. Subjects were fed a controlled diet containing 120 micrograms folate/d and either 330 or 730 micrograms synthetic folic acid/d. In contrast to previously reported data, no differences in mean folate catabolite excretion were detected between pregnant and nonpregnant subjects. Catabolite excretion (pABG + apABG) decreased significantly relative to initial values in pregnant women consuming 450 micrograms folate/d (-40 +/- 20%; mean +/- SD) and final mean excretion was significantly lower in the pregnant women consuming 450 micrograms folate/d (86 +/- 32 nmol/d) compared with 850 micrograms folate/d (148 +/- 20 nmol/d). Data from this study indicate that second trimester pregnant women do not excrete more folate catabolites than nonpregnant controls and that consumption of 450 vs. 850 micrograms folate/d results in a significant reduction in the quantity of folate catabolites excreted. 3afolic acid 3apregnancy 3ametabolism 3anutrient intake 3aurine 3aexcretion 3avitamin supplements 3adose response 3ametabolites 3aglutamates 3anutritional status 3awomen 2aAdult 2aDiet 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aGlutamatesxurine 2aHumans 2aPregnancyxmetabolism 2aPregnancy Trimester, Secondxmetabolism 2aReference Values 0apara-aminobenzoylglutamate 0aacetamidobenzoylglutamate1 aGregory, J.F.

Studies of retinoid-deficient and -treated embryos, and of receptor null mutants, provide evidence that this participation involves interactions between retinoids and their receptors. Targeted retinoid application and retinoid deficiency, using in ovo avian embryos, has identified early cardiogenic contributions, including cardiocyte gene expression and differentiation, heart tube fusion and laterality, and segmental identity. Also useful is a mammalian model, which targets retinoid deficiency to distinct gestational windows, circumventing limitations of traditional deficiency studies and current null mutant technologies. Rat embryos made deficient in retinoids during gestational d 11.5-13.5 exhibit specific cardiac, limb, ocular and nervous system deficits. That many of the anomalies previously reported in retinoid receptor null mutants are observed in deficiency confirms that ligand-receptor interactions are essential for embryonic development. Other defects are novel, reemphasizing the functional redundancy of retinoid receptors and that retinoid receptors have multiple and overlapping contributions to morphogenesis. 3acell differentiation 3aeyes 3anullisomics 3agene expression 3apregnancy 3aheart 3aanimal models 3amutants 3alimbs (animal) 3areceptors 3aembryogenesis 3avitamin A 0ainteractions 0aliterature reviews 0aligands 0avitamin a deficiency 0atiming 0anervous system 0aretinoids1 aDickman, E.D.1 aPower, S.C.1 aLancman, J.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1998 Feb., v. 128, no. 2S p.467S-470Sx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03696naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011700144300001600261500001500277520160300292650002101895650002501916650002001941650001701961650001401978650001401992650001502006650002402021650001802045650001002063650001502073650001202088650001302100650001702113650001102130650002102141650002602162650000902188650002102197650001002218650001602228650001202244650001802256650002502274650001202299650002002311650002202331650002602353650001402379650001802393650007202411650003802483650002102521650002102542650000902563650000902572650002502581650002402606653001602630653001002646653001802656653001302674700001302687700001802700700002102718700001602739773007902755852000902834930003302843945001302876946001302889655001202902IND2180401720221117211631.0981009e199802  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218040172DNAL7 a94468502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhlsson, L.10aOrally fed digalactosyldiacylglycerol is degraded during absorption in intact and lymphatic duct cannulated rats  ap. 239-245.  a2019-12-05  aMembrane lipids of green plants digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGalDG) and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGalDG) are hydrolyzed in vitro by human duodenal contents, pancreatic juice and bile salt stimulated lipase and guinea pig and rat pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 to free fatty acids, di- and monogalactosylmonoacylglycerols and water soluble galactose-containing compounds. The fate of intermediate products is unknown. We have investigated the digestion and absorption of DGalDG in rats. [3H]- and [14C]-labeled DGalDG in galactolipid dispersions, and 200 g/L soybean triacylglycerol (TG) oil-galactolipid emulsions of different concentrations were fed orally to intact and lymphatic duct cannulated rats. Chyle, gastrointestinal tract, liver and plasma were analyzed for radioactivity in different lipid classes. Recovery of [3H] also was determined in feces. Comparison was made with an emulsion of [14C]dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine ([14C]DPPC), soybean TG oil and soybean phosphatidylcholine (PC). Less than 2% of the radioactivity in chyle was found in DGalDG, >70% of the radioactivity in triacylglycerol TG), and the remaining part in glycerophospholipids. In intact rats, <1.5% of radioactivity in liver and plasma was identified as DGalDG. In experiments where 120 mg galactolipid-phospholipid mixture or 120 mg PC were given in a soybean TG oil-emulsion, the absorption of galactolipid fatty acids was less complete than PC-fatty acids, as indicated by analysis of feces and intestinal contents. Galactolipids are not absorbed intact or as reacylated monoacyl compounds by rats. 3alymphatic system 3aphosphatidylcholines 3adiacylglycerols 3acerebrosides 3adigestion 3aemulsions 3aoleic acid 3aoral administration 3adose response 3afeces 3aintestines 3astomach 3ahydrogen 3ablood plasma 3ayields 3atriacylglycerols 3aintestinal absorption 3arats 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3asoybean oil 3adigesta 3aanimal models 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aCatheterization 2aChylexmetabolism 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aEmulsions 2aGalactolipids 2aGlycolipidsxadministration & dosagexmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aIntestinal Absorptionxphysiology 2aLipid Metabolism 2aLymphatic System 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTissue Distribution 0acomparisons 0achyle 0aphospholipids 0arecovery1 aBlom, M.1 aBohlinder, K.1 aCarlsson, Arvid.1 aNilsson, A.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1998 Feb., v. 128, no. 2 p.239-245x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03182naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245006100148300001600209500001500225520143700240650002101677650001201698650000901710650001401719650001801733650002901751650002601780650000901806650002101815650003201836650001101868650002301879650004801902650002701950650002601977650001102003650003602014650004302050650004002093650002202133650004102155653002702196653001802223653002502241653002402266653003102290653002102321653001602342653002402358653002402382653001502406773007902421852000902500930003302509945001302542946001302555655001202568IND2180398420221117211635.0981009e199802  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218039842DNAL7 a94468352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnderwood, B.A.10aFrom research to global reality: the micronutrient story  ap. 145-151.  a2019-12-05  aThe professional life history of E.V. McCollum exemplifies how sound nutrition-related laboratory research was translated into practical realities that influenced individual and national nutrition-related decisions. Public health and educational programs emerging in the first third of this century improved health and nutritional well-being in the United States. Characteristics that surrounded pioneering efforts early in the century are similar to those that have reinvigorated global micronutrient concerns in the last third of the century. Sound community-oriented scientific research revealed the true consequences of iodine, vitamin A and iron micronutrient malnutrition. Repositioning the image of these three micronutrients from that of a clinical problem affecting relatively few to one with consequences for individual, national and global development affecting many more, and disseminating these facts through high-level political forums incited attention, commitment and actions. As in the early days of McCollum and his contemporaries, current nutrition scientists played a significant role, interacting with politically oriented counterparts, in taking micronutrient research to reality for improving health and quality of life globally. Lessons learned from the process, both past and present, should guide future nutrition-oriented endeavours in moving research to reality for betterment of global community health. 3ahealth education 3ahistory 3adiet 3avitamin A 3ahealth policy 3anutritional intervention 3anutrient deficiencies 3airon 3anutrition policy 3afood and nutrition programs 3aiodine 3anutrition research 2aDeficiency Diseasesxdrug therapyxhistory. 2aHealth Policyxhistory 2aHistory, 20th Century 2aHumans 2aIronxhistoryxtherapeutic use. 2aMicronutrientsxhistoryxpharmacology. 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aResearchxhistory 2aVitamin Axhistoryxtherapeutic use. 0anational consciousness 0apublic health 0avitamin a deficiency 0aworld food problems 0atrace element deficiencies 0aglobal nutrition 0aconferences 0acommunity nutrition 0apolitical attitudes 0aperception0 tJournal of nutrition.g1998 Feb., v. 128, no. 2 p.145-151x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02565naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100001500162245010300177300001400280500002400294520056200318650002300880650001100903650001300914650002700927650001400954650001200968650001100980650001500991650000901006650001401015650001501029650001401044650001701058650001201075650003901087650002101126650003101147650001901178650001101197650004201208650001801250650002201268650001101290650001601301650002101317650000901338650005001347650002201397650002101419650004501440650003901485651001701524651001701541700001901558700001601577700001801593700001701611700001401628700001501642773011801657852000901775856008301784655001201867IND4478193320221117212142.0140307s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447819332DNAL7 a126254002pmid7 a10.1023/A:10220545227252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmer, O.H.10aBiochemical Profiles in Friesian Cattle Naturally Infected with Theileria annulata in Saudi Arabia  ap. 15-25.  aIncludes references  aThe biochemical parameters were studied in adult and young Friesian cattle naturally infected with Theileria annulata in the Qassim Region, Saudi Arabia.

As for other greenhouse crops, tomato tissues are specific in that they have a high mineral content. The consequences of this accumulation of minerals on the construction cost of the tissues and the possible interactions with the physiological age of the organs and with the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere was examined. For that purpose, three methods of estimating the construction cost were used and compared. Large quantities of minerals accumulated in the tissues of tomato plants (ranging from 0.05 in fruits to 0.26 g g-1 DM in leaves). The subsequent dilution of the organic matter explained why the estimated construction cost of the dry matter (organic matter+minerals) was fairly low in comparison to that of other crop species. The construction cost was higher in fruits than in vegetative organs, partly because of a lower mineral content. It decreased by 7-12% from top to bottom of the canopy, following the increase in the physiological age of the tissues. This ontogenic drift was partly explained by the accumulation of minerals in the older organs. In the conditions of CO2 enrichment of a commercial greenhouse, no effect of CO2 concentration on the mineral content and on the construction cost of tissues was observed. Such a variability of the construction cost of tomato plant tissues due to the accumulation of minerals or to the ontogeny questions the use of standard values in crop models. 3acarbon dioxide 3acanopy 3aprotein content 3astems 3aorganic matter 3aorganic acids and salts 3acarbohydrates 3aage 3aontogeny 3alipids 3alignin 3adry matter partitioning 3acarbon 3achemical constituents of plants 3aphotosynthesis 3abiomass 3amineral content 3aleaves 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0acarbon dioxide enrichment 0aenergy metabolism 0aleaf age 0afruits1 aBertin, N.1 aFrossard, J.S.1 aLe Bot, J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 Jan., v. 49, no. 318 p.49-57x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.318.493Available from publisher's Web site  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02649naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001700142245010500159300001600264520145000280650003501730650001901765650001401784650000901798650002001807650000901827650001601836650002501852650001401877650001401891650002201905650001101927653001101938653002201949700001801971773009001989852000902079856008202088930003302170945001302203946001102216655001202227IND2073000220221117211941.0980504e199801  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND207300022DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/49.318.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjorkman, T.10aHigh temperature arrest of inflorescence development in broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica L.)  ap. 101-106.  aHigh temperature causes unevenly-sized flower buds on broccoli inflorescences. This deformity limits production of broccoli to areas where summer temperatures rarely exceed 30 degrees C. The stage of development sensitive to heat was determined by exposing plants of 'Galaxy' broccoli at varying developmental stages to 35 degrees C day temperature for 1 week, and subsequently analysing the head structure. During the high temperature exposure, the development of certain flower buds was arrested. There was no corresponding cessation of bud initiation at the apex. No injury resulted if heat was applied before the reproductive induction, nor was there injury to differentiated flower buds. Meristems were affected only if heat was applied during inflorescence production or the floral initiation process. Shorter heat exposures produced little injury, and longer exposures were lethal. The plant's development at this sensitive period still appeared vegetative externally, but the youngest leaves had just begun to reorientate as a consequence of the reduced stem elongation rate. The meristem was less than 1 mm wide, and floral primordia were just forming, still subtended by leaf primordia. The injury was fully expressed by the time the head was first exposed (approximately 5-10 mm wide), though it became more apparent as the head matured. The buds that were delayed in development by the high temperature developed into normal flowers. 3aBrassica oleracea var. italica 3ainflorescences 3aflowering 3aheat 3aair temperature 3abuds 3aheat injury 3acell differentiation 3ameristems 3amortality 3avegetative growth 3aleaves 0agrowth 0acrop growth stage1 aPearson, K.J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 Jan., v. 49, no. 318 p.101-106x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.318.1013Available from publisher's Web site  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03021naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001900142245009900161300001600260500001500276520156500291650001401856650001801870650002201888650001801910650001101928650001601939650002001955650001601975650001501991650001902006650001502025650002702040650002302067650003602090650002002126650002202146653001402168653001002182700001602192700001702208700002402225700001602249773009002265852000902355856008202364930003302446945001302479946001102492655001202503IND2138034920221117211559.0980807e199806  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213803492DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/49.323.9372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVuylsteker, C.10aEvidence for nitrate reductase expression during initiation of lateral roots by NAA in chicory  ap. 937-944.  a2019-12-04  aThe supply of alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), to excised chicory roots induced the formation of lateral root meristems mainly localized proximal to the pre-existing apical root meristem, in a region which does not initiate any lateral roots in control conditions. Inhibition of root elongation and concomitant enlargement of the apices were also observed. Quantification of IAA and cytokinin levels showed that the most reproducible and significant changes occurring after the NAA treatment consisted of a decrease in the level of zeatin-O-glucoside conjugates. Hydrolysis of these conjugates might deliver free zeatin-type compounds which were consumed during the lateral root growth. After 5 d, control excised roots contained a high level of amino acids, mainly as asparagine and arginine, probably issued from proteolysis associated to a senescent-like process. Conversely, in the presence of NAA, neither accumulation of amino acids nor a decrease of the total protein content of the tissue could be detected. Newly initiated meristems expressed the nia gene which encodes nitrate reductase, the first enzyme of the nitrate assimilatory pathway. Thus the increased expression of nitrate reductase which was observed in excised roots of chicory supplied with NAA (Vuylsteker et al., 1997b) may be ascribed to lateral root formation and development. The reinduction of nitrate reduction activity was driven by the increased demand for reduced nitrogen. Thus, the nia gene is one of the genes expressed during the early stages of root meristem formation. 3aroot tips 3amessenger RNA 3anitrate reductase 3amorphogenesis 3azeatin 3aproteolysis 3agene expression 3aamino acids 3aglucosides 3aroot meristems 3acytokinins 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aindole acetic acid 3achemical constituents of plants 3aprotein content 3aCichorium intybus 0ainduction 0aroots1 aPrinsen, E.1 aBoutin, J.P.1 aOnckelen, H.A. van.1 aRambour, S.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 June, v. 49, no. 323 p.937-944x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.323.9373Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02278naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245009500160300001600255500001500271520121000286650001301496650002001509650001101529650002001540650001001560650002101570653001801591653002601609653001501635700001601650773009001666852000901756856008201765930003301847945001301880946001101893655001201904IND2138035820221117211927.0980807e199806  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213803582DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/49.323.9792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllerby, D.J.10aResistance to fluid flow of model xylem vessels with simple scalariform perforation plates  ap. 979-985.  a2019-12-04  aThe resistances of xylem vessel walls and perforation plates has been investigated using 18 large-scale physical models made of plastic tubing into which scale models of plates were inserted. Flow of water through vessels was modelled using glycerol instead of water to keep the Reynolds number below 0.1. The technique proved easy, cheap and reliable. Results showed that perforation plate resistance is low compared with the resistance of the walls, whatever the plate morphology; plates only provided 0.6-18.6% extra resistance. Simple plates provided less resistance than scalariform plates, but because they are arranged closer together in vessels, resistance values (1.7-5.1%) overlap with those of scalariform plates. The resistance of scalariform plates varied in a systematic way with their morphology. For a given plate angle, increasing the number of bars increased resistance. For a given bar number, increasing the angle of the plate to the vessel axis also increased the resistance. However, for a given gap between bars, increasing the angle of the plate to the vessel axis decreased resistance. These results are discussed in the light of theories about the function of perforation plates. 3aglycerol 3aphysical models 3alength 3aflow resistance 3axylem 3aplant morphology 0aplant anatomy 0aplant vascular system 0asimulation1 aEnnos, A.R.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 June, v. 49, no. 323 p.979-985x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.323.9793Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02437naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001600143245011700159300001800276520134300294650001601637650002901653650001301682650001401695650001701709650001101726650001901737650001501756650001701771653001601788700001801804773009201822852000901914856008301923930003302006945001302039946001102052655001202063IND2138036820221117211849.0980807e199806  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213803682DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/49.323.10152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWitty, J.F.10aHydrogen measurements provide direct evidence for a variable physical barrier to gas diffusion in legume nodules  ap. 1015-1020.  aA considerable weight of evidence has accumulated to show that O2 diffusion into legume nodules is controlled by a variable physical barrier which balances the influx of this gas against its respiratory consumption. Recently, however, the existence of such a barrier has been challenged on the grounds of lack of evidence for structural changes and on the possibility that there are metabolic and/or biochemical alternatives which might substitute for the barrier. Such speculation may be justified for the apparent diffusion resistance to O2 and CO2 where a range of potential metabolic reactions make it difficult to separate physical and chemical processes. However, this ambiguity does not apply to H2 within nodules formed by rhizobium strains lacking an uptake hydrogenase (Hup(-ve)). Within such nodules H2 generated as a by-product of N2 fixation cannot be further metabolized. Thus the steady-state relationship between internal concentration of H2 and its rate of efflux from the nodule can only be determined by the resistance of a physical barrier to diffusion. Data are presented here on H2 concentrations and rates of efflux from nodules of soyabean (Clarke/USDA16 symbiosis) subjected to detopping and stepped increases in pO2, which provides incontrovertible evidence for the existence of such a variable physical barrier. 3aGlycine max 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3ahydrogen 3adiffusion 3aroot nodules 3aoxygen 3acarbon dioxide 3ametabolism 3agas exchange 0arespiration1 aMinchin, F.R.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 June, v. 49, no. 323 p.1015-1020x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.323.10153Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03022naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245011500174300001600289520163600305650002101941650001501962650001801977650002301995650002202018650002502040650001202065650001002077650001602087650001002103650002302113650002502136650002102161650000902182650002002191650001102211650001302222650001502235650001402250651001602264773012702280852000902407856009202416939003302508946001102541655001202552IND4475038320221117211648.0131220e20031201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447503832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livprodsci.2003.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerentsen, P.B.M.10aEffects of animal productivity on the costs of complying with environmental legislation in Dutch dairy farming  ap. 183-194.  aDutch dairy farmers have to comply with two policies that aim to reduce losses of nitrogen and phosphate to soil and ground water. The first policy (Mineral Accounting System, MINAS) uses a farm gate balance approach for registering nutrient input and output and consequently nutrient surpluses. Surpluses above an acceptable level are taxed. The second policy (Manure Transfer Agreement System, MTAS) aims at restricting manure application by requiring a manure transfer agreement for manure that is produced on the farm but cannot be applied according to maximum application rates. A possible way to meet both policies is to increase animal productivity in order to complete the milk quota with a smaller herd. This paper explores the impact of increasing animal productivity on economic results of dairy farms of different intensities taking into account environmental policies and a restricting quota. Furthermore, the yearly costs of extra quota are determined below which it is more interesting to buy extra milk quota in response to increasing milk production per cow than to decrease the number of cows. A linear programming model of a dairy farm is used to examine the economic and environmental effects of improved productivity for three farms differing in intensity. From the results, it appears that an improvement of dairy cow productivity leads to considerably lower costs of meeting the environmental policies. From the economic values (EV) of milk production under the 2003 environmental legislation follows that farms with a low intensity can pay three times as much for additional quota than high intensity farms. 3aapplication rate 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3aeconomic valuation 3aenvironmental law 3aenvironmental policy 3afarmers 3afarms 3agroundwater 3aherds 3alinear programming 3alivestock production 3amanure spreading 3amilk 3amilk production 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphosphates 3asurpluses 3aNetherlands0 tLivestock production science.g2003 Dec. 1, v. 84, no. 2 p.183-194aLivestock production science (Online)x0301-62267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livprodsci.2003.09.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20131220  aNon-US 7aarticle01555naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010000129300001800229500001500247520061400262650001300876650001600889650001900905650002100924650002400945650001300969651000900982653001100991653001501002700001801017773010201035852000901137930003301146945001301179946001301192655001201205IND2331379420221117211309.0030313e200211  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233137942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerriges, J.A.10aInducing patterns of correlation and substitution in repeated logit models of recreation demand  ap. 1076-1090.  a2019-12-05  aRepeated logit models are among the most commonly applied methods for modeling seasonal recreation demand.

Particular attention is paid to the use of the mixed logit framework to generalize the strong assumptions on correlation patterns across sites and choice occasions imbedded in the nested logit model.

Eight pairs of infants were matched for gestational age and one minute Apgar score. One member of each pair served as a control and the other was given supplemental oral calcium (75 mg/kg/24 hr) beginning at 12 and ending at 72 hours of age. In patients at risk for hypocalcemia, prospective use of oral calcium supplements during the period when there is inadequate calcium intake from feedings may prevent hypocalcemia. This appears to be without deleterious effect on measurable chemical and hormonal factors important in calcium homeostasis, and results in maintenance of higher serum calcium levels after supplementation has been discontinued. 3ainfants 3acalcium 3ahormones 3ahypocalcemia 0aSupplements Nutrient 0aBiochemical effects1 aChen, I.

Diets were designed to allow feeding at two levels of calcium intake (normal = 78 mg/d and low = 15 mg/d) and two levels of energy intake (normal and 40% restriction) while keeping the intake of protein, fat, fiber, vitamins and other minerals equal between groups. Thus rats received either a control diet (CNTL), a diet restricted in calcium, energy or both for 9 wk. Energy restriction reduced BW 5-21% (P < 0.01) and elevated bone formation 10-20% (P < 0.05) in both age groups. Bone resorption was 20-40% above CNTL values (P < 0.05), in rats fed all three restricted diets. In younger rats, BMD increased over time in all groups (P < 0.05), but final BMD was lower in calcium restricted groups compared with CNTL (P < 0.01). In older rats, CNTL had a significantly greater final BMD (P < 0.05) than diet-restricted groups. These data indicate that, in both younger and older rats, dietary restriction of calcium or energy results in an elevated rate of bone turnover. BMD is compromised by calcium restriction in both younger and older rats, whereas only older rats were negatively influenced by dietary energy restriction. Thus the present study indicates a detrimental effect of low-energy diets, as well as inadequate calcium intake, on bone density in mature rats. 3anutrient intake 3arestricted feeding 3aenergy intake 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3acalcium 3abody weight 3aexperimental diets 3abone formation 3abone density 3aanimal models 3afemales 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBone Densityxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBone Remodelingxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCalciumxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aDiet 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 0adiet 0aweight losses 0aage differences1 aRothkopf, M.M.1 aShapses, S.A.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1998 Mar., v. 128, no. 3 p.640-645x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle01568naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001800143245005800161300001800219500001500237520032200252650001800574650001900592650003000611650002500641650002000666650001000686650002500696650001900721650001900740653001400759653001000773653002100783653001600804653002800820700001700848700001600865773009200881852000900973856008300982930003301065945001301098946001101111655001201122IND2138038820221117211826.0980807e199806  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213803882DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/49.323.10612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVicient, C.M.10aCharacterization of am Em-like gene of Brassica napus  ap. 1061-1062.  a2019-12-04  aEm-like proteins are present in dry seeds of several species playing a role in the desiccation tolerance of the embryo.

In this study, we compared the efficacy of dietary protein replenishment and supplementation with L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (OTC, 3.5 mg/d), a cysteine precursor, to protect against hyperoxia-induced lung damage in PEM rats. The PEM rats were produced by feeding weanling rats a protein-deficient diet (0.5% protein) for 14 d. PEM rats were then divided in three dietary treatment groups, 0.5% protein (-Pr), 0.5% protein plus the OTC supplement (+OTC), or 15% protein (+Pr) during 4 d of either hyperoxia (85% O2) or air exposure. Increased lung-to-body weight ratios, indicative of oxidative tissue damage, were observed following exposure to hyperoxia in -Pr and +Pr rats, but not in +OTC rats, even though the OTC supplement and the 15% protein diet contained a comparable amount of cysteine. Tissue reduced glutathione (GSH) status, GSH-dependent enzyme activity and antioxidant defense enzyme activities were monitored in the lung, liver and blood during 4 d of hyperoxia exposure. OTC supplementation enhanced GSH levels significantly in the lung of PEM rats, whereas protein repletion significantly elevated blood GSH concentrations. The protective effect of OTC was not a function of changes in activity of GSH-dependent enzymes or oxygen defense enzymes in the lung. These results indicate that a short-term strategy that selectively elevates GSH levels in the lung is more effective than protein repletion in protecting against hyperoxia-induced oxidative lung damage in PEM rats. 3aprotein energy malnutrition 3ahyperoxia 3aglutathione 3aoxidation 3adietary protein 3aprotein intake 3acysteine 3aoxazolidinethiones 3abody weight 3aweight 3alungs 3aenzyme activity 3asuperoxide dismutase 3acatalase 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3aantioxidants 3arats 3aanimal models 3adietary supplements 2aAnimals 2aDietary Proteinsxtherapeutic use 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aHyperoxiaxpathology 2aLungxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMale 2aProtein-Energy Malnutritionxdiet therapyxpathology. 2aPyrrolidonecarboxylic Acid 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aThiazolesxtherapeutic use 2aThiazolidines 0adamage 0aprotection1 aSikorski, B.1 aBray, T.M.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1998 Apr., v. 128, no. 4 p.671-676x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle01820naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001500143245009800158300001800256500001500274520068400289650001300973650002600986650001801012650001201030650000801042650001401050650003601064650001001100650001001110653002601120700001801146700001601164773009301180852000901273856008301282930003301365945001301398946001101411655001201422IND2197179820221117211834.0990223e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219717982DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/49.326.15392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnns, L.C.10aSolute concentrations in xylem sap along vessels of maize primary roots at high root pressure  ap. 1539-1544.  a2019-12-04  aThe elemental composition of xylem sap has been determined by cryo-analytical microscopy in situ along vessels in the roots of maize plants frozen intact while root pressure was high. The only chemical element (including carbon) present in significant concentrations in the vessels was potassium at approximately 11 mM and approximately 15 mM in the late (LMX) and early (EMX) metaxylem, respectively. There was no gradient of [K] along the vessels, which each run the length of the mature proximal end of the roots. At the distal end of each vessel, in the oldest still living vessel elements, there was a sharp rise in [K] to 110 mM and 130 mM in the LMX and EMX, respectively. 3aZea mays 3aquantitative analysis 3aroot pressure 3asolutes 3asap 3apotassium 3achemical constituents of plants 3axylem 3aroots 0aplant vascular system1 aMcCully, M.E.1 aCanny, M.J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 Sept., v. 49, no. 326 p.1539-1544x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.326.15393Available from publisher's Web site  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03497naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001400143245012000157300001800277500001500295520194400310650001502254650002702269650002102296650002802317650002002345650002002365650001502385650001202400650003602412650001802448650001502466650001802481650001802499650001802517650001402535650004302549653001402592653001302606653001002619653001602629653002102645653001802666700001402684700001602698773009202714852000902806856008302815930003302898945001302931946001102944655001202955IND2196550720221117211832.0990121e199807  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219655072DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/49.324.12032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, T.P.10aDisappearance of desiccation tolerance of imbibed crop seeds is not associated with the decline of oligosaccharides  ap. 1203-1212.  a2019-12-04  aThe relationship between sugar content and loss of desiccation tolerance of hydrated crop seeds (tomato, okra, snow pea, mung bean, and cucumber) was evaluated by imbibing seeds with or without ABA, followed by dehydration and germination. During the process of hydration, but before the seeds lost desiccation tolerance, monosaccharide content increased only slightly, sucrose increased in snow pea, mung bean and cucumber, but maintained its original level in other species and the oligosaccharides declined dramatically. At the time of losing desiccation tolerance, the sucrose content of imbibed seeds was 2-3 times higher than the original level in most species. Positive significant correlation coefficients (r) were found in many, but not all crop seeds between desiccation tolerance and the oligosaccharide mass, or oligo/sucrose ratio. The ratio of oligo/sucrose in intact seeds at the time of losing desiccation tolerance, however, was not a fixed value and varied among species. Oligosaccharides declined significantly in different seed parts of imbibed cucumber seeds while sucrose increased to a higher level in the radicle than in the hypocotyl. Radicles were far more sensitive to desiccation than hypocotyls. The same observation was found for cucumber seeds imbibed in 100 micromolar ABA, yet desiccation tolerance was largely maintained in hypocotyls and cotyledons. It is concluded that sucrose and oligosaccharides are not the determinants of the loss of desiccation tolerance in hydrated seeds. Imbibed seeds did not show any differences between seed parts in their ability to resynthesize sugars during the process of slow dehydration. Differences in sensitivity to desiccation among seed parts were not due to differences in the initial water content or to the rate of water content increase among seed parts. Physiological regulation of the loss of desiccation tolerance in crop seeds during hydration is discussed. 3aimbibition 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3aseed germination 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3amonosaccharides 3aCucumis sativus 3ahypocotyls 3asucrose 3achemical constituents of plants 3aVigna radiata 3acotyledons 3awater content 3aabscisic acid 3aPisum sativum 3amortality 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0atolerance 0aradicles 0aseeds 0adesiccation 0aoligosaccharides 0aseed moisture1 aYen, W.L.1 aChien, C.T.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 July, v. 49, no. 324 p.1203-1212x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.324.12033Available from publisher's Web site  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01680naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008500128300001600213500001500229520070500244650000900949650003200958650001900990650001601009650002101025650002301046651001201069651001201081653001501093653002601108700001601134773010001150852000901250930003301259945001301292946001301305655001201318IND2229610720221117211537.0010125e200011  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222961072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPietola, K.S.10aInvestment under uncertainty and dynamic adjustment in the Finnish pork industry  ap. 956-967.  a2019-12-05  aA stochastic dual model of investment under uncertainty is used to investigate structural adjustment in the Finnish hog industry. Value function restrictions are found to be comparable to those in existing dual models assuming deterministic state variables. The model also allows for an asymmetry in investment response during capital expansion and contraction phases. Empirical results show that investments respond negatively to increased uncertainty and that labor adjusts more slowly during contraction phases than during expansions. Results on economies of size, uncertainty effects, and adjustment rigidities have important implications for hog industry response to Finland's entry into the EU. 3apork 3alivestock and meat industry 3adynamic models 3auncertainty 3aproduction costs 3aeconomies of scale 3aDenmark 3aFinland 0ainvestment 0astructural adjustment1 aMyers, R.J.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2000 Nov., v. 82, no. 4 p.956-967x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle01353naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245008500136300001600221300002400237520036100261650002000622650002100642650002000663650001400683650001800697650002600715650002600741651001800767700002200785700001800807773011500825852000900940939003300949945000800982946001300990655001201003991618982780742620221117211603.0900730e198906  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900008112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanden, W.O.

There is reason to believe that inputs in determining quality likely complement. And it is not possible to regulate many of these inputs. In a food production system possessing these characteristics, we show that leadership by one or more firms through communicating actions may be used as a mechanism to increase overall food quality. As there may be no private incentive to lead, there may be strategic merit in assigning liability through legislation. We also suggest the possibility that genetics are leadership instruments in hog production systems. 3apoultry 3aswine 3afood safety 3afood production 3afood quality 3adecision making 3aleadership 3amathematical models 3alivestock and meat industry 3aUnited States1 aRoosen, J.1 aMiranowski, J.A.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2001 Nov., v. 83, no. 4 p.862-874x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02690naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001500142245014200157300001600299520133000315650001601645650001901661650002001680650001101700650001401711650001901725650001301744650001801757650003001775650002101805650002601826650001401852650001401866653001501880653001601895653001101911653003001922700001801952700001201970773009001982852000902072856008202081930003302163945001302196946001102209655001202220IND2107445320221117211938.0980528e199803  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND210744532DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/49.320.5832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSims, D.A.10aElevated CO2 concentration has independent effects on expansion rates and thickness of soybean leaves across light and nitrogen gradients  ap. 583-591.  aThe rate and extent of leaf thickness and area development are important determinants of whole plant photosynthetic capacity. The interactive effects of photon flux density (PFD), nitrogen supply and CO2 concentration on leaf expansion rate were measured as well as final leaf size and thickness of soybean. Leaf thickness and final area were not correlated with leaf relative expansion rate (RER) suggesting that these parameters are controlled by different mechanisms and that final leaf dimensions are determined by the duration rather than the rate of leaf expansion. Carbohydrate supply did not explain the variation in leaf RER since RER increased with increasing CO2 concentration, but decreased with increasing PFD. Leaf thickness and final area were related to resource supply but not in a simple fashion. Both positive and negative correlations between leaf thickness and carbohydrate and nitrogen concentrations were obtained depending on the environmental variable responsible for the variation. In contrast, there was a simple proportional relationship between whole plant relative growth rate and a correlate of leaf thickness (leaf water content per unit area), suggesting that leaf thickness responds to the balanced supply of all resources, in the same fashion as RGR, rather than to any individual resource. 3aGlycine max 3acarbon dioxide 3alight intensity 3aleaves 3aleaf area 3aphotosynthesis 3anitrogen 3acarbohydrates 3asource-sink relationships 3anitrogen content 3anutrient availability 3amesophyll 3athickness 0adry matter 0agrowth rate 0agrowth 0acarbon dioxide enrichment1 aSeemann, J.R.1 aLuo, Y.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 Mar., v. 49, no. 320 p.583-591x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.320.5833Available from publisher's Web site  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03148naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245009600177300001600273500001500289520171700304650002002021650001402041650002702055650002802082650002002110650002302130650001302153650002602166650001302192650001602205650002102221650001202242650001402254650002202268650005202290650001702342650002202359651001002381651001002391653001802401773007202419852000902491856008502500930003302585945001302618946001102631655001202642IND2333131820221117211934.0030619e200305  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233313182DNAL7 a126708002pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/23.7.4632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Y.10aVariation in needle longevity of Pinus tabulaeformis forests at different geographic scales  ap. 463-471.  a2019-12-04  aNeedle longevity of conifer species is known to increase with latitude, but little is known about intraspecific variation and associated factors within a location. Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) forests were investigated to identify patterns of needle longevity at seven sites with distinctive climatic conditions along a latitudinal gradient (33-38 degrees N) in Shaanxi province, northwest China. A demographic approach was used to quantify needle longevity as an index of entire foliage population adjusted to needle-age-specific mortality rates. There were significant differences in needle longevity of Chinese pine stands across sites and across sample plots within a site. Individual tree needle longevity ranged from 0.62 to 3.75 years for 276 samples across sites. Needle longevity increased with latitude (R2 = 0.40, P < 0.0001), but decreased with mean January temperature (R2 = 0.63, P < 0.0001). Foliage retention of Chinese pine stands at the regional level was generally associated with climatic variability, indicating that variation in needle longevity was primarily an environmental acclimation to low temperature in winter. Stand characteristics were closely associated with needle longevity at three sites located within the same climatic zone. Needle longevity was positively correlated with tree age (R2 = 0.48, P < 0.0001) and stand density (R2 = 0.26, P = 0.0015) at Huanglong and Huangling, respectively, whereas it was negatively associated with total tree height at Zhidan (R2 = 0.50, P < 0.0001). It is concluded that, at the stand and individual tree level, intraspecific variation in needle longevity is most likely a result of adaptation to patchy microsite environments. 3asolar radiation 3alongevity 3ageographical variation 3adry matter accumulation 3aconifer needles 3aseasonal variation 3alatitude 3astand characteristics 3aaltitude 3atemperature 3aclimatic factors 2aClimate 2aGeography 2aPinusxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aTime Factors 2aTreesxphysiology 3aChina 0aChina 0aprecipitation0 tTree physiology.g2003 May, v. 23, no. 7 p.463-471x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/23.7.4633Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02660naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001400142245010000156300001600256500001500272520117900287650001101466650002201477650001601499650002201515650001701537650001401554650002001568650002501588650001601613650002501629650001801654650002001672650002101692653001401713653002301727653001501750653002801765653001101793653002301804700001601827700001501843700002101858700001301879773009001892852000901982856008201991930003302073945001302106946001102119655001202130IND2107631520221117211926.0980604e199804  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND210763152DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/49.321.6492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMay, M.J.10aGlutathione homeostasis in plants: implications for environmental sensing and plant development  ap. 649-667.  a2019-12-04  aGlutathione (GSH; gamma-glutamylcysteinyl glycine) is an abundant and ubiquitous thiol with proposed roles in the storage and transport of reduced sulphur, the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids and as a modulator of enzyme activity. The level of glutathione has also been shown to correlate with the adaptation of plants to extremes of temperature, in the tolerance of plants to xenobiotics and to biotic and abiotic environmental stresses. In addition, the size of the reduced glutathione pool shows marked alterations in response to a number of environmental conditions. Taken together, these findings have prompted intense efforts to characterize in detail the mechanisms underlying glutathione homeostasis in plants and to elucidate the role of these responses in the strategies plants have evolved to adapt to environmental stresses. The aim of this review is to assess recent biochemical, molecular, genetic, and physiological advances which are increasing our understanding of the mechanisms by which plant glutathione homeostasis is controlled and the role of glutathione in the integration of cellular processes with plant growth and development under stress. 3asulfur 3aplant development 3aglutathione 3aprotein synthesis 3abiosynthesis 3aevolution 3aair temperature 3aamino acid sequences 3ahomeostasis 3anucleotide sequences 3anucleic acids 3aenzyme activity 3aplant morphology 0atolerance 0aliterature reviews 0aadaptation 0amolecular sequence data 0astress 0amolecular genetics1 aVernoux, T.1 aLeaver, C.1 aMontagu, M. van.1 aInze, D.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 Apr., v. 49, no. 321 p.649-667x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.321.6493Available from publisher's Web site  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01620naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007400128300001600202500001500218520067200233650002400905650001200929650001300941650001400954650001000968650001800978653001500996653001701011653002401028653002201052700001601074773010001090852000901190930003301199945001301232946001301245655001201258IND2326758120221117211506.0020426e200111  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232675812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGervais, J.P.10aOptimal production tax and quota under time consistent trade policies  ap. 921-933.  a2019-12-05  aThis article investigates the policy active importers' incentives and welfare implications of using production and trade policies in a dynamic framework where production decisions occur before consumption decisions. We show that the equilibrium for production taxes and quotas are not equivalent, and that each equilibrium depends on whether the trade policy instruments are tariffs or quotas. Under import quotas, the equilibrium policy is to tax domestic production, whereas under a tariff either a production tax or subsidy may be optimal. We also show that a collective agreement to ban production policies is likely to be welfare-improving in many circumstances. 3amathematical models 3atariffs 3aduration 3asubsidies 3ataxes 3aimport quotas 0aincentives 0atrade policy 0adomestic production 0aproduction policy1 aLapan, H.E.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2001 Nov., v. 83, no. 4 p.921-933x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03335naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001600142245023200158300001600390500001500406520159600421650002502017650002402042650003802066650001902104650003602123650001202159650001202171650002202183650002002205650002002225650001102245650001202256650002002268650001002288650001302298650001902311650002002330650002102350650001102371653003002382653002802412653001102440653000902451700001602460700001302476700001402489700001602503773009002519852000902609856008202618930003302700945001302733946001102746655001202757IND2107631720221117211548.0980604e199804  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND210763172DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/49.321.6692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSignora, L.10aOver-expression of sucrose phosphate synthase in Arabidopsis thaliana results in increased foliar sucrose/starch ratios and favours decreased foliar carbohydrate accumulation in plants after prolonged growth with CO2 enrichment  ap. 669-680.  a2019-12-04  aArabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia was transformed with a maize sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) cDNA under the control of the promoter for the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase from tobacco (rbcS). The effects of SPS over-expression were compared in plants of the T2 and T3 generations grown either in air or with CO2 enrichment (700 microliter l -1) for either 4 or 10 weeks. Maximal extractable foliar SPS activities were three times those of the untransformed controls in the highest rbcS-SPS expressing line. In untransformed Arabidopsis leaves SPS activity was not subject to light/dark regulation, but was modified by incubation with either the inhibitor, orthophosphate, or the activator, mannose. Photosynthesis (Amax) values were similar in all lines grown in air. After 10 weeks of CO2 enrichment a decrease in Amax in the untransformed controls, but not in the high SPS expressors, was observed. There was a strong correlation between the sucrose-to-starch ratio of the leaves and their SPS activity in both growth conditions. The total foliar carbohydrate contents of 4-week-old plants was similar in all lines whether plants were grown in air or with CO2 enrichment. After 10 weeks growth the leaves of the high rbcS-SPS expressors accumulated much less total carbohydrate than untransformed control leaves in both growth conditions. It was concluded that SPS overexpression causes increased foliar sucrose/starch ratios in Arabidopsis leaves and favours decreased foliar carbohydrate contents when plants are grown for long periods with CO2 enrichment. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3ahexosyltransferases 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical constituents of plants 3aglucose 3asucrose 3atransgenic plants 3aorthophosphates 3aplasmid vectors 3astarch 3amannose 3agene expression 3alight 3afructose 3aphotosynthesis 3aenzyme activity 3apromoter regions 3aleaves 0acarbon dioxide enrichment 0acarbohydrate metabolism 0aratios 0adark1 aGaltier, N.1 aSkot, L.1 aLucas, H.1 aFoyer, C.H.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 Apr., v. 49, no. 321 p.669-680x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.321.6693Available from publisher's Web site  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02623naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002200142245008800164300001600252520141000268650002201678650001201700650002201712650001901734650001901753650001801772650001801790650001001808650001301818650002001831650001601851650001301867653002501880700001401905700001601919700001601935773009001951852000902041856008202050930003302132945001302165946001102178655001202189IND2107632720221117211503.0980604e199804  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND210763272DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/49.321.7132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez-Delgado, H.10aInduction of thermotolerance in potato microplants by acetylsalicylic acid and H2O2  ap. 713-720.  aPotato microplants propagated as nodal explants were subjected to heat treatments in vitro similar to those employed in the thermotherapy step of virus eradication procedures. Low concentrations (10(-6)-10(-5) M) of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in the culture medium improved (by 3.7-fold) tolerance of a 5-week high-temperature (35 C) treatment. Furthermore, tissues subcultured on to ASA-free medium following several weeks of growth on ASA were more thermotolerant (by 3.8-fold) of a 7 week 35 C treatment, and (by 38-fold) of a 15h 42 C heat-shock. Stems of microplants grown on ASA contained significantly less catalase activity and higher levels of H2O2 than controls. Explanting and heat treatment, however, reduced catalase activity to similar levels in ASA-treated and control microplant tissues. To investigate whether H2O2 could be involved in signal transduction during the induction of thermotolerance, nodal explants were incubated for 1 h in H2O2 (0.1-50 mM), and then cultured under standard conditions. The microplants that grew from the H2O2-treated explants showed concentration-dependent decreases in stem height, but were significantly more thermotolerant than controls, more than 1 month after the H2O2 treatment. Thus, thermotolerance induced in these conditions was extremely stable. It is concluded that both salicylate and H2O2 treatments can induce thermotolerance in this system. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aaspirin 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aheat treatment 3aheat tolerance 3aculture media 3aplant tissues 3astems 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3aheat stress 3aexplants 0aregenerative ability1 aDat, J.F.1 aFoyer, C.H.1 aScott, I.M.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 Apr., v. 49, no. 321 p.713-720x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.321.7133Available from publisher's Web site  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03202naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001700182245011100199300001600310500002400326506007600350520136400426506003701790650001301827650001301840650000901853650001401862650001001876650002301886650001201909650001901921650001401940650001801954650001201972650001301984650005101997650001602048650004602064650003802110650001702148650005202165650003502217650001302252650001402265650004202279650002502321650003602346700002002382700001902402773011302421852000902534856008102543655001202624IND4414792820221207114746.0090109e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441479282DNAL7 a189971172pmid7 aPMC26137252pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.108.1250052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xianting10asuppressor of sessile spikelets1 Functions in the ramosa Pathway Controlling Meristem Determinacy in Maize  ap. 205-219.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe spikelet, which is a short branch bearing the florets, is the fundamental unit of grass inflorescence architecture. In most grasses, spikelets are borne singly on the inflorescence. However, paired spikelets are characteristic of the Andropogoneae, a tribe of 1,000 species including maize (Zea mays). The Suppressor of sessile spikelets1 (Sos1) mutant of maize produces single instead of paired spikelets in the inflorescence. Therefore, the sos1 gene may have been involved in the evolution of paired spikelets. In this article, we show that Sos1 is a semidominant, antimorph mutation. Sos1 mutants have fewer branches and spikelets for two reasons: (1) fewer spikelet pair meristems are produced due to defects in inflorescence meristem size and (2) the spikelet pair meristems that are produced make one instead of two spikelet meristems. The interaction of Sos1 with the ramosa mutants, which produce more branches and spikelets, was investigated. The results show that Sos1 has an epistatic interaction with ramosa1 (ra1), a synergistic interaction with ra2, and an additive interaction with ra3. Moreover, ra1 mRNA levels are reduced in Sos1 mutants, while ra2 and ra3 mRNA levels are unaffected. Based on these genetic and expression studies, we propose that sos1 functions in the ra1 branch of the ramosa pathway controlling meristem determinacy.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3abranches 3acorn 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenetic background 3agrasses 3ainflorescences 3ameristems 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3amutation 2aFlowersxgeneticsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aGene Dosage 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aMeristemxgeneticsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aZea maysxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aSkirpan, Andrea1 aMcSteen, Paula0 tPlant physiology.g2009 Jan., v. 149, no. 1 p.205-219dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.108.1250053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03723naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001600142245010100158300001600259500001500275520225800290650001102548650002202559650002502581650002302606650001802629650002502647650002102672650001302693650001802706650002402724650001102748650001402759650001502773650002302788650002302811650002302834650001002857650001102867653001302878653001102891653001502902653001702917700002102934773009002955852000903045856008203054930003303136945001303169946001103182655001203193IND2107445920221117212242.0980528e199803  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND210744592DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/49.320.5992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJames, E.K.10aEffect of oxygen availability on nitrogen fixation by two Lotus species under flooded conditions  ap. 599-609.  a2019-12-04  aThe pasture legumes Lotus uliginosus (Schk.) and Lotus corniculatus (L.), known to differ in their tolerance to flooding, were inoculated with Rhizobium loti and flooded for 60 d while subjected to two levels of dissolved pO2: 0.241 and 0.094 micromoles ml-(-1). L. uliginosus showed significantly greater growth (shoot and root) and N2 fixation under both pO2s, compared to L. corniculatus, although growth and N2 fixation by L. cornicalatus was not affected by the low pO2. Surprisingly, in L. uliginosus., growth, nodulation and N2 fixation were all increased by low pO2 while nodulation of L. corniculatus was unaffected by low pO2. The highest rates of endogenous ethylene production were found with L. corniculatus where low pO2 plants showed a significant increase over that of the higher pO2 plants while L. uliginosus plants showed a decline. Root porosity of L. uliginosus doubled in the low pO2-treatment from a mean of 14.5% in high pO2 roots to 28.5%, whereas that of L. corniculatus was relatively unaffected by pO2, being 7% and 9% for high and low pO2 plants, respectively. The structure of nodules differed little between species and treatments, although nodules/nodulated roots from the L. uliginosus plants had particularly profuse lenticels and aerenchyma. However, L. corniculatus nodules, especially those grown in the lower pO2 showed signs of early senescence with vacuolation of infected cells and green coloration when cut open. Leghaemoglobin (Lb) concentrations in nodules from both species were unaffected by low pO2, although that of L. corniculatus nodules, regardless of pO2, was significantly greater than L. uliginosus. Concentrations of the intercellular glycoprotein recognized by the monoclonal antibody MAC265 were significantly reduced in nodules from the low pO2 treatment in both species. Immunogold labelling showed that the MAC265 antigen was localized primarily within intercellular spaces within nodule cortices from both Lotus species. A marked decrease in deposition of the MAC265 antigen within the cortices of L. uliginosus nodules grown in the lower pO2. is discussed in terms of the relative abilities of the two Lotus spp. to maintain an O2 supply to the N2-fixing bacteroids within submerged nodules. 3acortex 3anitrogen fixation 3aanaerobic conditions 3aaerobic conditions 3aglycoproteins 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aLotus uliginosus 3aporosity 3aleghemoglobin 3aethylene production 3aoxygen 3aRhizobium 3anodulation 3aMesorhizobium loti 3aLotus corniculatus 3aflooding tolerance 3aroots 3ashoots 0aflooding 0agrowth 0asenescence 0aflooded land1 aCrawford, R.M.M.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 Mar., v. 49, no. 320 p.599-609x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.320.5993Available from publisher's Web site  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01564naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245006900137300001600206300002400222520062100246650001800867650002500885650002100910650002300931650002000954653002800974700001601002700001601018700001401034773011501048852000901163939003301172945000801205946001301213655001201226991618977370742620221117212237.0910528e199006  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910013892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanderslice, J.T.10aAscorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid content of foods-as-eaten  ap. 105-118.  ap. 105-118. charts.  aHigh performance liquid chromatography combined with laboratory robotic extraction procedures was utilized to determine the ascorbic acid and the dehydroascorbic acid content of the principal sources of vitamin C in the American diet.

Plant water loss, measured as xylem sap flow and as leaf transpiration, was lower in water-stressed plants. Morphometric measurements on xylem showed that vessels of water-stressed plants had lower transactional areas. Shoot hydraulic conductivity (kh), shoot specific conductivity (ks) and leaf specific conductivity (kl) were lower in water-stressed plants. When conductivities were measured on shoot portions, differences between treatments were particularly high at the basal internodes. At the lower stress level no embolism was detected, and reduced conductivity could be explained by the reduction of vessel diameter, according to the Poiseuille equation. At the higher stress level kh was further reduced by formation of vessel embolisms. The tension gradient along the shoot increased only at the higher stress level. Stomatal conductance was linearly correlated with kl at low stress levels, suggesting a concerted regulation of water flow, while at higher stress levels stomatal conductance decreased with no changes of kl. Reduced development of xylem vessels in grapevines subjected to moderate water stress may contribute to the control of water flow and to a reduction in vulnerability to xylem embolism. 3astomatal conductance 3adiameter 3ainternodes 3adrought 3awater stress 3asap flow 3awater 3asap 3aVitis vinifera 3axylem 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aleaves 3aleaf conductance 0asize 0awater availability 0ashoot hydraulic conductivity 0atranspiration 0aplant vascular system 0alosses1 aSchubert, A.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 Apr., v. 49, no. 321 p.693-700x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.321.6933Available from publisher's Web site  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03896naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001600142245003800158300001600196500001500212520259700227650001102824650001502835650001802850650001002868650003202878650001002910650001902920650001302939650001002952650001702962650001002979650001702989653002503006653001903031653001803050653001403068653002303082653001503105653002603120700001903146773008903165852000903254856008203263930003303345945001303378946001103391655001203402IND2123633020221117212241.0980625e199805  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212363302DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/49.322.7752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteudle, E.10aHow does water get through roots?  ap. 775-788.  a2019-12-04  aOn the basis of recent results with young primary maize roots, a model is proposed for the movement of water across roots. It is shown how the complex, 'composite anatomical structure' of roots results in a 'composite transport' of both water and solutes. Parallel apoplastic, symplastic and transcellular pathways play an important role during the passage of water across the different tissues. These are arranged in series within the root cylinder (epidermis, exodermis, central cortex, endodermis, pericycle stelar parenchyma, and tracheary elements). The contribution of these structures to the roots overall radial hydraulic resistance is examined. It is shown that as soon as early metaxylem vessels mature, the axial (longitudinal) hydraulic resistance within the xylem is usually not rate-limiting. According to the model, there is a rapid exchange of water between parallel radial pathways because, in contrast to solutes such as nutrient ions, water permeates cell membranes readily. The roles of apoplastic barriers (Casparian bands and suberin lamellae) in the root's endo- and exodermis are discussed. The model allows for special characteristics of roots such as a high hydraulic conductivity (water permeability) in the presence of a low permeability of nutrient ions once taken up into the stele by active processes. Low root reflection coefficients indicate some apoplastic by-passes for water within the root cylinder. For a given root, the model explains the large variability in the hydraulic resistance in terms of a dependence of hydraulic conductivity on the nature and intensity of the driving forces involved to move water. By switching the apoplastic path on or off, the model allows for a regulation of water uptake according to the demands from the shoot. At high rates of transpiration, the apoplastic path will be partially used and the hydraulic resistance of the root will be low, allowing for a rapid uptake of water. On the contrary, at low rates of transpiration such as during the night or during stress conditions (drought, high salinity, nutrient deprivation), the apoplastic path will be less used and the hydraulic resistance will be high. The role of water channels (aquaporins) in the transcellular path is in the fine adjustment of water flow or in the regulation of uptake in older, suberized parts of plant roots lacking a substantial apoplastic component. The composite transport model explains how plants are designed to optimize water uptake according to demands from the shoot and how external factors may influence water passage across roots. 3acortex 3acell walls 3atranspiration 3acells 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3awater 3acell membranes 3asymplast 3axylem 3awater uptake 3aroots 3apermeability 0ahydraulic resistance 0awater transfer 0aplant anatomy 0aepidermis 0aliterature reviews 0aparenchyma 0aplant vascular system1 aPeterson, C.A.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 May, v. 49, no. 322 p.775-788x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.322.7753Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02507naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002000142245016600162300001600328500001500344520094400359650002101303650002201324650001801346650001201364650002201376650001201398650001201410650002301422650002501445650002001470650002801490650000701518650001501525650002501540650001301565650002001578653002301598653002101621653001501642653002801657653002301685653001401708700001801722773008901740852000901829856008201838930003301920945001301953946001101966655001201977IND2123633420221117212141.0980625e199805  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212363342DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/49.322.7892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallagher, J.A.10aIsolation and characterization of a cDNA clone from Lolium temulentum L. encoding for a sucrose hydrolytic enzyme which shows alkaline/neutral invertase activity  ap. 789-795.  a2019-12-04  aA novel cDNA clone, functionally expressed in E. coli, was isolated from a L. temulentum L. cDNA library. The expressed protein hydrolysed sucrose with an apparent Km of approximately 18 mM, and produced equi-molar concentrations of glucose and fructose. Optimum activity was observed at pH 7-7.5; there was little or no activity at pH 5.5. The expressed protein did not hydrolyse raffinose, stachyose or maltose. The activity of the expressed protein was inhibited by fructose (50% at 15 mM) and TRIS (50% at 2.5 mM), but was not affected by MgCl2, CaCl2 or MnCl2. These findings suggest that this cDNA clone encodes for an alkaline/neutral invertase. Sequence analysis revealed little homology with published sequences for acid invertase, however the invertase motif (NDPN) identified in other invertases was present. Expression studies show that the gene encoding for this enzyme is not regulated by sucrose accumulation in leaf tissue. 3acalcium chloride 3aLolium temulentum 3amessenger RNA 3abuffers 3acomplementary DNA 3aglucose 3asucrose 3amagnesium chloride 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3apH 3ahydrolysis 3anucleotide sequences 3afructose 3aenzyme activity 0amanganese chloride 0agenbank/aj003114 0ainhibition 0amolecular sequence data 0agenetic regulation 0achlorides1 aPollock, C.J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 May, v. 49, no. 322 p.789-795x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.322.7893Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01192naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099245006300117300001400180520050200194650002500696650001700721650001400738650002400752653003500776773007700811852000900888939003300897945000800930655001200938991618975830742620221117212134.0780201e19770915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794437642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aHamburger topples as Seattle campus broadens food horizons  ap. 95-96.  aNew culinary horizons were opened up when the Husky Den replaced the previous dining facility at the University of Washington in Seattle.

Leaf optical properties, pigment changes, expansion characteristics, stomatal development, and photosynthetic rates were studied. In both S. luehmannii and S. wilsonii photosynthetic development was delayed until after full leaf expansion. Rates of O2 evolution were negative during expansion of S. luehmannii and S. wilsonii leaves and stomatal conductance was 10-20 mmol m-2 s-1 lower than for corresponding leaves of S. moorei. Stomatal conductance data and scanning electron microscopy showed that the development of functional stomata was delayed until after full leaf expansion in S. luehmannii and S. wilsonii, however, low stomatal conductance was not responsible for the lack of photosynthetic potential during leaf expansion in these species. Leaves of S. luehmannii and S. wilsonii required less than 10 d for full leaf expansion and contained anthocyanin during expansion. In contrast, leaves of S. moorei and S. corynanthum expanded slowly (20-40 d required for full leaf expansion), exhibited positive rates of O2 evolution and did not accumulate anthocyanin. In S. luehmannii and S. wilsonii anthocyanin was located in the vacuole of distinct cell layers just below the upper epidermis and the possible functions of anthocyanin accumulation are discussed. This is the first report where such variation in leaf development has been characterized in the one genus. 3aanthocyanins 3ainterspecific variation 3aplant development 3apigmentation 3agas production (biological) 3agas exchange 3aphotosynthesis 3aSyzygium 3astomata 3aoptical properties 3achlorophyll 3aoxygen 0aspecies differences 0agrowth 0asyzygium wilsonii 0asyzygium moorei 0adark 0arespiration 0asyzygium luehmannii 0asyzygium corynanthum 0aleaves1 aDodd, I.C.1 aStewart, G.R.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 Jan., v. 49, no. 318 p.79-87x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.318.793Available from publisher's Web site  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01990naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005100127300001800178520103500196650001601231650001801247650001301265650003001278650002501308650002401333650002801357651001601385653003301401700001901434700001701453773010201470852000901572930003301581945001301614946001301627655001201640IND2331379120221117211409.0030313e200211  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233137912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReinhard, S.10aAnalysis of environmental efficiency variation  ap. 1054-1065.  aIn this article, we develop and implement a methodology for analyzing the sources of variation in environmental efficiency across producers. We formulate a two-stage model. In the first stage, we use stochastic frontier analysis to estimate both technical and environmental efficiency. In the second stage, we again use stochastic frontier analysis to regress estimated environmental efficiency scores against a variety of technology, physical environment, and management variables. In this stage we estimate the impact of each explanatory variable on environmental efficiency, and we derive conditional estimates of environmental efficiency from the one-sided error component. We illustrate our methodology with an empirical application to a panel of Dutch dairy farms. We find evidence of relatively low levels of environmental efficiency, and we find that environmental efficiency can be improved through a number of policy options, including the provision of farmers with more insight into the nutrient balance of their farms. 3afarm inputs 3adairy farming 3anitrogen 3aenvironmental degradation 3astochastic processes 3aregression analysis 3anutrient use efficiency 3aNetherlands 0astochastic frontier analysis1 aLovell, C.A.K.1 aThijssen, G.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2002 Nov., v. 84, no. 4 p.1054-1065x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle01009naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002300115245007300138300001600211520014200227650002300369650001700392650001800409650002200427651001100449653001200460653002600472700001900498773011500517852000900632939003300641945000800674946001300682655001200695991618973260742620221117211412.0890206e198811  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890001882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSagrero-Nieves, L.10aPhenolic content of vanilla planifolia as affected by harvest period  ap. 362-365.  aThe vanilla bean was analyzed for the phenolic compounds, vanilla, vanillic acid and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde as a function of harvest time. 3aVanilla planifolia 3aharvest date 3avanillic acid 3aspectral analysis 3aMexico 0avanilla 0a4-hydroxybenzaldehyde1 aSchwartz, S.J.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g1988 Nov., v. 1, no. 4 p.362-365wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02440naa a2200625 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002200133245007000155300001600225300002900241500006600270520071800336650002001054650002501074650001801099650002001117650002101137650001501158650001001173650001601183650000901199650001001208650002101218650002001239650001701259650002101276650001801297650001101315650001101326650000901337650001601346650001301362650004001375650002901415650001601444650001301460651001801473651001801491653001501509653002501524653002701549700002001576700001801596700002301614773010201637852000901739939003301748945000801781946001301789655001201802991618971390742620221117211443.0810811e198106  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810015382DNAL7 a72520122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWindham, Carol T.10aConsistency of nutrient consumption patterns in the United States  ap. 587-595.  ap. 587-595. ill., chart.  aPartially funded by USDA Cooperative Agreement 58-32U4-0-120.  aAn analysis of current food consumption data was undertaken to determine dietary quality in the U.S., nutritional adequacy based on RDAs, and qualitative food consumption patterns of various age-sex groups based on nutrient/calorie ratio.

BSP) seedlings to severe artificial frost treatments applied at 2-week intervals during cold acclimation. Black spruce seedlings responded to cold acclimation with long-term suppression of photosynthetic capacity (Amax) and apparent quantum-use efficiency (a'). Short-term reductions in both photosynthetic parameters following frost treatments were dependent on the extent of cold acclimation of the seedlings and the severity of the frost treatments. Large reductions in Amax in response to the frost treatments were observed in seedlings that had undergone little cold acclimation and these reductions were associated with an irreversible reduction in a'. Such seedlings recovered only partially during the subsequent 23 days, whereas seedlings in most other treatments showed complete recovery of A(max) after 13 days. The impact of frost treatments on A(max) and a' did not vary with seedling provenance. We propose an algorithm that predicts the combined effects of cold acclimation and severe freezing temperatures on the extent of the suppression of A(max) during autumn. The algorithm is based on (1) the maximum A(max) observed during the growing season, (2) the accumulation of cold degree-days, based on a minimum nocturnal temperature < 5 degrees C, and (3) the severity of freezing temperatures during autumn. The parameters developed in the algorithm showed that cold acclimation of black spruce seedlings had a greater impact on the reduction of A(max) in autumn than did the severe frost treatments. Mean A(max) of seedlings subjected to artificial frosts showed a strong correlation with values predicted by the algorithm (r2 = 0.91). 3aPicea mariana 3acold stress 3aphotosynthesis 3anet assimilation rate 3agas exchange 3ameasurement 3afrost resistance 3aacclimation 3aseasonal variation 3aboreal forests 3aprovenance 3amathematical models 3aequations 3aalgorithms 2aAcclimatizationxphysiology 2aCold Temperature 2aFreezing 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPiceaxphysiology 2aTreesxphysiology 3aQuebec1 aMargolis, H.A.1 aBigras, F.J.1 aRaulier, F.0 tTree physiology.g2003 Apr., v. 23, no. 5 p.301-311x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/23.5.3013Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02165naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002000133245005500153300001600208300002400224520095000248650000801198650001101206650001101217650001601228650002001244650001001264650001601274650001601290650001601306650001101322650001101333650000901344650001601353650001701369650001601386653003101402653002601433700001901459700002101478700001901499773010201518852000901620939003301629945000801662946001301670655001201683991618969850742620221117204644.0810811e198106  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810015402DNAL7 a72520142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPirie, Phyllis.10aDistortion in self-reported height and weight data  ap. 601-606.  ap. 601-606. charts.  aData on 3407 adults, 20-59 years old, from a lipid screening program were analyzed for the degree and direction of error in self-reported height and weight data and for possible correlations between demographic variables and reporting errors.

Male smokers had less discrepancy than any others. Marital status was not related to reporting. These results may be useful as a measure of potential bias in other data collections. 3aage 3aheight 3aweight 3areliability 3aself-perception 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aBody Height 2aBody Weight 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSelf Concept 2aSex Factors 0aindividual characteristics 0aSex (Characteristics)1 aJacobs, David.1 aJeffery, Robert.1 aHannan, Peter.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1981 June, v. 78, no. 6 p.601-606x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810811c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01964naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001700099040001800116100001500134245019000149300001600339520068400355650001301039650001601052650001301068650001401081650001601095650001801111650002601129650001101155650001101166650001401177650002601191650002601217650003001243650002801273650001401301650002201315650003001337650001701367700001501384773006901399852000901468939003301477945000801510655001201518991618969900742620221117204700.0781101e197804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894837122DNAL7 a3054742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgra, S.S.10aImmunologic aspects of human colostrum and milk.

The TPN group received more calories, and the total serum protein in them increased significantly. Metabolic complications did not occur. Transient thrombocytosis occurred in six infants who received TPN and eosinophilia occurred in nine. The case fatality rate in the TPN group (Three of 20) was not significantly less than in the glucose group (six of 20). The differences suggested that infants who weigh less than 1,500 gm may receive the greater benefit from TPN. 3acasein 3aelectrolytes 3aglucose 3ainfant feeding 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asoybean products 3atotal parenteral nutrition 3apremature birth 3ainfants 2aBlood Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCalciumxblood 2aCaseins 2aElectrolytes 2aEmulsions 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aGlucose 2aHumans 2aInfant Food 2aInfant, Newborn 2aInfusions, Parenteral 2aMale 2aParenteral Nutrition 2aParenteral Nutrition, Total 2aRespiratory Distress Syndrome, Newbornxbloodxtherapy. 2aSoybeans1 aReaman, G.1 aOuterbridge, E.W.1 aColle, E.0 pJ Pediatricsg1978 Apr., v. 92, no. 4 p.608-613x0022-34767nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19780901c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle01942naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245006900162300001500231520079700246650002801043650002501071650001801096650002001114650002001134650003101154650001801185650002401203700001901227700001501246700003001261773011601291852000901407856008501416930003301501946001101534990002301545655001201568IND4402449220221117203855.0080306e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440244922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tig.2007.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVolk, Talila10aTissue development and RNA control: “HOW” is it coordinated?  ap. 94-101.  aThe regulation of developmental processes at the RNA level enables selective and rapid modulation of gene expression. Studies in model organisms revealed the essential contribution of the signal transduction and activation of RNA (STAR) family of RNA binding proteins to developmental processes. STAR proteins coordinate the proper timing of developmental events by delaying expression or altering the mRNA or protein levels of essential genes. Recent functional analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster STAR protein, Held Out Wing (HOW), in the context of embryonic development, provided insight into its mode of activity. Here, we describe HOW's activity in the temporal repression or elevation of gene expression that is essential for coordinating the correct timing of instructive signals. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aembryogenesis 3aessential genes 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3amessenger RNA 3asignal transduction1 aIsraeli, David1 aNir, Ronit1 aToledano-Katchalski, Hila0 tTrends in genetics.g2008 Feb., v. 24, no. 2 p.94-101dCambridge, UK: Elsevier Trends Journalsx0168-95257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2007.11.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20080605b20080704c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01321naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245008500134300001400219300002200233520034000255650001000595650001200605650001300617650002600630650001300656650001600669650001200685650001200697651001000709700001800719700001800737700001600755773011300771852000900884939003300893945000800926946001300934655001200947991618965180742620221117203846.0891206e198903  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890019242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Tinay, A.H.10aProximate composition and mineral and phytate contents of legumes grown in Sudan  ap. 69-78.  ap. 69-78. charts.  aSeveral cultivars of chickpea, white bean, lentil, broad bean, and soybean were analyzed for protein, fat, carbohydrate, minerals and phytate.

MS piglets (n=17 from nine sows) exhibited similar thermogenic capacities, i.e. summit metabolic rates (SMR), than European piglets (n=19 from 10 sows) in the cold, but BW had breed-specific effects on thermogenic capacities. First, our results confirm that, with the exception of light European piglets, SMR is proportional to BW−1 in 2-h-old animals. Second, MS piglets with BW ranging between 800 and 1300 g have similar ability to increase thermogenesis and to reduce thermolysis in the cold. On the contrary, BW has major effects on maximal thermoregulatory abilities of European piglets, with a linear relation between BW and reduction of heat loss in the cold, and a progressive impairment of thermogenic capacities below a calculated BW of 1125 g. Therefore, European piglets weighing less than 1125 g are particularly at risk in a cold environment, although they cannot be classified as runt animals. Eight additional piglets (four MS and four LW) of average BW within breeds were used to uncover the effect of breed on uncoupling protein (UCP2, UCP3) tissue expression. Expression of UCP2 does not differ but an overexpression of UCP3 is observed in adipose tissue (AT) and skeletal muscle of MS piglets, in good agreement with their higher minimal metabolic rate (MMR). 3aMeishan 3aadipose tissue 3abody weight 3acold 3acold zones 3aheat production 3alivestock production 3ametabolism 3apiglets 3arisk 3askeletal muscle 3asows 3athermal degradation0 tLivestock production science.g2004 June, v. 88, no. 1-2 p.17-26aLivestock production science (Online)x0301-62267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20131206  aNon-US 7aarticle03256naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245008300169300001600252520173600268650000802004650001902012650002002031650001902051650001202070650001102082650002002093650001002113650001702123650001802140650002102158650002502179650001402204650002502218650001202243650001302255650001802268650001402286650001402300650001502314650001902329650002002348650001402368650001402382650002802396650001802424773012702442852000902569856009202578939003302670946001102703655001202714IND4475036420221117203442.0131219e20031201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447503642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livprodsci.2003.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamminga, S.10aPollution due to nutrient losses and its control in European animal production  ap. 101-111.  aDifferences in soil, climate and socioeconomic conditions cause animal production to vary widely between European regions, notably in animal density and percentage landless farming. They have in common that animal products result from the cycling and redistribution of nutrients through soil, air, plants, animals and manure, with energy from photosynthesis or from the input of fossil energy as driving force. Nature of nutrients and rates of their conversion vary between and within cycle components, and consequently imbalances occur, causing undesired nutrient losses to or extractions from soil, water and air. Nutrients causing environmental concern are those containing excessive phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and nitrate (NO(3−)), contaminating soil and water and those losing the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO(2)), methane (CH(4)) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) into the air. Successful and feasible interventions are to extensify, to reduce external inputs and to optimise. Maximum stocking density should not exceed 2.0 livestock units (LU)/ha. Reductions in external inputs of N, P and K are possible through reduction in fertiliser inputs and by reducing or applying compositional changes of dietary inputs. Optimisation at farm level includes implementing the nutritive measures mentioned above combined with an increased reproductive efficiency by lowering the number of parent animals. Animal manure should be treated as a commodity rather as a waste, with a tailor made composition to be achieved by nutrition or by fractionation. The recommended measures require legal and mental interventions, the success of which will largely depend on the quality of legislation and the acceptability of its implementation. 3aair 3aanimal manures 3aanimal products 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aenergy 3afarming systems 3afarms 3afossil fuels 3afractionation 3agreenhouse gases 3alaws and regulations 3alivestock 3alivestock production 3amethane 3anitrates 3anitrous oxide 3anutrients 3anutrition 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3aplants (botany) 3apollution 3apotassium 3areproductive efficiency 3astocking rate0 tLivestock production science.g2003 Dec. 1, v. 84, no. 2 p.101-111aLivestock production science (Online)x0301-62267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livprodsci.2003.09.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20131219  aNon-US 7aarticle02698naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145072001700163072001700180072001700197100001500214245013400229300001400363520084300377650001801220650001701238650001801255650001401273650002401287650002401311650002201335650001401357650001701371650001901388650002601407650003201433650002501465650001701490650002101507650001601528650001701544650002801561650002801589650003101617650004701648650003601695650004701731650001001778651001001788700001901798700001701817700002301834700001501857773007101872852000901943856008401952945002502036946001102061655001202072IND4362183820221117204300.0040420e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436218382DNAL7 a146522152pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/24.1.652doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Parry, D.W. Lawlor, and R.A. Leigh.  aProceedings of a meeting held September 7-9, 1994, Harpenden, UK.  aThe relation between photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area (Pn), total photosynthesis by canopies and dry matter production (DMP) of crops is reviewed. Although Pn is the driving force for all plant growth, total DMP is determined by processes integrated over the canopy, primarily light interception and thus by leaf area index (LAI) and canopy architecture and leaf area duration (LAD). The processes are not linearly related so that effects on DMP of changes in the efficiency of conversion of energy of radiation to dry matter are smaller than those associated with LAI. Photosynthesis is much less sensitive to changing environmental conditions than development of leaf area. This explains the apparent anomaly that Pn does not determine the variation in productivity of a crop under normal agronomic practice, despite the role of photosynthesis in providing all the assimilates for DMP. Breeding and selection of crops for higher yield has not resulted in improvements in dry matter production. Indeed, potential photosynthetic rate has decreased under selection breeding, compensated by increased leaf area: the causes are considered. Crops growing at or near their potential rate use most of the available solar energy and there is a strong correlation between radiation absorbed and DMP and canopy photosynthesis is not light saturated. To increase production it will be necessary to extend either the growing season or to improve light conversion efficiency; the latter is best achieved by increasing Pn. The limiting factors in photosynthetic metabolism which determine Pn under different environmental conditions, are reviewed. Increased Pn is not likely to come from altering light harvesting, electron transport or ATP and NADPH synthesis which are potentially very flexible and have large capacity: there is large genetic variation. Synthesis of ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) depends on activity of Calvin cycle enzymes which may be limiting due to environmental factors. Increasing the atmospheric CO2 supply increases production of C3 plants under current conditions: this is due to a decrease in the oxygenase function of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco). Improving the specificity factor of Rubisco is a longterm goal to decrease photorespiration. Even if Pn is increased, evidence from theoretical and crop canopy studies suggest that the increase in biomass production will only be a small proportion of the increase in Pn, and DMP also depends on the crop's sink capacity. Crop production is a function of many processes, at the level of the chloroplast, the leaf and the canopy. To increase Pn and production of crops will require knowledge of processes at all levels in the plant-environment system. 3acrops 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaf area 3aleaf area index 3acanopy 3abiological production 3adry matter accumulation 3aplant breeding 3agenetic improvement 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 0aliterature reviews 0aleaf duration 0arespiration 0aphotosynthetic rate per unit leaf area0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1995 Sept., v. 46, no. special p.1449-1461x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/46.special_issue.14493Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03228naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002300142245013500165300001600300500001500316520179000331650001602121650002002137650001402157650002502171650001502196650002002211650001202231650001802243650002002261650001502281650001902296650001802315653001302333653001302346653002402359653001402383653001102397653001902408700001902427700001802446700002002464773009002484852000902574856008202583930003302665945001302698946001102711655001202722IND2070267120221117204352.0980430e199802  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND207026712DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/49.319.1452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrosch-Salomon, S.10aUltrastructural localization of polysaccharides and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine in the secretory pathway of green algae (Demidiaceae)  ap. 145-153.  a2019-12-04  aIn order to characterize the secretory pathway leading to multipolar tip growth in green algae of the family Desmidiaceae, different general polysaccharide stainings, such as the periodic acid-silver hexamine method and the periodic acid-silver proteinate method as well as different lectins specific to defined sugar residues have been employed. General polysaccharide stainings label different kinds of secretory vesicles starting from the onset of vesicle production up to their delivery into the primary cell wall, however, the discrimination of Golgi products is possible using lectins. Both gold-labelled lectins from Helix pomatia and from Glycine max with affinity to N-acetyl-D-galactosamine only produce labelling of primary wall material containing 'dark vesicles' on ultrathin sections of high-pressure frozen and freeze-substituted Micrasterias cells, whereas other vesicle types remain unstained. 'Dark vesicles' are labelled when still attached to trans-Golgi compartments, when distributed throughout the cytoplasm or when fusing with the plasma membrane with the same staining intensity which indicates that the sugars detected by the methods used are present from the onset of visible vesicle production. Gold-labelling of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine is also observed in the primary cell wall. In control experiments the staining vanishes when ultrathin sections are pre-incubated with N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. Various other lectins with affinity to different sugar residues than N-acetyl-D-galactosamine do not produce any staining of the cell wall nor of any kind of secretory vesicles. As N-acetyl-D-galactosamine is usually not present in N-linked polysaccharides the results point towards the presence of 0-linked-glycoproteins in the primary cell wall of desmids. 3aGlycine max 3apolysaccharides 3asecretion 3aimmunohistochemistry 3acell walls 3aGolgi apparatus 3alectins 3aHelix pomatia 3aplasma membrane 3aDesmanthus 3aultrastructure 3agalactosamine 0aresidues 0avesicles 0acell ultrastructure 0acytoplasm 0agrowth 0ahistochemistry1 aHoftberger, M.1 aHolzinger, A.1 aLutz-Meindl, U.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1998 Feb., v. 49, no. 319 p.145-153x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/49.319.1453Available from publisher's Web site  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03236naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001500160245010100175300001800276500002400294520161900318650002001937650001901957650001501976650002601991650001002017650001102027650001602038650001702054650001702071650001602088650007102104650006002175650001202235650004702247650002102294650002502315650002002340650003102360650002402391650003202415650001602447700002002463700001802483773013902501852000902640856008102649655001202730IND4450915920221117204011.0110319e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445091592DNAL7 a212169802pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2010-35892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRushen, J.10aANIMAL BEHAVIOR AND WELL-BEING SYMPOSIUM: Farm animal welfare assurance: Science and application  ap. 1219-1228.  aIncludes references  aPublic and consumer pressure for assurances that farm animals are raised humanely has led to a range of private and public animal welfare standards, and for methods to assess compliance with these standards. The standards usually claim to be science based, but even though researchers have developed measures of animal welfare and have tested the effects of housing and management variables on welfare within controlled laboratory settings, there are challenges in extending this research to develop on-site animal welfare standards. The standards need to be validated against a definition of welfare that has broad support and which is amenable to scientific investigation. Ensuring that such standards acknowledge scientific uncertainty is also challenging, and balanced input from all scientific disciplines dealing with animal welfare is needed. Agencies providing animal welfare audit services need to integrate these scientific standards and legal requirements into successful programs that effectively measure and objectively report compliance. On-farm assessment of animal welfare requires a combination of animal-based measures to assess the actual state of welfare and resource-based measures to identify risk factors. We illustrate this by referring to a method of assessing welfare in broiler flocks. Compliance with animal welfare standards requires buy-in from all stakeholders, and this will be best achieved by a process of inclusion in the development of pragmatic assessment methods and the development of audit programs verifying the conditions and continuous improvement of farm animal welfare. 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal welfare 3acompliance 3afarmed animal species 3afarms 3aflocks 3aresearchers 3arisk factors 3astakeholders 3auncertainty 2aAnimal Husbandryxlegislation & jurisprudencexmethodsxstandards. 2aAnimal Welfarexlegislation & jurisprudencexstandards. 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domesticxphysiologyxpsychology. 2aBehavior, Animal 2aChickensxphysiology 2aFootxpathology 2aFoot Dermatosesxpathology 2aGuideline Adherence 2aPoultry Diseasesxpathology 2aUncertainty1 aButterworth, A.1 aSwanson, J.C.0 tJournal of animal science.g2011 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.1219-1228dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2010-35893Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04701naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002000165245017900185300001600364520270700380650002703087650001303114650003603127650002003163650001503183650001403198650001103212650001203223650001403235650001403249650000903263650001303272650002603285650002503311650002503336650001103361650002503372650002603397650001303423650002303436650002203459650002303481650006303504650001603567650002303583650002303606650006203629650005603691651001503747653003103762653003103793700001303824773007403837852000903911856008603920930003304006945001304039946001104052655001204063IND2333699920221117203501.0030721e200307  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233369992DNAL7 a127772402pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/23.10.6752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasolova, N.V.10aBranchlet nutrient concentration in hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) relative to family, stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios and growth rate in contrasting environments  ap. 675-684.  aGenetic variation in branchlet nutrient (N, P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Mn and Fe) concentrations and mineral concentration (sum of branchlet P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Mn and Fe concentrations) of 8-9-year-old hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii Ait. ex D.

There were significant variations in branchlet P, K, Ca and Mg concentrations at both sites, and these variations differed with canopy position. Relationships between family means of branchlet N concentration and tree growth or delta13C or delta18O varied with canopy position at both sites. At the wet site, there were significant positive correlations between branchlet mineral concentration in the upper-outer or upper-inner canopy and tree height (r = 0.26 and 0.37, P < 0.01) and between branchlet mineral concentration and delta13C (r = 0.24, P < 0.01) in the upper-inner canopy, and a significant negative correlation between branchlet mineral concentration and delta13C (r = -0.21, P < 0.05) in the upper-outer canopy. At the dry site, branchlet mineral concentrations in the upper-inner and upper-outer canopy were significantly correlated with branchlet delta13C (r = -0.28 and -0.51, P < 0.01), and branchlet N concentration in the upper-inner canopy was significantly correlated with tree growth (r = 0.29, P < 0.01). A significant correlation between branchlet delta18O (an index of stomatal conductance) and branchlet mineral concentration at the dry site (r = 0.39, P = 0.020) indicated that stomatal conductance might be a factor regulating the variation in branchlet mineral concentration of the hoop pine families. Both branchlet N concentration and mineral concentration at particular canopy positions assist in selecting hoop pine families with improved tree growth and N- and water-use efficiency in environments where both N deficiency and a limited water supply are major factors affecting plantation productivity. 3aAraucaria cunninghamii 3abranches 3achemical constituents of plants 3amineral content 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asodium 3acalcium 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3airon 3anitrogen 3aquantitative analysis 3astomatal conductance 3awater use efficiency 3acanopy 3aspatial distribution 3astand characteristics 3aisotopes 3aoxygen requirement 3agenetic variation 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aTracheophytaxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aEnvironment 2aMineralsxanalysis 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aPlant Stemsxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aTreesxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 3aQueensland 0acarbon isotope composition 0aoxygen isotope composition1 aXu, Z.H.0 tTree physiology.g2003 July, v. 23, no. 10 p.675-684x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/23.10.6753Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle04050naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100001400191245010500205300001800310500001500328520145300343650001401796650001301810650001001823650001901833650002101852650001301873650001501886650003101901650002601932650002001958650002601978650001102004650001602015650002402031650002202055650002002077650001902097650004302116650001802159650002302177650001802200650002302218650002302241650005602264650002802320650003802348650002802386650003702414650007002451650002802521650002702549650004202576650005302618650006102671650006702732650003102799650003102830650004902861653001002910653002802920653001802948700001602966700001502982773009102997852000903088856007803097930003303175945002503208946001103233655001203244IND4385358220221117203430.0061119e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438535822DNAL7 a169903752pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erl1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKöck, M.10aTissue-specific expression of tomato Ribonuclease LX during phosphate starvation-induced root growth  ap. 3717-3726.  a2019-12-04  aRibonuclease LX (RNaseLX) from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) belongs to the RNase T2/S-RNase superfamily of plant endoribonucleases and this is a report on the characterization of the RNaseLX gene and its encoded protein as a member of the phosphate starvation response in tomato. RNaseLX gene sequences were cloned by a PCR-assisted approach. RNaseLX promoter sequences contained the conserved binding motif of the transcription factor PHR1 known to mediate phosphate starvation-dependent gene expression. The increase of RNaseLX transcript levels in roots during phosphate starvation correlated with high promoter activity in transgenic plants carrying a PROMLX::uidA gene construct and pointed to transcriptional control of RNaseLX expression. Histochemical staining for β-glucuronidase activity and immunodetection of RNaseLX protein revealed striking RNaseLX expression in main and lateral root tips of phosphate-starved transgenic plants, specifically in epidermal cells, as well as in lateral and adventitious root primordia. Induced RNaseLX expression in roots correlated with stimulated growth and elongation of primary and lateral roots during phosphate deprivation. Phosphate-starvation-induced RNaseLX transcript levels in roots were not modulated by auxin or ethylene. These data indicate that the role of intracellular RNaseLX in the phosphate starvation response is connected with specific RNA turnover processes at the root tip. 3aroot tips 3aethylene 3agenes 3aroot primordia 3apromoter regions 3atomatoes 3aphosphates 3agene expression regulation 3atranscription factors 3aplant nutrition 3anutrient deficiencies 3aauxins 3aroot growth 3aDNA-binding domains 3aepidermis (plant) 3aenzyme activity 3ahistochemistry 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aribonucleases 3abeta-glucuronidase 2aBinding Sites 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aEndoribonucleasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEthylenesxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGlucuronidasexanalysis 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxpharmacology 2aSolanum lycopersicumxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphatesxmetabolism 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aroots 0amolecular sequence data 0aplant tissues1 aStenzel, I.1 aZimmer, A.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Nov., v. 57, no. 14 p.3717-3726x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erl1243Available from publisher's Web site  a20070307b20070402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/02/02  aNon-US 7aarticle04901naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100002200191245009600213300001800309520262900327650002102956650001302977650001902990650001203009650001903021650003303040650002503073650002503098650001103123650002503134650001503159650002103174650002303195650001403218650001703232650002403249650001703273650002503290650001903315650002203334650002103356650002903377650002603406650003303432650003403465650002103499650002703520650002803547650004003575650003103615650003103646650004603677650003703723653002403760700001403784700001703798700001603815700002103831700002503852700001903877773009103896852000903987856007803996930003304074945002504107946001104132655001204143IND4385359120141222000000.0061119e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438535912DNAL7 a170430832pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erl1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDiaz-Vivancos, P.14aThe apoplastic antioxidant system in Prunus: response to long-term plum pox virus infection  ap. 3813-3824.  aThis work describes, for the first time, the changes taking place in the antioxidative system of the leaf apoplast in response to plum pox virus (PPV) in different Prunus species showing different susceptibilities to PPV. The presence of p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid (pHMB)-sensitive ascorbate peroxidase (APX) (class I APX) and pHMB-insensitive APX (class III APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POX), NADH-POX, and polyphenoloxidase (PPO) was described in the apoplast from both peach and apricot leaves. PPV infection produced different changes in the antioxidant system of the leaf apoplast from the Prunus species, depending on their susceptibility to the virus. In leaves of the very susceptible peach cultivar GF305, PPV brought about an increase in class I APX, POX, NADH-POX, and PPO activities. In the susceptible apricot cultivar Real Fino, PPV infection produced a decrease in apoplastic POX and SOD activities, whereas a strong increase in PPO was observed. However, in the resistant apricot cultivar Stark Early Orange, a rise in class I APX as well as a strong increase in POX and SOD activities was noticed in the apoplastic compartment. Long-term PPV infection produced an oxidative stress in the apoplastic space from apricot and peach plants, as observed by the increase in H₂O₂ contents in this compartment. However, this increase was much higher in the PPV-susceptible plants than in the resistant apricot cultivar. Only in the PPV-susceptible apricot and peach plants was the increase in apoplastic H₂O₂ levels accompanied by an increase in electrolyte leakage. No changes in the electrolyte leakage were observed in the PPV-inoculated resistant apricot leaves, although a 42% increase in the apoplastic H₂O₂ levels was produced. Two-dimensional electrophoresis analyses revealed that the majority of the polypeptides in the apoplastic fluid had isoelectric points in the range of pI 4-6. The identification of proteins using MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight) and peptide mass fingerprinting analyses showed the induction of a thaumatin-like protein as well as the decrease of mandelonitrile lyase in peach apoplast due to PPV infection. However, most of the selected polypeptides showed no homology with known proteins. This fact emphasizes that, at least in Prunus, most of the functions of the apoplastic space remain unknown. It is concluded that long-term PPV infection produced an oxidative stress in the leaf apoplast, contributing to the deleterious effects produced by PPV infection in leaves of inoculated, susceptible Prunus plants. 3aPrunus armeniaca 3aapricots 3aPrunus persica 3apeaches 3aPlum pox virus 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aantioxidant activity 3aintercellular spaces 3aleaves 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aperoxidase 3acatechol oxidase 3adisease resistance 3acultivars 3aelectrolytes 3agel electrophoresis 3apolypeptides 3aextracellular fluids 3aplant proteins 3aisoelectric point 3amolecular weight 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aAscorbate Peroxidases 2aCatechol Oxidasexmetabolism 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aOxidative Stress 2aPeroxidasexmetabolism 2aPeroxidasesxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxvirology. 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlum Pox Virusxphysiology 2aPrunusxenzymologyxmetabolismxvirology. 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 0aelectrolyte leakage1 aRubio, M.1 aMesonero, V.1 aPeriago, PM1 aRos Barceló, A.1 aMartínez-Gómez, P.1 aHernández, JA0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Nov., v. 57, no. 14 p.3813-3824x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erl1383Available from publisher's Web site  a20070308b20070402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/02/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03658naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100002400191245011800215300001800333520166200351650002402013650002102037650001102058650001002069650001802079650002002097650001502117650002102132650002502153650002102178650001702199650002002216650002202236650003102258650002802289650002002317650004602337650006202383650002802445650001702473650001302490650004002503650002802543650002902571650002802600650003102628650004902659700002102708700002002729700002402749773009102773852000902864856007802873930003302951945002502984946001103009655001203020IND4385360020221117204042.0061119e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438536002DNAL7 a170506442pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erl1462doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aShukla, Ashutosh K.10aTranscriptome analysis in Catharanthus roseus leaves and roots for comparative terpenoid indole alkaloid profiles  ap. 3921-3932.  aIn Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don each tissue is known to produce a distinct spectrum of terpenoid indole alkaloids. Since the invaluable antineoplastic bisindole alkaloids are restricted to the aerial parts of the plant and do not occur in its underground tissues, identification of the structural and regulatory factors operating distinctly in the shoot/leaf of the plant will be a necessity for modulation of bisindole alkaloid biosynthesis. This study aimed at elucidating the differential gene expression in the two main tissues (leaf and root) of the plant, well known for their distinct terpenoid indole alkaloid profiles. The leaf and root transcriptomes of C. roseus were comparatively analysed using two different approaches: (i) indirectly through construction and characterization of separate cDNA libraries; and (ii) directly through a strategically designed suppression subtractive hybridization, using the leaf and root cDNA populations as tester and driver, respectively. A total of 155 ESTs (55 and 45 from the separate leaf and root cDNA libraries, respectively, and 55 from the subtracted leaf-specific cDNA library) were subjected to homology-based classification and submitted to dbEST. The direct approach yielded an EST for sgd (strictosidine β-D-glucosidase) and 16 novel ESTs. Dat (acetyl-CoA: 4-O-deacetylvindoline 4-O-acetyl-transferase) and sgd transcripts could not be detected in the root system of the plant (cv. 'Dhawal') at any developmental stage (6 d, 6 weeks, or 6 months). The growth-related decrease in shoot/leaf dat and sgd transcript levels was paralleled by a concomitant decrease in shoot/leaf vindoline content. 3aCatharanthus roseus 3amedicinal plants 3aleaves 3aroots 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aterpenoids 3aindole alkaloids 3amedicinal properties 3aherbal medicines 3aaerial parts 3agene expression 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agenetic markers 2aAcetyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCatharanthusxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGene Library 2aGenotype 2aGlucosidasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSecologanin Tryptamine Alkaloidsxmetabolism1 aShasany, Ajit K.1 aGupta, Madan M.1 aKhanuja, Suman P.S.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Nov., v. 57, no. 14 p.3921-3932x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erl1463Available from publisher's Web site  a20070307b20070402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/02/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03969naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100002200191245016700213300001800380500001500398520166000413650002702073650001702100650001302117650002302130650002202153650002302175650002202198650001602220650001402236650002202250650002302272650001902295650001402314650002102328650001002349650001202359650001902371650002402390650005702414650002002471650002802491650002802519650001402547650004002561650005302601650003902654650006702693650003102760650004202791650002202833653002502855653003302880653002802913700002002941700001602961700002302977773009103000852000903091856007803100930003303178945002503211946001103236655001203247IND4385359820221117203521.0061119e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438535982DNAL7 a170327282pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erl1852doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVaughan, Simon P.10aCharacterization of FaRB7, a near root-specific gene from strawberry (Fragariaxananassa Duch.) and promoter activity analysis in homologous and heterologous hosts  ap. 3901-3910.  a2019-12-04  aMany insect and fungal pathogens posing agronomically important threats specifically target the roots in strawberry. The use of a root-specific promoter to confer expression of resistance genes in a targeted manner has the potential appreciably to benefit the genetic improvement of commercial strawberry varieties. A novel gene, FaRB7, was isolated from strawberry (Fragariaxananassa Duch.) and found to contain motifs characteristic of tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that FaRB7 represents an RB7-type TIP. In strawberry, this gene is expressed predominantly in roots, with very low expression in petioles. A 2.843 kb region representing the FaRB7 gene upstream regulatory sequence was isolated and found to share a number of sequence motifs with the promoter of the Nicotiana tabacum TobRB7 root-specific RB7-type TIP. When cloned upstream of the gusA reporter gene and introduced into strawberry plants, the FaRB7 promoter was shown to direct strong, near root-specific expression with expression patterns very similar to that of the endogenous gene. Furthermore, the FaRB7 promoter was found to confer constitutive expression, comparable to that produced by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S RNA promoter, in tobacco. Thus, the FaRB7 promoter may be used to achieve near-root-specific transgene expression in strawberry and also represents an alternative to the CaMV 35S promoter for producing constitutive foreign gene expression in heterologous hosts. The FaRB7 full-length genomic sequence and 5' upstream regulatory region have been submitted to the EMBL/GenBank database under accession number DQ178022. 3agenetic transformation 3astrawberries 3apetioles 3agenetic resistance 3aFragaria ananassa 3abeta-glucuronidase 3atransgenic plants 3ahost plants 3aphylogeny 3aNicotiana tabacum 3adisease resistance 3areporter genes 3atonoplast 3apromoter regions 3aroots 3atobacco 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aFragariaxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGlucuronidasexanalysis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxanalysis 2aTobaccoxgenetics 0aregulatory sequences 0atonoplast intrinsic proteins 0amolecular sequence data1 aJames, David J.1 aLindsey, K.1 aMassiah, Andrea J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Nov., v. 57, no. 14 p.3901-3910x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erl1853Available from publisher's Web site  a20070308b20070402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/02/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03444naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072001700157072001700174100002600191245013500217300001800352520141200370650002201782650001201804650002001816650001801836650002201854650001001876650002001886650002501906650002201931650001701953650002101970650001801991650002102009650003002030650001102060650004502071650003002116650002502146650002802171650002802199650004302227650003102270650002402301650002102325650008102346650004002427650005802467700002102525700002502546773009102571852000902662856007802671930003302749945002502782946001102807655001202818IND4385360120221117203516.0061119e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438536012DNAL7 a169979022pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erl1472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFotopoulos, Vasileios10aEffect of ascorbate oxidase over-expression on ascorbate recycling gene expression in response to agents imposing oxidative stress  ap. 3933-3943.  aAscorbate oxidase (AO) is a cell wall-localized enzyme that uses oxygen to catalyse the oxidation of ascorbate (AA) to the unstable radical monodehydroascorbate (MDHA) which rapidly disproportionates to yield dehydroascorbate (DHA) and AA, and thus contributes to the regulation of the AA redox state. Here, it is reported that in vivo lowering of the apoplast AA redox state, through increased AO expression in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Xanthi), exerts no effects on the expression levels of genes involved in AA recycling under normal growth conditions, but plants display enhanced sensitivity to various oxidative stress-promoting agents. RNA blot analyses suggest that this response correlates with a general suppression of the plant's antioxidative metabolism as demonstrated by lower expression levels of AA recycling genes. Furthermore, studies using Botrytis cinerea reveal that transgenic plants exhibit increased sensitivity to fungal infection, although the response is not accompanied by a similar suppression of AA recycling gene expression. Our current findings, combined with previous studies which showed the contribution of AO in the regulation of AA redox state, suggest that the reduction in the AA redox state in the leaf apoplast of these transgenic plants results in shifts in their capacity to withstand oxidative stress imposed by agents imposing oxidative stress. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3atobacco 3agene expression 3aascorbic acid 3aascorbate oxidase 3agenes 3aredox potential 3aintercellular spaces 3atransgenic plants 3aplant growth 3aoxidative stress 3amessenger RNA 3aBotrytis cinerea 3afungal diseases of plants 3aleaves 2aAscorbate Oxidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAscorbic Acidxmetabolism 2aBotrytisxphysiology 2aCarotenoidsxmetabolism 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aCucumis sativusxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxidative Stress 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxanatomy & histologyxenzymologyxmicrobiology. 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aTobaccoxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology.1 aSanmartin, Maite1 aKanellis, Angelos K.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2006 Nov., v. 57, no. 14 p.3933-3943x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erl1473Available from publisher's Web site  a20070307b20070402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/02/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02640naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100001900153245008800172300001800260500015400278500007000432520107800502650002201580650001301602650001801615650002201633650002201655650003801677650002701715650002501742650002601767650003001793653002301823653001401846653001601860700001501876700001701891700001601908773009901924852000902023856009302032930003302125945001302158946001102171655001202182IND2051683020221117204105.0960613e199509  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205168302DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/46.special_issue.12612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutteridge, S.14aThe crystal structures of Rubisco and opportunities for manipulating photosynthesis  ap. 1261-1267.  aIn the special issue: The manipulation of photosynthesis carbon metabolism in crop improvement / edited by M.A.J.

The data have been used with some success to rationalize mutagenesis strategies, identify residues involved in the reaction cycle and, of particular concern, understand the basis for the ability of these enzymes to discriminate differentially between CO2 and O2. However, a detailed comparison of these structures indicates that there are significant differences in the positions of critical regions of the protein that may influence the outcome of catalysis and have certainly influenced the conclusions of investigators. For example, the C-terminus of the L-subunit of the inactive dimeric enzyme from Rhodospirillum rubrum has a quite distinct motif compared to the same segment of the activated hexedecameric Rubisco from cyanobacteria or plants. It is plausible that this is yet one more region of the protein that adopts different conformations depending on whether the active site is vacant or occupied by co-factors, bisphosphate substrate or analogues. 3aX-ray diffraction 3abacteria 3aSynechococcus 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3amolecular conformation 3aamino acid sequences 3aRhodospirillum rubrum 3asite-directed mutagenesis 0aliterature reviews 0astructure 0aactive site1 aNewman, J.1 aHerrmann, C.1 aRhoades, D.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1995 Sept., v. 46, no. special . p.1261-1267x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/46.special_issue.12613Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02897naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100001700153245009200170300001800262500015400280500007000434500001500504520140500519650002501924650003201949650002601981650002002007650002002027650001902047650001102066650001002077653002302087653002002110653002902130653003802159653001002197773009702207852000902304856009302313930003302406945001302439946001102452655001202463IND2051682920221117204222.0960613e199509  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205168292DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/46.special_issue.12532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, D.A.10aManipulating photosynthetic metabolism to improve crops: an inversion of ends and means  ap. 1253-1259.  aIn the special issue: The manipulation of photosynthesis carbon metabolism in crop improvement / edited by M.A.J.

The feasibility of improving productivity at a rate capable of matching the current daily increase in population of approximately 350000 is considered and thought is given to the consequences of achieving that goal. Some environmental and intrinsic factors which are known to constrain photosynthesis are examined and it is proposed that, whereas there is no reasonable possibility of increasing quantum efficiency, there are many aspects of photosynthesis which are worthy of investigation in their own right and that these, if subjected to further investigation of a fundamental nature, could result in improvements in 'efficiency' in the wider sense of the word. It is concluded, nevertheless, that the greatest limitation on global agriculture is not water, temperature, pests or disease, but the cost and availability of fossil fuels, and that this fact should be kept uppermost when defining priorities in the light of future scenarios in which fossil fuel reserves are bound to dwindle more and more quickly during a period of massive population increase. 3ainorganic phosphorus 3agas production (biological) 3anutrient availability 3aair temperature 3alight intensity 3aphotosynthesis 3aoxygen 3acrops 0aliterature reviews 0alight relations 0ainorganic orthophosphate 0aphotosynthetic quantum efficiency 0alight0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1995 Sept., v. 46, no. special p.1253-1259x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/46.special_issue.12533Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03154naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245007900182300001600261520152400277650001801801650001501819650001001834650003201844650001601876650001301892650001801905650002301923650002201946650001601968650001601984650001902000650001502019650002402034650001402058650001902072650002402091650002802115650002802143650002202171650002202193651001202215651001202227653002202239653002402261700001602285700002002301700001902321773007302340852000902413856008502422930003302507945001302540946001102553655001202564IND2333137820221117204201.0030619e200304  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233313782DNAL7 a126155502pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/23.5.3532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHultine, K.R.10aHydraulic redistribution by deep roots of a Chihuahuan Desert phreatophyte  ap. 353-360.  aDownward redistribution of soil water through plant roots has important consequences for water and nutrient balance of arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Nevertheless, information on the seasonal patterns and magnitudes of redistribution is lacking for all but a few plant species. We measured sap flow in the taproot and three main lateral roots of a 10-year-old Juglans major Torr. tree, on an ephemeral catchment in southeastern Arizona, to determine how patterns of redistribution respond to pulses of summer precipitation. Groundwater was beyond rooting depth and a hardpan prevented recharge of surface water to deep soil layers. Reverse flow (hydraulic descent) commenced in the taproot and deep lateral roots in early August after a series of moderate precipitation events, and abruptly ceased after all shallow roots were experimentally severed in mid-August. On some days, hydraulic descent continued in the deep lateral roots during periods of daytime transpiration, and the daily volume of hydraulic descent (deep lateral roots plus taproot) ranged from 10 to nearly 60% of daily transpiration. The persistent pattern of reverse flow demonstrates that, in some plants, water potential gradients from soil to leaf during transpiration are often smaller than those between soil layers within the rooting zone. Hydraulic descent may be an important component of the water balance of phreatophytic trees by facilitating root growth in deep soil layers and by transferring water away from shallow-rooted competitors. 3aJuglans major 3axerophytes 3aroots 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3ameasurement 3asap flow 3atranspiration 3aseasonal variation 3adiurnal variation 3aX-radiation 3aradiography 3ariparian areas 3aecosystems 3amathematical models 3aequations 2aDesert Climate 2aJuglansxphysiology 2aPlant Rootsxphysiology 2aPlant Stemsxphysiology 2aTreesxphysiology 2aWaterxphysiology 3aArizona 0aArizona 0ahydraulic descent 0aheat pulse velocity1 aCable, W.L.1 aBurgess, S.S.O.1 aWilliams, D.G.0 tTree physiology.g2003 Apr., v. 23, no. 5 p.353-360x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/23.5.3533Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01823naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002100133245005600154300001600210300002300226520064000249650002400889650002400913650002500937650001900962650001500981650002900996650002301025650002301048650003601071653002401107653002201131653002101153700002501174700002101199700001701220773010101237852000901338939003301347945000801380946001301388655001201401991618955000742620221117204223.0810727e198105  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810014822DNAL7 a72520092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenneman, Alice.10aTeaching nutritional assessment to nursing students  ap. 498-500.  ap. 498-500. chart.  aA project to assist in the integration of nutrition education into the first 2 years of a nursing program utilized a data collection tool focusing on the basic principles of nutritional assessment as practiced in a hospital setting.

The possibility that C4 plants undergo photorespiratory nitrogen and carbon metabolism when grown in air is considered in detail. 3amalic enzyme 3aphotorespiration 3achemical constituents of plants 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3aAmaranthus caudatus 3aoxaloacetic acid 3amutants 3aC4 photosynthesis 3aglycine (amino acid) 3aenzyme activity 0aAmaranthus 0aphosphoenolpyruvic acid 0aketo acids 0aamino acids 0aphotosynthesis1 aBlackwell, R.D.1 aFullwood, N.J.1 aLacuesta, M.1 aLeegood, R.C.1 aOnek, L.A.1 aPearson, M.1 aLea, P.J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1995 Sept., v. 46, no. special p.1363-1376x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/46.special_issue.13633Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03666naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245018300180300001600363500001500379520186300394650001102257650000902268650002502277650002102302650001802323650002602341650001402367650001102381650002602392650001102418650001002429650001902439650002602458650003602484650001902520650001702539650001102556650002702567650003802594650002402632650004602656650004402702650005102746650003702797651001202834653001802846773007302864852000902937856008502946930003303031945001303064946001103077655001203088IND2333685620221117204217.0030718e200306  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233368562DNAL7 a127500532pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/23.9.6032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOksanen, E.10aPhysiological responses of birch (Betula pendula) to ozone: a comparison between open-soil-grown trees exposed for six growing seasons and potted seedlings exposed for one season  ap. 603-614.  a2019-12-04  aPhysiological responses of 4-year-old potted saplings of an O3-tolerant clone of Betula pendula Roth to short-term ozone (O3) exposure (one growing season) were compared with those of 6-year-old open-soil-grown trees of the same clone fumigated with O3 for six growing seasons. In the 2001 growing season, both groups of plants were exposed to ambient (control) and 1.6x ambient (elevated) O3 concentration under similar microclimatic conditions in a free air O3 exposure facility. Growth, net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, stomatal density, visible foliar injury, starch and nutrient concentrations, bud formation and differences in O3 responses between lower, middle and upper sections of the canopy were determined. The potted saplings were unaffected by elevated O3 concentration, whereas the open-soil-grown trees showed a 3-38% reduction in shoot growth, a 22% reduction in number of overwintering buds, a 26-65% decrease in autumnal net photosynthesis, 30% and 20-23% reductions in starch and nitrogen concentrations of senescing leaves, respectively, and disturbances in stomatal conductance. The greater O3 sensitivity of open-soil-grown trees compared with potted saplings was a result of senescence-related physiological factors. First, a lower net photosynthesis to stomatal conductance ratio in open-soil-grown trees at the end of the season promoted O3 uptake and decreased photosynthetic gain, leading to the onset of visible foliar injuries. Second, decreased carbohydrate reserves may have resulted in deleterious carry-over effects arising from the reduced formation of over-wintering buds. Finally, the leaf-level O3 load was higher for open-soil-grown trees than for potted saplings because of slower leaf senescence in the trees. Thus, O3 sensitivity in European white birch increases with increasing exposure time and tree size. 3acanopy 3abuds 3astomatal conductance 3anitrogen content 3aphytotoxicity 3aquantitative analysis 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3anet assimilation rate 3astarch 3aozone 3aBetula pendula 3afield experimentation 3achemical constituents of plants 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant damage 3aleaves 3acontainer-grown plants 2aBetulaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aOzonexpharmacology 2aPhotosynthesisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPlant Transpirationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTreesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 3aFinland 0acarbohydrates0 tTree physiology.g2003 June, v. 23, no. 9 p.603-614x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/23.9.6033Available from publisher's Web site  a20040608b00000000c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01540naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245014800161300001600309520051300325592002800838650002000866650001000886650000900896651000900905700002300914700002000937700003300957773016400990856007501154852000901229655001201238IND60760488720221122011408.0211222e20210826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076048872DNAL7 a10.2744/CCB-1477.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Wesley O.10aPrevalence of Leeches and Algae on Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta) in Four Created Ponds in Central Ohio: Effects of Pond, Sex, and Age Class  ap. 304-307.  aWe examined the prevalence (% of turtles examined) of leeches (Placobdella parasitica) and algae (likely Arnoldiella sp.) on Chrysemys picta found in 4 recently created ponds in central Ohio.

The dodecamer is extremely stable in comparison to the classic ferritin tetracosamer and preserves its quaternary assembly at pHâ2.0, despite an altered tertiary structure. Below pHâ2.0, dissociation into dimers occurs and is paralleled by the complete loss of tertiary structure and a significant decrease in secondary structure elements. Dissociation of dimers into monomers occurs only at pHâ1.0. Addition of NaCl to the protein at pHâ2.0 induces structural changes similar to those observed upon increasing the proton concentration, although dissociation proceeds only to the dimer stage. Addition of sulfate at pH values â¥â1.5 prevents the dissociation of the dodecamer. The role played by hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions in determining the resistance to dissociation of L.âinnocua ferritin at low pH is discussed in the light of its threeâdimensional structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria innocua 3adissociation 3aferritin 3agel chromatography 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobic bonding 3apH 3asodium chloride 3aspectroscopy1 aConsalvi, Valerio1 aCavallo, Stefano1 aIlari, Andrea1 aStefanini, Simonetta1 aChiancone, Emilia0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2000 Sept. 15, v. 267, no. 18 p.5733-5741dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01639.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002000191245004600211300001800257506007600275520162200351592002801973506003702001650001602038650002102054650001702075650001702092650001002109650002002119650001802139650001302157650002202170650001402192650002602206650002902232650001602261653002502277653001402302653001002316653001802326653001302344700002302357700002002380773010702400856008402507852000902591655001202600IND60691189820221207084623.0200428e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069118982DNAL7 a10.1080/15476286.2014.9960602doi7 aPMC46156512pmcid7 a255880292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatsuma, Susumu10aGuardian small RNAs and sex determination  ap. 1238-1242.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe W chromosome of the silkworm Bombyx mori has been known to determine femaleness for more than 80 years. However, the feminizing gene has not been molecularly identified, because the B. mori W chromosome is almost fully occupied by a large number of transposable elements. The W chromosome-derived feminizing factor of B. mori was recently shown to be a female-specific PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA). piRNAs are small RNAs that potentially repress invading “non-self” elements (e.g., transposons and virus-like elements) by associating with PIWI proteins. Our results revealed that female-specific piRNA precursors, which we named Fem, are transcribed from the sex-determining region of the W chromosome at the early embryonic stage and are processed into a single mature piRNA (Fem piRNA). Fem piRNA forms a complex with Siwi (silkworm Piwi), which cleaves a protein-coding mRNA transcribed from the Z chromosome. RNA interference of this Z-linked gene, which we named Masc, revealed that this gene encodes a protein required for masculinization and dosage compensation. Fem and Masc both participate in the ping-pong cycle of the piRNA amplification loop by associating with the 2 B. mori PIWI proteins Siwi and BmAgo3 (silkworm Ago3), respectively, indicating that the piRNA-mediated interaction between the 2 sex chromosomes is the primary signal for the B. mori sex determination cascade. Fem is a non-transposable repetitive sequence on the W chromosome, whereas Masc is a single-copy protein-coding gene. It is of great interest how the piRNA system recognizes “self ”Masc mRNA as “non-self” RNA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBombyx mori 3aRNA interference 3aW chromosome 3aZ chromosome 3agenes 3amasculinization 3amessenger RNA 3aproteins 3asex determination 3asilkworms 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransposons 0aamplification cycles 0aping-pong 0apiRNA 0aPIWI proteins 0asilkworm1 aKawamoto, Munetaka1 aKiuchi, Takashi0 tRNA biology.g2014 Oct. 3, v. 11, no. 10 p.1238-1242dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2014.9960603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007800160500001900238520157000257592002801827650001101855650001301866650001501879650001001894650002101904650002001925650001401945650001501959650001701974650002501991650002302016650002202039650002002061700001902081700001902100700002102119700001702140700001802157700001802175700001802193700002102211700001902232700002302251700002102274700001902295773012202314856007402436852000902510655001202519IND60732188320221119094948.0210326e20210227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073218832DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130307782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUeshima, Junko 10aNutritional Assessment in Adult Patients with Dysphagia: A Scoping Review  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMalnutrition negatively affects the quality of life of patients with dysphagia. Despite the need for nutritional status assessment in patients with dysphagia, standard, effective nutritional assessments are not yet available, and the identification of optimal nutritional assessment items for patients with dysphagia is inadequate. We conducted a scoping review of the use of nutritional assessment items in adult patients with oropharyngeal and esophageal dysphagia. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched to identify articles published in English within the last 30 years. Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven nutritional assessment categories were identified: body mass index (BMI), nutritional screening tool, anthropometric measurements, body composition, dietary assessment, blood biomarkers, and other. BMI and albumin were more commonly assessed in adults. The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM), defining new diagnostic criteria for malnutrition, includes the categories of BMI, nutritional screening tool, anthropometric measurements, body composition, and dietary assessment as its required components, but not the blood biomarkers and the “other” categories. We recommend assessing nutritional status, including GLIM criteria, in adult patients with dysphagia. This would standardize nutritional assessments in patients with dysphagia and allow future global comparisons of the prevalence and outcomes of malnutrition, as well as of appropriate interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aalbumins 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3abody composition 3abody mass index 3adysphagia 3aleadership 3amalnutrition 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional status 3aoptimal nutrition 3aquality of life1 aMomosaki, Ryo 1 aShimizu, Akio 1 aMotokawa, Keiko 1 aSonoi, Mika 1 aShirai, Yuka 1 aUno, Chiharu 1 aKokura, Yoji 1 aShimizu, Midori 1 aNishiyama, Ai 1 aMoriyama, Daisuke 1 aYamamoto, Kaori 1 aSakai, Kotomi 0 tNutrients.g2021 Feb. 27, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130307783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013900170300001600309520122400325592002801549650001501577650001001592650000901602650001301611650001501624650001901639650001301658650001101671650002001682650000901702650001301711650002201724650001901746650001201765653002101777653003201798653001301830653001401843700006701857773011001924856008602034852000902120655001202129IND60593745220221123032738.0190410e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059374522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamel, Pere R.10aProcessed cheese as a polymer matrix composite: A particle toolkit for the replacement of milk fat with canola oil in processed cheese  ap. 110-118.  aIn this study, we show that the replacement of milk fat with canola oil in a model caseinate-based imitation cheese product to increase its nutritional value can be done by treating processed cheese as a particle filled gel network. Using microscopy, model imitation cheese products with different lipid phases were found to have similar microstructures where fat or oil appears as inert particle fillers in a continuous protein network. Using a texture profile analyzer, we show that the textural properties of model imitation cheese are dependent on the material properties of the inert filler. Addition of rigid particle fillers generally results in greater reinforcement of the matrix (i.e., increased hardness). The addition of oat fiber particles at 5% volume fraction to model cheese containing 51% milk fat and 49% canola oil resulted in a product with similar functionalities (i.e., hardness, oil stability, and meltability) as that of model cheese containing 100% milk fat. The current study therefore shows that the addition of edible non-fat particles for matrix reinforcement can be used as an alternative method for reducing saturated fats in foods while keeping other desirable properties of the product.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanola oil 3afoods 3agels 3ahardness 3amicroscopy 3amicrostructure 3amilk fat 3amodels 3anutritive value 3aoats 3apolymers 3aprocessed cheeses 3asaturated fats 3atexture 0aProcessed cheese 0aParticle filled gel network 0aMilk fat 0aOat fiber1 aMarangoni, Alejandro G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3129-44730 tFood research international.g2018 May, v. 107 p.110-118dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245009500165500001900260520178200279592002802061650001502089650001402104650002002118650001302138650001502151650001002166650001402176650001802190650001302208650002302221700002302244700002302267700002102290700002202311700002102333700002302354700001902377700002202396700002402418773012202442856007402564852000902638655001202647IND60732188420221119094510.0210326e20210227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073218842DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130307862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiamanti, Antonella 10aEtiology and Management of Pediatric Intestinal Failure: Focus on the Non-Digestive Causes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBackground: Intestinal failure (IF) is defined as reduction in functioning gut mass below the minimal amount necessary for adequate digestion and absorption. In most cases, IF results from intrinsic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (digestive IF) (DIF); few cases arise from digestive vascular components, gut annexed (liver and pancreas) and extra-digestive organs or from systemic diseases (non-digestive IF) (NDIF). The present review revised etiology and treatments of DIF and NDIF, with special focus on the pathophysiological mechanisms, whereby NDIF develops. Methods: We performed a comprehensive search of published literature from January 2010 to the present by selecting the following search strings: “intestinal failure” OR “home parenteral nutrition” OR “short bowel syndrome” OR “chronic pseudo-obstruction” OR “chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction” OR “autoimmune enteropathy” OR “long-term parenteral nutrition”. Results: We collected overall 1656 patients with well-documented etiology of IF: 1419 with DIF (86%) and 237 with NDIF (14%), 55% males and 45% females. Among DIF cases, 66% had SBS and among NDIF cases 90% had malabsorption/maldigestion. Conclusions: The improved availability of diagnostic and therapeutic tools has increased prevalence and life expectancy of rare and severe diseases responsible for IF. The present review greatly expands the spectrum of knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms through which the diseases not strictly affecting the intestine can cause IF. In view of the rarity of the majority of pediatric IF diseases, the development of IF Registries is strongly required; in fact, through information flow within the network, the Registries could improve IF knowledge and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adigestion 3adigestive tract 3aetiology 3aintestines 3aliver 3alongevity 3amalabsorption 3apancreas 3aparenteral feeding1 aCalvitti, Giacomo 1 aMartinelli, Diego 1 aSantariga, Emma 1 aCapriati, Teresa 1 aBolasco, Giulia 1 aIughetti, Lorenzo 1 aPujia, Arturo 1 aKnafelz, Daniela 1 aMaggiore, Giuseppe 0 tNutrients.g2021 Feb. 27, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130307863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010600164300001600270520158000286592002801866650001301894650001701907650000901924650001301933650001801946650001401964650001401978650001901992650001902011650002102030650001402051653002702065653002102092653002302113653002802136653002402164700001902188700001802207700002002225700005402245773012502299856008302424852000902507655001202516IND60628910920221117041337.0190523e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062891092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.01.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Xueqin10aSynthesis of BiVO4 nanoflakes decorated with AuPd nanoparticles as selective oxidation photocatalysts  ap. 300-311.  aThe ultrathin BiVO4 nanoflakes decorated with Pd and AuPd nanoparticles (NPs) were respectively synthesized and optimized for the enhanced photocatalysis towards selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols. The monometallic Pd(x)-BiVO4 samples presented hump-like variation in the photocatalytic activity with increasing Pd amount (x) from 0 to 2.0 wt%. Subsequently, coupling Au with Pd on BiVO4 nanoflakes resulted in a further improvement in the photocatalysis, with retaining the high selectivity (>99%) for aldehyde production. By tuning metal loading, the typical Au(0.5)Pd(0.5)-BiVO4 photocatalyst exhibited the highest benzaldehyde yield of 887.7 μmol·g−1·h−1, which was 6.0 times that of bare BiVO4 nanoflakes and 1.35 times that of Pd(1.0)-BiVO4 photocatalyst. A series of characterizations and DFT calculations confirmed the enhanced light harvesting and charge separation of the Au(0.5)Pd(0.5)-BiVO4 material, owing to the strong electronic couplings in AuPd NPs and its remarkable influence on the band structure of BiVO4. The photocatalytic mechanism studies indicated that the selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols was achieved by the cooperation of photogenerated holes and O2− radical, and this process was promoted by the interfacial synergism between AuPd NPs and BiVO4 nanoflakes. This work demonstrates a systematic study on optimizing photocatalysts to improve their performance in light-driven organic transformations as well as highlights the synergistic effect of metal-metal coupling and metal-semiconductor interface on photocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3abenzaldehyde 3agold 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3apalladium 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asuperoxide anion 3asynergism 0aHydrothermal synthesis 0aBiVO4 nanoflakes 0aAuPd nanoparticles 0aPhotocatalytic reaction 0aSelective oxidation1 aShao, Liangzhi1 aWang, Renshan1 aXiang, Hongping1 aLi, Benxia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6454-44590 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 541 p.300-311dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.01.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01888naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008700170520087400257592002801131650001801159650001501177650002201192653002501214653002101239653001901260653001801279653001701297700002001314700001801334773011501352856008601467852000901553655001201562IND60687963020221120174139.0200509e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068796302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.1047012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNebenzal, Asaf10aModel-based dense air pollution maps from sparse sensing in multi-source scenarios  aA method for producing dense air pollution maps, based on any given air-pollution dispersion model, is presented. The scheme consists of two phases. At the first stage, sources' locations and emission rates, i.e., source term estimation, as a function of the model's parameter space are sought (“backward computation”). Then, the source term is used to generate the dense maps utilizing the same dispersion model (“forward computation”). The algorithm is model-invariant to the dispersion model, and thus is suitable for a wide range of applications according to the required accuracy and available resources. A simulation of an industrial area demonstrated that this method produced more accurate maps than current state-of-the-art techniques. The resulting dense air pollution map is thus a valuable tool for air pollution mitigation, regulation and research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aalgorithms 3apollution control 0aAir quality modeling 0aSource detection 0aGaussian model 0aInterpolation 0aSpatial maps1 aFishbain, Barak1 aKendler, Shai0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2020 June, v. 128 p.104701-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.1047013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008700164520104200251592002801293650001501321650001501336650001801351650001501369650001701384650001101401650001501412650001401427650002201441650001301463650001301476650001101489650001801500653001501518653001501533653001601548653002201564653001901586700001701605700002001622700001701642773011701659856008201776852000901858655001201867IND60684735120221119202529.0200503e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068473512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2020.1006842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Tee How10aCurrent development of geopolymer as alternative adsorbent for heavy metal removal  aThe deterioration of water quality is becoming serious due to continuous development. One of the major factors is heavy metal contamination, which is an extremely deleterious to the environment and human being. This work reviews current development of a potential alternative adsorbent, namely geopolymer, in removing heavy metal pollutants from water via adsorption techniques. Geopolymer adsorbent can be regarded as a sustainable material as it can be synthesized by utilizing waste material and by-products. Fabrication process, removal capability and factors governing the removal ability of geopolymer have been highlighted as well. As binding site is a salient criteria for the adsorption technique, enhancement in porosity of adsorbent, i.e. in porous and pervious geopolymer as well as different shapes of geopolymer, of which will influence the available binding sites, is also reviewed. The intention of this review is to provide some state-of-the-art of geopolymer technology in eliminating heavy metal pollutants from water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abinding sites 3abyproducts 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3apollutants 3apollution 3apollution control 3apolymers 3aporosity 3awastes 3awater quality 0aGeopolymer 0aAdsorption 0aHeavy metal 0aPorous Geopolymer 0aSustainability1 aMo, Kim Hung1 aLing, Tung-Chai1 aLai, Sai Hin0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2020 May, v. 18 p.100684-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2020.1006843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005100151245014000202300001600342520115600358592002801514650001301542650001401555650002101569650001101590650001201601650001001613650003301623650002601656650001701682650001601699653002701715653002101742653003901763653002601802653006601828700001701894700001701911773011001928856008602038852000902124655001202133IND60593745620221123010048.0190410e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059374562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ye1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1440-428710aComparison of fresh watermelon juice aroma characteristics of five varieties based on gas chromatography-olfactometry-mass spectrometry  ap. 119-129.  aQualitative and quantitative analysis and odor active value (OAV) calculation were applied to identify the aroma-active compounds of fresh watermelon juice in five varieties: Seedless, Jingxin, Lianfa, Qilin, and Texiaofeng. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis were selected to compare the similarity and difference among watermelons juices. Fifty-five volatiles were identified in watermelon juice in five varieties, among which 6 volatiles were identified for the first time in watermelon. (Z)-6-nonenal, (E, Z)-2,6-nonadienal, (E)-2-nonenal, and (E, E)-2,4-nonadienal contributed greater to aroma profiles than alcohols due to lower threshold through odor active values. It was indicated by principal component analysis and cluster analysis that watermelon juices were separated into three groups, Jingxin, Lianfa-Texiaofeng, and Seedless-Qilin, whose characteristic volatiles were aldehydes, alcohols, and ketones respectively. The average distance between JX and the other varieties was higher than that of others through cluster analysis, indicating that the aroma of Jingxin differed from that of the other four varieties greatly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3acluster analysis 3ajuices 3aketones 3aodors 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3aspectroscopy 3awatermelons 0aAroma-active compounds 0aWatermelon juice 0aPrincipal component analysis (PCA) 0aCluster analysis (CA) 0aGas chromatography-olfactometry-mass spectrometry (GC–MS/O)1 aHe, Congcong1 aSong, Huanlu0 tFood research international.g2018 May, v. 107 p.119-129dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245009200201300001600293500001900309500002000328520151600348592002801864650002401892650001801916650002301934650001701957650001101974650001901985650001202004650001202016650002002028650001302048650001502061650001902076650001402095651001302109700002502122700002002147700002202167700002202189773012402211856007302335852000902408655001202417IND60732313520221119025509.0210326e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073231352DNAL7 a10.1111/gfs.125182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBekuma, Amanuel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7377-900610aBiserrula pelecinus L. is a promising forage legume for the central Ethiopian highlands  ap. 105-115.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe availability of effective inoculant rhizobia is often critical to the successful development of productive forage legumes. Biserrula pelecinus L. is a legume with potential as forage in Ethiopia to improve livestock feed quality and soil fertility. B. pelecinus can form N₂‐fixing symbiosis with rhizobia in the genus Mesorhizobium. This study investigated the N₂ fixation effectiveness of 15 B. pelecinus‐nodulating Mesorhizobium strains on two subspecies of B. pelecinus (B. pelecinus ssp. leiocarpa, native to Ethiopia, and the introduced B. pelecinus ssp. pelecinus). The most effective strain (WSM3873) on both subspecies was assessed at two sites; one with pre‐existing populations of B. pelecinus‐nodulating rhizobia (Modjo), and one without (Holeta). No inoculation response was observed at Modjo when B. pelecinus ssp. pelecinus was inoculated with WSM3873 alone, however, biomass yield was greatest (11.5 tonne DM/ha) following inoculation along with co‐application of phosphorus and nitrogen. At Holeta, a strong inoculation response was achieved with WSM3873 alone on B. pelecinus ssp. pelecinus. In contrast, B. pelecinus ssp. leiocarpa did not show any response at Modjo and failed to emerge after sowing at Holeta.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in many biological processes and diseases. To determine whether miRNAs can affect glucocerebrosidase activity, we performed a screen of 875 different miRNA mimics. The screen was performed using Gaucher fibroblasts, and glucocerebrosidase activity was used as the initial outcome parameter. We found several miRNAs that either up- or down-regulated glucocerebrosidase activity. In follow-up assays, we confirmed that one specific miRNA (miR-127–5p) down-regulated both glucocerebrosidase activity and protein levels by down-regulation of LIMP-2, the receptor involved in proper trafficking of glucocerebrosidase from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosome. A conditioned media assay demonstrated that cells treated with this miRNA secreted glucocerebrosidase into the extracellular environment, supporting impaired LIMP-2 function. Two other miRNAs, miR-16–5p and miR-195–5p, were found to up-regulate glucocerebrosidase activity by greater than 40% and to enhance expression and protein levels of the enzyme. In conclusion, we show that miRNAs can alter glucocerebrosidase activity in patient cells, indicating that miRNAs can potentially act as modifiers in Gaucher disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aenzyme activity 3afibroblasts 3agenetic disorders 3agenotype 3aglucosylceramidase 3alysosomes 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3apatients 3aphenotypic variation 3aprotein content 0aGaucher Disease 0aGBA 0aGCase 0aglucocerebrosidase 0amimics 0amiRNA 0ascreen1 aWestbroek, Wendy1 aChen, Yuqi,1 aMoaven, Nima1 aLi, Yan1 aVelayati, Arash1 aSaraiva-Pereira, Maria Luiza1 aMartin, Scott E1 aSidransky, Ellen0 tRNA biology.g2014 Oct. 3, v. 11, no. 10 p.1291-1300dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2014.9960853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245007700179300001600256520109900272592002801371650002501399650001201424650001101436650002101447650002401468650001601492650002301508650001401531650001301545650002501558653001701583653002601600653001501626653002101641653001401662653001401676653001501690700001801705700002401723700003001747700003601777773010001813856008701913852000902000655001202009IND60526035320221119204027.0190402e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052603532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.01.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCvjetko Bubalo, Marina10aGreen extraction of grape skin phenolics by using deep eutectic solvents  ap. 159-166.  aConventional extraction techniques for plant phenolics are usually associated with high organic solvent consumption and long extraction times. In order to establish an environmentally friendly extraction method for grape skin phenolics, deep eutectic solvents (DES) as a green alternative to conventional solvents coupled with highly efficient microwave-assisted and ultrasound-assisted extraction methods (MAE and UAE, respectively) have been considered. Initially, screening of five different DES for proposed extraction was performed and choline chloride-based DES containing oxalic acid as a hydrogen bond donor with 25% of water was selected as the most promising one, resulting in more effective extraction of grape skin phenolic compounds compared to conventional solvents. Additionally, in our study, UAE proved to be the best extraction method with extraction efficiency superior to both MAE and conventional extraction method. The knowledge acquired in this study will contribute to further DES implementation in extraction of biologically active compounds from various plant sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3acholine 3agrapes 3ahydrogen bonding 3amicrowave treatment 3aoxalic acid 3aphenolic compounds 3ascreening 3asolvents 3aultrasonic treatment 0aAnthocyanins 0aDeep eutectic solvent 0aGrape skin 0aGreen extraction 0aMicrowave 0aPhenolics 0aUltrasound1 aĆurko, Natka1 aTomašević, Marina1 aKovačević Ganić, Karin1 aRadojčić Redovniković, Ivana0 tFood chemistry.g2016 June 01, v. 200 p.159-166dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.01.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012000161500001900281520157100300592002801871650002801899650002101927650001301948650001601961700003701977700002002014700002702034700001802061700002602079700002102105700002802126773012202154856007402276852000902350655001202359IND60732189020221119093227.0210326e20210227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073218902DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130307902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Osvaldo 10aFunctional Health Literacy: Psychometric Properties of the Newest Vital Sign for Portuguese Adolescents (NVS-PTeen)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSelf-management of health requires skills to obtain, process, understand, and use health-related information. Assessment of adolescents’ functional health literacy requires valid, reliable, and low-burden tools. The main objective of this study was to adapt and study the psychometric properties of the Newest Vital Sign for the Portuguese adolescents’ population (NVS-PTeen). Classic psychometric indicators of reliability and validity were combined with item response theory (IRT) analyses in a cross-sectional survey, complemented with a 3-month test-retest assessment. The NVS-PTeen was self-administered to students enrolled in grades 8 to 12 (12 to 17 years old) in a school setting. Overall, 386 students (191 girls) from 16 classes of the same school participated in the study (mean age = 14.5; SD = 1.5). Internal reliability of the NVS-PTeen was α = 0.60. The NVS-PTeen total score was positively and significantly correlated with Portuguese (r = 0.28) and mathematics scores (r = 0.31), school years (r = 0.31), and age (r = 0.19). Similar to the original scale (for the U.S.), the NVS-PTeen is composed of two dimensions, reading-related literacy and numeracy. Temporal reliability is adequate, though with a learning effect. IRT analyses revealed differences in difficulty and discriminative capacity among items, all with adequate outfit and infit values. Results showed that the NVS-PTeen is valid and reliable, sensible to inter-individual educational differences, and adequate for regular screening of functional health literacy in adolescents.  aPublisher supplied data 3across-sectional studies 3ahealth education 3aliteracy 3amathematics1 aStefanovska-Petkovska, Miodraga 1 aVirgolino, Ana 1 aMiranda, Ana  Cristina1 aCosta, Joana 1 aFernandes, Elisabete 1 aCardoso, Susana 1 aCarneiro, António Vaz,0 tNutrients.g2021 Feb. 27, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130307903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245011800217300001600335520128400351592002801635650004401663650002301707650001001730650001201740650001101752650001401763650001101777650003301788650002001821650000901841650001801850650001101868650001401879650001401893650001901907650001301926650001301939650002401952650001401976650001401990650001102004650000902015653001502024653001102039653001102050653001302061653001602074700002102090700003402111700003102145700003402176773011002210856008602320852000902406655001202415IND60593745820221121042424.0190410e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059374582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.02.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiano, Alberto Claudio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2874-301210aCorrelating the properties of different carioca bean cultivars (Phaseolus vulgaris) with their hydration kinetics  ap. 182-194.  aThis work explained how the intrinsic properties of beans affects the hydration process. For that, different properties of six cultivars of carioca bean (a variety of common bean) were analyzed to verify the correlation with their hydration kinetics characteristics (hydration rate, lag phase time and equilibrium moisture content), using a Multiple Factorial Analysis (MFA): the chemical composition (starch, protein, lipids, minerals (Mg, P, S, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn), functional groups from the seed coat analyzed by FT-IR), physical properties (size, 1000 grain weight, seed coat thickness, energy to penetrate the bean) and microstructure. Only few properties correlated with the hydration kinetics characteristics of the studied bean, comprising both composition and structure. The fat content, potassium content, specific surface, and the protein to lipids ratio correlated with the lag phase time, which is related with the seed coat impermeability to water. The necessary energy to perforate the seed coat correlated negatively with the hydration rate. It was concluded that the hydration of beans process is a complex phenomenon and that despite being from the same variety of legume, any change due to agronomic enhancement may affect their hydration process kinetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abeans 3acalcium 3acopper 3acultivars 3aenergy 3aequilibrium moisture content 3afactor analysis 3airon 3alipid content 3alipids 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amicrostructure 3aminerals 3amoieties 3aphysical properties 3apotassium 3aseed coat 3astarch 3azinc 0aHydrations 0aPulses 0aGrains 0aModeling 0aCommon bean1 aSaldaña, Erick,1 aCampestrini, Luciano Henrique1 aChiorato, Alisson Fernando1 aAugusto, Pedro Esteves Duarte0 tFood research international.g2018 May, v. 107 p.182-194dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.02.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003300117024003600150040001800186100001700204245003400221300001800255506007600273506003100349520170800380592002802088596000802116596005402124506003702178650002102215650002902236650002102265650001502286650001002301650001002311650001302321650002402334700001602358700002102374700001702395700002002412700002102432773017802453856007902631961000902710852000902719655001202728IND60734464420221215143621.0220901e20170516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073446442DNAL7 a10113/73446442hdl7 a10.1073/pnas.16212031142doi7 a10.1073/pnas.16212031142chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Jingjin10aPaper-based plasma sanitizers  ap. 5119-5124.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThis work describes disposable plasma generators made from metallized paper. The fabricated plasma generators with layered and patterned sheets of paper provide a simple and flexible format for dielectric barrier discharge to create atmospheric plasma without an applied vacuum. The porosity of paper allows gas to permeate its bulk volume and fuel plasma, while plasma-induced forced convection cools the substrate. When electrically driven with oscillating peak-to-peak potentials of ±1 to ±10 kV, the paper-based devices produced both volume and surface plasmas capable of killing microbes. The plasma sanitizers deactivated greater than 99% of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and greater than 99.9% of Escherichia coli cells with 30 s of noncontact treatment. Characterization of plasma generated from the sanitizers revealed a detectable level of UV-C (1.9 nW⋅cm−2⋅nm−1), modest surface temperature (60 °C with 60 s of activation), and a high level of ozone (13 ppm with 60 s of activation). These results deliver insights into the mechanisms and suitability of paper-based substrates for active antimicrobial sanitization with scalable, flexible sheets. In addition, this work shows how paper-based generators are conformable to curved surfaces, appropriate for kirigami-like “stretchy” structures, compatible with user interfaces, and suitable for sanitization of microbes aerosolized onto a surface. In general, these disposable plasma generators represent progress toward biodegradable devices based on flexible renewable materials, which may impact the future design of protective garments, skin-like sensors for robots or prosthetics, and user interfaces in contaminated environments.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSF  cUSDA | National Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiodegradability 3aconvection 3aozone 3apaper 3aporosity 3asurface temperature1 aChen, Qiang1 aSuresh, Poornima1 aRoy, Subrata1 aWhite, James F.1 aMazzeo, Aaron D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.g2017 May 16, v. 114, no. 20 p.5119-5124dProceedings of the National Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.16212031143Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245016500164300001600329520201100345592002802356650000802384650001502392650002002407650001902427650001502446650002202461650001202483650001502495650001502510650001402525650001502539650001202554650001302566653001602579653002402595653003102619653005202650653003802702653003402740700001902774700001402793700001702807700001902824773011102843856008302954852000903037655001203046IND60553505020221123023442.0180831e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055350502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.08.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Zhenli10aEnzyme-triggered formation of enzyme-tyramine concatamers on nanogold-functionalized dendrimer for impedimetric detection of Hg(II) with sensitivity enhancement  ap. 108-115.  aA new impedimetric sensing strategy based on enzyme-triggered formation of enzyme-tyramine concatamers on the nanogold-functionalized poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer was designed for sensitive detection of mercury(II) (Hg²⁺) ion, coupling with enzymatic biocatalytic precipitation towards 4-choloro-1-naphthol (4-CN) on thymine (T)-rich single-stranded DNA1-modified electrode. Initially, nanogold–decorated PAMAM dendrimer (AuNP–PAMAM) was synthesized by the in-situ reduction method, and then functionalized with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and another T-rich oligomer (DNA2). Upon target Hg²⁺ introduction, probe DNA2 on the AuNP–PAMAM bound to the DNA1 on the electrode owing to the T–Hg²⁺–T coordination chemistry between the two DNA strands. Accompanying the AuNP–PAMAM, the carried HRP could trigger the formation of HRP–tyramine concatamer via the classical tyramine signal amplification strategy in the presence of HRP–tyramine conjugates and hydrogen peroxide. The concatenated HRP molecules in the concatamer catalyzed the 4-CN oxidation to produce an insoluble precipitation on the electrode, thereby resulting in the local alteration in the conductivity. Under optimal conditions, two signal-generation tags including HRP–AuNP–DNA2 and HRP–AuNP–PAMAM–DNA2 with or without tyramine signal amplification strategy (i.e., four schemes) were used for impedimetric detection of target Hg²⁺ on the basis of the same assay format. A low detection limit (LOD) of 0.4pM and a wide dynamic working range of 0.001–100nM Hg²⁺ by using HRP–AuNP–PAMAM–DNA2 with tyramine signal amplification strategy were obtained in comparison with those of other strategies. The assay had a good repeatability and showed an intermediate precision of down to 9.6%. In addition, the methodology also exhibited high specificity and selectivity towards target Hg²⁺ against other metal ions, and was applicable for monitoring Hg²⁺ in the spiked drinking water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3adrinking water 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amercury 3ametal ions 3amonitoring 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3athymine 3atyramine 0aMercury ion 0aImpedimetric sensor 0aEnzyme-tyramine concatamer 0aNanogold–decorated poly(amidoamine) dendrimer 0aEnzymatic catalytic precipitation 0aTyramine signal amplification1 aTang, Dianyong1 aShu, Jian1 aChen, Guonan1 aTang, Dianping0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 75 p.108-115dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.08.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245007600191300001400267520133400281592002801615650001401643650002001657650001001677650001001687650001101697650001101708650001401719650001901733650002201752650002301774650001201797650001201809650001801821650002501839650002601864650002601890650001101916650001401927650001901941650003801960650004301998650004402041650004702085651002802132651001202160651001102172651001102183651002802194651002602222653002002248653001902268653001702287700002002304700002002324700002202344700001702366700002102383700002302404700001902427700002002446700002702466700002602493700002802519773011302547856008502660852000902745655001202754IND60099521520221118030853.0190412e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009952152DNAL7 a235424572pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2013.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiccozzi, Massimo10aEpidemiological history and phylogeography of West Nile virus lineage 2  ap. 46-50.  aWest Nile virus (WNV) was first isolated in Uganda. In Europe WNV was sporadically detected until 1996, since then the virus has been regularly isolated from birds and mosquitoes and caused several outbreaks in horses and humans. Phylogenetic analysis showed two main different WNV lineages. The lineage 1 is widespread and segregates into different subclades (1a–c). WNV-1a includes numerous strains from Africa, America, and Eurasia. The spatio-temporal history of WNV-1a in Europe was recently described, identifying two main routes of dispersion, one in Eastern and the second in Western Europe. The West Nile lineage 2 (WNV-2) is mainly present in sub-Saharan Africa but has been recently emerged in Eastern and Western European countries. In this study we reconstruct the phylogeny of WNV-2 on a spatio-temporal scale in order to estimate the time of origin and patterns of geographical dispersal of the different isolates, particularly in Europe. Phylogeography findings obtained from E and NS5 gene analyses suggest that there were at least two separate introductions of WNV-2 from the African continent dated back approximately to the year 1999 (Central Europe) and 2000 (Russia), respectively. The epidemiological implications and clinical consequences of lineage 1 and 2 cocirculation deserve further investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aWest Nile virus 3abirds 3agenes 3ahorses 3ahumans 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aHistory, 20th Century 2aHistory, 21st Century 2aHumans 2aPhylogeny 2aPhylogeography 2aViral Envelope Proteinsxgenetics 2aViral Nonstructural Proteinsxgenetics 2aWest Nile Feverxepidemiologyxhistory. 2aWest Nile virusxclassificationxgenetics. 3aCentral European region 3aEurasia 3aRussia 3aUganda 3aWestern European region 0aEuropexepidemiology. 0aWest Nile virus 0aPhylogeography 0aEpidemiology1 aPeletto, Simone1 aCella, Eleonora1 aGiovanetti, Marta1 aLai, Alessia1 aGabanelli, Elena1 aAcutis, Pier Luigi1 aModesto, Paola1 aRezza, Giovanni1 aPlatonov, Alexander E.1 aLo Presti, Alessandra1 aZehender, Gianguglielmo0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2013 July, v. 17 p.46-50dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2013.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245012100202300001600323500002000339520160800359592002801967596004701995650001602042650001302058650000902071650001702080650003202097650002202129650001502151650001802166650002402184650001402208700002202222700001902244700001602263700001802279700001902297700001502316700001902331700001702350700002702367700002102394700002302415700001702438773012002455856007402575852000902649655001202658IND60760142220221120103600.0211218e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076014222DNAL7 a10.1111/faf.126032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoehn, John Zachary1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2668-609310aFishing for health: Do the world’s national policies for fisheries and aquaculture align with those for nutrition?  ap. 125-142.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAquatic foods are rich in micronutrients essential to human health, and fisheries and aquaculture are increasingly recognized for their capacity to contribute to reducing global micronutrient deficiencies and diet‐based health risks. Whether fisheries and aquaculture sector and public health nutrition policies align to meet this goal, however, is unclear. Do fisheries and aquaculture policies have explicit nutrition and public health objectives? Do public health nutrition policies recognize the contribution of aquatic foods? Using content analysis, we assessed the alignment of objectives in national fisheries and public health nutrition policies. We further determined conditions associated with varying levels of cohesion among policies in these sectors or domains. We found that 77 of 158 national fisheries policies identified nutrition as a key objective in the sector, and 68 of 165 public health nutrition policies identified the importance of fish and shellfish consumption as key objectives. More recent policies were associated with improved coherence among sectors. International organization presence in policy development was also associated with greater coherence. Countries with higher overweight prevalence had fisheries and public health nutrition policies that were not aligned. There has been a promising recent trend for improved alignment of objectives between fisheries and public health nutrition policies, but more targeted and systematic policy approaches are needed to realize the potential contribution of nutrient‐rich fish and shellfish to healthier food systems.  aPublisher supplied data  a1068839cNSF IGERT Program on Ocean Change 3aaquaculture 3acohesion 3afish 3ahuman health 3ainternational organizations 3aissues and policy 3aoverweight 3apublic health 3aseafood consumption 3ashellfish1 aAllison, Edward H1 aVilleda, Karen1 aChen, Zelin1 aNixon, Marisa1 aCrigler, Emily1 aZhao, Lily1 aChow, Michelle1 aVaitla, Bapu1 aThilsted, Shakuntala H1 aScholtens, Joeri1 aHicks, Christina C1 aAndrew, Neil0 tFish and fisheries.g2022 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.125-142dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867077x1467-29607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.126033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245009700179520174900276592002802025650001602053650002002069650002602089650001102115650002002126650002002146650001502166650001802181650001602199650001602215653002102231653001502252653001502267700001802282773011702300856008702417852000902504655001202513IND60758856120221119155948.0220118e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075885612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2021.1055282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpreitzenbarth, Stefan10aBehavior of newly-hatched Octopus tetricus paralarvae in response to different light sources  aResearch aimed at resolving commonly observed high mortalities in the culture of octopus paralarvae has largely focused on their nutritional requirements, while zootechnical aspects have been somewhat disregarded. Light conditions are a key environmental factor often involved in the successful larval culture of many marine organisms, with little known about the optimal light conditions for the growth and survival of cultured octopus paralarvae. This study evaluates the behavior (positive or negative phototaxis) of newly-hatched O. tetricus paralarvae aged 0 days when held under four different light sources (blue – 460 nm, green – 517 nm, pale blue – 460–517 nm, white – 440–530 nm). To test phototaxis behavior, 200 newly-hatched paralarvae were placed in a kreisel tank (7 l volume), held in darkness for 30 min before exposed to one of the light sources above and the distribution of the paralarvae within the tank recorded with a video camera at 0, 15 and 25 min among the bottom, middle and top layers of the kreisel tank. Light intensity was highest in the top layer for all four light sources and decreased by up to 49% and 54% in the middle and bottom layer of the kreisel tank, depending on the wavelength of each light source. Newly-hatched paralarvae were evenly distributed among the three tank layers for the four light sources at 0 min. In contrast, the majority (52.1–57.8%) of paralarvae were found in the top layer at 15 min and 25 min for all four light sources. The results demonstrate that newly-hatched O. tetricus paralarvae show positive phototaxis towards blue, green and white light, which is important knowledge required to provide O. tetricus paralarvae with suitable culture conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOctopodidae 3aanimal behavior 3aenvironmental factors 3alarvae 3alight intensity 3amollusc culture 3aphototaxis 3avideo cameras 3awavelengths 3awhite light 0aOctopus tetricus 0aParalarvae 0aLED lights1 aJeffs, Andrew0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2022 Jan., v. 246 p.105528-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2021.1055283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245010900210300002000319520185000339592002802189650004402217650002502261650001002286650002002296650001802316700002302334700006302357773013102420856008502551852000902636655001202645IND60759234420221119112503.0211207e20211123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075923442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c025492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Frond, Hannah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1199-072710aμATR-FTIR Spectral Libraries of Plastic Particles (FLOPP and FLOPP-e) for the Analysis of Microplastics  ap. 15878-15885.  aRaman spectral libraries specific to microplastics demonstrated improved spectral matching results when weathered plastics and a variety of particle colors and morphologies were included. Here, we explore if this is true for Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as well. We present two novel databases specific to microplastics using attenuated total reflection (μATR-FTIR): (1) an FTIR library of plastic particles (FLOPP), containing 186 spectra from common plastic items, across 14 polymer types and (2) an FTIR library of plastic particles sourced from the environment (FLOPP-e), containing 195 spectra across 15 polymer types. Both libraries include particles from a variety of sources, morphologies, and colors. We demonstrate the applicability of these libraries for microplastics research by comparing spectral match results from two microplastic datasets. For this, we use different combinations of libraries including: commercially available reference libraries, an open-access polymer library, and FLOPP and FLOPP-e. Among tests, the greatest mean HQI result was achieved when the greatest number of libraries was included. This work demonstrates that spectral libraries specific to plastic particles found in the environment improve the accuracy of spectral matching and are best used in combination with commercial libraries containing chemical components that are commonly found within plastics and other anthropogenic particles. Multivariate principal component analyses of FLOPP and FLOPP-e spectra confirmed differences among polymer types and higher variation in principal component scores among weathered particles, but no patterns were observed among particle colors or morphologies. These results demonstrate that ATR-FTIR analyses are sensitive to weathering of plastics but not to particle color and morphology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aanalytical chemistry 3acolor 3adata collection 3amicroplastics1 aRubinovitz, Ronald1 aRochman, Chelsea M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7624-711X0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Nov. 23, v. 93, no. 48 p.15878-15885dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c025493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009100169300001600260520128900276592002801565650001901593650001401612650001101626650001701637650001601654650001901670653003101689653001601720653002101736653003101757653001901788700001501807700002001822700001701842700001701859773008901876856008501965852000902050655001202059IND60607797020221122215509.0180830e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060779702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yanchao10aThermoelectric performance and optimization of three-terminal quantum dot nano-devices  ap. 593-601.  aThe thermodynamic performance and optimization of a three-terminal quantum dot nano-device consisting of two capacitively coupled quantum dots connected to electron reservoirs in the Coulomb-blockade regime are investigated. Based on the master equation, the existing model with configuration A and a previously unreported model with configuration B of the device are studied and compared systematically. The maximum power output and efficiency of the two configurations under different given conditions are analyzed. The results obtained indicate that the working regions of the output voltage and Coulomb interaction of configuration B are significantly larger than those of configuration A. Moreover, the optimum ranges of the output voltage and Coulomb interaction of both configuration A and B are determined. A key measure of performance, i.e. the efficiency at the maximum power output, is further studied. It is found that the efficiency at the maximum power output is approximately equal to 0.035 for configuration A and 0.058 for configuration B. When the temperature difference between the two electron reservoirs is large enough, the maximum power output and efficiency at the maximum power output of configuration B are significantly larger than those of configuration A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric power 3aequations 3amodels 3aquantum dots 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aThree-terminal nano-device 0aQuantum dot 0aCoulomb-blockade 0aThermoelectric performance 0aOptimum design1 aWang, Yuan1 aHuang, Chuankun1 aLin, Guoxing1 aChen, Jincan0 tEnergy.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 95 p.593-601dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03572naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002700180245015300207300001600360500002000376506007600396520177300472592002802245596004102273596004102314596005902355506003702414650001002451650001602461650001602477650001702493650003902510650002602549650001502575650001602590650002102606650001502627650001602642650001102658650000702669650003802676650002002714650002802734650001702762700005802779773012302837856007302960852000903033655001203042IND60691301820221207131722.0200429e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069130182DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.130582doi7 aPMC72169022pmcid7 a318160922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBulychev, Alexander A.10aInhibition of endosomal trafficking by brefeldin A interferes with long‐distance interaction between chloroplasts and plasma membrane transporters  ap. 122-134.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe huge internodal cells of the characean green algae are a convenient model to study long‐range interactions between organelles via cytoplasmic streaming. It has been shown previously that photometabolites and reactive oxygen species released by illuminated chloroplasts are transmitted to remote shaded regions where they interfere with photosynthetic electron transport and the differential activity of plasma membrane transporters, and recent findings indicated the involvement of organelle trafficking pathways. In the present study, we applied pulse amplitude‐modulated microscopy and pH‐sensitive electrodes to study the effect of brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of vesicle trafficking, on long‐distance interactions in Chara australis internodal cells. These data were compared with BFA‐induced changes in organelle number, size and distribution using fluorescent dyes and confocal laser scanning microscopy. We found that BFA completely and immediately inhibited endocytosis in internodal cells and induced the aggregation of organelles into BFA compartments within 30–120 min of treatment. The comparison with the physiological data suggests that the early response, the arrest of endocytosis, is related to the attenuation of differences in surface pH, whereas the longer lasting formation of BFA compartments is probably responsible for the acceleration of the cyclosis‐mediated interaction between chloroplasts. These data indicate that intracellular turnover of membrane material might be important for the circulation of electric currents between functionally distinct regions in illuminated characean internodes and that translational movement of metabolites is delayed by transient binding of the transported substances to organelles.  aPublisher supplied data  aP 22957‐B20cAustrian Science Fund  aP 27536‐B16cAustrian Science Fund  a16‐04‐00318cRussian Foundation for Basic Research0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChara 3aChlorophyta 3abrefeldin A 3achloroplasts 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acytoplasmic streaming 3aelectrodes 3aendocytosis 3afluorescent dyes 3ainternodes 3ametabolites 3amodels 3apH 3aphotosynthetic electron transport 3aplasma membrane 3areactive oxygen species 3atransporters1 aFoissner, Ilse1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3060-10640 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2020 May, v. 169, no. 1 p.122-134dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.130583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245018700202300002000389520178000409592002802189650002502217650002102242650002102263650002202284650002802306650001302334650001802347650001302365650001402378650002002392650002602412650002402438650001902462650001702481700005602498773013102554856008502685852000902770655001202779IND60759234520221119112648.0211207e20211124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075923452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c025982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7647-717X10aTransparent Ultramicroelectrodes for Studying Interfacial Charge-Transfer Kinetics of Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation at TiO₂ Nanorods with Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy  ap. 15886-15896.  aScanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) has been extensively applied to the electrochemical analysis of the surfaces and interfaces of a photoelectrochemical (PEC) system. A semiconductor photoelectrode with a well-defined geometry and active surface area comparable to SECM’s tip is highly desired for accurately quantifying interfacial charge-transfer activities and photoelectrochemically generated redox species, where the broadening effects due to the mass transfer gradient and nonlocal electron transfer at a planar semiconductor surface can be minimized. Here, we present a newly developed platform as a SECM substrate for investigating semiconductor PEC activities, which is based on a transparent ultramicroelectrode (UME) fabricated by using two-step photolithographic patterning and ion milling methods. This transparent UME with a 25 μm recessed disk shape is fully characterized with SECM for quantifying the interfacial charge-transfer rates of IrCl₆²–/IrCl₆³– by comparing with theoretical results from finite element simulations in COMSOL Multiphysics. When coated with TiO₂ nanorods as a model semiconductor material, the transparent UME can be used to quantify the catalytic PEC water oxidation in a feedback mode of SECM by sampling tip and substrate current signals simultaneously. This transparent UME–SECM study provides insights into the potential-dependent PEC water oxidation reaction mechanism and the quantitative analysis of photocurrent contributions from water oxidation and the SECM tip-generated redox mediator. The transparent UME–SECM method can be potentially expanded to other SECM operation modes such as surface interrogation for understanding the dynamics of the electrode surfaces and interfaces of a PEC system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3afinite element analysis 3ageometry 3amass transfer 3ananorods 3aoxidation 3aphotoelectrodes 3aquantitative analysis 3areaction mechanisms 3asemiconductors 3asurface area1 aPan, Shanlin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2226-96870 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Nov. 24, v. 93, no. 48 p.15886-15896dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c025983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245014200206300001300348506007600361520151100437592002801948506003701976650001802013650002202031650001302053650001402066650001402080650001002094650001502104651001402119651001802133700001902151700001702170700001802187700001202205700002702217700001802244700001302262700002002275700001902295773010602314856008102420852000902501655001202510IND60119564220221207124549.0141214e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011956422DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2007-8-11-r2452doi7 aPMC22581832pmcid7 a180214482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Gui-Sheng10aPopulation phylogenomic analysis of mitochondrial DNA in wild boars and domestic pigs revealed multiple domestication events in East Asia  ap. 1725.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Previously reported evidence indicates that pigs were independently domesticated in multiple places throughout the world. However, a detailed picture of the origin and dispersal of domestic pigs in East Asia has not yet been reported. RESULTS: Population phylogenomic analysis was conducted in domestic pigs and wild boars by screening the haplogroup-specific mutation motifs inferred from a phylogenetic tree of pig complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences. All domestic pigs are clustered into single clade D (which contains subclades D1, D2, D3, and D4), with wild boars from East Asia being interspersed. Three haplogroups within D1 are dominant in the Mekong region (D1a2 and D1b) and the middle and downstream regions of the Yangtze River (D1a1a), and may represent independent founders of domestic pigs. None of the domestic pig samples from North East Asia, the Yellow River region, and the upstream region of the Yangtze River share the same haplogroup status with the local wild boars. The limited regional distributions of haplogroups D1 (including its subhaplogroups), D2, D3, and D4 in domestic pigs suggest at least two different in situ domestication events. CONCLUSION: The use of fine-grained mtDNA phylogenomic analysis of wild boars and domestic pigs is a powerful tool with which to discern the origin of domestic pigs. Our findings show that pig domestication in East Asia mainly occurred in the Mekong region and the middle and downstream regions of the Yangtze River.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adomestication 3amitochondrial DNA 3amutation 3aphylogeny 3ascreening 3aswine 3awild boars 3aEast Asia 3aYangtze River1 aYao, Yong-Gang1 aQu, Kai-Xing1 aDing, Zhao-Li1 aLi, Hui1 aPalanichamy, Malliya G1 aDuan, Zi-Yuan1 aLi, Ning1 aChen, Yao-Sheng1 aZhang, Ya-Ping0 tGenome biology.g2007 Nov., v. 8, no. 11 p.1725-1725dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2007-8-11-r2453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003000142245013800172500001400310520171600324592002802040650001402068650001802082650001902100650002002119650002202139650001302161650001702174650002402191650001902215650002102234650001202255651001202267700007102279700001902350700002102369700001902390773010202409856007602511852000902587655001202596IND60706945020221119090113.0200811e20200727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070694502DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/54294722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMouatassem, Touria Filali10aStudy of Abiotic and Biotic Parameters Affecting the Abundance of Mosquito Larvae (Diptera: Culicidae) in the Region of Fez (Morocco)  aNAL-light  aMosquitoes cause significant human health issues. However, very few studies have attempted to examine the question of how abiotic and biotic factors affect the abundance of Culicidae in the larval habitat. The objective of this study was to analyze the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on the increase of the most common mosquito species in the Fez region (Central Morocco). Larvae mosquitoes were sampled by standard dipping technique in four different types of macrohabitats, between November 2015 and November 2016. Each mosquito specimen was morphologically identified by the Moroccan Culicidae key and the Brunhes key. The analysis was done using R analysis software. We collected a total of 772 mosquito larvae belonging to nine different species, five of which are considered of medical interest. Culex pipiens (Linnaeus, 1758), known as the major vector in the transmission of West Nile virus fever (WNV), was the most common species of all mosquito larvae collected. The results of Poisson regression analysis showed that factors such as the presence of green filamentous algae, vegetation cover, and debris were found to be positively significant in the distribution of the genus Culex. However, there was insufficient evidence to determine the parameters that are capable of estimating the abundance of Anopheles. The findings have also estimated that biotic and abiotic factors can lead to significant variation in the abundance of Culex perexiguus (Theobald, 1903), Culex theileri (Theobald, 1903), and Culex pipiens (Linnaeus, 1758). Identifying the priority parameters governing the proliferation of mosquitoes in the region of Fez can be one of the key elements for better vector control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles 3aCulex pipiens 3aCulex theileri 3aWest Nile fever 3acomputer software 3ahabitats 3ahuman health 3aregression analysis 3avector control 3avegetation cover 3azoology 3aMorocco1 aEl Ouali Lalami, Abdelhakim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7152-97081 aFaraj, Chafika1 aRais, Noureddine1 aGuemmouh, Raja0 tInternational journal of zoology.g2020 July 27, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:21406x1687-84857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/54294723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245010400205300002000309520162000329592002801949650002501977650001802002650002002020650001202040650002602052650001302078650001202091650001302103651001002116651001502126700005602141700001802197700001702215700001902232700005502251700005402306700001202360700001802372700001402390700001802404773013102422856008502553852000902638655001202647IND60759234720221119112449.0211207e20211122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075923472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c030602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yulong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2373-425310aCoprecipitation of Mercury from Natural Iodine-Containing Seawater for Accurate Isotope Measurement  ap. 15905-15912.  aOceans play a key role in the global mercury (Hg) cycle, but studies on Hg isotopes in seawater are rare due to the extremely low Hg concentration and the lack of a good preconcentration method. Here, we introduce a new coprecipitation method for separating and preconcentrating Hg from seawater for accurate isotope measurement. The coprecipitation was achieved by sequential addition of 0.5 mL of 0.5 M CuSO₄, 1 mL of 0.5 M Na₂S, and 1 mL of 0.5 M CuSO₄ reagents, which allowed for quantitatively precipitating Hg from up to 10 L of seawater. The protocol was validated by testing synthetic solutions with varying Hg and iodide (I–) concentrations and by comparing the reaction times of various reagents added. The method resulted in a quantitative recovery of 98 ± 12% (n = 32, two standard deviations, 2 SD) and a relatively low procedure blank (103 pg of Hg, n = 8). The precipitates were filtrated and analyzed for Hg isotopes. Repeated measurements of synthetic seawaters spiked with certificated standard materials (NIST 3133 and 3177) using the entire method gave identical Hg isotope ratios with near-quantitative Hg recovery, indicating no isotope fractionation during preconcentration. A total of six nearshore seawater samples from the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea (China) were analyzed using the coprecipitation method. The data showed a large fractionation of Hg isotopes and revealed the possible impact of both atmospheric and anthropogenic inputs to the coastal seawater Hg budget, implying the potential application of this method in studying marine Hg systematics and global Hg cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acoastal water 3acoprecipitation 3aiodides 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3amercury 3aseawater 3aChina 3aYellow Sea1 aChen, Jiubin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7299-03551 aLiu, Jianfeng1 aGai, Pengxue1 aAu Yang, David1 aZheng, Wang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3413-97001 aLi, Yanbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1813-41731 aLi, Dan1 aCai, Hongming1 aYuan, Wei1 aLi, Yuansheng0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Nov. 22, v. 93, no. 48 p.15905-15912dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c030603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006600147245014200213300001600355520133200371592002801703650002001731650001201751650001301763650001501776650002101791650001201812650001301824650001801837650001601855651001401871653002401885653002001909653003301929700005901962700001802021773012702039856008102166852000902247655001202256IND60683958620221121231022.0200214e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068395862DNAL7 a10.1017/S13689800190020032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLacy-Nichols, Jennifer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5157-209814aThe politics of voluntary self-regulation: insights from the development and promotion of the Australian Beverages Council’s Commitment  ap. 564-575.  aTo analyse the evolution of the soft drink industry’s use of self-regulation as a response to obesity and examine the motivations driving its development and the strategies used to promote it to policy makers. We used a data set of industry documents published by the Australian Beverages Council (ABC) between 1998 and 2016. We analysed how the ABC voiced its political motivations about self-regulation and what internal nutrition policies it developed prior to its public launch of self-regulation. We also analysed two promotional strategies: funding research and writing policy submissions. Australia. Between 1998 and 2006, the ABC shifted from a defensive strategy that denied the role of its products in obesity to more conciliatory strategy that emphasised the role of the soft drink industry in solutions to obesity. The ABC deliberately timed the launch of its self-regulation to coincide with an international public health congress. Following its launch, the ABC funded research demonstrating the efficacy of self-regulation and wrote submissions to government nutrition policies arguing that further regulation was unnecessary. The soft drink industry uses self-regulation to bolster its reputation and influence nutrition policy. Strategic timing plays a key role in the political influence of self-regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3afunding 3aindustry 3amotivation 3anutrition policy 3aobesity 3apolitics 3apublic health 3asoft drinks 3aAustralia 0aSoft drink industry 0aSelf-regulation 0aCorporate political activity1 aScrinis, Gyorgy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3897-47781 aCarey, Rachel0 tPublic health nutrition.g2020 Feb., v. 23, no. 3 p.564-575dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800190020033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01659naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245009300180300002000273520066600293592002800959650002500987650002101012650001701033650001301050650002401063700005701087773013101144856008501275852000901360655001201369IND60759234820221119112607.0211207e20211121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075923482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c031162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValderrama, Olenka Jibaja10aReincarnation of the Analytical Ultracentrifuge: Emerging Opportunities for Nanomedicine  ap. 15805-15815.  aThe analytical ultracentrifuge (AUC) and the modern field of analytical ultracentrifugation found its inception approximately a century ago.

We adapted an established diet quality index for European preschool children to align with the Canadian context and applied the index to dietary data of 3-year-old children to assess patterns of diet quality. Our diet quality index (DQI-C) consists of four components that align with Canada’s Food Guide (Vegetables and Fruit, Grain Products, Milk and Alternatives and Meat and Alternatives) and two components that account for less healthy intakes (Candy/Snacks, and Sugar-Sweetened Beverages (SSB)). The ratio between consumption v. recommended intakes is calculated for each component and summed to give a total score from 0 to 6. Alberta, Canada. The DQI-C was applied to FFQ data from 1260 3-year-old children. Mean DQI-C was 3·69 (sd 0·6). Most children met recommendations for Vegetables and Fruit (73 %) and Meat and Alternatives (70 %); however, fewer met recommendations for Milk and Alternatives (38 %) and Grain Products (13 %). Children in the lowest quartile for DQI-C score consumed a mean of 82 g of Candy/Snacks and 193 g of SSB daily, whereas those in the highest quartile consumed 45 g/d and 17 g/d of Candy and Snacks and SSB, respectively. This DQI-C score is useful for ranking Canadian preschool children according to their overall diet quality. There is room for improvement for consumptions of Grain Products, Meat and Alternatives, Candy/Snacks and SSB, which could be a target for initiatives to improve diet quality of preschool children in Canada.  aPublisher supplied data 3acandy 3adietary recommendations 3afruits 3agrain products 3ameat 3amilk 3anutritional adequacy 3apreschool children 3asnacks 3asugar sweetened beverages 3avegetables 3aAlberta 0aDiet quality index 0aCanada’s Food Guide1 aVashi, Nisha1 aAngus, Amy1 aBell, Rhonda C1 aGiesbrecht, Gerald F2 athe APrON study team0 tPublic health nutrition.g2020 Feb., v. 23, no. 3 p.385-393dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800190020393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03848naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002300135024003800158024004500196040001800241100001600259245006900275300001600344506007600360506003100436520214100467592002802608596008302636506003702719650002102756650001302777650002302790650001602813650002802829650002802857650001202885650002302897650001502920650002002935650001702955650001902972653001102991653001603002653001803018653001203036653001703048653002503065700002503090773008803115856008503203961000903288852000903297655001203306IND60607797520221215142340.0180830e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060779752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.0312chorus7 a10113/60779752hdl7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.0312doi7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.0312chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Yayuan10aCost minimization of supplying biomass for ethanol biorefineries  ap. 209-214.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aA major hurdle facing commercial biofuel production is the cost of producing the feedstock. Since biofuel feedstock is bulky in nature, a large proportion of cost needed to be allocated for harvesting and transportation of feedstock. Economic viability of ethanol production from cellulosic feedstock depends in part of the cost to produce, harvest and deliver feedstock to the ethanol production facilities. A well-developed harvesting and transportation system does not exist for most feedstock. Hence to determine accurate estimation of the harvest, transportation and storage costs is important in ethanol production. The objectives of the study are to determine the optimal harvesting unit for ethanol biorefinery and estimate harvesting, storage and transportation costs of switchgrass under various harvesting schedules. A biorefinery with the annual capacity of processing 4.16 million gallons of ethanol was considered. Based on average dry matter yield, total production area needed for annual harvesting was estimated. The harvesting units needed for the continuous harvest and supply of biomass were estimated based on information on the capacity of machineries etc. Accordingly various costs associated with operating and maintaining harvesting unit were estimated. Transportation units needed were estimated for continuous supply of feedstock to the refinery and the associated costs were calculated.The number of machinery needed for a harvesting unit for the 90 day harvesting schedule are the most while year round harvesting schedules needs lesser number of machinery for a harvesting unit. Harvesting switchgrass in 90 day schedule is the most expensive scenario with all harvesting, hauling and storage costs added together. Year round harvesting schedule occurs as the least costly scenario. Sensitivity analysis shows the positive trend for harvesting and hauling costs to biomass yield, ethanol conversion technology, distance and decreasing trend for the range of truck speed considered. The results generated in this study will be useful in designing optimal harvest schedule of biomass for ethanol biorefinery.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPanicum virgatum 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3abiorefining 3adry matter accumulation 3aeconomic sustainability 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3aharvest date 3atransportation 0aEnergy 0aBiorefinery 0aCost modeling 0aEthanol 0aHarvest unit 0aSensitivity analysis1 aIllukpitiya, Prabodh0 tEnergy.g2016 Feb. 1, v. 96 p.209-214dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01669naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245010100207300001300308506007600321520055300397592002800950506003700978650001501015650001701030650001001047650000901057650001401066700002301080700002001103773010601123856008101229852000901310655001201319IND60119564620221207121141.0141214e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011956462DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2007-8-11-r2362doi7 aPMC22581852pmcid7 a179960332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhutkar, Arjun10aInferring genome-scale rearrangement phylogeny and ancestral gene order: a Drosophila case study  ap. 1716.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA simple, fast, and biologically inspired computational approach for inferring genome-scale rearrangement phylogeny and ancestral gene order has been developed.

The biochips were validated by a dimension of atomic force microscope (AFM). The visualized detection limit of IgG antibody on the biochip was 0.39μg/ml. Finally, 286 serum samples from the patients with syphilis were simultaneously tested on the rTpN15–17–47 coated biochips. The results were evaluated in comparison with the assays of T. pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) and the toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST). The result demonstrated that the relative positive rate in the 286 patients by biochip was 99.0%, similar to that by TPPA (97.9%, P>0.05) and higher than that by TRUST, (76.2%, P<0.01). The detection specificities were 100% for the biochip and the TPPA and 97.0% for the TRUST. Thus, the protein biochip would provide a useful platform not only for enabling concurrent detection of the infectious antibodies directed against T. pallidum on a larger scale, but also for monitoring therapy modality of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTreponema pallidum 3aantibodies 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3apatients 3atherapeutics 0aBiochip 0aSyphilis 0aTreponema pallidum 0aDithiobis (succinimidyl undecanoate) (DSU) 0aThe toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST) 0aT. pallidum particle agglutination test (TPPA)1 aYe, Lei1 aSchneider, Marion E.1 aDu, Yi-Xin1 aXu, Yuan-Hong1 aFan, Li-Bin1 aDu, Wei-Dong0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 75 p.465-471dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.08.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03623naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003300117024003600150040001800186100001400204245008400218300002000302506007600322506003100398520168100429592002802110596002902138596002502167596006302192596003602255596004902291596002202340596004102362596005402403506003702457650001602494650000802510650001902518650002102537650001802558650001302576650001802589700001502607700001902622700001402641700001302655700001502668700002502683700002302708700001802731700001402749773018102763856007902944961001303023852000903036655001203045IND60734465320221215143609.0220901e20191119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073446532DNAL7 a10113/73446532hdl7 a10.1073/pnas.17085081162doi7 a10.1073/pnas.17085081162chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Meina10aComprehensive mapping of abiotic stress inputs into the soybean circadian clock  ap. 23840-23849.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe plant circadian clock evolved to increase fitness by synchronizing physiological processes with environmental oscillations. Crop fitness was artificially selected through domestication and breeding, and the circadian clock was identified by both natural and artificial selections as a key to improved fitness. Despite progress in Arabidopsis, our understanding of the crop circadian clock is still limited, impeding its rational improvement for enhanced fitness. To unveil the interactions between the crop circadian clock and various environmental cues, we comprehensively mapped abiotic stress inputs to the soybean circadian clock using a 2-module discovery pipeline. Using the “molecular timetable” method, we computationally surveyed publicly available abiotic stress-related soybean transcriptomes to identify stresses that have strong impacts on the global rhythm. These findings were then experimentally confirmed using a multiplexed RNA sequencing technology. Specific clock components modulated by each stress were further identified. This comprehensive mapping uncovered inputs to the plant circadian clock such as alkaline stress. Moreover, short-term iron deficiency targeted different clock components in soybean and Arabidopsis and thus had opposite effects on the clocks of these 2 species. Comparing soybean varieties with different iron uptake efficiencies suggests that phase modulation might be a mechanism to alleviate iron deficiency symptoms in soybean. These unique responses in soybean demonstrate the need to directly study crop circadian clocks. Our discovery pipeline may serve as a broadly applicable tool to facilitate these explorations.  aPublisher supplied data  cCenter for Life Sciences  cGuangzhou University  cHHS | NIH | National Institute of General Medical Sciences  cHoward Hughes Medical Institute  cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cPeking University  cUSDA | Agricultural Research Service  cUSDA | National Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aRNA 3aabiotic stress 3acircadian clocks 3adomestication 3asoybeans 3atranscriptome1 aCao, Lijun1 aMwimba, Musoki1 aZhou, Yan1 aLing, Li1 aZhou, Mian1 aSchnable, Patrick S.1 aO'Rourke, Jamie A.1 aDong, Xinnian1 aWang, Wei0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.g2019 Nov. 19, v. 116, no. 47 p.23840-23849dProceedings of the National Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.17085081163Available from publisher's site  aUSDAUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle04134naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011600169520235900285592002802644650004102672650001602713650002002729650002002749650001602769650003102785650001702816653000902833653002102842653001802863653001902881653000702900653000702907653000802914653000902922653000902931653000802940653001102948653000902959653000702968653000902975653001002984653000702994653000903001653000803010653000803018653000703026653000803033653000903041653000803050653000803058653000903066653000803075653000703083653000803090653000703098653000803105653000803113700001303121700001503134700001403149700001703163700001303180773012503193856008503318852000903403655001203412IND60758856820221119160841.0220307e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075885682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2021.1065862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yanchao10aReal-time strawberry detection using deep neural networks on embedded system (rtsd-net): An edge AI application  aComputer vision is a key technique to make agricultural machinery smart. Deep neural network has achieved great success in computer vision. How to use it at a small size, low cost, low power consumption device with high accuracy and speed on strawberry harvesting machinery has drawn much research attention. Since the infield situation has reduced number of objects and that they are easier to be distinguished from the background compared to other computer vision datasets, the huge neural network structure can be simplified in order to speed up the detection inference without penalizing the detection accuracy. In this research, a new deep neural network called RTSD-Net is proposed based on stat-of-art light-weighted YOLOv4-tiny with reduced layers and modified structure for real-time strawberry detection under infield condition. The original CSPNet was replaced by 2 types of CSPNet designed with reduced parameters and a simplified structure and 4 new network structures are designed by combining these 2 types. The performances of the 4 networks were evaluated. It was observed that the number of parameters of these 4 networks and the detection speed of the model is negatively correlated. Simplified structure and reduced parameters can contribute to faster operational speed. The last one was selected and named as RTSD-Net. Comparing with YOLOv4 tiny, the accuracy of RTSD-Net is only reduced by 0.62% but the speed is increased by 25FPS, which is 25.93% higher than that of YOLOv4-tiny. Embedded system Jetson Nano was selected as the evaluation platform to evaluate the RTSD-Net’s performance for edge computing. The original Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) model was loaded on Jetson Nano and the speed of RTSD-Net was 13.1FPS, which is 19.0% higher than that of YOLOv4-tiny. After speeded up by TensorRT method, the transformed model reached 25.20fps, which is twice as fast as the ONNX model, and 15% faster than the YOLOv4-tiny model. After speeding up, the efficiency of RTSD-Net is enough for computer vision based strawberry detection and harvesting. In summary, the proposed RTSD-Net has good potential in smart strawberry harvesting machinery and the idea of redesigning neural structure and reducing parameters to speed up the detection rate of deep neural network is expected to have good application in edge computing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3aagriculture 3acomputer vision 3adata collection 3aelectronics 3aenergy use and consumption 3astrawberries 0aYOLO 0aObject detection 0aDeep learning 0aEdge computing 0aAI 0aAP 0aCBL 0aCIoU 0aCNNs 0aCSI 0aCSPNet 0aCUDA 0aDC 0aDIoU 0aFLOPs 0aFP 0aFP16 0aFPN 0aFPS 0aFN 0aGPU 0aHIDM 0aIoU 0amAP 0aONNX 0aPAN 0aPC 0aSPP 0aTP 0aUAV 0aUSB1 aYu, Jiya1 aChen, Yang1 aYang, Wen1 aZhang, Wenbo1 aHe, Yong0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2022 Jan., v. 192 p.106586-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.1065863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245011300164300002000277520106800297592002801365650003701393650001501430650001701445650002601462650001001488650001301498650001301511650001201524650001701536650001401553653003001567653001501597653001201612653003101624653001401655653003001669700002101699700002101720700002301741773012601764856008001890852000901970655001201979IND60528793120221120202825.0160717e20151216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052879312DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b077252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruce, Jared P.10aElectrical Characteristics of the Junction between PEDOT:PSS and Thiophene-Functionalized Silicon Microwires  ap. 27160-27166.  aThiophene moieties have been attached to Si microwires (Si MWs) by a two-step chlorination/alkylation reaction method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that saturation of the surface occurred after 30 min of reaction time. Electrical measurements using a standard probe station indicated that the junction between individual thiophene-functionalized Si MWs and the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) became more ohmic as more thiophene was added to the MW surface. Under a light-limited current of 20 nA, representative of operation of Si MWs under 1 Sun illumination conditions, the iR loss of thiophene-n-Si MW/PEDOT-PSS contacts was 20 mV, representing an order of magnitude reduction compared with PEDOT-PSS junctions formed with methyl terminated n-Si MWs. Such iR losses are much less than typical catalytic overpotentials for fuel formation, and hence the thiophene-functionalized Si MW contacts will not limit the performance of a Si MW array-based solar fuels device under 1 Sun illumination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalkylation 3achlorination 3aelectrical properties 3afuels 3alighting 3apolymers 3asilicon 3asolar energy 3athiophene 0aartificial photosynthesis 0amicrowires 0asilicon 0aelectrical characteristics 0aPEDOT:PSS 0asurface functionalization1 aOliver, Derek R.1 aLewis, Nathan S.1 aFreund, Michael S.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Dec. 16, v. 7, no. 49 p.27160-27166dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b077253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245012800153300001800281500001900299500002000318520153600338592002801874596004401902650001801946650002501964650002301989650001402012650001302026650001402039650001702053650001802070650001602088650001102104650000902115650001602124650001702140650001402157650003602171650001102207650001402218700002902232700002302261700002802284773013502312856007202447852000902519655001202528IND60691302520221120031540.0200429e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069130252DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.47022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Biyao10aModulatory Effects of Pb2+ on Virally Challenged Chicken Macrophage (HD‐11) and B‐Lymphocyte (DT40) Cell Lines In Vitro  ap. 1060-1070.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aElevated levels of lead have been found in waterfowl, due to human activities. Lead may cause immunomodulatory effects, but the mechanisms are largely unknown, especially after viral challenges. To characterize avian immunomodulatory hazards of lead (Pb)²⁺, we used chicken macrophage (HD‐11) and B‐lymphocyte (DT40) cell lines, as in vitro models for the innate and adaptive immune systems, respectively. The cells were activated via toll‐like receptor‐3 by polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid sodium salt (poly I:C), mimicking viral infections. Our results indicate that Pb²⁺ is cytotoxic to both cell lines, macrophages being more sensitive. De novo synthesis of glutathione plays an important role in protecting macrophages from Pb²⁺ intoxication, which might also be closely involved in the induction of nitric oxide after Pb²⁺ exposure. Stimulatory effects on cell proliferation were noticed at noncytotoxic Pb²⁺ concentrations as well. Exposure to Pb²⁺ could also affect the inflammatory status by inhibiting the pro‐inflammatory interferon (IFN)‐γ while promoting the production of anti‐inflammatory type I IFNs in both macrophages and B‐cells, and increasing intracellular IgM levels in B‐cells. These results suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of Pb²⁺ in birds are probably closely associated with disruption of immune cell proliferation and cytokine production, potentially causing disorders of the avian immune system.

Adopting a plant-based diet (PBD) and lifestyle is healthy, sustainable, and increasingly popular, while also demanding. Individuals might face challenges to maintain this lifestyle. We aimed to determine the anthropometric values and lifestyle factors and motives of adults to adopt a whole-food, plant-based (WFPB) lifestyle by joining our ongoing, community-based, WFPB lifestyle program 0.5–10 years ago. Methods. We measured body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage status (BF%) using bioimpedance. Lifestyle status was obtained by standardized electronic questionnaires. For evaluating the motives for following strict PBD, the participants were asked to rank 8 different motives (i.e., 8: the most-, 1: the least important). Setting. A cross-sectional study in Slovenia. Participants. A total of 151 healthy adults with an average age of 39.6 years (SD: 12.5 years). Results. The participants had an average BMI of 23.9 kg/m² (SD: 3.8 kg/m²) and an average BF% of 22.3% (SD: 7.3%), were physically very active, with an average Long International Physical Activity Questionnaire (L-IPAQ) score of 5541.2 metabolic equivalents (METs) min/week (SD: 4677.0 METs min/week), having good sleep quality, with an average Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 2.7 (SD: 1.8), perceiving low stress, and with an average Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) score of 0.29 (SD: 0.1). We discovered no significant differences in lifestyle between participants who were involved in our WFPB lifestyle program for short, medium, or long periods of time. The motives for WFPB lifestyle included health benefits (score: 7.9/8), body mass management (6.3), eating to satiety (4.9), convenience (4.3), environmental concerns (4.1), affordability (3.7), animal ethics (3.6), and religious reasons (1.1). Conclusion. A WFPB lifestyle program for any length of time that includes an extensive support system provides favorable, long-term lifestyle changes.  aPublisher supplied data  cJavna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS 3aaffordability 3aanimal ethics 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3abody weight 3across-sectional studies 3alifestyle 3ametabolism 3aphysical activity 3aplant-based diet 3aquestionnaires 3asatiety 3asleep 3aSlovenia1 aJakše, Barbara1 aPinter, Stanislav1 aPajek, Jernej1 aMis, Nataša Fidler1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3199-04840 tJournal of nutrition and metabolism.g2020 Aug. 1, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:21568x2090-07327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/69505303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245013600206300001600342520113100358592002801489650001501517650001301532650002101545650001701566650002001583653003701603653002201640653002801662653003301690773008901723856008501812852000901897655001201906IND60607797820221121105531.0180830e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060779782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeh, Naichia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5079-323510aIllumination uniformity issue explored via two-stage solar concentrator system based on Fresnel lens and compound flat concentrator  ap. 542-549.  aThis paper illustrates details about the solar radiation distribution on the target of a two-stage solar concentrator that combines the Fresnel lens (FL) and the compound flat concentrator (CFC). The paper starts with a review of some FL development milestones such as the two-stage systems and the comparisons of flat vs. curved lenses in addition to the most noteworthy FL-based solar energy application, concentration photovoltaic (CPV). Through the review of the FL based CPV and two-stage concentrators, this study leads to the development of an algorithm to explore the spectrum distribution insight on the receiver of a two-stage (FL plus CFC) solar concentration system. It established the potential for using a correctly positioned 2nd stage reflector of right dimension to selectively redirect the desired spectrum on the target area so as to enhance the concentration flux intensity and uniformity at the same time. The study also helped to chart out the approximate locations of certain spectrum segments on the FL's target area, which is useful for exploring the spectrum control mechanism via the Fresnel lenses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3alighting 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 0aCompound flat concentrator (CFC) 0aFresnel lens (FL) 0aIllumination uniformity 0aTwo-stage solar concentrator0 tEnergy.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 95 p.542-549dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010200171300001800273520115800291592002801449650001501477650001301492650002001505700001801525700001901543700005601562700001901618773011301637856008401750852000901834655001201843IND60697194320221121052311.0200602e20200511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069719432DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c004862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyeong Wook10aMolecular Ordering Behavior of Lyotropic Chromonic Liquid Crystals on a Polyimide Alignment Layer  ap. 5778-5786.  aCoating-type polarizing films with a high dichroic ratio (DR) and polarization efficiency in the visible region were fabricated using a solution of ternary lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs). Optical characteristics of these anisotropic LCLC polarizing films were then determined. DR increased with increasing LCLC concentrations. Molecular ordering of these LCLCs on a rubbed polyimide (PI) layer increased because LCLC molecules’ orientation was enhanced by the dielectric anisotropy effect from rubbing the surface of the PI. In addition, this study demonstrated how the interaction between liquid crystal aggregates and the PI surface with different LCLC solutions correlated with LCLC molecular orientations on the PI which is significantly dependent on whether the coating direction of the LCLC solution was parallel or perpendicular to the PI rubbing direction. It was found that the ordering direction at high LCLC concentrations was determined by shearing direction of the LCLC solution coating, whereas the ordering direction at low LCLC concentrations was governed by the dielectric anisotropy effect from the PI rubbing direction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acoatings 3aliquid crystals1 aWon, Sang Hee1 aKuzmin, Valery1 aKim, Bo Sung1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0227-19231 aShin, Sung Tae0 tLangmuir.g2020 May 11, v. 36, no. 21 p.5778-5786dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c004863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002300192245010900215300001600324506007600340520129400416592002801710506003701738650003001775650001901805650002001824650002501844650004301869650001301912650002201925650001401947650001901961650002401980650001202004650002502016700002002041700002402061700002402085700002002109700002102129700002002150700001802170700002502188700002102213700002402234773009902258856008502357852000902442655001202451IND60562068120221207094307.0170125e20170217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056206812DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2017.12651312doi7 aPMC55871272pmcid7 a280945992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkender, Stephanie10aPlasma 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 Levels in Colorectal Cancer Patients and Associations with Physical Activity  ap. 229-237.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhysical activity (PA) and vitamin D are thought to affect colorectal cancer prognosis. The present study investigates associations between 25(OH)D ₃ and PA in prospectively followed colorectal cancer patients in the ColoCare study. At 6, 12, and 24 mo after surgery, patients donated a blood sample, wore an accelerometer for 10 consecutive days, and completed a PA questionnaire. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D ₃ (25(OH)D ₃) levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. We tested associations using partial correlations and multivariate linear regression analysis, adjusted for season, age, and body mass index. A total of 137 assessments of 25(OH)D ₃ levels and PA were conducted (58 at 6 mo, 51 at 12 mo, and 28 at 24 mo). More than 60% of the patients were vitamin D-deficient (25(OH)D ₃ ≤20 ng/ml), independent of study time point. At 6-mo follow-up, accelerometry-based vigorous and moderate-to-vigorous PAs were positively associated with 25(OH)D ₃ levels (P = 0.04; P = 0.006,). PA together with season was a significant predictor of elevated 25(OH)D ₃ levels. Our results suggest that the majority of colorectal cancer patients may suffer from vitamin D deficiency. Engaging in PA may be an effective approach to increase their 25(OH)D ₃ levels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3ablood sampling 3abody mass index 3acolorectal neoplasms 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apatients 3aphysical activity 3aprognosis 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asurgery 3avitamin D deficiency1 aBöhm, Jürgen,1 aSchrotz-King, Petra1 aChang-Claude, Jenny1 aSiegel, Erin M.1 aSteindorf, Karen1 aOwen, Robert W.1 aOse, Jennifer1 aHoffmeister, Michael1 aBrenner, Hermann1 aUlrich, Cornelia M.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2017 Feb. 17, v. 69, no. 2 p.229-237dTaylor & Francisx1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2017.12651313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006200142245012700204520176000331592002802091650001302119650000902132650001602141650001002157650002002167650001202187650002602199650002302225650002102248650001102269650001202280650001902292650002202311650001502333651001302348700002002361700002002381773010802401856007602509852000902585655001202594IND60706945620221119085946.0200811e20200730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070694562DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/70652382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaymale, Humuri K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6301-531X10aEstimating Conveyance Efficiency and Maize Productivity of Traditional Irrigation Systems in Usa River Catchment, Tanzania  aEstimating the conveyance efficiency of traditional irrigation schemes systems is very important. It is because of understanding the volume of water lost along with the transportation facility, enhancing water usage and productivity, hence making better decisions about the utilization of water resources. The objective of the study was to determine water abstraction permit compliances and estimate conveyance efficiency and crop and water productivity of traditional irrigation systems in northern Tanzania. The task involved measurement of irrigation water flows to determine the amount of water abstraction, inflow (head) and outflow (tail) between the canals to determine the conveyance efficiency of the main, secondary, and tertiary canals of the traditional irrigation systems. Moreover, water and yield obtained at the farm level were determined. Results indicate that approximately 72% of water transported reaches the destined farm which produced maize (Zea mays L) yields of 1054.5 kg/ha, 892.4 kg/ha, and 875.156 kg/ha at downstream, midstream, and upstream which equals 0.41 kg/m3, 0.15 kg/m3, and 0.09 kg/m3, respectively, while about 28% of water is lost along the canals through evaporation, seepage, and deep percolation and overtopping. Consequently, water measured at furrow intakes in total was 3,500 L/s, equal to 23% more than the permitted amount of 2856.14 L/s at Usa River Catchment. Interventions to minimize water losses starting at the furrow’s intakes are urgently required in the current trend of the increasing demand for water resources for food production and schemes performance. Subsequently, more effective conveyance technologies and water management strategies other than canal lining are required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aevaporation 3afarms 3afood production 3afurrows 3airrigation management 3airrigation systems 3airrigation water 3arivers 3aseepage 3atransportation 3awater utilization 3awatersheds 3aTanzania1 aNjau, Karoli N.1 aKahimba, F.

The currently marketed formulation of CTX contains high concentrations of surfactant and ethanol, which causes severe hypersensitivity reactions in patients. To deal with aforementioned side effects, our previous study attempted to develop the prodrugs of CTX with dextran. Here our approach differs through synthesizing folate containing prodrug and also investigating cytotoxicity and pharmacokinetics parameters obtained with dextran and dextran-folate nanoconjugates versus free CTX. MCF-7 with medium folate receptor expression and MDA-MB-231 as high folate receptor expression cell lines were selected for cytotoxicity assay. Pharmacokinetics properties were studied by injecting prodrugs and CTX to Wistar rats, analyzing serum and selected tissue samples and the obtained results were sibjected to data modeling study. The size of synthesized prodrugs was mostly less than 90 nm. Folate conjugates provided higher toxicity in comparison with dextran conjugates on both cell lines. In vivo non-compartmental pharmacokinetics analysis revealed enhanced area under the curve (about 3–5 fold for different samples) and longer half-life (approximately 1.3–1.8 fold higher) which led to increased serum residence time of prodrugs in comparison to free CTX. Tissue accumulation data showed that liver was the major organ with high accumulation of CTX. The accumulation of folate conjugates was remarkably higher than dextran samples (p < 0.05 in samples of 2, 10 and 24 h). Data modeling by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster models showed a significant difference between pharmacokinetics properties of CTX and prodrugs. In summary, prodrugs seem to be proper and promising CTX delivery systems as substitution for the current market formulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3ablood serum 3acytotoxicity 3adextran 3aethanol 3afolate receptors 3afolic acid 3ahalf life 3ahypersensitivity 3aliver 3amarkets 3apharmacokinetics 3aprincipal component analysis 3asurfactants 3ataxanes 3atoxicity testing 3awater solubility 0aBiodistribution 0aCabazitaxel 0aConjugate 0aDextran/ dextran- folate Prodrug 0aHierarchical Cluster model1 aSamani, Soliman Mohammadi1 aSakhteman, Amirhossein1 aDaneshamouz, Saeid1 aParhizkar, Golnaz1 aAhmadi, Fatemeh0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Jan., v. 209 p.112187-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1121873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245012600183300002000309520179000329592002802119650002302147650002502170650003502195650001502230650001502245650001702260650002802277650004102305650001502346650001102361650001302372700002602385700001802411700006002429700006002489700002002549700005602569773013102625856008502756852000902841655001202850IND60759235320221119112431.0211207e20211118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075923532DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c032752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWickramasinghe, Raveendra C.10aFemtosecond Laser Desorption Postionization MS vs ToF-SIMS Imaging for Uncovering Biomarkers Buried in Geological Samples  ap. 15949-15957.  aThe study of lipid molecular fossils by traditional biomarker analysis requires bulk sample crushing, followed by solvent extraction, and then the analysis of the extract by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). This traditional analysis mixes all organic compounds in the sample regardless of their origins, with a loss of information on the spatial distribution of organic molecules within the sample. These shortcomings can be overcome using the chemical mapping of intact samples. Spectroscopic techniques such as UV fluorescence or Raman spectroscopy, laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) are among those elemental and molecular mapping techniques. This study employed femtosecond (fs) laser ablation combined with single-photon ionization, a method called fs-laser desorption postionization mass spectrometry (fs-LDPI-MS). A pulsed ∼75 fs, 800 nm laser was used to ablate the geological sample, which was then photoionized after a few microseconds by a pulsed 7.9 eV vacuum ultraviolet laser. An organic carbon-rich geological sample was used for this study to map hydrocarbon biomarkers in sediments that were previously studied by GC–MS. The petrography of this sample was examined by optical and fluorescence microscopy. It is demonstrated here that fs-LDPI-MS combined with petrography for multimodal imaging can expose buried compounds within the sample via in situ layer removal. When used in conjunction with traditional organic geochemical analysis, this method has the potential to determine the spatial distribution of organic biomarkers in geological material. Finally, fs-LDPI-MS imaging data are compared with ToF-SIMS imaging that is commonly used for such studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aanalytical chemistry 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abiomarkers 3adesorption 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aionization 3alipids 3asolvents1 aPasterski, Michael J.1 aKenig, Fabien1 aIevlev, Anton V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3645-05081 aLorenz, Matthias1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0867-85481 aGross, Jason M.1 aHanley, Luke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7856-18690 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Nov. 18, v. 93, no. 48 p.15949-15957dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c032753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245006700199520184800266592002802114650001402142650001202156650001802168650002802186650001902214650001402233650001802247650001602265650001102281650001002292650002002302650002302322650001402345650001302359650000902372650002602381650001402407650001302421650001402434651001302448700002102461700001902482700002102501700002002522773009002542856007602632852000902708655001202717IND60706945720221119090039.0200811e20200727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070694572DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/81742402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpallone, Amy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7513-652214aThe Burden of Neurocysticercosis at a Single New York Hospital  aNeurocysticercosis (NCC), a disease caused by the larval pork tapeworm Taenia solium, has emerged as an important infection in the United States. In this study, we describe the spectrum of NCC infection in eastern Long Island, where there is a growing population of immigrants from endemic countries. A retrospective study was designed to identify patients diagnosed with NCC using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes in the electronic medical records at Stony Brook University Hospital between 2005 and 2016. We identified 52 patients (56% male, median age: 35 years) diagnosed with NCC in the only tertiary medical center in Suffolk County. Twenty-five cases were reported in the last three years of the study. Forty-eight (94%) patients self-identified as Hispanic or Latino in the electronic medical record. Twenty-two (44%) and 28 (56%) patients had parenchymal and extraparenchymal lesions, respectively. Nineteen (41.3%) patients presented with seizures to the emergency department. Six patients (11.7%) had hydrocephalus, and five of them required frequent hospitalizations and neurosurgical interventions, including permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunts or temporary external ventricular drains. No deaths were reported. The minimum accumulated estimated cost of NCC hospitalizations during the study period for all patients was approximately 1.4 million United States dollars (USD). In conclusion, NCC predominantly affects young, Hispanic immigrants in Eastern Long Island, particularly in zip codes correlating to predominantly Hispanic communities. The number of cases diagnosed increased at an alarming rate during the study period. Our study suggests a growing need for screening high-risk patients and connecting patients to care in hopes of providing early intervention and treatment to avoid potentially detrimental neurological sequelae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHispanics 3aLatinos 3aTaenia solium 3acomplications (disease) 3acost estimates 3ahospitals 3ahydrocephalus 3aimmigration 3alarvae 3amales 3amedical records 3aneurocysticercosis 3apathogens 3apatients 3apork 3aretrospective studies 3ascreening 3aseizures 3atapeworms 3aNew York1 aWoroch, Luboslav1 aSweeney, Keith1 aSeidman, Roberta1 aMarcos, Luis A.0 tJournal of pathogens.g2020 July 27, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:21571x2090-30657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/81742403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009800169520185300267592002802120650001602148650002302164650002202187650001602209650001102225650001502236650001202251650002202263653003102285653002602316653001802342653001602360653001802376653002302394700001602417700001502433700001902448700001502467700001802482773012502500856008502625852000902710655001202719IND60758857220221119160828.0220307e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075885722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2021.1066022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shenying10aSimulation and parameter optimisation of pickup device for full-feed peanut combine harvester  aTo reduce the pickup and pod drop losses of peanut picking combine harvesters, and to improve the quality of pickup work, a peanut pickup device is designed and a kinematics simulation analysis is conducted using ADAMS software in this study. According to the simulation analysis of the different ratio (λ) of the rotary linear speed of the spring-finger end to the forward speed of the harvester, the motion trajectory diagram of the spring-finger end was obtained, and the reasonable value range for λ was λ > 1. Through the simulation analysis of the missed pickup zone for different spring-finger rows, six was determined as a reasonable number of spring-finger rows. On this basis, the multi-index field orthogonal tests were performed with the pickup and pod drop rate as the performance indexes. The forward speed of the harvester, rotary angular speed of the spring-finger, and bend angle of the spring-fingertip were considered as the test factors. The test results showed that the pickup rate was positively correlated with the value of λ. When λ ≤ 1, the pickup rate was<95 %; when λ > 1, the pickup rate increased gradually with the increase in λ and tended to be constant, which is consistent with the simulation analysis results. There was no positive correlation between the pod drop rate and λ value. A comprehensive scoring method was employed to evaluate and analyse the two performance indexes to determine the optimal parameter combination: when the harvester's forward speed was 1.0 m/s, with a rotary angular speed of 4 rad/s, and spring-fingertip bend angle at 150°, the comprehensive pickup performance was optimum (with a comprehensive test score of 0.106). This study can provide relevant technical references for the research of both peanut pickup combine harvesters and rape and forage pickup devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3acombine harvesters 3acomputer software 3aelectronics 3aforage 3akinematics 3apeanuts 3asimulation models 0aFull-feed peanut harvester 0aKinematics simulation 0aPickup device 0aPickup rate 0aPod drop rate 0aMissed pickup zone1 aHu, Zhichao1 aYao, Lijun1 aPeng, Baoliang1 aWang, Bing1 aWang, Yongwei0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2022 Jan., v. 192 p.106602-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.1066023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245008900165520132100254592002801575650002301603650001301626650002801639650001401667650001901681650001301700650002101713650000901734653002401743653001801767653001801785653001301803653002001816700001401836700001701850700001501867700001401882700001801896700001801914700001701932773011701949856008602066852000902152655001202161IND60788691220221120182045.0220929e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078869122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1154912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yue13aAn anti-swelling, strong and flexible wood-based composite hydrogel as strain sensor  aGeneral flexible conductive hydrogels are excellent candidate as strain-sensor. However, they were usually suffered by high water-absorbing and low mechanical properties. Herein, by introducing delignified wood skeleton into polyacrylamide hydrogel, wood-based composite hydrogels (WCH) with low-swelling and high strength were successfully obtained. The fracture tensile strength of the WCH can reach as high as 19.8 MPa along the longitudinal direction of wood and 2.7 MPa along the transverse direction, which originated from the intrinsic structure of wood skeleton. After water-soaking, size and weight of the WCH increased by only 9 % and 42 %, much less than that of the pristine PAM hydrogel (70 % and 383 %). Based on finite element analysis, wood skeleton structure disperses the swelling stress, which was conducive to reduce the water-swelling of hydrogels. The WCH also showed high adhesion to polar substrates (28.55 kPa to paper) and repeatable adhesion properties. Moreover, the WCH sensors demonstrated stable strain sensitivity, which could monitor bending and pressing. The as-prepared WCH will be promising in broaden the application field of flexible conductive hydrogels as strain-sensors. This work also provides a simple method of balsa wood to new multi-functional and smart applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOchroma pyramidale 3aadhesion 3afinite element analysis 3ahydrogels 3apolyacrylamide 3askeleton 3atensile strength 3awood 0aWood-based hydrogel 0aAnti-swelling 0aHigh strength 0aAdhesion 0aFlexible sensor1 aPan, Nana1 aZhu, Minghao1 aTang, Miao1 aWu, Yakun1 aYou, Zhenping1 aZhou, Xiaoyan1 aChen, Minzhi0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 187 p.115491-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1154913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245018700168300001600355520164500371592002802016650002302044650002802067650001802095650001202113650002102125650001402146650001902160653001602179653002002195653001702215653001702232653001702249700002502266700002102291700002502312700003002337700002102367700002302388700006102411773012702472856008102599852000902680655001202689IND60683959320221122015228.0200214e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068395932DNAL7 a10.1017/S13689800190023502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMamalaki, Eirini10aSocial life characteristics in relation to adherence to the Mediterranean diet in older adults: findings from the Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD) study  ap. 439-445.  aThe present study aimed to explore the associations between social life and adherence to a healthy dietary pattern, the Mediterranean diet (MD), in a population-representative cohort of older people. Cross-sectional study. Adherence to the MD was evaluated by an a priori score; tertiles of the score, indicating low, medium and high adherence, were used in the analyses. Social life was assessed by a questionnaire evaluating participation in leisure-time activities and the number of social contacts; primary occupation was also recorded and job characteristics were further explored. Community-dwelling older adults. Adults from the Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD) study (n 1933; age range 65–99 years). Each unit increase in the number of social contacts/month and in the frequency score of intellectual, social and physical activities was associated with a 1·6, 6·8, 4·8 and 13·7 % increase in the likelihood of a participant being in the high MD adherence group, respectively. The analysis by age group revealed that younger elderly participants had a 1·4, 8·4 and 11·3 % higher likelihood to be in the high adherence group for each unit increase in the number of social contacts/month and in the frequency score of engagement in intellectual and physical activities, respectively. Similar associations were found for older elderly participants with high compared with low MD adherence, except for the intellectual activities. The present results suggest that high MD adherence is associated with good social life, suggesting a clustering of health-promoting lifestyle factors in older adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3across-sectional studies 3aeating habits 3aelderly 3ahealth promotion 3alifestyle 3aquestionnaires 0aSocial life 0aSocial contacts 0aLeisure time 0aDiet quality 0aOlder adults1 aAnastasiou, Costas A1 aKosmidis, Mary H1 aDardiotis, Efthimios1 aHadjigeorgiou, Georgios M1 aSakka, Paraskevi1 aScarmeas, Nikolaos1 aYannakoulia, Mary1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2171-73370 tPublic health nutrition.g2020 Feb., v. 23, no. 3 p.439-445dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800190023503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245009400164300001400258500002000272520181400292592002802106596004302134650002602177650001002203650001902213650002102232650002202253650001102275650002002286650001902306650001702325650001202342700002302354700006402377773012202441856008002563852000902643655001202652IND60760143820221120092826.0211218e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076014382DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.134572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, Aparna10aEvaluating the role of reference‐genome phylogenetic distance on evolutionary inference  ap. 45-55.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhen a high‐quality genome assembly of a target species is unavailable, an option to avoid the costly de novo assembly process is a mapping‐based assembly. However, mapping shotgun data to a distant relative may lead to biased or erroneous evolutionary inference. Here, we used short‐read data from a mammal (beluga whale) and a bird species (rowi kiwi) to evaluate whether reference genome phylogenetic distance can impact downstream demographic (Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent) and genetic diversity (heterozygosity, runs of homozygosity) analyses. We mapped to assemblies of species of varying phylogenetic distance (from conspecific to genome‐wide divergence of >7%), and de novo assemblies created using cross‐species scaffolding. We show that while reference genome phylogenetic distance has an impact on demographic analyses, it is not pronounced until using a reference genome with >3% divergence from the target species. When mapping to cross‐species scaffolded assemblies, we are unable to replicate the original beluga demographic results, but are able with the rowi kiwi, presumably reflecting the more fragmented nature of the beluga assemblies. We find that increased phylogenetic distance has a pronounced impact on genetic diversity estimates; heterozygosity estimates deviate incrementally with increasing phylogenetic distance. Moreover, runs of homozygosity are largely undetectable when mapping to any nonconspecific assembly. However, these biases can be reduced when mapping to a cross‐species scaffolded assembly. Taken together, our results show that caution should be exercised when selecting reference genomes. Cross‐species scaffolding may offer a way to avoid a costly, traditional de novo assembly, while still producing robust, evolutionary inference.  aPublisher supplied data  a8021‐00218BcDet Frie Forskningsråd 3aDelphinapterus leucas 3abirds 3aconspecificity 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenome assembly 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3amammals1 aLorenzen, Eline D.1 aWestbury, Michael V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0478-39300 tMolecular ecology resources.g2022 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.45-55dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.134573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03652naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003300117024003600150040001800186100001400204245004900218506007600267506003100343506002800374506007200402520170500474592002802179596003602207596002402243596000802267596000802275596000902283506003702292650001202329650002102341650001702362650001202379650001302391650001202404650002602416650001802442650001602460650002102476650001502497650001102512650001102523650001502534650001502549650001602564650001702580700002602597700002502623700002302648700002402671773011902695856011402814856008002928961000903008852000903017655001203026IND60734465820221215142551.0220901e20171003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073446582DNAL7 a10113/73446582hdl7 a10.1073/pnas.17123811142doi7 a10.1073/pnas.17123811142chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Ying10aHydrologic regulation of plant rooting depth  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aResource is Open Access  aProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences License Information  aPlant rooting depth affects ecosystem resilience to environmental stress such as drought. Deep roots connect deep soil/groundwater to the atmosphere, thus influencing the hydrologic cycle and climate. Deep roots enhance bedrock weathering, thus regulating the long-term carbon cycle. However, we know little about how deep roots go and why. Here, we present a global synthesis of 2,200 root observations of >1,000 species along biotic (life form, genus) and abiotic (precipitation, soil, drainage) gradients. Results reveal strong sensitivities of rooting depth to local soil water profiles determined by precipitation infiltration depth from the top (reflecting climate and soil), and groundwater table depth from below (reflecting topography-driven land drainage). In well-drained uplands, rooting depth follows infiltration depth; in waterlogged lowlands, roots stay shallow, avoiding oxygen stress below the water table; in between, high productivity and drought can send roots many meters down to the groundwater capillary fringe. This framework explains the contrasting rooting depths observed under the same climate for the same species but at distinct topographic positions. We assess the global significance of these hydrologic mechanisms by estimating root water-uptake depths using an inverse model, based on observed productivity and atmosphere, at 30″ (∼1-km) global grids to capture the topography critical to soil hydrology. The resulting patterns of plant rooting depth bear a strong topographic and hydrologic signature at landscape to global scales. They underscore a fundamental plant–water feedback pathway that may be critical to understanding plant-mediated global change.  aPublisher supplied data  cEnvironmental Protection Agency  cEuropean Commission  cNSF  cNSF  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abedrock 3acapillary fringe 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate 3adrainage 3adrought 3aecological resilience 3aglobal change 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic cycle 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aoxygen 3asoil water 3atopography 3awater table 3awater uptake1 aMiguez-Macho, Gonzalo1 aJobbágy, Esteban G.1 aJackson, Robert B.1 aOtero-Casal, Carlos0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.dProceedings of the National Academy of Sciencesx1091-64907nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73446583Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.17123811143Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245011600164520147200280592002801752650002201780650001801802650002101820650002001841650001201861650003501873650002401908650001501932650004301947650001901990650001502009650002702024651001202051700005802063700002302121700001902144773011702163856007602280852000902356655001202365IND60706945920221119085919.0200811e20200727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070694592DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/87398642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbinne, Elijah S.10aAssessing the Health of Akamkpa Forest Reserves in Southeastern Part of Nigeria Using Remote Sensing Techniques  aAssessment of forest health is very vital because forests form the largest terrestrial ecosystems on earth. The greenness of vegetation is one of the essential factors used in evaluating the health of forest reserves. This study is aimed at assessing the health of fifteen forest reserves in Southeastern part of Nigeria using meteorological data and MOD13A1-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Related portions of the monthly MOD13A1 data, derived for the years 2010, 2014, and 2018, were downloaded, and the monthly mean values of the vegetation indices (NDVI and EVI) were estimated for each of the forest reserves using the Spatial Analysis Module in ArcGIS software. The computed monthly mean values of NDVI range from 0.094 to 0.790 while that of EVI ranges from 0.11 to 0.624 and the rainfall data range from 0 to 780.2 mm/month within the period of study. Analyses of the correlation coefficients between monthly rainfall data and NDVI, monthly rainfall data and EVI, and that of NDVI and EVI range from −0.827 to 0.584; −0.715 to 0.914, and 0.598 to 0.980. The obtained results indicate that some of the forest reserves are moderately healthy while some areas are under great stress. We can conclude that satellite remote sensing is a veritable tool in the assessment, management, and monitoring of forest health especially where there is little or no terrestrially acquired forest inventory data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aforest health 3aforest inventory 3aforest reserves 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3ameteorological data 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3aNigeria1 aApeh, Ojima I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5815-42621 aNdukwu, Raphael I.1 aAbah, Edebo J.0 tInternational journal of forestry research.g2020 July 27, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:J000000092x1687-93767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/87398643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010300167520114300270592002801413650001301441650001601454650002801470650001301498650001901511650001601530650001201546653001401558653002201572653002301594653002801617653002501645700001801670700002201688773012501710856008501835852000901920655001201929IND60758857420221119160951.0220307e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075885742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2021.1066042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadjur, Hugo10aToward an intelligent and efficient beehive: A survey of precision beekeeping systems and services  aSince the end of the 20th century, bees are suffering from increasing stress factors, leading domesticated colonies to die or at least be less productive. Precision beekeeping (PB) is an emerging field of agriculture that aims at protecting bees, supporting beekeepers, and optimizing apiary production thanks to digital infrastructures. The digitalization of apiculture first involves systems from the field of the Internet of Things (IoT), with the development of sensors to collect and transfer bee-related data. Then, data analysis comes into play, providing models that connect the data with the biological states of beehives, sometimes thanks to artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, we describe the recent advances in precision beekeeping as systems and as services. Different types of sensors, networks, and power sources in PB are covered. The collection and use of data are described, and the performances of PB services are assessed. We also estimate the sustainability of the proposed solutions, taking into account their scalability, efficiency, and economic cost, because beekeepers need deployable research results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aagriculture 3aartificial intelligence 3abeehives 3aeconomic costs 3aelectronics 3asurveys 0aHoney bee 0aSmart Agriculture 0aInternet of Things 0aArtificial Intelligence 0aPrecision Beekeeping1 aAmmar, Doreid1 aLefevre, Laurent,0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2022 Jan., v. 192 p.106604-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.1066043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013800166520153300304592002801837650001501865650001501880650001201895650001101907650001801918650002201936650002301958650001601981650003001997650001302027650001102040650001002051650001302061650002302074650001402097650002202111650001702133650002702150650002502177650001002202653001502212653001702227653001202244653002102256653001902277700001702296700001702313700001802330700001202348700001202360700001802372700001902390700002102409700001902430773011702449856008602566852000902652655001202661IND60788691320221120182112.0220929e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078869132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1154932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuo10aFacile ultrasonic-assisted one-step preparation of sugarcane bagasse carbon sorbent for bio-based odor removal cat litter formulation  aTo reduce the cost of adsorbents for the removal of cat urine odor there has been concerted research efforts to produce functionalized porous carbon from waste biomass. In this work, a cost-effective and environmentally friendly method was used to prepare a carbon adsorbent (AC-SNP) from sugarcane bagasse through ultrasonic-assisted impregnation of mixed HNO₃/H₃PO₄ on bagasse prior to carbonization. Ultrasonication enhanced structural deformation of bagasse and enriched the N and O-containing groups prior to cabonization which allowed the final carbon material to have increased specific surface area of 1603.1 m²/g and porosity of 1.3858 cm³·g⁻¹ (including micro- and meso-pores), and increased surface functionality of -COOH, -OH, pyrrolic N, and pyridinic N groups. The adsorption capacity of the carbon material for 3-mercapto-3-methyl-1-butanol (MMB), a volatile cat urine component, was up to 207.12 mg/g at 25 °C, and the heterogenous multi-layer Freundlich model and Pseudo-second-order model were used to explain the adsorption mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that there are electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding between the O- and N-containing groups and MMB molecules. AC-SNP was found to be nontoxic in a cat litter formulation, and removes 99.87% volatile MMB at a low loading ratio of 2 wt%. The fabricated sugarcane bagasse-based cat litter (SB_CL) formulation also has anti-bacterial properties, and so has significant commercialization prospects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3acommercialization 3acost effectiveness 3adeformation 3adensity functional theory 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3aodors 3aporosity 3asorption isotherms 3asugarcane 3asugarcane bagasse 3asurface area 3asustainable technology 3aultrasonic treatment 3aurine 0aCat litter 0aOdor removal 0aBagasse 0aActivated carbon 0aDFT simulation1 aXie, Caifeng1 aWang, Shupei1 aHang, Fangxue1 aLi, Wen1 aLi, Kai1 aMann, Anthony1 aSarina, Sarina1 aDoherty, William1 aShi, Changrong0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 187 p.115493-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1154933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245013500208300001600343500001900359520171300378592002802091596005002119596004502169650001502214650001202229650002102241650001402262650002602276650001502302650001602317700002602333700001702359773011402376856008202490852000902572655001202581IND60716615420221123030342.0201106e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071661542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-020-04783-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwanz, Lisa E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5864-711210aContext dependence of transgenerational plasticity: the influence of parental temperature depends on offspring environment and sex  ap. 391-401.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnder environmental change, the relationship between phenotype and fitness can change rapidly, leaving populations vulnerable. Plasticity within and between generations could provide the fastest mitigation to environmental change. However, plasticity may depend on interactions among parental environment, offspring environment and offspring sex, and we know little of how these interactions manifest. We examine the importance of parental and offspring thermal environment in the context of a terrestrial ectotherm (the jacky lizard, Amphibolurus muricatus), where the thermal environment depends on complex thermoregulatory behaviours. By manipulating both parental and offspring thermoregulatory (basking) opportunities in a full factorial design, we found that transgenerational plasticity was highly context dependent. Overall, longer parental thermoregulatory opportunities led to increased growth in offspring, providing a clear fitness benefit to daughters but inducing a cost of increased oxidative stress in sons. Daughters, but not sons, received the greatest advantage when their thermal environment matched that of their parents. The offspring thermal environment had little independent effect on offspring phenotype. Together, the results suggest that both directional selection on offspring size (leading to growth being dependent on thermal conditions) and selection for anticipatory parental effects operate, but with a different balance in males and females. More broadly, restrictions in thermoregulatory opportunities under climatic warming will have negative consequences both within and between generations, but the exact nature will depend on the evolved functional form of plasticity.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE120101446cAustralian Research Council (AU)  aDP150100676cAustralian Research Council 3aectothermy 3alizards 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aplasticity 3atemperature1 aCrawford-Ash, Jordann1 aGale, Teagan0 tOecologia.g2020 Nov., v. 194, no. 3 p.391-401dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04783-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002200135245010100157300001500258500001900273520174800292592002802040650001302068650002502081650001702106650001502123650001102138650001902149650001402168651000902182700002102191700002502212773015202237856006902389856010402458990002302562852000902585655001202594IND60732310420221119025443.0210326e20210130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073231042DNAL7 a10.3791/619022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerrin, Louisiane10aTime-resolved fluorescence imaging and analysis of cancer cell invasion in the 3d spheroid model  ap. e61902.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe invasion of cancer cells from the primary tumor into the adjacent healthy tissues is an early step in metastasis. Invasive cancer cells pose a major clinical challenge because no efficient method exist for their elimination once their dissemination is underway. A better understanding of the mechanisms regulating cancer cell invasion may lead to the development of novel potent therapies. Due to their physiological resemblance to tumors, spheroids embedded in collagen I have been extensively utilized by researchers to study the mechanisms governing cancer cell invasion into the extracellular matrix (ECM). However, this assay is limited by (1) a lack of control over the embedding of spheroids into the ECM; (2) high cost of collagen I and glass bottom dishes, (3) unreliable immunofluorescent labeling, due to the inefficient penetration of antibodies and fluorescent dyes and (4) time-consuming image processing and quantification of the data. To address these challenges, we optimized the three-dimensional (3D) spheroid protocol to image fluorescently labeled cancer cells embedded in collagen I, either using time-lapse videos or longitudinal imaging, and analyze cancer cell invasion. First, we describe the fabrication of a spheroid imaging device (SID) to embed spheroids reliably and in a minimal collagen I volume, reducing the assay cost. Next, we delineate the steps for robust fluorescence labeling of live and fixed spheroids. Finally, we offer an easy-to-use Fiji macro for image processing and data quantification. Altogether, this simple methodology provides a reliable and affordable platform to monitor cancer cell invasion in collagen I. Furthermore, this protocol can be easily modified to fit the users’ needs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollagen 3aextracellular matrix 3afluorescence 3ametastasis 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aFiji1 aTucker, Theodore1 aGligorijevic, Bojana0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2021 Jan. 30, , no. 167 p.e61902-e61902dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/619023Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/61902/time-resolved-fluorescence-imaging-analysis-cancer-cell-invasion-3d  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01766naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024002800113040001800141100002000159245007600179300001600255500001500271520050800286592002800794650001900822650001000841650001400851650001900865650001600884650002000900650001000920650002700930650002200957650001400979653001600993653001701009700002201026773008601048856011201134856007601246961001301322852000901335655001201344IND4362668920221118112806.0151127e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436266892DNAL7 a10113/145122hdl7 a10.1614/WT-03-108R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFORCELLA, FRANK10aMethods in Weed Ecology: Glue Retains Seeds in Shatter-Prone Seedheads1  ap. 183-185.  a2019-12-04  aThe difficulty of measuring fecundity of weeds with shatter-prone seeds can be overcome by postanthesis application of nontoxic glues to seedheads.

Mineral N availability results from two opposing processes, 1) gross mineral N production (gross ammonification/gross nitrification) and 2) microbial N immobilization. These processes can be influenced by the availability of plant-derived C (PDC) inputs to the microbes, SOM-N pool size, and the size of the microbial community (microbial biomass). We considered how changes in PDC inputs and SOM-N pool size together may alter microbial biomass, mineral N availability, and feedbacks on plant productivity. In areas dominated by one of six tallgrass prairie species along a natural gradient of PDC inputs and SOM-N pool size, we conducted a field survey of microbial biomass and gross ammonification. We also performed greenhouse manipulations of SOM-N pool size and PDC inputs on two species in our study area (Poa pratensis and Schizachyrium scoparium). Structural equation modeling of the field data showed that gross ammonification was both positively and directly related to microbial biomass and SOM-N pool size. Gross ammonification was positively and indirectly related to SOM-N pool size and belowground PDC inputs, via microbial biomass. In the short-term greenhouse study, PDC inputs and SOM-N pool size positively affected gross mineral N production, although only at high SOM-N pool size. If the patterns in the greenhouse can be applied to field conditions, this suggests that SOM-N pool size may constrain plant driven feedbacks on plant productivity by limiting gross mineral N production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoa pratensis 3aSchizachyrium scoparium 3aammonification 3agreenhouses 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aplants (botany) 3aprairies 3asoil organic matter 3asurveys1 aKnops, Johannes M.H.1 aBrassil, Chad0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2012 Oct., v. 53 p.1-8dElsevier Ltdx0038-07177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.04.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01657naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245007500165300001600240520077400256592002801030650001901058650001001077650001001087650000901097651001801106651002301124773013401147856007701281852000901358655001201367IND60760486220221122032323.0211222e20211126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076048622DNAL7 a10.1656/045.028.04082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Roo, Brandi L.10aParasitic Egg Ejection by Vireo gilvus (Warbling Vireo) in New England  ap. 511-514.  aVireo gilvus (Warbling Vireo) is the smallest bird species in North America known to eject Molothrus ater (Brown-headed Cowbird) eggs from their nests. Populations eject parasitic eggs in central North America and the Great Lakes region but not in western North America. The geographic differences in behavior may reflect the range distributions of 2 subspecies. However, experimental studies of egg ejection in eastern populations are currently lacking. To address this gap, I experimentally parasitized 3 Warbling Vireo nests in Massachusetts using real and model cowbird eggs. At all 3 nests, Warbling Vireos ejected the parasitic egg.

A key uncertainty surrounding the risk assessment of AgNPs is whether their effects are driven through the same mechanism of action that underlies the toxic effects of Ag ions. We present the first full transcriptome study of the effects of Ag ions and NPs in an ecotoxicological model soil invertebrate, the earthworm Eisenia fetida. Gene expression analyses indicated similar mechanisms for both silver forms with toxicity being exerted through pathways related to ribosome function, sugar and protein metabolism, molecular stress, disruption of energy production and histones. The main difference seen between Ag ions and NPs was associated with potential toxicokinetic effects related to cellular internalisation and communication, with pathways related to endocytosis and cilia being significantly enriched. These results point to a common final toxicodynamic response, but initial internalisation driven by different exposure routes and toxicokinetic mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEisenia fetida 3acilia 3aearthworms 3aecotoxicology 3aendocytosis 3aenergy 3aexposure pathways 3agene expression 3ahistones 3aions 3amechanism of action 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aprotein metabolism 3aribosomes 3arisk assessment 3asilver 3asoil 3asugars 3atoxicity 3atranscriptome 3auncertainty 0aSilver 0aNanoparticles 0aIons 0aSoil sentinel 0aCryptic lineage 0aToxicokinetics1 aLahive, Elma1 aDíez-Ortiz, María1 aMatzke, Marianne1 aMorgan, Andrew J.1 aSpurgeon, David J.1 aSvendsen, Claus1 aKille, Peter0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2015 Oct., v. 205 p.385-393dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2015.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002300188245013200211506010400343506007600447520118600523592002801709506003701737650001001774650000901784650001701793650000901810650001901819650001801838650001201856650001001868653007601878653002001954653002001974653001201994700002502006700002802031700006302059773008302122856008202205852000902287655001202296IND60684731320221215142339.0220914s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068473132DNAL7 a322113032pmid7 aPMC70826082pmcid7 a10.1016/j.mex.2020.1008142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanne, Nicholas J.12aA minimally invasive technique for serial intraosseous perfusion measurements in the murine tibia using laser Doppler flowmetry  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn biomedical and preclinical research, the current standard method for measuring blood perfusion inside murine bone, radiolabeled microspheres, is a terminal procedure that cannot be used to monitor longitudinal perfusion changes. Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) can assess perfusion within the proximal tibial metaphysis of mice in vivo but requires a surgical procedure to place the measurement probe directly onto the bone surface. Sustained inflammation for over a month following this technique was previously reported, and previous studies have used LDF as an endpoint-only procedure. We developed a modified, minimally invasive LDF procedure to measure intraosseous perfusion in the murine tibia without stimulating local or systemic inflammation or inducing gait abnormalities. This modified technique can be used to measure perfusion weekly for up to at least a month in the murine tibia.•Unlike previous endpoint-only techniques, this modified LDF procedure can be performed weekly to monitor serial changes to intraosseous perfusion in the murine tibia•The modified LDF technique utilizes a smaller, more localized incision to minimize invasiveness and speed recovery  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood 3agait 3ainflammation 3amice 3amicroparticles 3aradiolabeling 3asurgery 3atibia 0aSerial intraosseous perfusion measurements with laser Doppler flowmetry 0aBone blood flow 0aVascular supply 0aIn vivo1 aEaster, Elizabeth D.1 aStangeland-Molo, Sandra1 aCole, Jacqueline H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0233-94250 tMethodsX.g2020, v. 7 p.100814-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2020.1008143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245006700161300001600228520153400244592002801778650002401806650002301830650002201853650002101875650001001896650001101906650001501917650001301932650001701945650001401962650001401976650002101990651001102011700001902022700002002041700001902061773013402080856007702214852000902291655001202300IND60760486320221122032342.0211222e20211126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076048632DNAL7 a10.1656/045.028.04092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBélanger, Luc10aWhich Bird Species Groups Use Highway Roadside Verges and Why?  ap. 515-526.  aHighway roadside verges (HRV) provide supplemental habitat for birds in intensive agricultural and suburban landscapes where the natural habitats are rapidly disappearing. The purpose of this study was to document the behavior of breeding bird species using the vegetation maintenance units (green shoulders, embankments, ditches, and banks) of HRV in 3 typical rural landscapes of southern Quebec, Canada. We observed the behavior of 722 individuals of 21 bird species. The most abundant ones (especially Sturnus vulgaris [European Starling] and Agelaius phoeniceus [Red-winged Blackbird]) foraged in the green shoulders, while others (such as Melospiza melodia [Song Sparrow], Spinus tristis [American Goldfinch], and Geothlypis trichas [Common Yellowthroat]) travelled or nested in the low vegetation in ditches and on the banks. Omnivorous species forage in the green shoulders and used the banks and ditches mainly for nesting-related behaviors, just like the few insectivorous species observed. The granivorous species were almost absent from studied HRV. Ground-foraging species used the shoulders to feed but nested in ditches and banks. Species foraging in low vegetation foraged mainly on the banks and used the ditches more for travelling. Reducing the mowing frequency of these 2 maintenance units would likely result in an increase in the vegetation cover and would thus provide additional nesting and foraging habitat for the species we recorded, 67% of which show a stable or declining population in North America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgelaius phoeniceus 3aGeothlypis trichas 3aMelospiza melodia 3aSturnus vulgaris 3abirds 3aforage 3agranivores 3ahabitats 3ainsectivores 3aomnivores 3aroadsides 3avegetation cover 3aQuebec1 aJobin, Benoît1 aLacroix, Gaston1 aBédard, Yves,0 tNortheastern naturalist.g2021 Nov. 26, v. 28, no. 4 p.515-526dHumboldt Field Research InstitutewJournal:19634x1092-61947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.028.04093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008200170300001400252520093400266592002801200650001701228650001401245650001101259650001601270650000901286650001101295650001101306650001201317650003101329650001601360650001701376700001901393700002101412700001801433773008901451856008501540852000901625655001201634IND60114122120221118155009.0141112e20120106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011412212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2011.09.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumoto, Jun10aHeating bearing shoots near fruits promotes sugar accumulation in melon fruit  ap. 18-22.  aShoots near fruits of Cucumis melo L. were continuously heated at night to a minimum of 30°C from the fifth day after anthesis (DAA).

Heterotrophic sessile marine invertebrate communities are extremely diverse but traditionally, space was viewed as the sole limiting resource. Recently planktonic food was recognized as an additional limiting resource, but the degree to which planktonic food acts as a single resource or is utilized differentially remains unclear. In other words, whether planktonic food represents a single resource niche or multiple resource niches has not been established. We estimated the rate at which 11 species of marine invertebrates consumed three phytoplankton species, each different in shape and size. Rates of consumption varied by a 240-fold difference among the species considered and, while there was overlap in the consumer diets, we found evidence for differential resource usage (i.e. consumption rates of phytoplankton differed among consumers). No consumer ingested all phytoplankton species at equivalent rates, instead most species tended to consume one of the species much more than others. Our results suggest that utilization of the phytoplankton niche by filter feeders is more subdivided than previously thought, and resource specialization may facilitate coexistence in this system. Our results provide a putative mechanism for why diversity affects community function and invasion in a classic system for studying competition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic invertebrates 3adiet 3adieting 3afoods 3ainterspecific variation 3aniches 3aphytoplankton 3aprediction1 aÁlvarez-Noriega, Mariana1 aMarshall, Dustin0 tOecologia.g2020 Nov., v. 194, no. 3 p.505-513dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04791-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04673naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245012800211300001800339520253200357592002802889650002502917650002102942650002302963650002602986650002203012650001203034650001303046650001003059650002603069650002703095650002803122650002603150650002903176650002903205650001303234650001903247650001303266650001403279650000903293650002103302650001803323650000903341650001803350650001003368650001303378650001503391650003003406650001603436650003703452650001403489650001803503650001303521650001503534650004403549650001103593650001303604650001703617650003803634650002203672650002103694650001903715773013803734856008203872852000903954655001203963IND60663951820221121102251.0190910e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066395182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-019-00388-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Razek, Nashwa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8407-032910aAntimicrobial activities of chitosan nanoparticles against pathogenic microorganisms in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus  ap. 1315-1330.  aNanotechnology is a recent unique technique generally used for nutrition and therapy purposes among others. In this respect, the present study was carried out to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of chitosan nanoparticles (CNP) against various microorganisms (fungi and bacteria) isolated from diseased or health Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. The CNP was prepared based on the ionic gelation of chitosan with tripolyphosphate anion and its mean size was 35 nm with a narrow size distribution and zeta potential of 61.2 mV. The lethal dose of pathogenic bacterial isolates for Nile tilapia was successfully standardized. Clinical signs including weakness, slower movement, swimming closer to the surface, fin hemorrhages, and red patches at the gut regions were observed. Enlargement of spleen followed by tissue necrosis along with signs of hemorrhagic septicemia was also seen in infected fish. Fungal and bacterial isolates were exposed to different CNP doses and it is noticed that CNP inhibited all examined fungal and bacterial isolates in a dose-dependent manner. However, high CNP doses (80 μg/ml) gave highest inhibition zones where Aspergillus flavus, Mucor sp., and Candida sp. were more susceptible, whereas Aspergillus niger, A. fumigatus, and Fusarium sp. were more resistant. Similarly, largest inhibition zones of tested bacteria were obtained at high CNP dose (20 μg/ml). And Aeromonas sobria, A. hydrophila, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most susceptible bacterial strain; meanwhile, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas fluorescens were the most resistant ones. The minimal inhibitory concentration of CNP against the examined bacteria ranged from 0.156 to 2.5 μg/ml causing their minimal counts. The transmission electron microscope images revealed that CNP showed antagonistic action against A. hydrophila causing disruption of cell membranes and the leakage of cytoplasm. In a practical experiment, Nile tilapia fed dietary CNP at levels of 0.0 and 1.0 g/kg diet for 3 weeks and post-challenged with different pathogenic bacteria via intraperitoneal injection. It is noticed that fish fed a CNP-enriched diet showed less mortality with all bacterial strains (6.7–20%), while, fish fed a CNP-free diet showed highest mortality (66.7–100%). The dietary CNP protected Nile tilapia efficiently against A. hydrophila, A. sobria, and Streptococcus agalactiae infections with relative level of protection (RLP) value of 93.3%, while the RLP against Staphylococcus aureus was 70.0%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aAeromonas sobria 3aAspergillus flavus 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aAspergillus niger 3aCandida 3aFusarium 3aMucor 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3acell membranes 3achitosan 3acytoplasm 3adiet 3adigestive system 3adose response 3afish 3afish diseases 3afungi 3agelation 3ahemorrhage 3aintraperitoneal injection 3alethal dose 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amortality 3ananoparticles 3anecrosis 3asepticemia 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aspleen 3aswimming 3atherapeutics 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atripolyphosphates 3avirulent strains 3azeta potential0 tAquaculture international.g2019 Oct., v. 27, no. 5 p.1315-1330dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl57531x0967-61207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-019-00388-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03740naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245008100163300002000244520192200264592002802186596009802214596006602312596007802378650001302456650002702469650001002496650001202506650001902518650001202537650001902549650001502568650000902583650001202592650001302604650000902617650001802626653002602644653003702670653002602707653001802733653002702751653001902778700001502797700005302812700005802865700005602923773014302979856007903122852000903201655001203210IND60794823820221119002058.0220929e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079482382DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c087782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Haikang10aSand-Based Economical Micro/Nanocomposite Materials for Diverse Applications  ap. 43656-43665.  aSand is one of the most fundamental construction materials that is of significant importance and widely used for making concrete, plasters, and mortars, and also for filling under floor and basements. Sand-derived functional materials, for instance superhydrophobic sand, which can be used to prepare liquid marble, separate oil–water mixtures, and transport liquids, have recently been a highly topical and promising research field. However, such materials are mainly prepared using valuable surface modification agents via complicated procedures that are difficult for mass-production, which restricted their true applications. Here, we developed a simple, low-cost, and efficient method for the development of sand-based hierarchical micro/nanostructured composite materials with diverse applications. Briefly, micro/nanostructured superhydrophobic sand was synthesized by one-step in situ growth of a network layer of silicone nanofilaments on the surface of sand microparticles, using only one cheap chemical of small molecules of silanes. The as-prepared superhydrophobic sand displays excellent performance in waterproofing, water storage, soil moisturizing, and oil–water separation. Furthermore, sand-supported micro/nanocomposite catalysts were obtained through covalent attachment of polyamines on the surface of silicone nanofilaments. Such composites, packed in a glass column, were used as a simple flow reactor for Knoevenagel condensation reactions. Quantitative amounts of pure products without further purification can be obtained in such a simple way that just allowing the reactants solution flows through the composite catalysts driven by gravity. These results pave the way toward the development of sand-based multifunctional materials with great potential for industrial use, given their versatile functions and excellent performances but easy-to-fabricate, low-cost preparation procedure.  aPublisher supplied data  a22172046cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aNAcUniversit?t Z?richdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006447  aZ202169380021cNatural Science Foundation of Changshadhttps://doi.org/NA 3aconcrete 3acondensation reactions 3aglass 3agravity 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3ananocomposites 3apolyamines 3asand 3asilanes 3asilicone 3asoil 3awater storage 0asuperhydrophobic sand 0ahierarchical micro/nanocomposite 0asilicone nanofilament 0awaterproofing 0aoil−water separation 0aflow catalysis1 aWang, Deqi1 aZhu, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9852-16451 aSeeger, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2892-74681 aChu, Zonglin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9230-69790 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 14, no. 38 p.43656-43665dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c087783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245011400160300001500274520166800289592002801957650002101985650001402006650001602020650001402036650001702050650001802067650000702085650002702092650001402119650001902133650001302152650001602165650002502181650001602206650001102222653002202233653002502255653002402280653002202304700001302326700001602339700001302355700005102368700001502419700005502434773012402489856008302613852000902696655001202705IND60628908620221117041117.0190523e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062890862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.01.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yue10aBiobased polymeric surfactant: Natural glycyrrhizic acid-appended homopolymer with multiple pH-responsiveness  ap. 93-100.  aEven though amphiphilic natural products have been widely employed in cosmetics, food, and pesticide formulations, the development of a compound with stimuli-responsiveness is still highly significant. Inspired by the low cost, biocompatibility, pH resistance and amphiphilicity of natural glycyrrhizic acid (Gly), we designed and synthesized an amphiphilic homopolymer, namely, poly(glycyrrhizic acid) (PGly), via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The two carboxylic groups on the side chain of PGly promoted it as a multiple pH-responsive polymeric surfactant. As the pH was decreased from 5.0 to 2.0, the PGly transformed from the extension to the coil state and further aggregated into nano/micro particles. During this process, the surface charge, surfactivity and diffusion rate of PGly decreased along with the decreasing pH. Moreover, with ultrasonic treatment (UT), the aggregates that formed at lower pH values decreased (pH 3.0 and 2.0) or almost disappeared (pH 4.0), indicating that these insoluble aggregates at lower pH were broken by UT and were then reassembled into the compacted PGly nanoparticles. Based on the above results, the emulsion (20 wt% xylene) stabilized by 0.1 wt% PGly was fabricated using ultrasonic emulsification for which the diameter distribution and the dispersion state can be reversibly regulated by pH (2.0–5.0). This natural polymeric surfactant exhibited a favorable surfactivity and multiple pH responsiveness in the preparation of emulsions, showing its potential for application in the controlled release of pesticide formulations and in the recovery of organic pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acosmetics 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aglycyrrhizin 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apesticide formulations 3apollution 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asurfactants 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3axylene 0aGlycyrrhizic acid 0aBio-based surfactant 0aAmphiphilic polymer 0apH-responsiveness1 aHao, Jie1 aZhao, Kefei1 aJu, Yong1 aHu, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0966-63621 aGao, Yuxia1 aDu, Fengpei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4949-75240 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 541 p.93-100dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.01.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002800188245006700216506010400283506007600387520123700463592002801700506003701728650001001765650001101775650001901786653006601805653002701871653001701898653004201915700002101957700006401978700002102042773008302063856008202146852000902228655001202237IND60684731820221215142821.0220914s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068473182DNAL7 a321951372pmid7 aPMC70783872pmcid7 a10.1016/j.mex.2020.1008192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Benito, Cristina10aGraphs based methods for simultaneous smoothing and sharpening  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe present two new methods for simultaneous smoothing and sharpening of color images: the GMS³ (Graph Method for Simultaneous Smoothing and Sharpening) and the NGMS³(Normalized Graph-Method for Simultaneous Smoothing and Sharpening).

On the one hand, we define a kernel-based filter for smoothing each pixel with the pixels associated to nodes in its same connected component. On the other hand, we modify each pixel by increasing their differences with respect to the pixels in the other connected components of those local graphs. Our approach is shown to be competitive with respect to other state-of-the-art methods that simultaneously manage both processes.•We provide two methods that carry out the process of smoothing and sharpening simultaneously.•The methods are based on the analysis of the structure of a local graph defined from the differences in the RGB space among the pixels in a 3 × 3 window.•The parameters of the method are adjusted using both observers opinion and the well-known reference image quality assessment BRISQUE (Blind/Referenceless images spatial quality Evaluator) score.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acolor 3agraphs 3aimage analysis 0aGraph Method for Simultaneous Smoothing and Sharpening (GMS3) 0aColor image processing 0aLocal graphs 0aSimultaneous smoothing and sharpening1 aJordan, Kris L.,1 aConejero, J.

So RDF is termed as genome signature in bacteria. It is not known if the constancy in RDF is governed by genome wide mutational bias or by selection. Here we did comparative analysis of RDF between the inter-genic and the coding sequences in seventeen bacterial genomes, whose gene expression data was available. The constraint on di-nucleotides was found to be higher in the coding sequences than that in the inter-genic regions and the constraint at the 2nd codon position was more than that in the 3rd position within a genome. Further analysis revealed that the constraint on di-nucleotides at the 2nd codon position is greater in the high expression genes (HEG) than that in the whole genomes as well as in the low expression genes (LEG). We analyzed RDF at the 2nd and the 3rd codon positions in simulated coding sequences that were computationally generated by keeping the codon usage bias (CUB) according to genome G+C composition and the sequence of amino acids unaltered. In the simulated coding sequences, the constraint observed was significantly low and no significant difference was observed between the HEG and the LEG in terms of di-nucleotide constraint. This indicated that the greater constraint on di-nucleotides in the HEG was due to the stronger selection on CUB in these genes in comparison to the LEG within a genome. Further, we did comparative analyses of the RDF in the HEG rpoB and rpoC of 199 bacteria, which revealed a common pattern of constraints on di-nucleotides at the 2nd codon position across these bacteria. To validate the role of CUB on di-nucleotide constraint, we analyzed RDF at the 2nd and the 3rd codon positions in simulated rpoB/rpoC sequences. The analysis revealed that selection on CUB is an important attribute for the constraint on di-nucleotides at these positions in bacterial genomes. We believe that this study has come with major findings of the role of CUB on di-nucleotide constraint in bacterial genomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3abacteria 3agene expression 3agenes 0aRDF(s) 0aCUB 0aHEG 0aLEG 0aRelative di-nucleotide frequency 0aCodon usage bias 0aGene expression 0aInter-genic region 0aCodon context1 aPowdel, Bhes Raj1 aDutta, Malay1 aBuragohain, Alak Kumar1 aRay, Suvendra Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5461-72550 tGene.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 536 p.18-28dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.11.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006000144245012700204300002000331520147800351592002801829596007401857596008101931596007202012596007202084650001402156650001902170650001402189650001702203650001302220650001602233653000902249653002202258653002802280653002502308653002702333700006502360700006002425700002302485700001502508700005702523700002002580773014302600856007902743852000902822655001202831IND60794824120220929000000.0220929e20220913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079482412DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c090322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDittrich, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2698-948110aSynthesis Control of Charge Separation at Anatase TiO₂ Thin Films Studied by Transient Surface Photovoltage Spectroscopy  ap. 43163-43170.  aFor the efficient photocatalytic oxidation of organic pollutants at surfaces of semiconductors, photogenerated holes shall be separated toward the surface and transferred to reactive surface sites, whereas the transfer of photogenerated electrons toward the surface shall be minimized. In this Research Article, the identification of suitable synthesis control of charge separation combined with an in-depth understanding of charge kinetics and trapping passivation mechanisms at the related surfaces can provide tremendous opportunities for boosting the photocatalytic performance. In this work, a comprehensive transient surface photovoltage spectroscopy study of charge separation at anatase TiO₂ thin films, synthesized by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis from titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP)–acetylacetone (AcacH) based precursor is reported. By varying the amount of AcacH in the precursor solution, an experimental approach of synthesis control of the charge transfer toward TiO₂ surface is provided for the first time. An increased amount of AcacH in the precursor promotes transition from preferential fast electron to preferential fast hole transfer toward anatase surface, correlating with a strong increase of the photocatalytic decomposition rate of organic pollutants. Suitable mechanisms of AcacH-induced passivation of electron traps at TiO₂ surfaces are analyzed, providing a new degree of freedom for tailoring the properties of photocatalytic systems.  aPublisher supplied data  aTAR16016EKcSihtasutus Archimedesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008369  a952509cHorizon 2020 Framework Programmedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010661  aPRG627cEesti Teadusagentuurdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002301  aPSG689cEesti Teadusagentuurdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002301 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3apyrolysis 3aspectroscopy 3atitanium 3aultrasonics 0aTiO2 0acharge separation 0aphotocatalytic activity 0asurface photovoltage 0atransient spectroscopy1 aSydorenko, Jekaterina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7675-04711 aSpalatu, Nicolae1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0234-21701 aNickel, Norbert H.1 aMere, Arvo1 aKrunks, Malle1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4658-44031 aOja Acik, Ilona0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Sept. 13, v. 14, no. 38 p.43163-43170dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c090323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006700151245019600218300001800414520160200432592002802034650002302062650003302085650002302118650002402141650001502165650000902180650002602189650001802215650001002233650001802243650001902261650003702280650001802317650002502335650001202360650001802372653001002390653000702400653000902407653000802416653000802424653002502432653001002457653002002467653000802487653000802495653001402503700002102517700002702538773011302565856008602678852000902764655001202773IND60593743320221120052206.0190516e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059374332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.01.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNatskoulis, Pantelis I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8121-560610aEvaluating the efficacy of turbimetric measurements as a rapid screening technique to assess fungal susceptibility to antimicrobial compounds as exemplified by the use of sodium metabisulfite  ap. 1037-1041.  aThe in vitro susceptibility to sodium metabisulphite (NaMBS) was investigated in 10 different food spoilage filamentous fungi, namely Aspergillus flavus, A. carbonarius, A. niger, A. ochraceus, A. tubingensis, A. westerdijkiae, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium commune and P. expansum. The fungi were inoculated in sterile 96-well microtiter plates containing Yeast-extract Sucrose (YES) semi-solid agar supplemented with NaMBS in concentrations ranging from 2000 to 3.9 mg l−1 and incubated at 25 °C. Growth was monitored by absorbance measurements at 600 nm using a multi-spectrophotometer. The surface areas under the optical density (OD) vs. time growth curves obtained were used to calculate the fractional area f(a), from which the non-inhibitory (NIC) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the antifungal agent were calculated for each fungus using the Gompertz model for decay. Most Aspergillus species showed remarkable resistance to NaMBS, presenting NIC and MIC values higher than 250 and 2500 mg l−1, respectively. The most susceptible fungi were the two Penicillium species and A. carbonarius, which presented very low NIC (<100 mg l−1) and MIC (<1300 mg l−1) values, whereas C. cladosporioides and F. oxysporum presented intermediate values. The method has the advantage of good repeatability and accuracy, rapid results within 48–72 h, growth detection and susceptibility to the antifungal agent for several fungi at the same time, and optimal use of microbiological media by using small volumes of consumables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aCladosporium cladosporioides 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aPenicillium commune 3aabsorbance 3aagar 3aanti-infective agents 3afood spoilage 3afungi 3agrowth curves 3alogit analysis 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3arapid methods 3asodium metabisulfite 3asucrose 3ayeast extract 0aNaMBS 0aOD 0af(a) 0aNIC 0aMIC 0aSodium metabisulfite 0aFungi 0aOptical density 0aMIC 0aNIC 0aModelling1 aLappa, Iliada K.1 aPanagou, Efstathios Z.0 tFood research international.g2018 Apr., v. 106 p.1037-1041dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.01.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007800172300001400250520170000264592002801964650003001992650001202022650001902034650002002053650002602073650001702099650001502116650001702131650001502148650002202163650001602185653002002201653003402221653001802255773010602273856008602379852000902465655001202474IND60114122820221118155054.0190318e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011412282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenry, Hugh A.L.10aReprint of “Soil extracellular enzyme dynamics in a changing climate”  ap. 53-59.  aAssays for extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) have become a common tool for studying soil microbial responses in climate change experiments. Nevertheless, measures of potential EEA, which are conducted under controlled conditions, often do not account for the direct effects of climate change on EEA that occur as a result of the temperature and moisture dependence of enzyme activity in situ. Likewise, the indirect effects of climate on EEA in the field, that occur via effects on microbial enzyme producers, must be assessed in the context of potential changes in plant and soil faunal communities. Here, EEA responses to warming and altered precipitation in field studies are reviewed, with the goal of evaluating the role of EEA in enhancing our understanding of soil and ecosystem responses to climate change. Seasonal and interannual variation in EEA responses to climate change treatments are examined, and potential interactions with elevated atmospheric CO2, increased atmospheric N deposition and changes in disturbance regimes are also explored. It is demonstrated that in general, soil moisture manipulations in field studies have had a much greater influence on potential EEA than warming treatments. However, these results may simply reflect the low magnitude of soil warming achieved in many field experiments. In addition, changes in plant species composition over the longer term in response to warming could strongly affect EEA. Future challenges involve extending studies of potential EEA to address EEA responses to climate change in situ, and gaining further insights into the mechanisms, such as enzyme production, stabilization and turnover, that underlie EEA responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenzyme activity 3afield experimentation 3asoil ecology 3asoil fauna 3asoil heating 3asoil water 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 0aClimate warming 0aExtracellular enzyme activity 0aPrecipitation0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2013 Jan., v. 56 p.53-59dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245020800177300001400385520103000399592002801429650002501457650001101482650001401493650001701507650001601524650001801540650001601558650001501574650001801589650001701607650002501624653002401649653001201673653001001685653002501695653001001720653002601730700002301756773009301779856008701872852000901959655001201968IND60526619320221122140100.0190408e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052661932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmutzler, Matthias10aSimultaneous detection of total antioxidant capacity and total soluble solids content by Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy: A quick and sensitive method for on-site analyses of apples  ap. 27-37.  aAntioxidant capacity and total soluble solids content (SSC) of seven cultivars of apples (Braeburn, Evelina, Gala, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Jonagold, Pink Lady) were successfully determined applying a FT-NIR handheld spectrometer.

Applying surface scanning, SEP values decreased significantly by 39% and 10% compared to on-site analyses for the prediction of SSC and polyphenolic compounds respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aapples 3acultivars 3afiber optics 3agallic acid 3aleast squares 3apolyphenols 3aprediction 3aspectrometers 3aspectroscopy 3atotal soluble solids 0aFT-NIR spectroscopy 0aOn-site 0aApple 0aAntioxidant capacity 0aSugar 0aHandheld spectrometer1 aHuck, Christian W.0 tFood control.g2016 Aug., v. 66 p.27-37dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04378naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245013100200300001100331500001400342520304600356592002803402650001303430650002803443650001703471650002103488650002003509650001403529650002403543650001603567650001203583650001403595650001103609650001003620650001103630650001103641650001303652650001503665650001303680650001403693700001703707773010503724856008203829852000903911655001203920IND60712672720221119022213.0210210e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071267272DNAL7 a10.1186/s13007-020-00624-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8769-598110aEarly recognition of tomato gray leaf spot disease based on MobileNetv2-YOLOv3 model [Erratum: December 2021, Vol.17(1), p.19]  ap. 83.  aNAL-light  aBACKGROUND: Tomato gray leaf spot is a worldwide disease, especially in warm and humid areas. The continuous expansion of greenhouse tomato cultivation area and the frequent introduction of foreign varieties in recent years have increased the severity of the epidemic hazards of this disease in some tomato planting bases annually. This disease is a newly developed one. Thus, farmers generally lack prevention and control experience and measures in production; the disease is often misdiagnosed or not prevented and controlled timely; this condition results in tomato production reduction or crop failure, which causes severe economic losses to farmers. Therefore, tomato gray leaf spot disease should be identified in the early stage, which will be important in avoiding or reducing the economic loss caused by the disease. The advent of the era of big data has facilitated the use of machine learning method in disease identification. Therefore, deep learning method is proposed to realise the early recognition of tomato gray leaf spot. Tomato growers need to develop the app of image detection mobile terminal of tomato gray leaf spot disease to realise real-time detection of this disease. RESULTS: This study proposes an early recognition method of tomato leaf spot based on MobileNetv2-YOLOv3 model to achieve a good balance between the accuracy and real-time detection of tomato gray leaf spot. This method improves the accuracy of the regression box of tomato gray leaf spot recognition by introducing the GIoU bounding box regression loss function. A MobileNetv2-YOLOv3 lightweight network model, which uses MobileNetv2 as the backbone network of the model, is proposed to facilitate the migration to the mobile terminal. The pre-training method combining mixup training and transfer learning is used to improve the generalisation ability of the model. The images captured under four different conditions are statistically analysed. The recognition effect of the models is evaluated by the F1 score and the AP value, and the experiment is compared with Faster-RCNN and SSD models. Experimental results show that the recognition effect of the proposed model is significantly improved. In the test dataset of images captured under the background of sufficient light without leaf shelter, the F1 score and AP value are 94.13% and 92.53%, and the average IOU value is 89.92%. In all the test sets, the F1 score and AP value are 93.24% and 91.32%, and the average IOU value is 86.98%. The object detection speed can reach 246 frames/s on GPU, the extrapolation speed for a single 416 × 416 picture is 16.9 ms, the detection speed on CPU can reach 22 frames/s, the extrapolation speed is 80.9 ms and the memory occupied by the model is 28 MB. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed recognition method has the advantages of low memory consumption, high recognition accuracy and fast recognition speed. This method is a new solution for the early prediction of tomato leaf spot and a new idea for the intelligent diagnosis of tomato leaf spot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3aartificial intelligence 3acrop failure 3acultivation area 3adata collection 3adetection 3afinancial economics 3agreenhouses 3agrowers 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3alight 3amemory 3amodels 3aplanting 3aprediction 3atomatoes 3avarieties1 aWang, Xuewei0 tPlant methods.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.83-83dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4337304x1746-48117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-020-00624-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010100168300001600269520140800285592002801693650002101721650003601742650001601778650001601794650002701810650001701837650002101854650003901875650002301914650002101937650003201958650003301990650001502023650002502038650001202063650002102075653001502096653002702111653003102138653002602169653001702195700001602212700001602228700001402244700001702258700001402275700002402289700002902313773011102342856008602453852000902539655001202548IND60593743520221120052202.0190516e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059374352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.01.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Zhenbao10aEffects of sonication on the physicochemical and functional properties of walnut protein isolate  ap. 853-861.  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the impact of high-intensity ultrasound treatment (sonication) on the molecular, physicochemical, and functional properties of walnut protein isolate. Aqueous walnut protein suspensions were sonicated at varying power levels (200, 400 or 600 W) and times (15 or 30 min), and then any alternations in protein structure and properties were determined. SDS-PAGE demonstrated that there were no changes in protein electrophoretic patterns, indicating that sonication did not break covalent bonds. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated a small change in protein secondary structure after sonication, with a decrease in α-helix and increase in β-sheet, β-turn, and random coil content. There was an increase in surface free sulfhydryl (SH) groups and a decrease in fluorescence intensity after sonication, indicating that appreciable changes in tertiary structure occurred. Ultrasound reduced the size of the particles in aqueous walnut protein dispersions as confirmed by static light scattering and scanning electron microscopy, suggesting that sonication dissociated protein aggregates. Moreover, the water-solubility (+22%), emulsifying activity index (+26%), and emulsifying stability index (+41%) all increased after sonication. These results suggest that sonication is a valuable tool for improving the functional attributes of walnut proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adispersions 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3afluorescence 3alight scattering 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein aggregates 3aprotein isolates 3aprotein secondary structure 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asonication 3aultrasonic treatment 3awalnuts 3awater solubility 0aUltrasound 0aWalnut protein isolate 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aFunctional properties 0aDenaturation1 aZhu, Weiduo1 aYi, Jianhua1 aLiu, Ning1 aCao, Yungang1 aLu, Jiali1 aDecker, Eric Andrew1 aMcClements, David Julian0 tFood research international.g2018 Apr., v. 106 p.853-861dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.01.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012300164500002200287520164000309592002801949650002301977650001502000650001502015650002402030650002202054650001202076650001302088650001102101650001202112650001702124650000902141650001202150650001502162650001102177650000702188650001302195650002302208653002702231653004002258653001902298653002102317653002002338700001502358700001702373700001802390700001802408700001702426700005702443773010902500856008302609852000902692655001202701IND60628909020221117041744.0190131e20190121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062890902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.01.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Liyan10aGreen multi-functional monomer based ion imprinted polymers for selective removal of copper ions from aqueous solution  aPre-press version  aGreen ion imprinted polymers (IIPs) were prepared in aqueous phase via the synergy of three functional monomers of low-cost eco-friendly gelatin (G), 8-hydroxyquinoline (HQ) and chitosan (C), namely G-HQ-C IIPs, and were applied as an effective and recyclable adsorbent to remove Cu(II) from aqueous solution. The as-prepared G-HQ-C IIPs were systematically characterized, and several major factors affecting adsorption capacity including solution pH, temperature and contact time were investigated in detail. The adsorption of Cu(II) on G-HQ-C IIPs followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models, and the adsorption capacity increased with temperature increase. Moreover, the maximum adsorption capacities of G-HQ-C IIPs toward Cu(II) reached up to 111.81 mg/g at room temperature, much higher than those of most of the reported adsorbents for Cu(II). The G-HQ-C IIPs displayed excellent selectivity against seven common divalent ions with selectivity coefficients above 18.71, as well as high anti-interference ability. Additionally, a good reusability was demonstrated without significant loss in adsorption capacity after at least ten cycles. The IIPs were applied to environmental water samples for selective removal of Cu(II) with satisfactory results. By replacing Cu(II) template by Cd(II), Hg(II) and Pb(II), respectively, the obtained three kinds of IIPs based on G-HQ-C presented convincing imprinting properties, and therefore the work could provide a simple and general imprinting strategy toward various concerned heavy metal ions through multi-point interactions from multiple functional monomers.  aPublisher supplied data 3a8-hydroxyquinoline 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3aaqueous solutions 3acadmium 3achitosan 3acopper 3agelatin 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amercury 3ametal ions 3amodels 3apH 3apolymers 3asorption isotherms 0aIon imprinted polymers 0aMulti-functional monomer imprinting 0aCu(II) removal 0aAqueous solution 0aGreen synthesis1 aLi, Jinhua1 aWang, Jianan1 aGuo, Xiaotong1 aWang, Xiaoyan1 aChoo, Jaebum1 aChen, Lingxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3764-35150 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Jan. 21, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.01.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012800162500001900290520159000309592002801899650002501927650001901952650002001971650001701991650001502008650001702023650001402040650001602054650001402070650002202084650000902106650001502115650000902130700002402139700002702163773012202190856007402312852000902386655001202395IND60732186620221119094932.0210326e20210226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073218662DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130307672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoepner, Cara T.,10aImpact of Supplementation and Nutritional Interventions on Pathogenic Processes of Mood Disorders: A Review of the Evidence  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis narrative review was conducted using searches of the PubMed/Medline and Google Scholar databases from inception to November 2019. Clinical trials and relevant articles were identified by cross-referencing major depressive disorder (and/or variants) with the following terms: folate, homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), L-acetylcarnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, N-acetylcysteine, L-tryptophan, zinc, magnesium, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, and inositol. Manual reviews of references were also performed using article reference lists. Abnormal levels of folate, homocysteine, and SAMe have been shown to be associated with a higher risk of depression. Numerous studies have demonstrated antidepressant activity with L-methylfolate and SAMe supplementation in individuals with depression. Additionally, the amino acids L-acetylcarnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, N-acetylcysteine, and L-tryptophan have been implicated in the development of depression and shown to exert antidepressant effects. Other agents with evidence for improving depressive symptoms include zinc, magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, and coenzyme Q10. Potential biases and differences in study designs within and amongst the studies and reviews selected may confound results. Augmentation of antidepressant medications with various supplements targeting nutritional and physiological factors can potentiate antidepressant effects. Medical foods, particularly L-methylfolate, and other supplements may play a role in managing depression in patients with inadequate response to antidepressant therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aS-adenosylmethionine 3aacetylcysteine 3aantidepressants 3acoenzyme Q10 3afolic acid 3ahomocysteine 3ainositols 3alipoic acid 3amagnesium 3amental depression 3arisk 3atryptophan 3azinc1 aMcIntyre, Roger S.,1 aPapakostas, George I.,0 tNutrients.g2021 Feb. 26, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130307673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245013700175300001600312520085100328592002801179650002301207650001901230650002001249650001601269650001501285650002601300650001301326650000901339650001401348653000801362653001001370653001101380653000901391653001301400653000801413653000801421653000801429653000901437653000801446653003801454653003101492653003601523700002201559700002501581700002201606700002701628700002201655700001901677700001901696700002401715700002201739773007401761856008201835852000901917655001201926IND60552370220221118085547.0161021e20140225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055237022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.11.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastilhos, Cristina D.10aDetermination of the lysosomal hydrolase activity in blood collected on filter paper, an alternative to screen high risk populations  ap. 344-347.  aThis study aimed to determine the enzymatic activity in dried blood samples collected on filter paper (DBS) for the diagnosis of the following diseases: Fabry, Pompe, Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) and Mucopolysaccharosis type VI (MPS VI).

Among them, Free-Choice Profiling (FCP) and Flash Profile (FP) are two that have been known for many years. The objectives of this work were to compare the rating-based FCP and ranking-based FP method; to evaluate the impact of adding adjustments to FP approach; to investigate the influence of the number of assessors on the outcome of modified FP. To achieve these aims, a conventional descriptive analysis (DA), FCP, FP and a modified version of FP were carried out. Red wines made by different grape maturity and ethanol concentration were used for sensory testing. This study showed that DA provided a more detailed and accurate information on products through a quantitative measure of the intensity of sensory attributes than FCP and FP. However, the panel hours for conducting DA were higher than that for rapid methods, and FP was even able to separate the samples to a higher degree than DA. When comparing FCP and FP, this study showed that the ranking-based FP provided a clearer separation of samples than rating-based FCP, but the latter was an easier task for most assessors. When restricting assessors on their use of attributes in FP, the sample space became clearer and the ranking task was simplified. The FP protocol with restricted attribute sets seems to be a promising approach for efficient screening of sensory properties in wine. When increasing the number of assessors from 10 to 20 for conducting the modified FP, the outcome tended to be slightly more stable, however, one should consider the degree of panel training when deciding the optimal number of assessors for conducting FP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethanol 3agrapes 3aprotocols 3arapid methods 3ared wines 3ascreening 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 0aDescriptive analysis 0aFree-Choice Profiling 0aFlash Profile 0aRapid sensory methodologies 0aSensory evaluation 0aWine1 aBredie, Wender L.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5145-41311 aSherman, Emma1 aHarbertson, James F.1 aHeymann, Hildegarde0 tFood research international.g2018 Apr., v. 106 p.892-900dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.01.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001300191245005100204300001800255506007600273520111800349592002801467506003701495650000801532650001601540650002001556650001101576653001401587653002201601653002001623653000901643653000901652700001601661700002401677700001601701700001901717773010701736856008401843852000901927655001201936IND60691188320221207054725.0200428e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069118832DNAL7 a10.4161/15476286.2014.9728532doi7 aPMC46155372pmcid7 a256029062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Dan10aRNAa in action: From the exception to the norm  ap. 1221-1225.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSmall RNA programmed Argonautes are sophisticated cellular effector platforms known to be involved in a diverse array of functions ranging from mRNA cleavage, translational inhibition, DNA elimination, epigenetic silencing, alternative splicing and even gene activation. First observed in human cells, small RNA-induced gene activation, also known as RNAa, involves the targeted recruitment of Argonaute proteins to specific promoter sequences followed by induction of stable epigenetic changes which promote transcription. The existence of RNAa remains contentious due to its elusive mechanism. A string of recent studies in C. elegans provides unequivocal evidence for RNAa's fundamental role in sculpting the epigenetic landscape and maintaining active transcription of endogenous genes and supports the presence of a functionally sophisticated network of small RNA-Argonaute pathways consisting of opposite yet complementary “yin and yang” regulatory elements. In this review, we summarize key findings from recent studies of endogenous RNAa in C. elegans, with an emphasis on the Argonaute protein CSR-1.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aepigenetics 3agene activation 3ahumans 0aArgonaute 0aepigenetic memory 0agene expression 0aRNAa 0aRNAe1 aBarry, Liam1 aLin, Sharon Szu Hua1 aHuang, Vera1 aLi, Long-Cheng0 tRNA biology.g2014 Oct. 3, v. 11, no. 10 p.1221-1225dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/15476286.2014.9728533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245016000167300001600327520159800343592002801941596005501969596004102024650001102065650002502076650001302101650001602114650002702130650001302157650001802170650001002188650001502198700002302213700002002236700001902256700002002275700002102295773014502316856008302461852000902544655001202553IND60762722820221119024214.0220112e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076272282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-021-03268-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarenne, Fanny10aSynthesis and characterization of molecularly imprinted polymers for the selective extraction of oxazepam from complex environmental and biological samples  ap. 451-463.  aOxazepam, one of the most frequently prescribed anxiolytic drugs, is not completely removed from wastewater with conventional treatment processes. It can thus be found at trace levels in environmental water, with human urine constituting the major source of contamination. This study focused on the development and characterization of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for the selective solid-phase extraction of oxazepam at trace levels from environmental water and human urine samples. Two MIPs were synthesized, and their selectivity in pure organic and aqueous media were assayed. After optimizing the extraction procedure adapted to a large sample volume to reach a high enrichment factor, the most promising MIP was applied to the selective extraction of oxazepam from environmental water. Extraction recoveries of 83 ± 12, 92 ± 4 and 89 ± 10% were obtained using the MIP for tap, mineral and river water, respectively, while a recovery close to 40% was obtained on the corresponding non-imprinted polymer (NIP). Thanks to the high enrichment factors, a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 4.5 ng L⁻¹ was obtained for river water. A selective extraction procedure was also developed for urine samples and gave rise to extraction recoveries close to 95% for the MIP and only 23% for the NIP. Using the MIP, a LOQ of 357 ng L⁻¹ was obtained for oxazepam in urine. The use of the MIP also helped to limit the matrix effects encountered for the quantification of oxazepam in environmental samples and in human urine samples after extraction on an Oasis HLB sorbent.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-15-CE04-0012cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  aDIM AnalyticscRégion Ile de France 3ahumans 3amolecular imprinting 3apolymers 3ariver water 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 3atranquilizers 3aurine 3awastewater1 aKadhirvel, Porkodi1 aBosman, Pauline1 aRenault, Loïc1 aCombès, Audrey1 aPichon, Valérie0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2022 Jan., v. 414, no. 1 p.451-463dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-021-03268-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245017700164500001900341520150400360592002801864650001001892650001001902650001501912650001301927650001701940650001501957650001301972650003101985650001102016650002302027650001002050700002402060700002602084700002002110700002002130700001902150700002002169700001802189700002302207700002102230700002202251700002202273700001902295700002002314700002202334700001902356773012202375856007402497852000902571655001202580IND60732186820221119094731.0210326e20210226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073218682DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130307692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabateen, Abrar  M.10aAcceptability and Feasibility of a 13-Week Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial Testing the Effects of Incremental Doses of Beetroot Juice in Overweight and Obese Older Adults  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNitrate-rich food can increase nitric oxide production and improve vascular and brain functions. This study examines the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing the effects of prolonged consumption of different doses of dietary nitrate (NO₃⁻) in the form of beetroot juice (BJ) in overweight and obese older participants. A single-blind, four-arm parallel pilot RCT was conducted in 62 overweight and obese (30.4 ± 4 kg/m²) older participants (mean ± standard deviation (SD), 66 ± 4 years). Participants were randomized to: (1) high-NO₃⁻ (HN: 2 × 70 mL BJ/day) (2) medium-NO₃⁻ (MN: 70 mL BJ/day), (3) low-NO₃⁻ (LN: 70 mL BJ on alternate days) or (4) Placebo (PL: 70 mL of NO₃⁻-depleted BJ on alternate days), for 13 weeks. Compliance was checked by a daily log of consumed BJ, NO₃⁻ intake, and by measuring NO₃⁻ and NO₂⁻ concentrations in plasma, saliva, and urine samples. Fifty participants completed the study. Self-reported compliance to the interventions was >90%. There were significant positive linear relationships between NO₃⁻ dose and the increase in plasma and urinary NO₃⁻ concentration (R² = 0.71, p < 0.001 and R² = 0.46 p < 0.001, respectively), but relationships between NO₃⁻ dose and changes in salivary NO₃⁻ and NO₂⁻ were non-linear (R² = 0.35, p = 0.002 and R² = 0.23, p = 0.007, respectively). The results confirm the feasibility of prolonged BJ supplementation in older overweight and obese adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeets 3abrain 3acompliance 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3aoverweight 3aplacebos 3arandomized clinical trials 3asaliva 3astandard deviation 3aurine1 aShannon, Oliver  M.1 aO’Brien, Gerard  M.1 aOkello, Edward 1 aKhan, Anmar  A.1 aRubele, Sofia 1 aWightman, Emma 1 aSmith, Ellen 1 aMcMahon, Nicholas 1 aOlgacer, Dilara 1 aKoehl, Christina 1 aFostier, William 1 aMendes, Inês 1 aKennedy, David 1 aMathers, John C.,1 aSiervo, Mario 0 tNutrients.g2021 Feb. 26, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130307693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245002300187300001600210520161700226592002801843650001401871650001501885650001101900650001201911650002001923650001101943650001501954650001401969650001801983650001602001650001302017650001802030650002402048650000902072650001302081650001602094650002702110650002302137700002002160773012302180856008202303852000902385655001202394IND4491789520221119180651.0141111e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449178952DNAL7 a227098992pmid7 a10.1016/j.jand.2012.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGould, Rebecca A.10aManagement Matters  ap.

Because higher salaries are tied to increasing levels of authority and responsibility, RDs must seek management and leadership roles to enjoy the increased remuneration tied to such positions. Advanced-level practice in any area of dietetics demands powerful communication abilities, proficiency in budgeting and finance, comfort with technology, higher-order decision-making/problem-solving skills, and well-honed human resource management capabilities, all foundational to competent management practice. As RDs envision the future of the dietetics profession, practitioners must evaluate management competence in both hard and soft skills. Just as research is needed to support evidenced-based clinical practice, the same is needed to support management practice across the profession. Dietetics educators and preceptors should be as enthusiastic about management practice as they are clinical practice when educating and mentoring future professionals. Such encouragement and support can mean that new RDs and dietetic technicians, registered, will understand what it takes to advance to higher levels of responsibility, authority, and subsequent enhanced remuneration. In the ever-changing social, legal, ethical, political, economic, technological, and ecological environments of work, food and nutrition professionals who are willing to step forward and assume the risks and responsibilities of management also will share in the rewards, and propel the profession to new heights of recognition and respect.  aPublisher supplied data 3adietetics 3adietitians 3aethics 3afinance 3ahuman resources 3ahumans 3aleadership 3amentoring 3anutritionists 3aoccupations 3apolitics 3aprofessionals 3aresource management 3arisk 3ateachers 3atechnicians 3awages and remuneration 3aworking conditions1 aCanter, Deborah0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2012 May, v. 112, no. 5S p.S38-S40dElsevier Inc.x2212-26727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2012.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05224naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245018900215300001100404500001400415520316500429592002803594650002203622650002403644650001303668650002303681650001503704650002403719650002203743650001103765650001803776650001203794650002203806650001603828650002903844650002503873650001503898650001403913650001903927650001703946650001903963650001603982650001103998650002604009650004304035650001404078650001404092650001504106650002404121650001904145650002804164650001204192650002504204650002204229700002304251700002004274700002104294700001604315700002204331773010504353856008304458852000904541655001204550IND60712673220221119022204.0210210e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071267322DNAL7 a10.1186/s13007-020-00625-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelvaraj, Michael Gomez1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2394-039910aMachine learning for high-throughput field phenotyping and image processing provides insight into the association of above and below-ground traits in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz)  ap. 87.  aNAL-light  aBACKGROUND: Rapid non-destructive measurements to predict cassava root yield over the full growing season through large numbers of germplasm and multiple environments is a huge challenge in Cassava breeding programs. As opposed to waiting until the harvest season, multispectral imagery using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are capable of measuring the canopy metrics and vegetation indices (VIs) traits at different time points of the growth cycle. This resourceful time series aerial image processing with appropriate analytical framework is very important for the automatic extraction of phenotypic features from the image data. Many studies have demonstrated the usefulness of advanced remote sensing technologies coupled with machine learning (ML) approaches for accurate prediction of valuable crop traits. Until now, Cassava has received little to no attention in aerial image-based phenotyping and ML model testing. RESULTS: To accelerate image processing, an automated image-analysis framework called CIAT Pheno-i was developed to extract plot level vegetation indices/canopy metrics. Multiple linear regression models were constructed at different key growth stages of cassava, using ground-truth data and vegetation indices obtained from a multispectral sensor. Henceforth, the spectral indices/features were combined to develop models and predict cassava root yield using different Machine learning techniques. Our results showed that (1) Developed CIAT pheno-i image analysis framework was found to be easier and more rapid than manual methods. (2) The correlation analysis of four phenological stages of cassava revealed that elongation (EL) and late bulking (LBK) were the most useful stages to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB), below-ground biomass (BGB) and canopy height (CH). (3) The multi-temporal analysis revealed that cumulative image feature information of EL + early bulky (EBK) stages showed a higher significant correlation (r = 0.77) for Green Normalized Difference Vegetation indices (GNDVI) with BGB than individual time points. Canopy height measured on the ground correlated well with UAV (CHuav)-based measurements (r = 0.92) at late bulking (LBK) stage. Among different image features, normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) data were found to be consistently highly correlated (r = 0.65 to 0.84) with AGB at LBK stage. (4) Among the four ML algorithms used in this study, k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) showed the best performance for root yield prediction with the highest accuracy of R² = 0.67, 0.66 and 0.64, respectively. CONCLUSION: UAV platforms, time series image acquisition, automated image analytical framework (CIAT Pheno-i), and key vegetation indices (VIs) to estimate phenotyping traits and root yield described in this work have great potential for use as a selection tool in the modern cassava breeding programs around the world to accelerate germplasm and varietal selection. The image analysis software (CIAT Pheno-i) developed from this study can be widely applicable to any other crop to extract phenotypic information rapidly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aManihot esculenta 3aaboveground biomass 3aaccuracy 3aaerial photography 3aautomation 3abelowground biomass 3abreeding programs 3acanopy 3acanopy height 3acassava 3acomputer software 3acorrelation 3adecision support systems 3adevelopmental stages 3aextraction 3agermplasm 3agrowing season 3aharvest date 3aimage analysis 3ainformation 3amodels 3amultispectral imagery 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphenology 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asupport vector machines 3atesting 3atime series analysis 3ayield forecasting1 aValderrama, Manuel1 aGuzmán, Diego,1 aValencia, Milton1 aRuiz, Henry1 aAcharjee, Animesh0 tPlant methods.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.87-87dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4337304x1746-48117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-020-00625-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245017100165300001600336520203800352592002802390650001002418650002002428650001902448650002702467650002402494650002402518650001502542650001802557650001102575650001302586650001802599650002102617650003202638650001702670700002102687700002302708700001702731700002102748773010502769856008202874852000902956655001202965IND60663953020221120211931.0190910e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066395302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-019-02075-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouth, Josie10aAssessing predator-prey interactions in a chemically altered aquatic environment: the effects of DDT on Xenopus laevis and Culex sp. larvae interactions and behaviour  ap. 771-780.  aBehavioural assays are used as a tool to understand ecotoxicological effects on organisms, but are often not applied in an ecologically relevant context. Assessment of the effect of chemical contaminants on behaviours relating to fitness and trophic interactions for example, requires incorporating predator-prey interactions to create impact assessments. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a controlled substance but is still regularly used as a form of mosquito control. There is little explicit information on the effect of DDT on animal behaviour and the consequent effects upon trophic interactions. This study uses a 3 × 2 factorial design to assess the feeding behaviour of Xenopus laevis toward Culex sp. larvae when supplied with different prey cues. We also assess the behavioural responses of mosquito larvae when supplied with no threat cue and predator threat cues when exposed to 0 µg/L, 2 µg/L and 20 µg/L DDT. There was a significant “DDT exposure” x “prey cue” interaction whereby DDT significantly decreased the foraging behaviour of X. laevis towards live prey cues, however there was no effect of DDT on X. laevis response to olfactory prey cues. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane exposure caused mosquito larvae to appear hyperactive regardless of DDT concentration. Mosquito larvae anti-predator response was significantly dampened when exposed to 2 µg/L DDT, however when exposed to 20 µg/L the anti-predator responses were not impaired. Our results indicate a complex interplay in trophic interactions under DDT exposure, wherein effects are mediated depending on species and concentration. There are possible implications regarding reduced anti-predator behaviour in the prey species but also reduced foraging capacity in the predator, which could drive changes in ecosystem energy pathways. We demonstrate that in order to quantify effects of pesticides upon trophic interactions it is necessary to consider ecologically relevant behaviours of both predator and prey species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulex 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aXenopus laevis 3aantipredatory behavior 3aaquatic environment 3achemical pollutants 3aecosystems 3aecotoxicology 3aenergy 3aforaging 3ainsect larvae 3amosquito control 3apredator-prey relationships 3aprey species1 aBotha, Tarryn L.1 aWolmarans, Nico J.1 aWepener, V.,1 aWeyl, Olaf L.

A total of 350 hot-break juices from two consecutive years (2013 and 2014) including 66 different varieties grown in 6 counties of California, USA, were used in this study. Duplicate spectra for each tomato juice were collected using the transmission accessory of the portable infrared spectrometer at 50 μm fixed path length. Samples were randomly divided into calibration (n = 280) and external validation (n = 70) sets and partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to develop calibration models to predict all the variables (quality traits) in the validation samples based on the tomato juice spectral data (rpred > 0.82). Overall, our validated chemometric models allowed rapidly (∼2 min) predicting all the quality traits in tomato juice samples with no sample preparation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrix 3atomato juice 3ablood serum 3amonitoring 3areducing sugars 3aglucose 3atotal soluble solids 3aspectrometers 3aviscosity 3amodels 3aleast squares 3apH 3achemometrics 3aspectral analysis 3afructose 3aspectroscopy 3aprediction 3aCalifornia 0arpred 0aJB 0arCV 0aPortable spectrometer 0aFT-IR 0aSECV 0amultivariate analysis 0acSt 0aSEP 0aPLSR 0aHPLC 0aPBB 0aTomato 0aQuality 0aRheological properties1 aSierra-Cadavid, Andrea1 aAykas, Didem P.1 aMulqueeney, Brett1 aSullivan, Scott1 aRodriguez-Saona, Luis E.0 tFood control.g2016 Aug., v. 66 p.79-86dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.01.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148242014500173245011900318300001600437500001900453520091500472592002801387650001401415650002501429650001101454650001601465650001001481650001401491650001001505700002101515700001701536700002401553700001701577700001801594773011801612856008301730852000901813655001201822IND60716616920221120191240.0210212e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071661692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10341-020-00526-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAladag, Mustafa Onur10aEinfluss des Trocknens auf die antioxidative Aktivität, die Phenolverbindungen und den Mineralgehalt von Weißdorn- und Wildbirnenfrüchten10aEffect of Drying On Antioxidant Activity, Phenolic Compounds and Mineral Contents of Hawthorn and Wild Pear Fruits  ap. 473-479.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe study demonstrated that SD‑4 (3193.894 mg GAE/100 g) followed by SD‑8 (2262.763 mg GAE/100 g) and SD‑7 (1473.956 mg GAE/100 g) had the maximum total phenolic contents.

The effect of power station ash, charred rice straw and fine material from the mine on soil chemistry, soil enzyme activities and plant growth was tested. Enzymes evaluated were β-glucosidase, urease, acid and alkaline phosphatase, arylsulphatase, catalase, arginine ammonification and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis. Due to the small amount of amendments, applied for economic reasons, and nutrient leaching during periods of high precipitation, only acid phosphatase activity was affected by treatments after four months. Plant height after 1.5 years was not found to be affected. We conclude that for monitoring soil quality of acid, P-deficient substrates from subtropical surface coal mines, the activity of acid phosphatase may be a useful bioindicator.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aammonification 3aarginine 3aarylsulfatase 3abeta-glucosidase 3acatalase 3acoal 3aenzyme activity 3afield experimentation 3ahydrolysis 3aindicator species 3aland restoration 3aleaching 3amining 3amonitoring 3aplant growth 3arice straw 3asoil 3asoil amendments 3asoil quality 3aurease 3aVietnam 0aSoil quality 0aSoil amendments 0aExtracellular enzyme activity 0aVietnam1 aKretschmer, Katja1 aKuka, Katrin1 aKlotz, Stefan1 aHeilmeier, Hermann0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2013 Jan., v. 56 p.87-89dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009200159500001900251520091300270592002801183650001801211650001401229650002401243650001701267650001001284650001101294650001501305650003101320650001201351700002201363700002201385700002301407700001901430700002201449700002301471773012201494856007401616852000901690655001201699IND60732187020221119100231.0210326e20210227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073218702DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130307702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiano, Ilaria 10aRetinal Neurodegeneration: Correlation between Nutraceutical Treatment and Animal Model  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRetinal diseases can be induced by a variety of factors, including gene mutations, environmental stresses and dysmetabolic processes. The result is a progressive deterioration of visual function, which sometimes leads to blindness. Many treatments are under investigation, though results are still mostly unsatisfactory and restricted to specific pathologies, particularly in the case of gene therapy. The majority of treatments have been tested in animal models, but very few have progressed to human clinical trials. A relevant approach is to study the relation between the type of treatments and the degenerative characteristics of the animal model to better understand the effectiveness of each therapy. Here we compare the results obtained from different animal models treated with natural compounds (saffron and naringenin) to anticipate the potentiality of a single treatment in different pathologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3ablindness 3adietary supplements 3agene therapy 3agenes 3ahumans 3anaringenin 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3asaffron1 aDi Paolo, Mattia 1 aCorsi, Francesca 1 aPiragine, Eugenia 1 aBisti, Silvia 1 aGargini, Claudia 1 aDi Marco, Stefano 0 tNutrients.g2021 Feb. 27, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130307703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01929naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245009700159300001600256520103800272592002801310650002301338650001101361650002201372650002001394650001501414650000701429650002801436773010601464856004801570852000901618655001201627IND4515811520221119180354.0151006e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451581152DNAL7 a10.1134/S106193481206007X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLenik, J.10aProperties of ion-selective electrodes with polymeric membranes for ketoprofen determination  ap. 543-549.  aThe aim of the research was to create electrodes based on PVC membrane with solid contact.

First, sterile flour solution (SFS) was developed as a substrate, and the HS-SPME-GC/MS technique was used to detect the volatile compounds, especially butanol. Then, gas production rate and acid-producing efficacy of S. cerevisiae were detected by Wickerham’s method and pH meter for assessing the ability to metabolize different sugar, respectively. Finally, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to determine the genetic relationships among the strains. As a result, the SC-X1 obtained the highest concentration of butanol by metabolizing SFS, and the SC-N1 produced the richest variety of flavors during fermentation. The SC-X1 had a better acid-producing ability, it metabolized glucose, sucrose and maltose to produce acid which lower the pH value by 2.26, 2.17 and 1.46, respectively. The SC-X1 had higher gas-producing efficiency by utilizing glucose and sucrose, and the SC-N1 had perfect performance in gas-producing. The PFGE similarity coefficient was high in relationship with the S. cerevisiae resource. Through comprehensive analysis, SC-X1 and SC-N1 were chosen for further research due to their excellent chemical and microbiological performances. Especially, the SC-X1 is very potential for commercial usage with high production of butanol.  aPublisher supplied data  a2662016PY102cthe fundamental research funds for China central university 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abutanol 3adough 3afermentation 3aflour 3afood research 3aglucose 3amaltose 3apH 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3asucrose1 aTumurbaatar, Naranzul1 aZhou, Junying1 aQi, Xiaobao0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2022 Jan., v. 248, no. 1 p.207-217dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-021-03874-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245019300168300001600361520144200377592002801819650002301847650002501870650001801895650001301913650001701926650004301943650002101986650001102007650002202018650002302040650001502063650001402078650001702092650001402109650001702123653000802140653000902148653001202157653000702169653000702176653000802183653000802191653000802199653000802207653001002215653001602225653002202241653002602263653002502289653002202314653002202336700001702358700001802375700001802393700001802411700001702429700001802446773011102464856008602575852000902661655001202670IND60593744120221123044926.0190516e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059374412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.01.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarbetta, A.10aInfluence of in vitro digestion process on polyphenolic profile of skin grape (cv. Italia) and on antioxidant activity in basal or stressed conditions of human intestinal cell line (HT-29)  ap. 878-884.  aWhite table grape cv. Italia is a typical component of the Mediterranean diet and a source of phenolic compounds, particularly abundant in the skin portion. The aim of this study was to characterize the phenolic profile of the table grape skin and to assess its stability after the in vitro digestion process. The main phenolic compounds identified by the HPLC-DAD analysis were: procyanidin B1, caftaric acid, catechin, coutaric acid, quercetin 3-glucuronide and quercetin 3-glucoside. All compounds showed a good stability after in vitro digestion (from 43 to 80%). Moreover, the influence of grape skin polyphenols on the modulation of ROS and GSH levels was evaluated in basal and in stressed conditions on human intestinal cells (HT-29). In basal conditions, a higher polyphenol concentrations exerted pro-oxidant effect corresponding to high ROS level and low GSH content. This effect was probably due to the polyphenolic oxidation in cell culture condition with consequent production of hydrogen peroxide. Otherwise, in stressed conditions, grape skin polyphenols exerted antioxidant effects up to 1.3 × 10−6 μg/g and restored the stress-related GSH reduction. The in vitro digestion process attenuated the biological effect of grape skin polyphenols on intestinal cell line (HT-29). In conclusion, grape skin polyphenols showed different behavior in relation to their concentrations and to the intracellular ROS levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3aantioxidant activity 3acaftaric acid 3acatechin 3acell culture 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestines 3aoxidation 3aprocyanidins 3aquercetin 3atable grapes 0aCAA 0aCMHP 0aDCFH-DA 0aFW 0aGI 0aGSH 0aMCB 0aROS 0aTPI 0aGrape 0aPolyphenols 0aDigestion process 0aIntestinal cell model 0aAntioxidant activity 0aIntracellular ROS 0aIntracellular GSH1 aNicassio, L.1 aD'Antuono, I.1 aCardinali, A.1 aLinsalata, V.1 aAttolico, G.1 aMinervini, F.0 tFood research international.g2018 Apr., v. 106 p.878-884dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.01.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145242044300166245010600609300001600715500001500731520126800746592002802014650001502042650002202057650002002079650001302099650001402112650002102126650001202147650001002159650001302169650002002182650001002202650001602212650001602228651001102244651001502255653002402270700001802294773009402312856008102406852000902487655001202496IND4435691620221118053323.0141217e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443569162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-009-0550-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBredehoeft, John10aTransport potentiel de contaminant dans l’aquifère régional carbonaté situé sous la montagne Yucca, Nevada, Etats-Unis Potencial transporte de contaminantes en el acuífero carbonático regional debajo de Yucca Mountain, Nevada, EEUU 美国内华达州犹卡山之下的区域灰岩含水层中潜在的污染物运移 Transporte potencial de contaminantes no aquífero carbonatado regional subjacente à Montanha Yucca, Nevada, EUA10aPotential contaminant transport in the regional Carbonate Aquifer beneath Yucca Mountain, Nevada, USA  ap. 775-789.  a2019-12-06  aYucca Mountain, Nevada is the site of the proposed US geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The repository is to be a mine, sited approximately 300 m below the crest of the mountain, in a sequence of variably welded and fractured mid-Miocene rhylolite tuffs, in the unsaturated zone, approximately 300 m above the water table. Beneath the proposed repository, at a depth of 2 km, is a thick sequence of Paleozoic carbonate rocks that contain the highly transmissive Lower Carbonate Aquifer. In the area of Yucca Mountain the Carbonate Aquifer integrates groundwater flow from north of the mountain, through the Amargosa Valley, through the Funeral Mountains to Furnace Creek in Death Valley, California where the groundwater discharges in a set of large springs. Data that describe the Carbonate Aquifer suggest a concept for flow through the aquifer, and based upon the conceptual model, a one-layer numerical model was constructed to simulate groundwater flow in the Carbonate Aquifer. Advective transport analyses suggest that the predicted travel time of a particle from Yucca Mountain to Death Valley through the Carbonate Aquifer might be as short as 100 years to as long 2,000 years, depending upon the porosity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonates 3asimulation models 3ahazardous waste 3aporosity 3amountains 3agroundwater flow 3avalleys 3afuels 3aaquifers 3acarbonate rocks 3adeath 3agroundwater 3awater table 3aNevada 3aCalifornia 0amathematical models1 aKing, Michael0 tHydrogeology journal.g2010 May, v. 18, no. 3 p.775-789dSpringer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-009-0550-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008700161500001900248520086700267592002801134650000901162650002301171650002401194650002701218650002001245650001201265650002501277650000901302700002401311700002201335700002001357700002001377700002001397773012201417856007401539852000901613655001201622IND60732187220221119094318.0210326e20210227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073218722DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130307722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlunno, Alessia 10aDiet in Rheumatoid Arthritis versus Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Any Differences?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn recent years, an increasing interest in the influence of diet in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) led to the publication of several articles exploring the role of food/nutrients in both the risk of developing these conditions in normal subjects and the natural history of the disease in patients with established RMDs. Diet may be a possible facilitator of RMDs due to both the direct pro-inflammatory properties of some nutrients and the indirect action on insulin resistance, obesity and associated co-morbidities. A consistent body of research has been conducted in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), while studies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are scarce and have been conducted mainly on experimental models of the disease.

The aim of the study is to determine the ecotoxicological effects of ZnO NPs on the survival and in the total hemocyte counts of Galleria mellonella L. 1758 (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) with two different methods (automated cell counter and hemocytometer). A toxicity test was performed to determine the lethal concentrations of ZnO NPs on larvae by force feeding method. After 24 h the treatment, LC₅₀ was 6.03 μg/10 µl and LC₉₉ was 12.86 μg/10 µl for force fed larvae according to probit assay. The NP that induced changes in the total hemocytes counts were counted by optical microscopy (larvae exposed to four different doses of ZnO NPs) and by automated cell counter. Analyses of total hemocyte counts of the insect were performed with four doses (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 μg/10 µl) <LC₅₀ at 24 h upon feeding larvae revealed that a number of hemocytes did not show significant changes in all treatments compared with control in the optical microscopy counting. The similar statistically insignificant counting results were also seen in the automated cell counting results. The percentage of the dead cells (10.01%) in the 5 μg/10 µl group was significantly higher than the control group (3.03%) and showed a statistically significant difference at 24 h in the optical microscopy count with trypan blue viability test.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGalleria mellonella 3aautomation 3adetergents 3aecotoxicology 3aforced feeding 3ahemocytes 3ainsects 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3alight microscopy 3ananoparticles 3aointments 3aproducts and commodities 3atoxicity 3aviability assays 3azinc oxide1 aÖZTÜRK, Şahlan1 aKÖRÜKÇÜ, Murat0 tEcotoxicology.g2019 Sept., v. 28, no. 7 p.801-808dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-019-02078-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245010800167520093500275592002801210650001101238650002101249650002201270650000901292650001501301650001301316650001301329653001501342653002001357653003801377653002601415700001601441700001701457700001501474700001801489773010601507856008701613852000901700655001201709IND60755297720221122041727.0211206e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075529772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1278102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Jiakai10aApplication of two-dimensional layered Mo-MOF@ppy with high valency molybdenum in lithium-ion batteries  aThis work demonstrates a facile synthesis of 2D layered Mo-MOF@ppy via reflux heating and coating methods as anode materials in the lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Mo-MOF with two-dimensional layered structure can accelerate the transfer of electrons inside the whole composite. Mo-MOF, as a precursor in the electrochemical reaction process, provides high-valence Mo binding more Li⁺, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance of the Mo-MOF. Meanwhile, the coated conducting polymer polypyrrole (ppy) can promote electron transfer and enhance the conductivity of the composite materials. Combining those merits, Mo-MOF@ppy has a better electrochemical performance than pure Mo-MOF. Mo-MOF@ppy can reach 930 mAh g⁻¹ at a current density of 100 mA g⁻ˡ and maintain 750 mAh g⁻ˡ at a current density of 500 mA g⁻ˡ after 200 cycles.

In Italy, voluntary programs to control MAP infection in dairy cattle are implemented in the Northern part of the country, where several studies have been carried out. Conversely, the disease status has not been fully investigated in the Southern regions. The aims of this study were to (i) determine the herd-level true prevalence (HTP) and (ii) the conditional within herd animal-level prevalence (CWHP) of JD in selected dairy cattle herds in Southern Italy. Serum samples were taken from 27 farms and analysed using a commercial ELISA test. A Bayesian model was fitted to the data. The estimated posterior mean of HPT was 0.46 (89 % CI 0.25−0.67), while the mean CWHP was 0.03 (89 % CI: 0.012–0.045). The results presented in this study call for designing and implementing an effective JD control program at national level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3ablood serum 3adairy cattle 3aparatuberculosis 3aveterinary medicine 3aItaly 0aMAP 0aPrevalence 0aDairy herds 0aInfectious disease 0aStatistical analysis1 aFanelli, Angela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8204-12301 aCordisco, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8131-55941 aTrotta, Adriana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0559-68491 aGalgano, Michela1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3386-48791 aCorrente, Marialaura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0164-67301 aBuonavoglia, Domenico1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3104-38310 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2022 Feb., v. 199 p.105552-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.1055523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03557naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010200165300001400267520206200281592002802343650001902371650001602390650001202406650001902418650001902437650000902456650002702465650001702492650002902509650002102538650002202559650001102581650001102592650001602603650001502619650001102634650002902645651001902674653003102693653001602724653003002740653002702770653002302797653001902820700001802839773008802857856008502945852000903030655001203039IND60607794820221122190738.0180830e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060779482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRečka, L.10aImpacts of carbon pricing, brown coal availability and gas cost on Czech energy system up to 2050  ap. 19-33.  aA dynamic partial equilibrium model, TIMES (​The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System), is built to optimize the energy system in a post-transition European country, the Czech Republic. The impacts of overall nine scenarios on installed capacity, capital and fuel costs, air quality pollutant emission, emission of CO2 and environmental and health damage are quantified for a period up to 2050. These scenarios are built around three different price sets of the EUA (EU allowance) to emit greenhouse gasses alongside a policy that retains the ban on brown coal mining in two Czech mines, a policy that will allow the re-opening of mining areas under this ban (i.e. within the territorial ecological limits), and a low natural gas price assumption. We found that the use of up until now dominant brown coal will be significantly reduced in each scenario, although reopening the coal mines will result in its smaller decline. With low EUA price, hard coal will become the dominant fuel in electricity generation, while nuclear will overtake this position with a 51% or even 65% share assuming the central price of EUA, or high EUA price, respectively. The low price of natural gas will result in an increasing gas share from an almost zero share recently up to about 42%. This stimulus does not however appear at all with low EUA price. Neither of these scenarios will achieve the renewable energy sources 2030 targets and only a high EUA price will lead to almost full de-carbonization of the Czech power system, with fossil fuels representing only 16% of the energy mix. The low EUA price will result in an increase in CO2 emissions, whereas the high EUA price will reduce CO2 emission by at least 81% compared to the 2015 reference level. Those scenarios that will result in CO2 emission reduction will also generate ancillary benefits due to reduction in air quality emissions, on average over the entire period, at least at 38€ per t of avoided CO2, whereas scenarios that will lead to CO2 increase will generate ancillary costs at least of 31€ per t CO2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aair quality 3acapital 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3acoal 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy costs 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3amining 3amodels 3anatural gas 3apollutants 3aprices 3arenewable energy sources 3aCzech Republic 0aEnergy system optimization 0aTIMES model 0aClimate change mitigation 0aEnvironmental benefits 0aAncillary benefits 0aCzech Republic1 aŠčasný, M.0 tEnergy.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 108 p.19-33dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010300166300001400269520137600283592002801659650001501687650002001702650001501722650003801737650001901775650001701794650002401811650001401835650003001849650001201879653002201891653001801913653003001931653001901961653002901980653002502009700001802034700002002052700001702072700001802089700001802107700001502125700001802140773010902158856008302267852000902350655001202359IND60553503420221120023726.0180831e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055350342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Kuang-Li10aNanoplasmonic biochips for rapid label-free detection of imidacloprid pesticides with a smartphone  ap. 88-95.  aThe widespread and intensive use of neonicotinoid insecticides induces negative cascading effects on ecosystems. It is desirable to develop a portable sensitive sensing platform for on-site screening of high-risk pesticides. We combined an indirect competitive immunoassay, highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biochip and a simple portable imaging setup for label-free detection of imidacloprid pesticides. The SPR biochip consists of several capped nanoslit arrays with different periods which form a spectral image on the chip. The qualitative and semiquantitative analyses of pesticides can be directly observed from the spot shift on the chip. The precise semiquantitative analyses can be further completed by using image processing in a smartphone. We demonstrate simultaneous detection of four different concentrations of imidacloprid pesticides. The visual detection limit is about 1ppb, which is well below the maximum residue concentration permitted by law (20ppb). Compared to the one-step strip assay, the proposed chip is capable of performing semiquantitative analyses and multiple detection. Compared to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, our method is label-free and requires simple washing steps and short reaction time. In addition, the label-free chip has a comparable sensitivity but wider working range than those labeling techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aecosystems 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimage analysis 3aimidacloprid 3alabeling techniques 3ascreening 3asurface plasmon resonance 3awashing 0aOptical biosensor 0aNanostructure 0aSurface plasmon resonance 0aSpectral image 0aImidacloprid insecticide 0aLabel-free detection1 aYou, Meng-Lin1 aTsai, Chia-Hsin1 aLin, En-Hung1 aHsieh, Shu-Yi1 aHo, Ming-Hsun1 aXu, Rujun,1 aWei, Pei-Kuen0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 75 p.88-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010400167300001600271520086200287592002801149650001901177650002901196650001101225650001001236650003601246650001701282650001201299650001601311650001301327650002701340650003601367653001701403653001701420653002301437653002101460653003601481700001701517700002301534700001701557700001901574700001801593700001901611700002001630773012801650856008501778852000901863655001201872IND60562065320221120193007.0170125e20170304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056206532DNAL7 a10.1080/09540105.2016.12513952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Ji-Soo10aAster yomena suppresses LPS-induced cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression  ap. 202-210.  aInflammation is a pathological process that is known to be involved in numerous diseases. Microbial infection or tissue injury activates inflammatory responses, resulting in the induction of proinflammatory proteins including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Aster yomena is used in traditional Korean remedies to treat cough, asthma, and insect bites. Here, we investigated the effects of A. yomena extract (EAY) on the expression of COX-2 and iNOS induced by LPS. EAY inhibited NF-κB activation and IκBα degradation induced by LPS. EAY suppressed LPS-induced COX-2 and iNOS expression which are the target genes regulated through NF-κB activation in macrophages. EAY also suppressed LPS-induced nitrite production. These results suggest that EAY has the potential to be developed as a potent anti-inflammatory drug.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIKappaB kinase 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3aasthma 3acough 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainsects 3amacrophages 3anitrites 3aprostaglandin synthase 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aAster yomena 0ainflammation 0anuclear factor-κB 0acyclooxygenase-2 0ainducible nitric oxide synthase1 aKim, Ah-Yeon1 aShin, Hyeon-Myeong1 aAhn, Sang-Il1 aShim, Hyun-Jin1 aNam, Kung-Woo1 aHwang, Kyung-A1 aYoun, Hyung-Sun0 tFood and agricultural immunology.g2017 Mar. 4, v. 28, no. 2 p.202-210dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45182x0954-01057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540105.2016.12513953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092024001900112024005600131040001800187100002200205245005500227300001800282500002000300520125100320592002801571650001401599650001501613650001701628650001701645650001001662650002201672650001901694650001401713650001201727650002301739650001501762650002101777650001601798650002101814650001901835650005501854650002301909650005401932650006501986650005402051700002402105773009902129852000902228856011102237856010602348961001202454655001202466IND4398349220221116153853.0170626e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439834922DNAL7 a10113/99512hdl7 a172492192pmid7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[2967:CRIASI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMäkelä, Annikki10aCrown ratio influences allometric scaling in trees  ap. 2967-2972.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAllometric theories suggest that the size and shape of organisms follow universal rules, with a tendency toward quarter‐power scaling. In woody plants, however, structure is influenced by branch death and shedding, which leads to decreasing crown ratios, accumulation of heartwood, and stem and branch tapering. This paper examines the impacts on allometric scaling of these aspects, which so far have been largely ignored in the scaling theory. Tree structure is described in terms of active and disused pipes arranged as an infinite branching network in the crown, and as a tapering bundle of pipes below the crown. Importantly, crown ratio is allowed to vary independently of crown size, the size of the trunk relative to the crown deriving from empirical results that relate crown base diameter to breast height diameter through crown ratio. The model implies a scaling relationship in the crown which reduces to quarter‐power scaling under restrictive assumptions but would generally yield a scaling exponent somewhat less than three‐quarters. For the whole tree, the model predicts that scaling between woody mass and foliage depends on crown ratio. Measurements on three boreal tree species are consistent with the model predictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallometry 3atree crown 3aforest trees 3awoody plants 3astems 3asimulation models 3aboreal forests 3aheartwood 3abiomass 3afractal dimensions 3aprediction 3amodel validation 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aBetula pendula 2aBetulaxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aModels, Biological 2aPiceaxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aPinus sylvestrisxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aTreesxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development.1 aValentine, Harry T.0 tEcology.g2006 Dec., v. 87, no. 12 p.2967-2972dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/99513Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87%5B2967:CRIASI%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle01832naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007400169300001600243520095800259592002801217650002201245650001101267650001201278650001201290700002201302773010001324856008601424990002301510852000901533655001201542IND60101601620221120045142.0141106e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010160162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhealeco.2011.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCawley, John14aThe medical care costs of obesity: An instrumental variables approach  ap. 219-230.  aThis paper is the first to use the method of instrumental variables (IV) to estimate the impact of obesity on medical costs in order to address the endogeneity of weight and to reduce the bias from reporting error in weight. Models are estimated using restricted-use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for 2000–2005. The IV model, which exploits genetic variation in weight as a natural experiment, yields estimates of the impact of obesity on medical costs that are considerably higher than the estimates reported in the previous literature. For example, obesity is associated with $656 higher annual medical care costs, but the IV results indicate that obesity raises annual medical costs by $2741 (in 2005 dollars). These results imply that the previous literature has underestimated the medical costs of obesity, resulting in underestimates of the economic rationale for government intervention to reduce obesity-related externalities.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenetic variation 3amodels 3aobesity 3asurveys1 aMeyerhoefer, Chad0 tJournal of health economics.g2012 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.219-230dElsevier B.V.x0167-62967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2011.10.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01508naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245004900171300001800220520058700238592002800825650002400853650002000877650002400897700001900921700001800940700002300958773011200981856008101093990002301174852000901197655001201206IND60104114620221116193145.0141107e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010411462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2011.05.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadenović, Stojan,12aA note on tvs-cone metric fixed point theory  ap. 2418-2422.  aIn this paper, the concept of set-valued contraction of Nadler type in the setting of tvs-cone spaces was introduced and a fixed point theorem in the setting of tvs-cone spaces with respect to a solid cone was proved.

The thermal decompositions, both pyrolysis and combustion, of these biomass components as well as a natural woody biomass (Acer saccharum) were investigated using High-Resolution Modulated TGA. The activation energies of each decomposition process were determined by Modulated TGA without any assumptions and mathematical model fitting. For the combustion of microcrystalline cellulose, the char residues underwent glowing ignition due to the presence of oxygen, and its first derivative of weight loss curve showed two thermal decomposition peaks, while only a single peak was observed for pyrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose in a nitrogen atmosphere. However, the effect of air was less evident in the thermal degradation of the Birchwood xylan. With air as the sample environment in the TGA experiment, the thermal decomposition of Organosolv lignin was simplified, and the onset of the primary decomposition shifted to temperatures greater than 300 °C, the decomposition zone became narrower, and the mass of residual solids at 600 °C was negligible. Since the sum of the TGA profiles (in air) of the three major biomass components closely matched the TGA profile (in air) of an actual wood sample (A. saccharum), the potential of using TGA to predict biomass compositions was indicated.  aPublisher supplied data 3amathematical models 3alignocellulose 3axylan 3anitrogen 3awood 3aactivation energy 3acellulose 3aweight loss 3aair 3acombustion 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3aAcer saccharum 3alignin 3aoxygen 3abiomass 0ahemicellulose1 aWinter, William T.1 aStipanovic, Arthur J.0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2012 Sept., v. 97, no. 9 p.1606-1615dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03611naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245006000170300001300230520230700243592002802550650002102578650002802599650001502627650000902642650002002651650001702671650001402688650001702702650001002719650001302729650001202742650002402754650001202778650001302790650001302803650001202816650001302828650000902841650001402850650002302864650002402887773010302911856008303014990002303097852000903120655001203129IND60104820120221116210148.0141107e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010482012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerry, Gerard T.10aGalactosemia: When is it a newborn screening emergency?  ap. 7-11.  aClassic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder of carbohydrate metabolism, due to a severe deficiency of the enzyme, galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT), that catalyzes the conversion of galactose-1-phosphate and uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPglucose) to uridine diphosphate galactose (UDPgalactose) and glucose-1-phosphate. Upon consumption of lactose in the neonatal period, the affected infants develop a potentially lethal disease process with multiorgan involvement. Since the advent of newborn screening (NBS) for galactosemia, we rarely encounter such overwhelmingly ill newborns. After ascertainment that the positive NBS indicates the possibility of galactosemia due to GALT deficiency, the critical question for the physician is whether the infant has the classic or a variant form of GALT deficiency, as classic galactosemia is a medical emergency. However, there are over 230 GALT gene mutations that have been detected around the world. Yet, most positive NBS tests are due to the Duarte biochemical variant condition or a simple false positive. In order to make the correct decision as well as provide informative counseling to parents of infants with a positive NBS, I utilize a relatively simple classification scheme for GALT deficiency. There are three basic forms of GALT deficiency: 1) classic galactosemia; 2) clinical variant galactosemia; and 3) biochemical variant galactosemia. The classic genotype is typified by Q188R/Q188R, the clinical variant by S135L/S135L and the biochemical variant by N314D/Q188R. In classic galactosemia, the erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity is absent or markedly reduced, the blood galactose and erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate levels are markedly elevated, and the patient is at risk to develop potentially lethal E. coli sepsis, as well as the long-term diet-independent complications of galactosemia. Patients with the clinical variant form require treatment but do not die from E. coli sepsis in the neonatal period. If the clinician suspects galactosemia, even if based on clinical findings alone, then the infant should be immediately placed on a lactose-restricted diet. The purpose of this review is to help the clinician make the correct therapeutic decision after an NBS test has returned positive for galactosemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acounseling 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3aerythrocytes 3agalactose 3agalactosemia 3agenes 3agenotype 3aglucose 3aglucose 1-phosphate 3alactose 3amutation 3aneonates 3aparents 3apatients 3arisk 3ascreening 3asepsis (infection) 3auridine diphosphate0 tMolecular genetics and metabolism.g2012 May, v. 106, no. 1 p.7-11dElsevier Inc.x1096-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.03.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03570naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245016300173300001600336520173200352592002802084650002302112650002202135650002102157650002102178650002702199650002602226650001602252650002202268650001502290650001302305650001302318650001102331650001102342650002302353650001002376650004902386650001002435650000902445650000902454650001402463650003702477650001102514650001302525650004402538650001102582650001102593650002202604650001802626650002402644650002302668650001502691650001002706650000902716773010102725856008602826990002302912852000902935655001202944IND60102456620221121180919.0141106e20130410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010245662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.12.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRefat, Moamen S.10aSpectroscopic and thermal degradation behavior of Cr(III), Mn(II), Fe(III), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes with thiopental sodium anesthesia drug  ap. 170-185.  aA new series of Cr(III), Mn(II), Fe(III), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes have been synthesized with thiopental sodium anesthesia drug. The elemental analyses of the complexes are confined to stoichiometry of the formulas [M(TPL)₃]⋅nH₂O (M=Cr(III) or Fe(III); n=6 or 5), [M(TPL)₂(H₂O)₂]⋅nH₂O (M=Mn(II), Co(II) or Ni(II); n=0 or 4), and [M(TPL)₂] (M=Cu(II) or Zn(II); n=2 or 0) respectively, where TPL is thiopental chelating agent. Structures have been discussed and suggested upon elemental analyses, infrared, Raman, electronic, electron spin resonance, ¹H NMR spectral data and magnetic studies. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was performed of metal complexes. The XRD patterns indicate crystalline nature for the complexes. The measured low molar conductance values in dimethylsulfoxide indicate that the complexes are non-electrolyte nature. Spectroscopic discussion refer that coordination take place through three types: CN (pyrimidine moiety) nitrogen and C2S (2-thiolate group) for Cr(III), Mn(II) and Fe(III), C6O (amido group) oxygen and C2S (2-thiolate group) for Co(II) and Ni(II), and Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions coordinated via CN (pyrimidine moiety) nitrogen, C2S (2-thiolate group) and C6O (amido group) oxygen, respectively. The thermal behavior (TG/DTG/DTA) of the complexes was studied and kinetic parameters were determined by Horowitz–Metzger and Coats–Redfern methods. The thiopental and its complexes have been screened for their antimicrobial (G⁺ and G⁻) bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungi (Aspergillus flavus and Candida albicans) activities by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aBacillus subtilis 3aCandida albicans 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanesthesia 3abacteria 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adrugs 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afungi 3aions 3airon 3amanganese 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anickel 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3asodium 3aspectral analysis 3astoichiometry 3athermal degradation 3athermal properties 3athiopental 3awater 3azinc0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2013 Apr. 10, v. 1037 p.170-185dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.12.0553Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01751naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245011200174300001600286520068600302592002800988650001501016650001001031650001001041650001601051650003101067650001801098650001901116650001301135650001101148700002101159773009901180856009001279990002301369852000901392655001201401IND60107583720221117180052.0141108e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010758372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2010.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Jung Kwon10aIron oxide-based superparamagnetic polymeric nanomaterials: Design, preparation, and biomedical application  ap. 168-189.  aRecent advances in the development and biological applications of polymeric nanomaterials embedded with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SIONPs) are summarized.

Glycated albumin (GA) reflects shorter-term glycemic control, as well as postprandial PG levels, as compared to HbA1c. In this study, we hypothesized that GA more strongly reflects long-term variations in PG levels than HbA1c, and compared the variability of HbA1c and that of GA in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: This study included 8 T1DM patients and 48 T2DM patients. Over a 1-year period, HbA1c and GA were measured every month and the mean values and coefficients of variation (CV) for each patient were calculated. RESULTS: In both T1DM and T2DM patients, the CV of GA was significantly higher than the CV of HbA1c. Both the CV of HbA1c and the CV of GA were significantly higher in the T1DM patients than in the T2DM patients. CONCLUSION: The annual variability in GA was greater than that in HbA1c. In addition, the annual variability in HbA1c and that in GA in the T1DM patients were greater than in the T2DM patients. Our findings suggest that GA more accurately reflects long-term variations in PG levels than HbA1c.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3ablood glucose 3aglycemic control 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients1 aMurai, Jun1 aMorita, Shinya1 aSaito, Hiroshi1 aKasayama, Soji0 tJournal of diabetes and its complications.g2013 , v. 27, no. 3 p.211-213dElsevier Inc.x1056-87277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2012.12.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008000168300001800248520141600266592002801682650001201710650001401722650001301736650001001749650001601759650001101775650002001786650001801806650001601824650001601840650001101856650000901867650000901876650003301885650001401918650001601932650000901948650001101957650001101968650001901979650001601998700002502014773008402039856008502123852000902208655001202217IND60109105620221118030348.0141109e20110530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010910562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2011.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIqbal, Zafar10aColorimetric analysis of water and sand samples performed on a mobile phone  ap. 1118-1123.  aAnalysis of water and sand samples was done by reflectance measurements using a mobile phone. The phone's screen served as light source and front view camera as detector. Reflected intensities for white, red, green and blue colors were used to do principal component analysis for classification of several compounds and their concentrations in water. Analyses of colored solutions and colorimetric reactions based on widely available chemicals were performed. Classification of iron(III), chromium(VI) and sodium salt of humic acid was observed using reflected intensities from blue and green light for concentrations 2–10mg/l. Addition of complex forming sodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacidic acid enabled the discrimination of Cu(II) ions in the 2–10mg/l concentration range based on reflection of red light. An alternate method using test strips for copper solutions with the phone as reader also demonstrated a detection limit of 2mg/l. Analysis of As(III) from 25 to 400μg/l based on reflection of red light was performed utilizing the bleaching reaction of tincture of iodine containing starch. Enhanced sensitivity to low concentrations of arsenic was obtained by including reflected intensities from white light in the analysis. Model colored sand samples representing discoloration caused by the presence of arsenic in groundwater were analyzed as a complementary method for arsenic detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3ableaching 3achromium 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3acopper 3adetection limit 3adiscoloration 3agroundwater 3ahumic acids 3aiodine 3aions 3airon 3aprincipal component analysis 3ared light 3areflectance 3asand 3asodium 3astarch 3awater analysis 3awhite light1 aBjorklund, Robert B.0 tTalanta.g2011 May 30, v. 84, no. 4 p.1118-1123dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2011.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010800168300001600276520160000292592002801892650001101920650001101931650001801942650001601960650001301976650002101989650001802010650001202028650001202040650001202052650001002064650002202074650001202096650001302108650001302121700001602134700002102150700001402171700001502185700001802200773010602218856008302324990002302407852000902430655001202439IND60104820320221116210516.0141107e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010482032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, T.B.10aPearson syndrome: Unique endocrine manifestations including Neonatal Diabetes and adrenal insufficiency  ap. 104-107.  aPURPOSE: Pearson syndrome is a very rare metabolic disorder that is usually present in infancy with transfusion dependent macrocytic anemia and multiorgan involvement including exocrine pancreas, liver and renal tubular defects. The disease is secondary to a mitochondrial DNA deletion that is variable in size and location. Endocrine abnormalities can develop, but are usually not part of the initial presentation. We report two patients who presented with unusual endocrine manifestations, neonatal diabetes and adrenal insufficiency, who were both later diagnosed with Pearson syndrome. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed. Confirmatory testing included: mitochondrial DNA deletion testing and sequencing of the breakpoints, muscle biopsy, and bone marrow studies. RESULTS: Case 1 presented with hyperglycemia requiring insulin at birth. She had several episodes of ketoacidosis triggered by stress and labile blood glucose control. Workup for genetic causes of neonatal diabetes was negative. She had transfusion dependent anemia and died at 24months due to multisystem organ failure. Case 2 presented with adrenal insufficiency and anemia during inturcurrent illness, requiring steroid replacement since 37months of age. He is currently 4years old and has mild anemia. Mitochondrial DNA studies confirmed a 4.9kb deletion in patient 1 and a 5.1kb deletion in patient 2. CONCLUSION: The patients reported highlight the importance of considering mitochondrial DNA disorders in patients with early onset endocrine dysfunction, and expand the knowledge about this rare mitochondrial disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3abiopsy 3ablood glucose 3abone marrow 3adiabetes 3aglycemic control 3ahyperglycemia 3ainfancy 3ainsulin 3aketosis 3aliver 3amitochondrial DNA 3amuscles 3apancreas 3apatients1 aDaniels, M.1 aPuthenveetil, G.1 aChang, R.1 aWang, R.Y.1 aAbdenur, J.E.0 tMolecular genetics and metabolism.g2012 May, v. 106, no. 1 p.104-107dElsevier Inc.x1096-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.01.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009700169300001800266500001500284520109200299592002801391650001901419650001601438650001001454650003701464650002201501650001401523650000901537650001701546650002601563650002101589650003701610650004401647650002101691650001401712650001901726653001801745700001901763700001301782700001901795700001701814773011101831856008501942852000902027655001202036IND60101287920221119193506.0141106e20110130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010128792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Zhongbiao10aDeactivation mechanism of PtOx/TiO₂ photocatalyst towards the oxidation of NO in gas phase  ap. 1053-1058.  a2019-12-04  aThis study has been undertaken to investigate the roles of PtO and PtO₂ deposits in photocatalytic oxidation of NO over Pt-modified TiO₂ catalysts. These photocatalysts were prepared by neutralization method and characterized by XRD, BET, XPS, TEM and FTIR. It was found that Pt dopant existed as PtO and PtO₂ particles in as-prepared photocatalysts. And these Pt dopants would change their oxidation states during the photocatalytic oxidation reaction. An in situ XPS study indicated that a portion of PtO₂ on the surface of Pt/TiO₂ was reduced to PtO under UV irradiation. The migration of electrons to PtO₂ particles could separate the electrons and holes, resulting in the improvement of photocatalytic activity. And the depletion of PtO₂ by electrons could lead to the deactivation of Pt/TiO₂ catalyst. Moreover, PtO particles could be corroded to form Pt²⁺ ions by HNO₃, which was one of the products of photocatalytic oxidation of NO. NO would adsorb on Pt²⁺ related sites to form Ptⁿ⁺–NO nitrosyls, retarding photocatalytic oxidation of NO to NO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneutralization 3anitric acid 3agases 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aelectrons 3aions 3anitric oxide 3aultraviolet radiation 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysts 0aphotocatalyst1 aSheng, Zhongyi1 aLiu, Yue1 aWang, Haiqiang1 aMo, Jiansong0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Jan. 30, v. 185, no. 2-3 p.1053-1058dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013500164300001600299500001500315520095100330592002801281650002901309650001101338650002801349650002201377650002301399653001401422700002001436700002801456700001701484773008101501856008401582852000901666655001201675IND60108154920221121065459.0141108e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010815492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2013.03.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Wook10aAnalysis of the effects of inverter ripple current on a photovoltaic power system by using an AC impedance model of the solar cell  ap. 150-157.  a2019-12-04  aMost of the solar cell models suggested so far mainly employ steady state modeling methods to estimate the characteristic I–V curve of a solar cell at a certain operating point. Thus a study on the dynamic characteristics of a solar cell can rarely be found. For the design of a high performance power conditioning unit, it is essential to have accurate information about the static and dynamic characteristics of the solar cell. In this study an AC impedance model of a solar cell module is developed using Impedance Spectroscopy and it is then used for evaluating the effects of the ripple current generated by a single phase inverter. Experimental results verify that the energy conversion efficiency of a photovoltaic power system may be significantly reduced when the 120 Hz ripple current generated by a single phase inverter is larger than a certain value and an appropriate limit value for the 120 Hz ripple current is also suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3arenewable energy sources 3amodels 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aenergy conversion 3aphotovoltaic cells 0aimpedance1 aDuong, Van-Huan1 aNguyễn, Thanh Tuấn,1 aChoi, Woojin0 tRenewable energy.g2013 Nov., v. 59 p.150-157dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2013.03.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02034naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001900159245008300178300001800261520104900279592002801328650001301356650004401369650002201413650001501435650001101450650001601461700001701477700001601494773010801510856009301618852000901711655001201720IND60105879820221117075558.0141108e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010587982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaléat, C.M.10aStudy on the phase separation of plasticised starch/poly(vinyl alcohol) blends  ap. 1930-1939.  aThe phase separation and the intermolecular interactions of a series of extruded plasticised starch (PlS)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) blends with various starch to PVOH ratios has been studied. Investigation on their thermo-mechanical behaviour indicated the existence of two phases: the low temperature transition was attributed to the PVOH-rich phase and the high temperature transition was assigned to the PlS-rich phase. An increase in the α -relaxation temperature of the PVOH-rich phase with the introduction of starch in the system suggested a small degree of miscibility. The water was also shown to partition unequally between both phases. High resolution solid-state NMR revealed slight variations between the different PlS/PVOH compositions, which could be related to either interactions between PVOH and starch chains or difference in short-range ordering (e.g. single helices). Proton spin-lattice relaxation time measurements confirmed the phase separation within the blend occurring, however, with a small degree of inter-mixing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3aseparation 3astarch 3atemperature1 aHalley, P.J.1 aTruss, R.W.0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2012 Oct., v. 97, no. 10 p.1930-1939dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012700172300001600299520108700315592002801402650002301430650001101453650001701464650001401481700001601495773010101511856008601612990002301698852000901721655001201730IND60102376020221116172743.0141106e20120314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010237602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2011.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArivazhagan, M.10aMolecular structure, vibrational spectroscopic, NBO, HOMO–LUMO and Mulliken analysis of 4-methyl-3-nitro benzyl chloride  ap. 111-120.  aThe FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra of 4-methyl-3-nitro benzyl chloride (MNBC) molecule have been recorded in the range of 4000–400cm⁻¹ and 3500–50cm⁻¹ respectively. The molecular geometry and vibrational frequencies in the ground state are calculated using the DFT/B3LYP method with 6-311+G (d, p) and 6-311++G (d, p) basis sets. The computed values of frequencies are scaled using a suitable scale factor to yield good coherence with the observed values. Most of the modes have wavenumbers in the expected range. The calculated HOMO–LUMO energy gap shows that charge transfer occur within the molecule. NBO analysis has been performed in order to elucidate charge transfers or conjugative interaction, the intra-molecule rehybridization and delocalization of electron density within the molecule. From the result of Mulliken population analysis, it is clear that the substitution of CH₂Cl atoms in the aromatic ring leads to a redistribution of electron density. The total energy distribution (TED) has also been calculated for each mode of the vibration of the molecule.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3aenergy 3aspectroscopy 3avibration1 aKavitha, R.0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2012 Mar. 14, v. 1011 p.111-120dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2011.12.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04332naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100001800181245009600199300001800295500001500313506007600328520153500404592002801939506003701967650001402004650002402018650002502042650002102067650001902088650001702107650002202124650001802146650001802164650003702182650001702219650001302236650002202249650001902271650002402290650001202314650000802326650002202334650001402356650002002370650001202390650006402402650001402466650001702480650001502497650004302512650002702555650006502582650001102647650006302658650006302721650004602784650000902830650006802839650004302907650000902950650006402959650002203023650005903045650001503104650003603119653001703155653001903172700002103191700001303212700002503225700001803250773013303268856008003401852000903481655001203490IND4488226820221207103020.0120320e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448822682DNAL7 a219308732pmid7 aPMC32327782pmcid7 a10.1128/AAC.00725-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Naveen10aReceptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors That Block Replication of Influenza A and Other Viruses  ap. 5553-5559.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have previously reported that two receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs), called AG879 and tyrphostin A9 (A9), can each block the replication of influenza A virus in cultured cells. In this study, we further characterized the in vitro antiviral efficacies and specificities of these agents. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) of each against influenza A was found to be in the high nanomolar range, and the selectivity index (SI = 50% cytotoxic concentration [CC50]/EC50) was determined to be >324 for AG879 and 50 for A9, indicating that therapeutically useful concentrations of each drug produce only low levels of cytotoxicity. Each compound showed efficacy against representative laboratory strains of both human influenza A (H1N1 or H3N2) and influenza B viruses. Importantly, no drug-resistant influenza virus strains emerged even after 25 viral passages in the presence of AG879, whereas viruses resistant to amantadine appeared after only 3 passages. AG879 and A9 each also exhibited potent inhibitory activity against a variety of other RNA and DNA viruses, including Sendai virus (Paramyxoviridae), herpes simplex virus (Herpesviridae), mouse hepatitis virus (Coronaviridae), and rhesus rotavirus (Reoviridae), but not against Pichinde virus (Arenaviridae). These results together suggest that RTKIs may be useful as therapeutics against viral pathogens, including but not limited to influenza, due to their high selectivity indices, low frequency of drug resistance, and broad-spectrum antiviral activities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRotavirus 3aMurine respirovirus 3aantiviral properties 3aantiviral agents 3aherpes simplex 3acytotoxicity 3aInfluenza A virus 3aCoronaviridae 3aHerpesviridae 3areceptor protein-tyrosine kinase 3atherapeutics 3atyrosine 3aenzyme inhibitors 3acultured cells 3aCali mammarenavirus 3aviruses 3aRNA 3avirus replication 3apathogens 3adrug resistance 2aAnimals 2aAntiviral Agentsxchemistryxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aCell Line 2aChick Embryo 2aCricetinae 2aDNA Virusesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxchemistryxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aHumans 2aInfluenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtypexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aInfluenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtypexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aInfluenza, Humanxdrug therapyxvirology. 2aMice 2aOrthomyxoviridae Infectionsxdrug therapyxmortalityxvirology. 2aRNA Virusesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aRats 2aReceptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aTreatment Outcome 2aTyrphostinsxchemistryxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aVero Cells 2aVirus Replicationxdrug effects 0aSendai virus 0aPichinde virus1 aSharma, Nishi R.1 aLy, Hinh1 aParslow, Tristram G.1 aLiang, Yuying0 tAntimicrobial agents and chemotherapy.g2011 Dec., v. 55, no. 12 p.5553-5559dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0066-48047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AAC.00725-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02088naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245016900167300001600336520095700352592002801309650002701337650001701364650001301381650002601394650001501420650001001435650001901445650001601464700001501480700001501495700001401510773008601524856008401610990002301694852000901717655001201726IND60103953220221118152205.0141107e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010395322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.12.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Jianxi14aThe effect of composition on Li₂(Mg₀.₃Zn₀.₇)Ti₃O₈–xTiO₂ microwave dielectric ceramics for low temperature co-fired ceramics technology application  ap. 168-171.  aThe effect of composition of Li₂(Mg₀.₃Zn₀.₇)Ti₃O₈–xTiO₂ (−0.36≤x≤0.36, for short LMZT) on sinterability, crystalline phase, microstructure and microwave dielectric properties of the ZnO–B₂O₃–SiO₂ (for short ZBS) glass doped samples was systematically investigated. It shows that as x is over zero, rutile phase was detected and the crystalline grain size of LMZT ceramics decrease abruptly. It was also found that the bulk density and the quality factor (Q×f) gradually decreased, dielectric constant (εᵣ) increased, the temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (τf) shifted to positive value with the increase of x value. When x=0.12, LMZT ceramics with 3wt% ZBS sintered at 900°C for 3h show excellent dielectric properties: εᵣ=25.1, Q×f=19,620GHz, τf=−2.3ppm/°C.

In order to clarify the health effects of airborne pollutant exposure, it would appear that toxicological evidence is needed to complement epidemiological observations to support by providing biological plausibility. The aim of this study is to manage air–liquid successive exposures to different pollutants such as a chemical pollutant (formaldehyde – FA), and a biological contaminant (Aspergillus fumigatus –Asp) using our in vitro model. Human alveolar cells (A549) were exposed at the air–liquid interface in an exposure module, firstly to an environmental level of FA (50μg/m³) (or air) for 30min, and 14h later to Asp (7×10⁸spores/m³) (or air) for 30min. After 10h post-incubation, cellular viability was assessed. Inflammation biomarkers (IL-8, MCP-1) were assayed by ELISA and by RT-PCR. Whatever the conditions, no cytotoxic effect was observed. FA followed by air exposure did not induce modification of production and expression of cytokines, confirming results with a unique FA exposure. Air followed by Asp exposure tended to induce IL-8 expression whereas IL-8 production tended to increase after FA and Asp exposure compared to FA and air exposure. The reaction of cells to sequential exposure to FA and Asp was moderate. These results show the feasibility of our model for sequential exposures to different types of environmental pollutants, allowing using it for preliminary assessment of cellular activity modification induced by airborne contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aair 3abiomarkers 3acytotoxicity 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aformaldehyde 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-8 3amodels 3apollutants 3arespiratory system 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviability1 aLeleu, Christopher1 aAchard, Sophie1 aFasseu, Magali1 aMenotti, Jean1 aMeneceur, Pascale1 aMomas, Isabelle1 aDerouin, Francis1 aSeta, Nathalie0 tToxicology letters.g2011 Nov. 10, v. 207, no. 1 p.53-59dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.07.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245009600171300001400267500001500281520086200296592002801158650002701186650002301213650002401236650000901260650002601269650001301295650002401308650001401332653001701346700002401363700002001387700002301407700002101430700001701451700002001468700001501488700001901503700002001522700001601542700001801558773010401576856008301680990002301763852000901786655001201795IND60104820520221116210213.0141107e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010482052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Yoshiyuki10aTherapeutic chaperone effect of N-Octyl 4-Epi-β-valienamine on murine GM₁-gangliosidosis  ap. 92-98.  a2019-12-04  aTherapeutic chaperone effect of a valienamine derivative N-octyl 4-epi-β-valienamine (NOEV) was studied in GM₁-gangliosidosis model mice. Phamacokinetic analysis revealed rapid intestinal absorption and renal excretion after oral administration. Intracellular accumulation was not observed after continuous treatment. NOEV was delivered to the central nervous system through the blood–brain barrier to induce high expression of the apparently deficient β-galactosidase activity. NOEV treatment starting at the early stage of disease resulted in remarkable arrest of neurological progression within a few months. Survival time was significantly prolonged. This result suggests that NOEV chaperone therapy will be clinically effective for prevention of neuronal damage if started early in life hopefully also in human patients with GM₁-gangliosidosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acentral nervous system 3abeta-galactosidase 3ablood-brain barrier 3amice 3aintestinal absorption 3apatients 3aoral administration 3aexcretion 0atherapeutics1 aIchinomiya, Satoshi1 aKurosawa, Mieko1 aMatsuda, Junichiro1 aOgawa, Seiichiro1 aIida, Masami1 aKubo, Takatoshi1 aTabe, Miho1 aItoh, Masayuki1 aHigaki, Katsumi1 aNanba, Eiji1 aOhno, Kousaku0 tMolecular genetics and metabolism.g2012 May, v. 106, no. 1 p.92-98dElsevier Inc.x1096-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.02.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01643naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012200167300001600289520061400305592002800919650001300947650000900960650001400969650001500983650001500998650001401013650001101027650001601038700001701054700001301071773009301084856008401177990002301261852000901284655001201293IND60103645920221120174518.0141106e20110131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010364592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2010.09.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Li-Xia10aLn₂Mo₃O₁₂ (Ln=La, Nd): A novel group of low loss microwave dielectric ceramics with low sintering temperature  ap. 164-166.  aLn₂Mo₃O₁₂ (Ln=La, Nd) ceramics with a defect scheelite related structure were prepared via a solid state reaction method.

STUDY DESIGN: Data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network randomized, controlled trial of whole-body hypothermia for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy were used for this secondary observational study. Infants (n = 204) had multiple blood gases recorded from birth to 12 hours of study intervention (hypothermia versus intensive care alone). The relationship between hypocarbia and outcome (death/disability at 18 to 22 months) was evaluated by unadjusted and adjusted analyses examining minimum PCO₂ and cumulative exposure to PCO₂ <35 mm Hg. The relationship between cumulative PCO₂ <35 mm Hg (calculated as the difference between 35 mm Hg and the sampled PCO₂ multiplied by the duration of time spent <35 mm Hg) and outcome was evaluated by level of exposure (none-high) using a multiple logistic regression analysis with adjustments for pH, level of encephalopathy, treatment group (±hypothermia), and time to spontaneous respiration and ventilator days; results were expressed as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Alternative models of CO₂ concentration were explored to account for fluctuations in CO₂. RESULTS: Both minimum PCO₂ and cumulative PCO₂ <35 mm Hg were associated with poor outcome (P < .05). Moreover, death/disability increased with greater cumulative exposure to PCO₂ <35 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: Hypocarbia is associated with poor outcome after hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood gases 3achildren 3aconfidence interval 3acumulative exposure 3adeath 3aencephalopathy 3ahuman development 3ahuman health 3ahypothermia 3amodels 3aneonatal development 3aneonates 3aobservational studies 3aodds ratio 3apH 3aregression analysis 2aCarbon Dioxidexblood 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypocapniaxetiologyxmortalityxtherapy. 2aHypothermia, Inducedxmethods 2aHypoxia-Ischemia, Brainxcomplicationsxmortalityxtherapy. 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMale 2aSurvival Rate 2aTreatment Outcome 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology.1 aShankaran, Seetha1 aLaptook, Abbot R.1 aLanger, John C.1 aBara, Rebecca1 aEhrenkranz, Richard A.1 aGoldberg, Ronald N.1 aDas, Abhik1 aHiggins, Rosemary D.1 aTyson, Jon E.1 aWalsh, Michele C.2 aEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2011 May, v. 158, no. 5 p.752-758.e1dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2010.10.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01531naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010300174300001800277520047200295592002800767650001300795650001400808650002300822650001600845650001200861650001400873650001400887700002000901700002300921700001800944700002900962773009700991856008401088852000901172655001201181IND60109732720221119053403.0141109e20110330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010973272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.01.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoukachabia, Mourad10aScreening method for the evaluation of asymmetric catalysts for the reduction of aliphatic ketones  ap. 1485-1489.  aATH reductions of aliphatic ketones in water catalyzed by ruthenium coordinated by prolinamide ligands produce alcohols with moderate enantiomeric excesses in most cases.

The review is divided into two main parts: systems enabling crosslinking at room temperature and those for which crosslinking occurs at intermediate temperatures (<150°C). In the first part, various key functional groups can be used, such as (i) carboxylic acid involving reactions with compounds that bear carbodiimide or aziridine functions; (ii) acetoacetyl groups (with isocyanate, activated alkenes, aldehyde, amine functions); (iii) reactions involving activated amines with carbonyl functions (aldehydes, ketones, etc.); (iv) species bearing acetals as pH-sensitive crosslinking agents since they are stable in basic medium but they can self react under acidic conditions; (v) acrylamide functions which are able to self-crosslink; (vi) crosslinking agents able to react with water (such as species that bear a poly(alkoxy)silane for sol–gel process) and derivatives containing isocyanate functions and (vii) systems that require oxygen, for example polymers bearing double bonds, boranes for generating hydroperoxides and acetylenic functions which undergo acetylenic coupling. The second series of systems, used at higher temperatures (yet below 150°C) involving the following key functions: (i) carboxylic acid that react with oxazoline, or epoxide function where specific catalysts are necessary; (ii) alcohols reacting with protected urethanes, azlactones and methylol amide (for coating applications); (iii) azetidines (obtained from a cyclic amine onto an activated double bond) which self-crosslink; (iv) reversible Diels–Alder reaction (such as furane/bismaleimide reaction), and (v) Huisgen reactions between azido and triple bond. Various examples are presented, along with a discussion of their properties and applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aacrylamides 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3aalkenes 3aamines 3aboranes 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3across-linking reagents 3acrosslinking 3ahydroperoxides 3aketones 3aoxygen 3apolymers 3asol-gel processing 3atemperature1 aBoutevin, Bernard1 aAméduri, B.,0 tProgress in polymer science.g2011 Feb., v. 36, no. 2 p.191-217dElsevier Ltdx0079-67007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2010.08.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002000159245015000179300001800329520094400347592002801291650002101319650001101340650001401351650001901365650002301384650001301407650002401420650004401444650000701488650001501495650001301510650002001523650001801543650001601561650001301577700002501590700002301615700001901638700003101657773010801688856009301796852000901889655001201898IND60105880120221121012239.0141108e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010588012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgach, Mickaël10aCharacterization, stability and ecotoxic properties of readily biodegradable branched oligoesters based on bio-sourced succinic acid and glycerol  ap. 1956-1963.  aBranched oligoesters, based on glycerol and bio-sourced succinic acid, with various controllable sizes and topologies are prepared without solvent nor catalyst and investigated using a modified A₂+B₃ approach (A₂+B’B₂). They are characterized by quantitative ¹³C NMR (topology and size), acid values (esterification advancement) and size exclusion chromatography (size). Modified mathematical models based on Frey relations are proposed to determine the DPₙ¯ and the average number of dendritic units per molecule (DN) of the synthesized oligoesters and other oligoesters and polyesters. Biodegradability and stability of the oligomers in bulk at various temperatures and in solution at various concentrations, pH and temperatures are reported. This study underlines the relative impacts of pH, concentration, temperature, formulation and topology on the stability of non-ecotoxic readily biodegradable branched oligoesters.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3aesterification 3agel chromatography 3aglycerol 3amathematical models 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apolyesters 3asolvents 3astable isotopes 3asuccinic acid 3atemperature 3atopology1 aDelbaere, Stéphanie1 aMarinkovic, Sinisa1 aEstrine, Boris1 aNardello-Rataj, Véronique0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2012 Oct., v. 97, no. 10 p.1956-1963dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.03.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245016400171300001600335520156700351592002801918650001301946650001601959650001601975650002001991650002802011650001502039650001002054650001702064650001002081650001402091650003102105650000802136650004302144650001302187650002102200650002802221650001002249700002202259700002402281700002102305700002902326700002102355700002302376710006202399773011002461856008602571990002302657852000902680655001202689IND60101152320221122135247.0141106e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010115232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2012.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfghahi, Hanri10aOngoing treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-blocking agents does not predict normoalbuminuric renal impairment in a general type 2 diabetes population  ap. 229-234.  aAIM: To examine the prevalence and the clinical characteristics associated with normoalbuminuric renal impairment (RI) in a general type 2 diabetes (T2D) population. METHODS: We included 94 446 patients with T2D (56% men, age 68.3±11.6years, BMI 29.6±5.3kg/m², diabetes duration 8.5±7.1years; means±SD) with renal function (serum creatinine) reported to the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR) in 2009. RI was defined as estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR)<60ml/min/1.73m² and albuminuria as a urinary albumin excretion rate (AER)>20μg/min. We linked the NDR to the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, and the Swedish Cause of Death and the Hospital Discharge Register to evaluate ongoing medication and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: 17% of the patients had RI, and 62% of these patients were normoalbuminuric. This group of patients had better metabolic control, lower BMI, lower systolic blood pressure and were more often women, non-smokers and more seldom had a history of cardiovascular disease as compared with patients with albuminuric RI. 28% of the patients with normoalbuminuric RI had no ongoing treatment with any RAAS-blocking agent. Retinopathy was most common in patients with RI and albuminuria (31%). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with type 2 diabetes and RI were normoalbuminuric despite the fact that 25% of these patients had no ongoing treatment with RAAS-blocking agents. Thus, RI in many patients with type 2 diabetes is likely to be caused by other factors than diabetic microvascular disease and ongoing RAAS-blockade.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3aalbuminuria 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acardiovascular diseases 3acreatinine 3adeath 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aexcretion 3aglomerular filtration rate 3amen 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aretinal diseases 3asystolic blood pressure 3awomen1 aMiftaraj, Mervete1 aSvensson, Ann-Marie1 aHadimeri, Henrik1 aGudbjörnsdottir, Soffia1 aEliasson, Björn1 aSvensson, Maria K.2 aon behalf of the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR)0 tJournal of diabetes and its complications.g2013 , v. 27, no. 3 p.229-234dElsevier Inc.x1056-87277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2012.10.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01929naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008500169300001600254520100700270592002801277650001301305650002601318650001101344650001301355700001401368700001301382700001701395773008701412856008401499990002301583852000901606655001201615IND60104039020221117233445.0141107e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010403902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.07.1222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhuoran10aEffects of different bond agents on commercially pure Ti-porcelain bond strength  ap. 214-216.  aThe effects of different brands' bond agents on the cpTi–porcelain bond strength was investigated in this study. The elemental composition and weight percentage of the three bond agents (Super Ti22, Duceratin Kiss, Titankeramik) for titanium were evaluated. The adhesion between titanium and porcelain with or without bond agent was measured by the three-point bending test. Then the cpTi–porcelain interfaces were characterized. All of the three bond agents were SiO₂-based and mixed with different oxides. The bond strengths of Super Ti22 and Duceratin with bond agent were significantly higher than those without bond agent (p<0.05). There was no statistical difference when Titankeramik bond agent was used (p>0.05). The interfaces of Super Ti22 and Duceratin with bond agent were compact, while there were visible cracks and pores at the interfaces of the other groups. The results show that the bond agent can improve the cpTi–porcelain bond strength and may be suitable for clinical use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aelemental composition 3aoxides 3atitanium1 aDan, Fei,1 aBa, Yama1 aZhang, Yumei0 tMaterials letters.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 109 p.214-216dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2013.07.1223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245012900213300001800342500001500360506007600375520136200451592002801813506003701841650001501878650001801893650002101911650001401932650001301946650001301959650002601972650001901998650001402017650001202031650002002043650001702063650001402080650003402094653001802128700001802146700002302164700002002187700001702207700003102224700001502255700001802270700002502288700002102313700001902334700001902353700002002372700002602392773008502418856008502503852000902588655001202597IND60111218120221207112753.0141109e20120907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011121812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.06.0292doi7 aPMC34257102pmcid7 a227324292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolton, Diane L.10aPriming T-cell responses with recombinant measles vaccine vector in a heterologous prime-boost setting in non-human primates  ap. 5991-5998.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLicensed live attenuated virus vaccines capable of expressing transgenes from other pathogens have the potential to reduce the number of childhood immunizations by eliciting robust immunity to multiple pathogens simultaneously. Recombinant attenuated measles virus (rMV) derived from the Edmonston Zagreb vaccine strain was engineered to express simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag protein for the purpose of evaluating the immunogenicity of rMV as a vaccine vector in rhesus macaques. rMV-Gag immunization alone elicited robust measles-specific humoral and cellular responses, but failed to elicit transgene (Gag)-specific immune responses, following aerosol or intratracheal/intramuscular delivery. However, when administered as a priming vaccine to a heterologous boost with recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 expressing the same transgene, rMV-Gag significantly enhanced Gag-specific T lymphocyte responses following rAd5 immunization. Gag-specific humoral responses were not enhanced, however, which may be due to either the transgene or the vector. Cellular response priming by rMV against the transgene was highly effective even when using a suboptimal dose of rAd5 for the boost. These data demonstrate feasibility of using rMV as a priming component of heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimens for pathogens requiring strong cellular responses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atransgenes 3aT-lymphocytes 3ahumoral immunity 3aserotypes 3avaccines 3aaerosols 3aMeasles morbillivirus 3aMacaca mulatta 3apathogens 3aviruses 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3achildhood 3aSimian immunodeficiency virus 0aMeasles virus1 aSantra, Sampa1 aSwett-Tapia, Cindy1 aCusters, Jerome1 aSong, Kaimei1 aBalachandran, Harikrishnan1 aMach, Linh1 aNaim, Hussein1 aKozlowski, Pamela A.1 aLifton, Michelle1 aGoudsmit, Jaap1 aLetvin, Norman1 aRoederer, Mario1 aRadošević, Katarina0 tVaccine.g2012 Sept. 7, v. 30, no. 41 p.5991-5998dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01583naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245006300174300001600237520057700253592002800830650001600858650002200874650001300896650001700909650001400926650001100940650001300951650001600964700002300980700002101003773009301024856008401117990002301201852000901224655001201233IND60103646120221120164114.0141106e20110131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010364612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2010.10.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlemkaite, Kristina10aReconstitution effect of Mg/Ni/Al layered double hydroxide  ap. 388-391.  aLayered double hydroxide (LDH) having a different cation (Mg, Ni, Al) composition was successfully synthesized by the low supersaturation method.

S33.  aBACKGROUND: Admissions to intensive care units (ICUs) are generally associated with an increased risk of nosocomial infections. No data have been reported for the incidence and determinants of these infections in patients admitted to ICUs in the Gaza Strip, occupied Palestinian territory. Therefore, the frequency of nosocomial infections in patients admitted to the largest ICU in the Gaza Strip at Al-Shifa Hospital was retrospectively assessed. METHODS: Systematic sampling was used to select the medical file of every tenth patient admitted to the ICU at Al-Shifa Hospital from Jan 1, 2006, to June 30, 2009, from the hospital's archive. All available files were included irrespective of the patient's age. Incomplete files and those of patients admitted from another ICU or who developed febrile illness before or on admission to the ICU were excluded. Information about patients was collated and entered into SPSS (version 19.0). The frequency distribution of the variables was analysed and the χ² test was used to assess differences between patients including in the duration of stay, illnesses, and the outcome of care. The study was approved by the administration of Al-Shifa Hospital. FINDINGS: Of 206 patients (mean age 36 years [SD 25]) admitted to the ICU, whose medical files were selected, 128 (62%) were men. The mean period of stay at the ICU was 6·2 days (8·7). 55 (27%) patients stayed in the ICU for up to 1 day; 43 (21%) for 2–3 days; 72 (35%) for 4–7 days; 19 (9%) for 8–14 days; and the remaining 17 (8%) for more than 2 weeks. 50 (24%) patients had nosocomial infections—28 (56%) pneumonia, seven (14%) wound infections, seven (14%) multiple causes, three (6%) bacteraemia, three (6%) undetermined, and two (4%) infections related to the urinary tract. The causative organisms of the nosocomial infections were pseudomonas in 15 (30%) patients, klebsiella in eight (16%), acinetobacter in six (12%), Escherichia coli in five (10%), staphylococci in two (4%), Enterococcus faecalis in one (2%), and more than one microorganism in six (12%); the causative microorganisms were not identified in seven (14%) patients. 29 (81%) of 36 patients who stayed in the ICU for more than 1 week had nosocomial infections compared with 15 (21%) of 72 who stayed from 4 days to 1 week, and six (6%) of 98 who stayed for up to 3 days (p<0·0001 for overall difference between groups). The risk of nosocomial infections was increased in some groups: 13 (19%) of 68 patients with an internal medical diagnosis, 12 (19%) of 64 admitted for post-surgical care, ten (20%) of 50 admitted for post-neurosurgical care, five (38%) of 13 admitted after being resuscitated for cardiopulmonary arrest, and ten (91%) of 11 with multiple trauma developed nosocomial infections (p<0·0001). The risk of death was higher in the 50 patients who acquired nosocomial infections than in the 156 who did not (42%vs 21%; attributable risk percentage 50%, 95% CI 17–83; p=0·013). INTERPRETATION: The high frequency and attributable risk percentage of mortality of nosocomial infections in the ICU at Al-Shifa Hospital indicate the need for additional preventive and control measures and a surveillance system for these infections in the ICUs of all hospitals in the Gaza Strip.

The device is a superposition of four Hele Shaw cells for producing a cascade of granular flows that enhances the segregation process. After the flow cascade, the concentration of each granular species is measured in the different cells. From these concentrations, a parameter p that characterizes the ability of the mixture to segregate is calculated. The physical model used to calculate this parameter p is presented. Finally, the method is validated with a series of experiments performed with common granular materials. Relevant parameters behind segregation are evidenced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequipment 3aequipment performance 3agranules 3amodels 3apowders1 aBoschini, F.1 aCloots, R.1 aVandewalle, N.0 tPowder technology.g2013 Jan., v. 234 p.32-36dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2012.09.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245007100175300001600246520085700262592002801119650001401147650001801161650002501179650001901204650001001223650001501233650002301248700001701271700002101288700001801309700001901327700002201346700001801368773009901386856009001485990002301575852000901598655001201607IND60107584220221122081330.0141108e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010758422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2010.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Byung-Soo10aDesign of artificial extracellular matrices for tissue engineering  ap. 238-268.  aThe design of artificial extracellular matrix (ECM) is important in tissue engineering because artificial ECM regulates cellular behaviors, including proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation. Artificial ECMs have several functions in tissue engineering, including provision of cell-adhesive substrate, control of three-dimensional tissue structure, and presentation of growth factors, cell-adhesion signals, and mechanical signals. Design criteria for artificial ECMs vary considerably depending on the type of the engineered tissue. This article reviews the materials and methods that have been used in fabrication of artificial ECMs for engineering of specific tissues, including liver, cartilage, bone, and skin.

However, it is not clear effect of oxidative stress on pharmacokinetics. Organic anion transporting polypeptides (human: OATPs, rodent: Oatps) are important for uptake of endogenous and exogenous compounds into hepatocytes. Thus, alteration of OATPs/Oatps expression level may affect pharmacokinetics of various drugs. In this study, we investigated the alteration of OATPs/Oatps expression levels and function by oxidative stress, and the effect of alteration of those on pharmacokinetics of a typical OATPs/Oatps substrate pravastatin. OATPs/Oatps expression levels and function were altered by H₂O₂-induced oxidative stress in in vitro experiments. The alteration of Oatps expression by oxidative stress also occurred in in vivo experiments. Oatp1a1, Oatp1a4 and Oatp1b2 expression in the liver were decreased in rats fed powdery diet containing 2% inosine, which induces oxidative stress through activation of xanthine oxidase, for 1 day. The decrease in Oatps expression levels by oxidative stress caused the suppression of pravastatin uptake to the liver, and resulted in high plasma concentration of pravastatin and low biliary excretion. In conclusion, oxidative stress induces alteration of OATPs/Oatps expression and function in hepatocytes, resulting in alteration of pharmacokinetics of their substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3adrugs 3aexcretion 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3aliver 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3apharmacokinetics 3apolypeptides 3arats 3areactive oxygen species 3axanthine oxidase1 aOgura, Jiro1 aKuwayama, Kaori1 aKoizumi, Takahiro1 aSasaki, Shunichi1 aTerada, Yusuke1 aKobayashi, Masaki1 aYamaguchi, Hiroaki1 aIseki, Ken0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Dec. 31, v. 458, no. 2 p.262-271dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.10.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013600171300001800307520145300325592002801778650001601806650001001822650001601832650002301848650001901871650001001890650001601900650001201916650001301928650000701941650002601948650001601974700002101990700001802011700002102029700002302050700002402073700002102097773010402118856008502222852000902307655001202316IND60100378120221122054706.0141105e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010037812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.03.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYano, Shigekazu10aEngineering the substrate specificity of Alcaligenesd-aminoacylase useful for the production of d-amino acids by optical resolution  ap. 3247-3252.  ad-Aminoacylase from Alcaligenes xylosoxydans subsp. xylosoxydans A-6 (AxD-NAase) offers a novel biotechnological application, the production of d-amino acid from the racemic mixture of N-acyl-dl-amino acids. However, its substrate specificity is biased toward certain N-acyl-d-amino acids. To construct mutant AxD-NAases with substrate specificities different from those of wild-type enzyme, the substrate recognition site of the AxD-NAase was rationally manipulated based on computational structural analysis and comparison of its primary structure with other d-aminoacylases with distinct substrate specificities. Mutations of amino acid residues, Phe191, Leu298, Tyr344, and Met346, which interact with the side chain of the substrate, induced marked changes in activities toward each substrate. For example, the catalytic efficiency (kcₐₜ/Kₘ) of mutant F191W toward N-acetyl-d-Trp and N-acetyl-d-Ala was enhanced by 15.6- and 1.5-folds, respectively, compared with that of the wild-type enzyme, and the catalytic efficiency (kcₐₜ/Kₘ) of mutant L298A toward N-acetyl-d-Trp was enhanced by 4.4-folds compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. Other enzymatic properties of both mutants, such as pH and temperature dependence, were the same as those of the wild-type enzyme. The F191W mutant in particular is considered to be useful for the enzymatic production of d-Trp which is an important building block of some therapeutic drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcaligenes 3aacids 3aamino acids 3acatalytic activity 3achromatography 3adrugs 3aengineering 3amutants 3amutation 3apH 3asubstrate specificity 3atemperature1 aHaruta, Hiroyuki1 aIkeda, Takuya1 aKikuchi, Takeshi1 aMurakami, Masahiro1 aMoriguchi, Mitsuaki1 aWakayama, Mamoru0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 879, no. 29 p.3247-3252dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.03.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007700168300001600245520140200261592002801663650002001691650001801711650001101729700002001740700002001760700001701780773010301797856008501900990002301985852000902008655001202017IND60101674520221120143942.0141106e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010167452DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-6058(13)60441-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCHE, Cui-cui10aExperimental study by PIV of swirling flow induced by trapezoid-winglets  ap. 919-928.  aThe characteristics of the longitudinal vortex induced by trapezoid-winglets in a circular tube are investigated by the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) Technique with flow Reynolds number in the range of 500–13 000. In the experimental test section, four trapezoid-winglets are fixed symmetrically on the tube wall in two different ways: up-flow and down-flow. The results show that a counter-rotating vortex pair is formed behind each winglet and they distribute as a symmetrical vortex array in the transverse section. Between the two vortexes in a vortex pair the fluid flows towards the wall in the up-flow winglet case and away from the wall in the down-flow winglet case, corresponding also to the regions of peak values of the velocity components normal to the mainstream. Both of the flow patterns enhance the velocity in the near wall region, leading to the intensification of the transverse mixing and the mass transfer in the tube. With Reynolds number increasing, the flow maintains the vortex pattern in the case of the up-flow winglets, indicating better persistence of the longitudinal vortex, while the vortexes in the case of the down-flow winglets are more scattered and tend to breaking into small eddies. The trapezoid winglet shows the preferable turbulent disturbance characteristics in the tube and the experimental results provide benchmark data for further CFD studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3amass transfer 3amixing1 aTIAN, Mao-cheng1 aZHANG, Guan-min1 aLENG, Xue-li0 tJournal of Hydrodynamics, Ser.B.g2013 Dec., v. 25, no. 6 p.919-928dElsevier Ltdx1001-60587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-6058(13)60441-23Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01257naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010700168300001600275520039200291592002800683650002300711650002300734650001100757650001200768700001300780773009300793856008400886852000900970655001200979IND60109884520221119223242.0141109e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010988452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.11.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Di-Han10aRhodium(I)-catalyzed [3+2] intramolecular cycloaddition of alkylidenecyclopropane–propargylic esters  ap. 487-490.  aAn interesting rhodium(I)-catalyzed [3+2] intramolecular cycloaddition of alkylidenecyclopropanes 1 containing propargylic esters has been described in this context.

The results suggest that: (1) both vanadium oxide and tungsten oxide (loadings ≤0.5mmol/100m² TS) are highly dispersed on TS support. (2) The reduction temperature of vanadium species becomes higher due to the formation of the V–O–W bonds. (3) With the loading amounts of WO₃ increasing, the amounts of the Brønsted acid sites increase, while the amounts of Lewis acid sites decrease. The strength of Brønsted acid sites is little influenced by the tungsten species which is further proved by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results. The adsorption of NO is little changed after WO₃ addition. Further increase of WO₃ (loadings≥1.0mmol/100m² TS) results in the formation of crystalline WO₃ and they will cover the vanadium oxide species on the surface of the catalysts. (4) The activity of “NO+NH₃+O₂” reaction is tightly related to the amounts of the Brønsted acid sites: the higher SCR activities should be attributed to the larger amounts of Brønsted acid sites when WO₃ are highly dispersed. When the crystalline WO₃ form, they cover the surface of the catalysts, and lead to the decrease of the activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLewis acids 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3anitric oxide 3atemperature 3atungsten oxide 3avanadium1 aDong, Lihui1 aYu, Wujiang1 aLiu, Lichen1 aLi, Hao1 aGao, Fei1 aDong, Lin1 aChen, Yi0 tJournal of Molecular Catalysis.

Aliphatic poly(urethane-amine) (PUA) was employed as the thermal-responsive composition in the hybrid membranes. The hybrid membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analyzer. The interaction between PAA and aliphatic PUA contributed the formation of compact CaCO₃ microparticles and the high drug loading efficiency of the hybrid membranes. By adjusting the pressure and reaction time of the biomineralization process, sustained drug release property could be achieved from the hybrid membranes. The results indicated that the compact CaCO₃ microparticles could hinder the permeability of the encapsulated drug and reduce the drug release effectively. Moreover, the thermal-sensitivity of aliphatic PUA and pH-sensitivity of alginate matrix would preserve after the biomineralization process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aartificial membranes 3abiomineralization 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbon dioxide 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aenergy 3apH 3apermeability 3apolyacrylic acid 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry1 aShi, Jin1 aDu, Chao1 aChen, Qun1 aCao, Shaokui0 tJournal of membrane science.g2013 Apr. 15, v. 433 p.39-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2013.01.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245016700161300001600328500001500344520116600359592002801525650002001553650002301573650001201596650001701608650001201625650003101637650001601668650001301684650002201697653001701719700001501736700001201751700001801763773008801781856008101869990002301950852000901973655001201982IND60108796020221117235917.0141108e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010879602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2013.07.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanan10aHighly sensitive fluorescent sensor for mercury (II) ion based on layer-by-layer self-assembled films fabricated with water-soluble fluorescent conjugated polymer  ap. 772-777.  a2019-12-04  aIn this paper, a simple and sensitive Hg (II) sensor based on the water-soluble fluorescent conjugated polymer multilayer films was developed. The multilayer films were fabricated successfully utilizing layer-by-layer self-assembly technology via the electrostatic interaction between polycation electrolyte PDDA and sulfonic group anion surrounded conjugated polymer PPESO₃. In the presence of Hg (II) ion, the photoluminescence (PL) of PDDA/PPESO₃ multilayer films quenched effectively without obvious maximum PL emission wavelength shift. The PL intensity ratio I₀/I (I₀ and I are the fluorescence intensity of PDDA/PPESO₃ multilayer films in the absence and presence of Hg(II) ion, respectively) was proportional to the concentration of Hg (II) in the concentration ranges of 2.0×10⁻⁷ to 3.0×10⁻⁵molL⁻¹. The detection limit (LOD) for Hg (II) was 1.0×10⁻⁷molL⁻¹. The proposed film sensor was successfully applied for the determination of Hg (II) in several water samples with satisfactory reproducibility and accuracy.

In this article, the macro-scale EMMS model was coupled with a two-fluid method (TFM) elaborated by the meso-scale EMMS model resolving sub-grid scale heterogeneity to simulate the hydrodynamics of circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers. The overall flow distribution under the steady state was approximately predicted by the macro-scale EMMS model, which serves as the initial condition for meso-scale TFM simulations reproducing the dynamic behavior of heterogeneous gas–solid flows. Using the solid circulation flux as criterion, it was shown that this coupling approach can significantly reduce the time required to reach the statistically steady state, as compared to the packed bed or homogeneously dispersed initial condition.

Although EMA and EHMA resemble each other in structure, EHMA propagates faster in bulk due to the presence of intermolecular hydrogen-bonds, which tend to facilitate the approach of the propagating species. This falls in contrast with the experimentally observed lower propagation rates of EHMA in ethanol compared to toluene. Calculations show that the 2.28 rate acceleration in toluene is governed by the ratio of the pre-exponential factors, which reflect the entropies of activation, in both media. The polar protic solvent ethanol has a disruptive effect via hydrogen-bonding on the 6-membered ring shape of EHMA monomers thus decreasing the entropy of activation of the reaction. In the case of toluene, there are no special interactions with the hydrophobic solvent, the entropy of activation is higher than in ethanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aentropy 3aethanol 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asolvents 3atoluene1 aCatak, Saron1 aSpeybroeck, Veronique van,1 aWaroquier, Michel1 aAviyente, Viktorya0 tPolymer.g2012 July 6, v. 53, no. 15 p.3211-3219dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2012.05.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245017900172300001600351520183300367592002802200650001002228650002002238650001502258650001002273650002302283650001102306650001602317650001102333650001402344650001702358650000902375651001102384653000802395653001902403653001702422653001302439653001102452653001402463700002402477700002502501700002102526700002602547773010702573856008802680852000902768655001202777IND60111612520221118183418.0190319e20130210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011161252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2012.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPie, Marcio R.10aUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying the distribution of microendemic montane frogs (Brachycephalus spp., Terrarana: Brachycephalidae) in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest  ap. 165-176.  aThe small geographical range of highly endemic species is an important factor to be considered in conservation initiatives because it can increase their risk of extinction, as well decrease their probability of discovery. In this study, we use environmental niche modeling (ENM) to investigate the distribution of Brachycephalus, an anuran genus characterized by microendemic species living mostly in montane habitats along the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. Given that traditional ENM is not possible in the case of Brachycephalus because most of its species have limited geographical ranges, we analyzed an ensemble dataset that combined records of most described species, as well as new species that are currently being described, while accounting for heterogeneity in their climatic niches. Niche heterogeneity was quantified by ordination of the bioclimatic variables associated with their occurrence records, followed by unguided clustering of the resulting ordination scores. Out of an initial dataset of 544 records, careful curation reduced it to 75 records of 24 species and 71 localities. Interestingly, the three major clusters of climatic niches found in Brachycephalus corresponded largely to the three previously recognized phylogenetic lineages in the genus. The pernix cluster included the highly endemic species from southern Brazil that were most restricted to high-elevation areas, whereas the didactylus cluster encompassed species with broader geographical ranges that extended into lowland regions of the Atlantic Rainforest. Finally, the ephippium cluster included species from southeastern Brazil with intermediate levels of endemism. The detection of several isolated locations with potentially suitable habitats indicate that the diversity of Brachycephalus could still be considerably underestimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnura 3adata collection 3aextinction 3afrogs 3aindigenous species 3amodels 3anew species 3aniches 3aphylogeny 3arain forests 3arisk 3aBrazil 0aAIC 0aBrachycephalus 0aConservation 0aEndemism 0aMaxent 0aTerrarana1 aMeyer, Andreas L.S.1 aFirkowski, Carina R.1 aRibeiro, Luiz F.1 aBornschein, Marcos R.0 tEcological modelling.g2013 Feb. 10, v. 250 p.165-176dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2012.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01450naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245005700171300001800228500001500246520047500261592002800736650001800764650002400782650001200806650001400818650002300832650001500855653001700870700001700887700001900904773009600923856008401019852000901103655001201112IND60109967520221121085958.0141109e20120808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010996752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.05.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Mengyang,10aSynthesis of dihydrobenzoimidazo[2,1-a]isoquinolines  ap. 4156-4160.  a2019-12-04  aA one-pot protocol toward several substituted 5,6-dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[2,1-a]isoquinolines 1 starting with 2-allylbenzaldehydes 2 was described.

The amount as well as the evolution of surface carbonate species with nature of MO and reaction temperature were analyzed by XRD, TPD, XPS and IR methods to better understand the reaction mechanism. The concentration of surface basic sites responsible for the formation of C₂ ⁺ were found to correlate well with the amount of evolved CO₂ in the 300–800°C temperature range. According to the experimental data, the higher was the catalyst basicity in terms of CO₂ retaining capacity the better was the efficiency for selectively converting methane to C₂ ⁺. The turnover frequency (TOF) values were calculated by measuring the total number basic sites retaining reversible CO₂ in reaction conditions. The experimental results can be explained in a simplified manner by considering a reaction mechanism in which alkaline active sites play a crucial role in methane selective activation to C₂ ⁺ whereas the acidic sites, showing little interaction CO₂, are responsible for methane combustion. A strategy for improving the performances of OCM catalysts is discussed in light of the experimental results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acombustion 3amagnesium 3amethane 3astrontium 3atemperature1 aLuminita, Patron1 aOsiceanu, Petre1 aBirjega, Ruxandra1 aAkane, Miyazaki1 aBalint, Ioan0 tJournal of Molecular Catalysis.

The results showed that the amine group was successfully loaded on all three modified adsorbents; among that, the polymer-modified silica adsorbents had higher amine content and larger surface area than the aminopropyl-grafted silica adsorbent and displayed higher thermal stability than the other polymer-modified silica materials previously reported. The CO₂ adsorption/desorption experiments performed at 25°C by TGA–DSC method showed that the highest CO₂ adsorption capacity (0.98mmol/g) was observed for the polymer-impregnated silica adsorbent.

This exercise reveals that the increase in energy consumption is associated with economic growth and population expansion. The interconnectivity between energy use and national level, as well as the connection between energy utilization and gross domestic product (GDP), which is an indicator of economic development, must be explained to determine the significance of national energy utility in these countries. Therefore, alternative energy source utilization is necessary for the provision of an appreciable constituent of imminent energy requirements in sectors that utilize energy. Alternative energy source utilization is a crucial factor in ensuring the total capacity of energy sources in various growing economies of the world where clean energy is unavailable. Furthermore, some of these countries also possess alternative energy sources such as hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass. This paper provides details on sustainable energy supply developments in OIC countries. These countries must sustainably develop energy despite their sufficient wealth in crude oil and natural gas. The main purpose of this study is to determine economic growth in relation to energy supply to facilitate sustainable development. In addition, this paper suggests necessary requirements to sustain the energy development processes in OIC countries and as well as some stages that must be adopted to enhance development at a sustainable rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aeconomic indicators 3aenergy 3aenergy requirements 3agross domestic product 3anatural gas 3apetroleum 3apopulation growth 3asustainable development 3awater power 3awind1 aSopian, K.q(Kamaruzzaman),1 aYaakob, Zahira1 aFaraji Zonooz, M.Reza1 aFudholi, Ahmad1 aAsim, Nilofar0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2013 Dec., v. 28 p.18-28dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2013.07.0453Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245008900174300001800263520122300281592002801504650002701532650003001559650001601589650002701605650003601632650001101668650001401679650002301693650001401716650002201730650002201752650002101774650001301795650005801808650001101866650002001877700002301897700002101920700002501941700002301966700002101989700001702010773008302027856008602110852000902196655001202205IND60105406620221122121903.0141108e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010540662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2011.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDolashka, Pavlina10aAntimicrobial proline-rich peptides from the hemolymph of marine snail Rapana venosa  ap. 1477-1483.  aHemolymph of Rapana venosa snails is a complex mixture of biochemically and pharmacologically active components such as peptides and proteins. Antimicrobial peptides are gaining attention as antimicrobial alternatives to chemical food preservatives and commonly used antibiotics. Therefore, for the first time we have explored the isolation, identification and characterisation of 11 novel antimicrobial peptides produced by the hemolymph of molluscs. The isolated peptides from the hemolymph applying ultrafiltration and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) have molecular weights between 3000 and 9500Da, determined by mass spectrometric analysis. The N-terminal sequences of the peptides identified by Edman degradation matched no peptides in the MASCOT search database, indicating novel proline-rich peptides. UV spectra revealed that these substances possessed the characteristics of protein peptides with acidic isoelectric points. However, no Cotton effects were observed between 190 and 280nm by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Four of the Pro-rich peptides also showed strong antimicrobial activities against tested microorganisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aanti-infective properties 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acotton 3adatabases 3afood preservatives 3ahemolymph 3aisoelectric point 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3aproteins 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asnails 3aultrafiltration1 aMoshtanska, Vesela1 aBorisova, Valika1 aDolashki, Aleksander1 aStevanovic, Stefan1 aDimanov, Tzvetan1 aVoelter, W.,0 tPeptides.g2011 July, v. 32, no. 7 p.1477-1483dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2011.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011200164300001400276520109800290592002801388650001701416650001101433650002101444650001501465650001601480700001701496700001601513700001901529700001701548700001801565773011201583856008201695990002301777852000901800655001201809IND60102950020221119222441.0141106e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010295002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jpba.2012.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Unyong10aTentative identification of phase I metabolites of HU-210, a classical synthetic cannabinoid, by LC–MS/MS  ap. 26-34.  a(6aR,10aR)-9-(Hydroxymethyl)-6,6-dimethyl-3-(2-methyloctan-2-yl)-6a,7,10,10a-tetrahydrobenzo[c]chromen-1-ol (HU-210) is a synthetic cannabinoid, with a classical cannabinoid structure similar to Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC). In this study, the in vitro metabolism of HU-210 was investigated in human liver microsomes to characterize associated phase I metabolites. HU-210 was incubated with human liver microsomes, and the reaction mixture was analyzed using LC–MS/MS. HU-210 was metabolized in human liver microsomes, yielding about 24 metabolites. These metabolites were structurally characterized on the basis of accurate mass analyses and MS/MS fragmentation patterns. The major metabolic route for HU-210 was oxygenation. Metabolites M1–M7 were identified as mono-oxygenated metabolites; M8–M15, mono-hydroxylated metabolites; M16–M20, di-oxygenated metabolites; and M21–M24, di-hydroxylated metabolites. These results provide evidence for in vivo HU-210 metabolism, and they may be applied to the analysis of HU-210 and its relevant metabolites in biological samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acannabinoids 3ahumans 3aliver microsomes 3ametabolism 3ametabolites1 aJin, Ming Ji1 aLee, Jaeick1 aHan, Sang Beom1 aIn, Moon Kyo1 aYoo, Hye Hyun0 tJournal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis.g2012 , v. 64-65 p.26-34dElsevier B.V.x0731-70857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2012.02.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011500170300001300285520158800298592002801886650003201914650001201946650001001958650001201968650002001980650002602000650001802026650001302044650001802057650000902075700002502084700002002109773007102129856008602200852000902286655001202295IND60105480020221122235022.0141108e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010548002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2013.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhazal, Pasha10aMorphine dependence is associated with changes in neuropeptide S receptor expression and function in rat brain  ap. 6-12.  aNeuropeptide S (NPS) is a newly identified ligand for the previously discovered G-protein coupled receptor 154 now named NPSR. Recently, it has been found that NPSR gene expression is altered during ethanol withdrawal. In this study we tried to elucidate if NPSR gene expression is modified in response to morphine withdrawal and its protracted abstinence. To induce opioid dependence Wistar rats were treated for 7 days with morphine. Twelve hours and 7 days after the last morphine administration brains were removed and the expression of NPSR mRNA was analyzed by in situ hybridization (ISH). Successful induction of opioid dependence was confirmed by the naloxone-precipitated withdrawal test 2h after the last morphine administration. Moreover, 7 days after the last morphine dose animals were checked for signs of anxiety and for intracerebroventricular (ICV) NPS (0.3 and 1.0nmol) induced anxiolytic effects by elevated plus maze (EPM). Results showed that in morphine treated rats strong somatic signs of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal occurred. ISH data revealed changes in NPSR gene expression in the ventral tegmental area as well as in the basolateral amygdaloid and bed nucleus of stria terminalis at 12h and 7 days into abstinence, respectively. At 7 days into abstinence post dependent animals showed higher levels of anxiety than controls which were significantly attenuated by NPS. These results demonstrated that morphine dependence induction led to (i) changes in NPSR mRNA expression; (ii) increased anxiety; and (iii) more potent anxiolytic-like effect of NPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aanxiety 3abrain 3aethanol 3agene expression 3ain situ hybridization 3amessenger RNA 3amorphine 3aneuropeptides 3arats1 aCiccocioppo, Roberto1 aUbaldi, Massimo0 tPeptides.g2013 Aug., v. 46 p.6-12dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2013.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01485naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010500165300001600270520053300286592002800819650001200847650001700859650001600876700001400892700001800906700001900924700002000943700002000963773009500983856008401078852000901162655001201171IND60105957920221122233012.0141108e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010595792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2011.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Cheng12aA simple method to synthesize Ba₀.₆Sr₀.₄TiO₃ nano-powders through high-energy ball-milling  ap. 299-302.  aIn this study, we fabricated Ba₀.₆Sr₀.₄TiO₃ (BST) powders via a high-energy ball-milling (HEBM) method.

Niosomes have been reported as conceivable vesicles to deliver drug molecules to the desired mucous membrane or skin layers. Hydroxychloroquine niosomes were designed using different methods of preparation. Tween 20 and cholesterol in molar ratio (1:0.5) were used. The prepared systems were characterized for entrapment efficiency, particle size and in vitro drug release. Different factors affecting the encapsulation of hydroxychloroquine in niosomes were studied vs. varying the type of surfactant, the cholesterol:surfactant molar ratio and the amount of the drug. The selected noisome formulation was dispersed in different gel formulations and evaluated according to the in vitro drug release and the physical stability. The results showed that the type of surfactant, cholesterol ratio and incorporated amount of drug altered the entrapment efficiency and the in vitro release of hydroxychloroquine from niosomes. The optimum formulation was prepared by reverse phase evaporation technique using Brij 98:cholesterol molar ratio (1:1.5) and containing 20mg of hydroxychloroquine and incorporated in 20% w/v Pluronic F-127 gel. A double-blind, controlled clinical study was performed using two groups of patients. Group A (n=11) who received hydroxychloroquine niosomal gel formulation, one application-a-day over 4 months showed 64.28% reduction in the size of lesions and the average score of pain was reduced from “4” to “1”. Compared to placebo group B (n=5), who showed only 3.94% reduction in the lesion size and the average score of pain was remained “3”. Our results suggest that these niosomal formulations could constitute a promising approach for the topical treatment of oral lichen planus in short time with less side effects and no recurrence after stopping the treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acholesterol 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aevaporation 3agels 3amucosa 3aniosomes 3aoral administration 3apain 3aparticle size 3apatients 3apolysorbates 3asurfactants1 aAbdullah, Hamoud1 aEl-Komy, Mohamed H.M.1 aKassem, Mohamed A.A.0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Dec. 31, v. 458, no. 2 p.287-295dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.10.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008600170300001800256520160200274592002801876650001901904650001901923650001601942650001901958650001601977650001201993650001002005650002602015650001002041650001802051650001202069650002002081650001102101650001702112700003002129773010402159856008502263852000902348655001202357IND60100378420221122054617.0141105e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010037842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaucci, Franca10ad-Asp: A new player in reproductive endocrinology of the amphibian Rana esculenta  ap. 3268-3276.  aWe investigated the involvement of d-Aspartic acid (d-Asp) on ovarian and testicular morphology of the green frog, Rana esculenta, and its effect on the testosterone production. The study has been performed throughout the reproductive cycle. In both ovary and testis a substantial amount of d-Asp is endogenously present and its concentration varies as function of reproduction. In the frog, d-Asp content is differently correlated with gonadal and plasmatic levels of testosterone, depending on the sex. In fact, the amount of the d-Asp is inversely linked with that of the testosterone in the ovary, while this correlation directly matched in the testis. In vivo short-term experiments, consisting of a single intra-peritoneal injection of d-Asp (2.0μmol/g body weight), demonstrated that the enantiomer is significantly accumulated by both the ovary and testis, reaching after 3h the highest uptake and thereafter decreasing to baseline values within 24h. Furthermore, d-Asp influences the synthesis and/or the release of testosterone, causing a decrease of its level in the female, and an increase in the male, respectively. In vivo long-term experiments, d-Asp, chronically administered to the frogs of both sexes, enhances the maturation of both gonads, determining in the oocytes an higher accumulation of carbohydrate yolk plates in the ooplasm, and stimulating the spermatogenesis in the testis. Taken altogether, our results show that d-Asp operates differently in female and male frog gonads, indicating that it has different targets in the reproductive machinery depending on the sex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRana esculenta 3aanimal ovaries 3abody weight 3achromatography 3aenantiomers 3afemales 3afrogs 3along term experiments 3amales 3anormal values 3aoocytes 3aspermatogenesis 3atestes 3atestosterone1 aDi Fiore, Maria Maddalena0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 879, no. 29 p.3268-3276dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245015200178300001600330520167400346592002802020650001102048650001202059650002002071650002102091650001502112650002802127650001102155650001402166650001802180650001502198650000702213650001402220650001102234650001002245700003102255700002202286700003602308700002602344773008802370856008102458990002302539852000902562655001202571IND60108639420221120070123.0141108e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010863942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.05.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Paulo Roberto de10aFlow injection amperometric determination of isoniazid using a screen-printed carbon electrode modified with silver hexacyanoferrates nanoparticles  ap. 795-802.  aA rapid and simple method was developed for isoniazid (INZ) determination by flow injection analysis (FIA) using a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) modified with silver hexacyanoferrates (NPAg-HCF) as amperometric detector. Dodecanethiol-stabilized silver nanoparticles were prepared by biphasic method and applied as modifier in a screen-printed electrode, used as precursors for the electrochemical hexacyanoferrates preparation (NPAg-HCF). The electrochemical behavior of both silver nanoparticles and silver hexacyanoferrates was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry in the presence of potassium or silver ions and was verified a strong dependence with the nature of the cations in the voltammetric profile. A catalytic response of the SPCE/NPAg-HCF electrode was observed for INZ determination confirmed by the increase int the current of the Ag₃K[Feᴵᴵ(CN)₆]/Ag₃[Feᴵᴵᴵ(CN)₆] redox couple at the electrode surface, proportionally to the INZ concentration. The device was evaluated as an amperometric sensor in an FIA system. Using the best operation conditions assigned as: potential applied of +0.45V, pH 3.0, flow rate of 2.9mLmin⁻¹, sample volume of 200μL, and analytical path of 30cm, it was possible to construct a linear calibration curve from 5.0×10⁻⁶ to 5.0×10⁻⁴molL⁻¹ with a limit of detection of 2.6μmolL⁻¹. Recoveries values obtained for INZ provided mean values ranging from 99.0 to 102%, and an analytical frequency of 24 injections per hour was achieved. The method was successfully applied for the determination of INZ in simulated human urine samples with good agreement between the added and recovery values.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acations 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aflow injection analysis 3ahumans 3aisoniazid 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apH 3apotassium 3asilver 3aurine1 aOliveira, Marcela Mohallem1 aZarbin, Aldo J.G.1 aMarcolino-Junior, Luiz Humberto1 aBergamini, Márcio F.0 tSensors and actuators.g2012 , v. 171-172 p.795-802dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.05.0733Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015000166300001800316520080100334592002801135650002501163650002301188650002301211650002101234650002601255650002801281650001501309650001501324650001601339650001701355650000901372650001301381700002001394700002201414700002701436700001801463700001901481773008801500856008101588852000901669655001201678IND60109493120221120213641.0141109e20120603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010949312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.03.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qingzhi10aFlavonoid metabolism: the synthesis of phenolic glucuronides and sulfates as candidate metabolites for bioactivity studies of dietary flavonoids  ap. 4194-4201.  aEpidemiological studies indicate that flavonoid intake is inversely associated with the risk of coronary heart disease, yet the mechanisms responsible for their bioactivity are still a matter of debate. Based on the rapid and extensive metabolism of most flavonoids, their health effects most likely result from the biological activity of their metabolites. However, a lack of commercially available compounds/standards has prevented the study of metabolite bioactivity and resulted in a focus on non-physiologically relevant precursor/parent structures. This paper details the synthesis of a series of phenolic glucuronide 1a–e and sulfate 2a–e derivates as candidate metabolites for use as reference compounds in metabolic profiling studies and for the exploration of flavonoid bioactivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3acoronary disease 3adiet study techniques 3aepidemiological studies 3aflavonoids 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3arisk 3asulfates1 aRaheem, K.

BTV infection during pregnancy can result in infection of the foetus, which may lead to the birth of persistently infected or immunotolerant offspring. Since persistently infected animals continuously produce large amounts of virus they could be a source of infection for the insect vector. This could significantly influence the epidemiology of the virus and hence might require additional measures to control a BTV outbreak.Therefore, we investigated the potential of BTV-8 to induce persistent infection or immunotolerance in lambs in an experimental setting.Infection of eighteen 70–75 days pregnant ewes with wild type BTV-8 led to the birth of 25 out of 44 BTV RNA positive lambs (foetal infected, FI). All 23 FI lambs born alive also had anti BTV antibodies at birth; infectious virus could be recovered from 5 out of 25 FI lambs.Viral RNA loads decreased rapidly after birth; 19 out of 20 FI lambs that remained in the experiment until week 14 after birth, were RNA negative at that time. Since persistence of BTV-8 infection could not be demonstrated, we investigated whether foetal infection had an effect on protection against a field virus infection and on efficacy of vaccination. To this end, 5 FI lambs and 5 foetal non-infected (FNI) lambs were vaccinated with the inactivated Bovilis® BTV-8 vaccine, five months after birth. Three weeks after the vaccination, all lambs were infected with wild type BTV-8. The foetal infection did not interfere with vaccination efficacy. In contrast, foetal BTV-8 infection induced an immune response which afforded protection against BTV challenge comparable to the level of protection induced by vaccination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBluetongue virus 3aRNA 3aantibodies 3acontrol methods 3aewes 3aimmune response 3ainsect vectors 3alambs 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3atransplacental transmission 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviremia 3aviruses 0aBluetongue 0aTransplacental transmission 0aSheep 0aVaccine 0aViraemia1 aSchroer-Joosten, D.P.H.1 aFid-Fourkour, A.1 aSmit, M.1 aVrijenhoek, M.P.1 aMoulin, V.1 ade Smit, A.J.1 aMoormann, R.J.M.0 tVaccine.g2013 Aug. 12, v. 31, no. 36 p.3726-3731dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.05.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02039naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245011400179300001800293520086800311592002801179650001401207650002101221650002601242650002001268650001901288650001301307650001101320650002101331650001901352650001701371650002401388700001801412700002201430773008401452856008501536990002301621852000901644655001201653IND60105714820221118142359.0141108e20120706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010571482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2012.05.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Michael Thomas12aA successful approach to disperse MWCNTs in polyethylene by melt mixing using polyethylene glycol as additive  ap. 3079-3083.  aAn additive-assisted one-step melt mixing approach was developed to produce nanocomposites based on linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) with multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT). The polymer granules, nanotube powder (2 wt% Nanocyl™ NC7000) and 1–10 wt% of the non-ionic additives poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) with molar masses between 100 g/mol and 100,000 g/mol were simply fed together in the hopper of a small-scale DSM Xplore 15 twin-screw microcompounder. The produced MWCNT/LLDPE composites showed excellent MWCNT dispersion and highly improved electrical properties as compared to samples without the additive, whereas the effects depend on the amount and molar mass of the additive.

However, recent studies have failed to validate this hypothesis. A proposed wider framework suggests that reproduction can be perceived as an overload adds up to other environmental challenges that individuals must adjust to. In this case, elevated glucocorticoids could help individuals to allocate resources to reproduction without comprising other functions, leading to the expectation of a positive cort-fitness relationship. This has been proposed as the Cort-Adaptation Hypothesis. Stress levels result from a complex interaction between the environment and the neuroendocrine system of animals. Accounting for physiological functions involved in how animals cope with their environment would help to clarify the relationship between glucocorticoids and animal performance. We used roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) inhabiting diverse habitats in the Iberian Peninsula to: i) test the Cort-Fitness and Cort-Adaptation hypotheses by indexing fitness using a comprehensive physiological approach which takes into account fundamental physiological functions and their trade-offs; and ii) evaluate the link between primary productivity and individuals' condition in a seasonal environment. We evaluated spatial and temporal variation in stress levels, reproductive hormone levels, nutritional status and immune function from fecal samples collected in 2010. Lower stress levels were related to better condition in non-reproductive seasons but not to higher primary productivity. In contrast, stress levels were always positively related to reproductive condition, which was better in most productive habitats. Summer and winter were the less productive seasons and the more challenging for the species in the habitat gradient studied. In winter, reproductive condition traded off against immune function being biased toward immune function in less productive habitats. In summer reduced primary productivity limited roe deer nutritional and immunological condition but not reproductive condition. Overall our results match both the Cort-Fitness and Cort-Adaptation Hypotheses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aanimal performance 3afeces 3aglucocorticoids 3ahabitats 3aneurosecretory system 3anutritional status 3aprimary productivity 3areproduction 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3avertebrates 3awinter 3aIberian Peninsula 0aStress 0aNon-invasive 0aHabitat quality 0aImmune function trade-off 0aEnvironmental change1 aPettorelli, Nathalie1 aVirgós, Emilio1 aLara-Romero, Carlos1 aLozano, Jorge1 aBarja, Isabel1 aCuadra, Felipe S.1 aPuerta, Marisa0 tActa oecologica.g2013 Nov., v. 53 p.38-48dElsevier Masson SASaElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2013.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01810naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245020400171300001800375520068700393592002801080650001901108650002301127650002301150650001201173650004401185700002201229700003201251700003501283773008801318856008101406852000901487655001201496IND60109493220221120213840.0141109e20120603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010949322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.03.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLivadiotou, Despina10aOne-pot efficient synthesis of novel fused pentacyclic indolopyridobenzimidazoles and pyridoimidazopyridoindoles from the reaction of pyranoindolones with 1,2-diaminobenzenes and 2,3-diaminopyridines  ap. 4202-4209.  aThe synthesis of a number of novel, fully conjugated, planar pentacyclic 5H-indolo[3′,2′:4,5]pyrido[1,2-a][1,3]benzimidazoles (8) and 11H-pyrido[3″,2″:4′,5′]imidazo[1′,2′:1,6]pyrido[3,4-b]indoles (12) by a one-pot reaction of pyranoindolones with substituted o-phenylenediamines or 2,3-diaminopyridines is described.

In the layer-by-layer process of metal complex wire construction, various combinations of anchor ligands, metal sources, and bridging ligands have been used. The prepared structures show multiple functions, including photocurrent generation, catalytic activity, insulation properties, and long-range electron transport abilities. The electron transport behavior, and the long-range electron transport abilities from the terminal redox site to the electrode via bis(terpyridine)metal complex wires, were evaluated using potential step chronoamperometry. The remarkable long-range electron transport abilities were evidenced in the small values for the attenuation factor, β. The influence of the building blocks in the metal complex wires on the β value and the electron transfer rate constant was demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3ainsulating materials 3apolymers1 aSakamoto, Ryōta,1 aNishihara, Hiroshi0 tPolymer.g2013 Aug. 2, v. 54, no. 17 p.4383-4403dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2013.04.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012000166300001600286500001500302520202700317592002802344650001002372650001402382650001602396650002802412653001402440700001902454773008402473856008402557990002302641852000902664655001202673IND60110913120221117225035.0141109e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011091312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultras.2011.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitri, F.G.10aTransverse (lateral) instantaneous force of an acoustical first-order Bessel vortex beam centered on a rigid sphere  ap. 151-155.  a2019-12-04  aIn a recent report [F.G. Mitri, Z.E.A. Fellah, Ultrasonics 51 (2011) 719–724], it has been found that the instantaneous axial force (i.e. acting along the axis of wave propagation) of a Bessel acoustic beam centered on a sphere is only determined for the fundamental order (i.e. m=0) but vanishes when the beam is of vortex type (i.e. m>0, where m is the order (or helicity) of the beam). It has also been recognized that for circularly symmetric beams (such as Bessel beams of integer order), the transverse (lateral) instantaneous force should vanish as required by symmetry. Nevertheless, in this commentary, the present analysis unexpectedly reveals the existence of a transverse instantaneous force on a rigid sphere centered on the axis of a Bessel vortex beam of unit magnitude order (i.e. |m|=1) not reported in [F.G. Mitri, Z.E.A. Fellah, Ultrasonics 51 (2011) 719–724]. The presence of the transverse instantaneous force components of a first-order Bessel vortex beam results from mathematical anti-symmetry in the surface integrals, but vanishes for the fundamental (m=0) and higher-order Bessel (vortex) beams (i.e. |m|>1). Here, closed-form solutions for the instantaneous force components are obtained and examples for the transverse components for progressive waves are computed for a fixed and a movable rigid sphere. The results show that only the dipole (n=1) mode in the scattering contributes to the instantaneous force components, as well as how the transverse instantaneous force per unit cross-sectional surface varies versus the dimensionless frequency ka (k is the wave number in the fluid medium and a is the sphere’s radius), and the half-cone angle β of the beam. Moreover, the velocity of the movable sphere is evaluated based on the concept of mechanical impedance. The proposed analysis may be of interest in the analysis of transverse instantaneous forces on spherical particles for particle manipulation and rotation in drug delivery and other biomedical or industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3aacoustics 3aultrasonics 3aindustrial applications 0aimpedance1 aFellah, Z.E.A.0 tUltrasonics.g2012 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.151-155dElsevier B.V.x0041-624X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2011.07.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02181naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010100167300001400268520111200282592002801394650002501422650002001447650001301467650002201480650002101502650001301523650001601536650002101552700001601573700001401589700001201603700001601615773009501631856008401726852000901810655001201819IND60101983120221119143229.0141106e20130415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010198312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2013.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Jianwen12aA simple and green preparation of PVA-based cation exchange hybrid membranes for alkali recovery  ap. 10-16.  aHere, a novel and green route for preparing cation exchange hybrid membranes is presented via polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and 3-trihydroxysilyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (THOPS), during which aqueous media instead of organic solvents is used and sulfonation process is avoided. The resulting hybrid membranes have the water uptake (WR) of 38–86%, ion exchange capacities (IECs) of 0.70–1.56mmol/g, initial decomposition temperature (IDT) of 224–231°C, tensile strength (TS) of 13.3–40.7MPa, and favorable elongation at break (Eb) of 177–571%. The linear expansion ratio (LER) is in the range of 15–25% in water, while in the range of 18–27% in 1.0M alkali solution. Diffusion dialysis (DD) of NaOH/Na₂WO₄ system shows that the dialysis coefficients of NaOH (UOH) are in the range of 0.011–0.022m/h, with the separation factors (S) of 11.6–20.6. Consequently, apart from endowing the resulting hybrid membranes with desirable DD performances, the method employed herein is simple and environment-friendly particularly due to the avoidance of organic solvents and hazardous sulfonation agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acation exchange 3adialysis 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asodium hydroxide 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atensile strength1 aWu, Yonghui1 aRan, Jing1 aWu, Bin1 aXu, Tongwen0 tJournal of membrane science.g2013 Apr. 15, v. 433 p.10-16dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2013.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01871naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245013600177300001600313520073700329592002801066650002301094650002301117650001901140650000901159650001301168650001001181653001901191653001501210653002101225653001301246653001401259653002401273700002001297773008701317856008401404852000901488655001201497IND60110040220221120160549.0161019e20130109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011004022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.09.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephenson, G.

The same sample clean-up procedure including a novel solid-phase extraction (SPE) on polymeric Strata-SDB cartridges was used for each matrix. The analytes were separated on Kinetex XB C-18 core–shell type HPLC column using isocratic elution mode with a mobile phase containing 0.1% formic acid in water/methanol (88/12, v/v, pH 2.6) at a flow rate of 0.7ml/min. The main advantage of the developed method is that the analysis time of only 3min, which is about three to ten times shorter than in other reported HPLC methods. The developed method was validated using a matrix-comprehensive in-house validation strategy. The matrix effect of LC–MS/MS analysis was also investigated.

However, tissue-selective transduction by systemically administered Ad5-based vectors is confounded by viral particle sequestration in the liver. Hexon-modified Ad5 expressing reporter gene under transcriptional control by the immediate/early cytomegalovirus (CMV) or the Roundabout 4 receptor (Robo4) enhancer/promoter was characterized by growth in cell culture, stability in vitro, gene transfer in the presence of human coagulation factor X, and biodistribution in mice. The obtained data demonstrate the utility of the Robo4 promoter in an Ad5 vector context. Substitution of the hypervariable region 7 (HVR7) of the Ad5 hexon with HVR7 from Ad serotype 3 resulted in decreased liver tropism and dramatically altered biodistribution of gene expression. The results of these studies suggest that the combination of liver detargeting using a genetic modification of hexon with an endothelium-specific transcriptional control element produces an additive effect in the improvement of Ad5 biodistribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell culture 3aendothelium 3agene expression 3agene therapy 3agene transfer 3agenetic engineering 3ahumans 3aliver 3amice 3areporter genes 3aserotypes 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirion 0aAdenovirus 0aTargeting 0aEndothelium 0aRoundabout 4 promoter 0aHexon1 aKaliberova, Lyudmila N.1 aHong Lu, Zhi1 aPreuss, Meredith A.1 aBarnes, Justin A.1 aStockard, Cecil R.1 aGrizzle, William E.1 aArbeit, Jeffrey M.1 aCuriel, David,0 tVirology.g2013 Dec., v. 447, no. 1-2 p.312-325dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2013.09.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001700168245013300185300001600318520163700334592002801971650002701999650003002026650002302056650001302079650001702092650001402109650002002123650002602143650001502169650001502184650001402199650001402213650001402227650001802241650002102259650003102280650006002311650001102371650001102382650005502393650005702448651002502505651001302530651004002543700002302583700002302606700001902629700001902648700001902667700002802686700002402714700002202738700002002760700002302780700002002803700002402823700002002847773009402867856008302961990002303044852000903067655001203076IND60102633820221119120231.0141106e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010263382DNAL7 a237735902pmid7 a10.1016/j.jpeds.2013.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeleb, Nadia10aBacterial Meningitis Surveillance in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 2005-2010: Successes and Challenges of a Regional Network  ap. S25-S31.  aOBJECTIVE: To describe epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region countries and assist in introduction of new bacterial vaccines. STUDY DESIGN: A laboratory-based sentinel surveillance was established in 2004, and up to 10 countries joined the network until 2010. Personnel at participating hospitals and national public health laboratories received training in surveillance and laboratory methods and used standard clinical and laboratory-confirmed case definitions. RESULTS: Over 22 000 suspected cases of meningitis were reported among children ≤5 years old and >6600 among children >5 years old. In children ≤5 years old, 921 of 13 125 probable cases (7.0%) were culture-confirmed. The most commonly isolated pathogens were S pneumoniae (27% of confirmed cases), N meningitidis (22%), and H influenzae (10%). Among culture-confirmed case-patients with known outcome, case-fatality rate was 7.0% and 12.2% among children ≤5 years old and those >5 years old, respectively. Declining numbers of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis cases within 2 years post-Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine introduction were observed in Pakistan. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial meningitis continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Surveillance networks for bacterial meningitis ensure that all sites are using standardized methodologies. Surveillance data are useful to monitor impact of various interventions including vaccines, but maintaining data quality requires consistent reporting and regular technical support.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3aWorld Health Organization 3abacterial vaccines 3achildren 3aepidemiology 3ahospitals 3ahuman resources 3alaboratory techniques 3ameningitis 3amonitoring 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apathogens 3apublic health 2aChild, Preschool 2aEpidemiological Monitoring 2aHaemophilus influenzae type bxisolation & purification 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMeningitis, Bacterialxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aMeningitis, Haemophilusxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 3aMediterranean region 3aPakistan 0aMediterranean Regionxepidemiology.1 aPilishvili, Tamara1 aVan Beneden, Chris1 aGhoneim, Amani1 aAmjad, Khawaja1 aMostafa, Amani1 aEstighamati, Abdul Reza1 aSmeo, Mohamed Najib1 aBarkia, Abdelaziz1 aElKhatib, Mutaz1 aMujaly, Abdellatif1 aAshmony, Hossam1 aJassim, Kifah Ahmed1 aHajjeh, Rana A.0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2013 July, v. 163, no. 1S p.S25-S31dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2013.03.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01527naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009800167300001800265520046000283592002800743650001400771650002300785650002300808650001100831650001300842650002200855700002000877700001600897700001900913700001900932700001800951700001800969773008800987856008101075852000901156655001201165IND60109419620221119032230.0141109e20111007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010941962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugimoto, Kenji10aSyntheses of aza-analogues of macrosphelides via RCM strategy and their biological evaluation  ap. 7681-7685.  aSyntheses of 16-membered macrolactams, which were aza-analogues of macrosphelides, could be established effectively by a ring-closing metathesis (RCM) strategy.

One major problem of ultrasonic transducers, radiating acoustic energy into air, is to find the proper acoustic impedances of one or more matching layers. This work aims at developing an original solution to the acoustic impedance mismatch between transducer and air. If the acoustic impedance defences between transducer and air be more, then finding best matching layer(s) is harder. Therefore we consider PZT (lead zirconate titanate piezo electric) transducer and air that has huge acoustic impedance deference. The vibration source energy (PZT), which is used to generate the incident wave, consumes a part of the mechanical energy and converts it to an electrical one in theoretical calculation. After calculating matching layers, we consider the energy source as layer to design a transducer. However, this part of the mechanical energy will be neglected during the mathematical work. This approximation is correct only if the transducer is open-circuit. Since the possibilities of choosing material with required acoustic impedance are limited (the counted values cannot always be realized and applied in practice) it is necessary to correct the differences between theoretical values and the possibilities of practical application of given acoustic impedances. Such a correction can be done by manipulating other parameters of matching layers (e.g. by changing their thickness). The efficiency of the energy transmission from the piezoceramic transducer through different layers with different thickness and different attenuation enabling a compensation of non-ideal real values by changing their thickness was computer analyzed (base on genetic algorithm). Firstly, three theoretical solutions were investigated. Namely, Chebyshev, Desilets and Souquet theories. However, the obtained acoustic impedances do not necessarily correspond to a nowadays available material. Consequently, the values of the acoustic impedances are switched to the nearest values in a large material database. The switched values of the acoustic impedances do not generally give efficient transmission coefficients. Therefore, we proposed, in a second step, the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to select the best acoustic impedances for matching layers from the material database for a narrow band ultrasonic transducer that work at frequency below the 2.5MHz by considering attenuation. However this bank is rich, the results get better. So the accuracy of the propose method increase by using a lot of materials with exact data for acoustic impedance and their attenuation, especially in high frequency. This yields highly more efficient transmission coefficient. In fact by using increasing number of layer we can increase our chance to find the best sets of materials with valuable both in acoustic impedance and low attenuation. Precisely, the transmission coefficient is almost equal to unity for the all studied cases. Finally the effect of thickness on transmission coefficient is investigated for different layers. The results showed that the transmission coefficient for air media is a function of thickness and sensitive to it even for small variation in thickness. In fact, the sensitivity increases when the differences of acoustic impedances to be high (difference between PZT and air).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustic impedance 3aair 3aalgorithms 3adatabases 3aenergy efficiency 3atransducers (equipment) 3avibration1 aʻAbdullāh, ʻĀmir,0 tUltrasonics.g2012 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.169-185dElsevier B.V.x0041-624X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2011.08.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245010200169300001400271520160500285592002801890650001301918650001201931650001301943650002001956650002101976650001601997650000902013650000902022650000902031650001802040650001102058650001302069650003002082650000902112651001902121651001302140651002902153653001602182653001802198653000802216653002802224653002302252653002402275700002102299700001902320700002002339773009902359856008302458852000902541655001202550IND60111695920221120110515.0190411e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011169592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actao.2013.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos, Jaime A.10aRelation between climatic factors, diet and reproductive parameters of Little Terns over a decade  ap. 56-62.  aWe used 10 years of data on clutch size, egg size and diet, and 8 years of data on timing of laying on Little Terns (Sternula albifrons) breeding in Ria Formosa lagoon system, Algarve, Portugal to assess whether diet acts as an important intermediary between climatic conditions and breeding parameters. We used Generalized Linear Models to relate (1) the relative occurrence and size of the main prey species, sand smelts (Atherina spp.), with environmental variables, a large-scale climate variable, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, and a local scale variable, the sea-surface temperature (SST), and (2) the respective effects of sand smelts relative occurrence, NAO index and SST on Little Tern breeding parameters. The diet of Little Terns was dominated by sand smelts, with a frequency occurrence of over 60% in all years. The winter SST (February) was negatively associated with the relative occurrence of sand smelts in the diet of Little Terns during the breeding season which, in turn, was positively associated with Little Tern clutch size. Our results suggest that negative NAO conditions in the Atlantic Ocean, often associated with rougher sea conditions (greater vertical mixing, stronger winds and lower SST) were related with earlier breeding, and lower SST in the surroundings of the colony during winter–spring favour the abundance of prey fish for Little Terns as well as their reproductive parameters. Climate patterns at both large and local scales are likely to change in the future, which may have important implications for estuarine seabirds in Southern Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtherina 3aLaridae 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3aclimatic factors 3aclutch size 3adiet 3aeggs 3afish 3alinear models 3amixing 3aseabirds 3asurface water temperature 3awind 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aPortugal 3aSouthern European region 0aLittle Tern 0aAtherina spp. 0aNAO 0aSea-surface temperature 0aEstuarine seabirds 0aBreeding parameters1 aPedro, Patrícia1 aMatos, Antonio1 aPaiva, Vitor H.0 tActa oecologica.g2013 Nov., v. 53 p.56-62dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2013.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01870naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007900162300001600241520090900257592002801166650001701194650002201211650002001233650001301253650002801266650001201294700001701306700002001323773008801343856008101431990002301512852000901535655001201544IND60108796720221117235944.0141108e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010879672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2013.07.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadura, M.10aStatistical assessment of quantification methods used in gas sensor system  ap. 815-823.  aThis paper presents comparative study of neural, fuzzy, fuzzy neural and support vector machines approach to gas sensor array responses processing.

Series of algorithms were prepared and tested using software written in MATLAB environment (partially in-house developed). The algorithms performance was compared and classic statistical test by McNemar was used to check whether the differences were significant or not. It was shown that response to this question may depend on the required quality of the sensor system. The results of statistical tests may be used in several ways to support the choice of the most suitable data processing method.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3ahumidity 3asupport vector machines 3atoluene1 aSzczurek, A.1 aSzecówka, P.M.0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Nov., v. 188 p.815-823dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2013.07.1053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245012300162300001600285520116100301592002801462650001101490650002501501650002101526650001601547650001201563650001301575650001801588650003701606650001901643650001701662650001601679650000701695650001101702650003701713650001901750700001501769700001501784700001501799700001501814700001801829773011601847856008201963852000902045655001202054IND60100837720221119233256.0141105e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010083772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.04.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuxi10aFormation and characterization of natural polysaccharide hollow nanocapsules via template layer-by-layer self-assembly  ap. 130-140.  aWith natural polysaccharides carrageenan (Car) and chitosan (Cs) as the polyanion and polycation, respectively, multilayer hollow nanocapsules have been fabricated via sequential layer-by-layer (LbL) electrostatic self-assembly from the sacrificed templates nanospheres (SiO₂–NH₂). The LbL assembly process with the polysaccharides on SiO₂–NH₂ core was followed by ζ-potential and size analysis. The fabrication of (Car/Cs)ₓ nanocapsules and the removing of the SiO₂–NH₂ core templates were confirmed by TGA and EDS analysis. The morphology of SiO₂(Car/Cs)ₓ nanospheres and (Car/Cs)ₓ nanocapsules were observed by TEM analysis. The size analysis of (Car/Cs)ₓ nanocapsules indicated that the cyst wall thickness and cavity volume of the nanocapsules are pH and ionic strength dual responsive. Due to the biocompatibility of the natural polysaccharides carrageenan and chitosan and the responsiveness of nanocapsules to pH and ionic strength, the (Car/Cs)ₓ multilayer nanocapsules are expected to be used as nanoreactors or nanocontainers to control the synthesis, encapsulation, and releasing behaviors of bioactive molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3abioactive properties 3abiocompatibility 3acarrageenan 3acations 3achitosan 3aencapsulation 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aionic strength 3ananocapsules 3ananospheres 3apH 3asilica 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential1 aYang, Jing1 aZhao, Ziqi1 aLi, Junjie1 aZhang, Rui1 aYao, Fanglian0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 379, no. 1 p.130-140dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.04.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009000169300001600259520161400275592002801889650001801917650001501935650001801950650001501968650003101983650001002014650002602024650002002050650000902070650005202079650002802131650001502159650001802174650001802192650001302210650001502223700001802238700002002256700001802276700002402294700002402318773009602342856008102438852000902519655001202528IND60110361220221121171112.0141109e20111218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011036122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2011.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuyama, Takuya10aToxicogenomic investigation on rat testicular toxicity elicited by 1,3-dinitrobenzene  ap. 169-177.  aRats were treated with a single oral dose of 10, 25 and 50mg/kg of 1,3-dinitrobenzene (DNB), and the testis was subjected to a GeneChip microarray analysis. A total of 186 and 304 gene probe sets were up- and down-regulated, respectively, by the DNB treatment, where spermatocyte death and Sertoli cell vacuolation in testis and increased debris of spermatogenic cell in epididymis were noted. The expression profile for four sets of genes were investigated, whose expressions are reported to localize in specific cell types in the seminiferous epithelium, namely Sertoli cells, spermatogonia plus early spermtocytes, pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids. The data demonstrated that pachytene spermatocyte-specific genes elicited explicit down-regulation in parallel with the progression of spermatocyte death, while other gene sets did not show characteristic expression changes. In addition, Gene Ontology analysis indicated that genes associated with cell adhesion-related genes were significantly enriched in the up-regulated genes following DNB treatment. Cell adhesion-related genes, namely Cdh2, Ctnna1, Vcl, Zyx, Itgb1, Testin, Lamc3, Pvrl2 and Gsn, showed an increase in microarray and the up-regulation of Cdh2 and Testin were confirmed by real time RT-PCR. The gene expression changes of pachytene spermatocyte-specific genes and cell adhesion-related genes were thought to reflect a decrease in the number of spermatocytes and dysfunction of Sertoli–germ cells adhesion junction, and therefore these genes would be potential genomic biomarkers for assessing DNB-type testicular toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSertoli cells 3abiomarkers 3acell adhesion 3aepididymis 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3apachytene stage 3arats 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aseminiferous epithelium 3aspermatids 3aspermatocytes 3aspermatogonia 3atoxicity 3atoxicology1 aNiino, Noriyo1 aKiyosawa, Naoki1 aKai, Kiyonori1 aTeranishi, Munehiro1 aSanbuissho, Atsushi0 tToxicology.g2011 Dec. 18, v. 290, no. 2-3 p.169-177dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0300-483X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2011.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011600167300001600283520147600299592002801775650002101803650001701824650001601841650001701857650003501874650001601909650001701925650001301942650005201955650001802007650001702025650001602042700001502058700001702073700002202090700001502112700001802127700001602145773008402161856008402245990002302329852000902352655001202361IND60110913420221117225107.0141109e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011091342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultras.2011.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xing-hua14aThe targeted gene (KDRP-CD/TK) therapy of breast cancer mediated by SonoVue and ultrasound irradiation in vitro  ap. 186-191.  aSuicide gene therapy has become an effective therapy for breast cancer, and ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) has become a popular topic in the gene therapy field.

When both 5-FC and GCV were administered, the rate of cellular inhibition was significantly greater than that achieved when only one of the prodrugs was administered (p<0.001). Moreover, the inhibition rates achieved administering 5-FC, GCV and both 5-FC and GCV were all significantly greater than the gene transfection rate of 21.92±3.64% (p<0.001). However, transgenic LS174T cells were not sensitive to any prodrug. These results demonstrated that UTMD is a safe, effective and targeted gene delivery system. Also, the KDR promoter can drive expression of the CD/TK double suicide gene target in MCF-7 cells, and the targeted killing effect of the KDRP-CD/TK gene on MCF-7 cells in vitro has good synergy with expression of the CD/TK fusion gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3agene fusion 3agene therapy 3agenetically modified organisms 3airradiation 3amicrobubbles 3aplasmids 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asuicide genes 3atransfection 3aultrasonics1 aZhou, Ping1 aWang, Li-hua1 aTian, Shuang-ming1 aQian, Ying1 aChen, Li-rong1 aZhang, Ping0 tUltrasonics.g2012 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.186-191dElsevier B.V.x0041-624X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2011.08.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03736naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245010600132300001600238520233700254592002802591650000802619650001802627650001102645650001302656650001602669650001202685650002102697650001602718650002202734650002502756650000702781650003002788650001402818650001802832650002202850650002002872650001102892650001602903650001302919651001002932700001702942700001602959700001702975700002102992700001703013700001203030773017903042852000903221655001203230IND4490768920221119131839.0120501e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449076892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dong-Sheng10aMicrobulbifer marinus sp. nov. and Microbulbifer yueqingensis sp. nov., isolated from marine sediment  ap. 505-510.  aTwo Gram-negative, aerobic strains, Y215T and Y226T, were isolated from sediment from Yueqing Bay, Zhejiang Province, China. The two novel strains were both positive for oxidase activity, nitrate reduction, and aesculin and casein decomposition, but negative for gelatin and tyrosine decomposition. Catalase activity, and starch and Tween 80 decomposition differed between the two strains. Cells of both novel strains were rod-shaped in young cultures and ovoid in older cultures. Optimum NaCl concentration and pH range for growth of both strains were 2.0â3.0 % (w/v) and 7.0â8.0, respectively, whereas the optimum growth temperature for strain Y215T (25â30 Â°C) was lower than that for strain Y226T (30â37 Â°C). The genomic DNA G+C contents of strains Y215T and Y226T were 54.0 and 56.7 mol%, respectively. The major fatty acids in both isolates were iso-C15 : 0 and iso-C17 : 1Ï9c, which was also the case in the reference strains apart from Microbulbifer salipaludis, which possessed C18 : 1Ï7c as the predominant fatty acid. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was Q-8 and the major polar lipids of both strains were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and an unknown glycolipid. Both strains had highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to members of the genus MICROBULBIFER: Strain Y215T was closely related to the type strains of Microbulbifer maritimus (97.6 %) and Microbulbifer donghaiensis (97.5 %), whereas strain Y226T was closely related to the type strain of M. salipaludis (97.6 %). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strains Y215T and Y226T fell into two separate clusters. The DNAâDNA relatedness values of strain Y215T with M. maritimus TF-17T and M. donghaiensis CN85T were 34.1 and 32.8 %, respectively, whereas that between strain Y226T and M. salipaludis SM-1T was 38.0 %; these values are significantly lower than the threshold value for the delineation of bacterial species. On the basis of their distinct taxonomic characteristics, the two isolates represent two novel species of the genus Microbulbifer, for which the names Microbulbifer marinus sp. nov. and Microbulbifer yueqingensis sp. nov. are proposed; the type strains are Y215T ( = CGMCC 1.10657T = JCM 17211T) and Y226T ( = CGMCC 1.10658T = JCM 17212T), respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMicrobulbifer 3acasein 3acatalase 3afatty acids 3agelatin 3amarine sediments 3anew species 3anitrate reduction 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3asodium chloride 3astarch 3atemperature 3atyrosine 3aChina1 aHuo, Ying-Yi1 aXu, Xue-Wei1 aWu, Yue-Hong1 aWang, Chun-Sheng1 aXu, Xue-Feng1 aWu, Min0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2012 Mar., v. 62, no.

PU1 was made up of castor oil and 4,4′-diphenylmethano-diisocyanate (MDI), a polyurethane that is not swollen by water, and PU2 was made up of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with MDI, a polyurethane exhibiting a high degree of swelling by water. PU2 also has the ability to form a considerable amount of hydrogen bonds with water molecules. To mimic the non-swollen and swollen behavior, canonical (i.e., NVT) and isothermal-isobaric (i.e., NPT) ensembles were used for PU1 and PU2, respectively. Simulation results showed that the diffusivity of water in PU1 was insensitive to its concentration at low concentrations but decreased with increasing concentration for PU2. Further data analysis revealed that in the case of PU1, both the mean number of hops of water molecules from one free volume hole to another and the mean hopping distance did not vary with water concentration. In other words, at low concentrations, hopping of water molecules is not affected by the presence of other water molecules, suggesting that there is no blocking effect. In the case of PU2, the mean number of hops did decrease drastically in the concentration range of 0–2 wt% and leveled off at higher concentrations while the mean hopping distance exhibited a slight decrease. It was found that the observed behavior is mainly attributed to the hydrogen bonds formed between PU2 and water molecules. However, it is the swelling behavior (i.e., high ⅆK/ⅆc below 2 wt% but almost constant ⅆK/ⅆc above 2 wt%) leads to the concentration dependence profile of diffusion coefficient. Compared with the theory of Barrie and Platt, the computed diffusivity is much lower than that is predicted by the theory. This is because the theory does not include effects from the hydrogen bonds formed between PU2 and water molecules and the swelling behavior of PU2.  aPublisher supplied data 3acastor oil 3adiffusivity 3ahydrogen bonding 3amolecular dynamics 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolyurethanes1 aChoi, Phillip0 tPolymer.g2012 July 6, v. 53, no. 15 p.3253-3260dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2012.04.0563Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011800171300001600289520137800305592002801683650001101711650004401722650000701766650001901773650001501792700002301807773011701830856008201947852000902029655001202038IND60100753020221123030754.0141105e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010075302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.06.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmbati, Jyothirmai10aReaction-induced phase separation of bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane upon sol–gel polymerization in acidic conditions  ap. 345-353.  aWhile organically bridged alkoxysilane precursors such as bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane (BTESE) find increasing use in materials synthesis, their polymerization still has not been subject to detailed kinetic investigations. One factor complicating the measurement and interpretation of the behavior of these monomers is their tendency to aggregate during polymerization into small clusters or particles. Here, the phase behavior and kinetics of BTESE during polymerization in acidic water–ethanol solutions are investigated in situ using ²⁹Si NMR spectroscopy. Based on macroscopic observation of the colloidal stability of the reacting solutions, a ternary pseudo-phase diagram is constructed and solutions that seem from a macroscopic point of view to be favorable for kinetic investigation are probed in situ using ²⁹Si NMR. However, even when the solutions remain optically clear, the polymerization mixtures are sometimes prone to gradual loss of NMR signal. The rate of signal loss is found to be dependent on the initial composition as well as the pH of the reacting mixtures. We speculate that this phenomenon is caused by microphase separation of reaction intermediates formed early in the polymerization process. This phenomenon is likely to affect the formation and distribution of oligomers in the solution that eventually react together to form a material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethane 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apolymerization 3aseparation1 aRankin, Stephen E.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 362, no. 2 p.345-353dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.06.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01207naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245006700176300001600243520031600259592002800575650000800603650001100611650002400622650001600646700002500662700001800687773008400705856008400789990002300873852000900896655001200905IND60110911620221117225004.0141109e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011091162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultras.2011.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLicznerski, Tomasz J.10aUltrasonic system for accurate distance measurement in the air  ap. 960-965.  aThis paper presents a system that accurately measures the distance travelled by ultrasound waves through the air.

Previous studies have reported on waste reduction potential from adopting prefabrication in various economies including Hong Kong. A significant shortcoming of these studies; however, is the neglect of the upstream processes of prefabrication including the manufacturing and transportation of components, which causes construction waste as well. To date it is still unclear how this portion of construction waste is generated and quantified. The issues are even more complicated in Hong Kong where components are manufactured in the offshore Pearl River Delta Region (PRDR) of mainland China and transported across the border to construction sites in Hong Kong. Against the theoretical backdrop of whole life cycle thinking, the aim of this study is to empirically investigate the manufacture and cross-border transportation processes, thereby to assess the waste reduction potentials of using prefabrication in construction. It does so by conducting three in-depth case studies with selected PRDR prefabrication factories. A hybrid of research methods are employed in the study. It is found that the waste generation rate in the upstream processes of offshore prefabrication is around 2% or lower by weight. This proves the orthodox that prefabrication in a factory environment is more conducive to waste reduction than the traditional cast in-situ construction manner. However, transporting the components adds cost and simultaneously increases the risk of waste generation. This study provides insights into understanding construction waste reduction through offshore prefabrication from a holistic view.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aconstruction industry 3aenvironmental impact 3afactories 3alife cycle thinking 3amanufacturing 3arisk 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asociety 3atransportation 3awaste reduction 3awastes 3aChina1 aYuan, Hongping0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2013 Dec., v. 28 p.804-811dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2013.08.0483Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01637naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245008600174300001800260520066200278592002800940650002200968650001800990650001901008650001401027700001801041700001801059700001901077700001601096700002101112773008801133856008101221852000901302655001201311IND60109491920221121220151.0141109e20120527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010949192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.03.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOelgemöller, Michael,10aSynthesis, structural characterization and photoisomerization of cyclic stilbenes  ap. 4048-4056.  aSix cyclic stilbene derivatives with hindered free rotation around the C(vinyl)–C(phenyl) single bond were synthesized by McMurry coupling.

Silver (Ag) nanoparticle (NP) based ink, with average particle size of 150nm, was inkjet printed on the surface of the silicon wafer. A thickness of 400nm was measured for the printed Ag NP film using vertical scanning interferometry. The Ag NP printed SERS substrate was tested toward heavy metal compounds like cadmium sulfide (CdS), zinc oxide (ZnO) and mercury sulfide (HgS). An amplification of the SERS intensity by an order of 3–5 times was observed for all test samples, due to the presence of hotspots between the metal nanoparticle aggregates. The responses demonstrated the feasibility of the novel SERS substrate to be used in applications for detection of heavy metal compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acadmium 3aheavy metals 3amercury 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3asilicon 3azinc oxide1 aNarakathu, B.B.1 aReddy, A.S.G.1 aMoorthi, A.1 aAtashbar, M.Z.1 aRebrosova, E.1 aRebros, M.1 aJoyce, M.0 tSensors and actuators.g2012 , v. 171-172 p.705-711dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.05.0603Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012000175300001400295520122600309592002801535650002501563650002301588650001301611650001201624650001401636650001101650650001601661700001601677700001301693773009401706856008401800852000901884655001201893IND60101982020221119143545.0141106e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010198202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2013.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOthman, Nur Hidayati10aBi₁.₅Y₀.₃Sm₀.₂O₃₋δ-based ceramic hollow fibre membranes for oxygenseparation and chemicalreactions  ap. 58-65.  aIn this study, Bi₁.₅Y₀.₃Sm₀.₂O₃-δ (BYS), an oxide of great ionic conductivity, has been used to develop BYS-La₀.₈Sr₀.₂MnO₃-δ (LSM) dual-phase ceramic hollow fibre membranes in an objective of promoting oxygen permeation that has been considered as the controlling step of our recent dual-layer ceramic hollow fibre membrane reactor (DL-CHFMR) for methane conversion, and subsequently lowering the temperature needed for both oxygen separation and catalytic reaction. Oxygen permeation of approximately 1.21mlmin⁻¹cm⁻² (900°C, Ar as sweep gas) was achieved by a single-layer BYS–LSM hollow fibre membrane, which is substantially higher than the previous counterpart of (ZrO₂)₀.₉₀(Sc₂O₃)₀.₁₀(ScSZ)–LSM, proving the advantage of using BYS in promoting oxygen permeation. Although the stability of BYS in strong reducing atmosphere hampers the use of BYS–LSM/BYS–Ni DL-CHFMR for partial oxidation of methane (POM), its great ionic conductivity and catalytic activity to oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) would lead to the further development of more efficient DL-CHFMR design that can be operated at possibly lower temperatures and under less reducing atmospheres.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acatalytic activity 3aceramics 3amethane 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3atemperature1 aWu, Zhentao1 aLi, Kang0 tJournal of membrane science.g2013 Apr. 1, v. 432 p.58-65dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2013.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245011100207300001600318506007600334520170500410592002802115506003702143650001502180650002002195650002602215650001002241650001302251650001302264650002202277650001202299650001802311650001602329650001102345650001302356650001302369650001302382650002102395650001902416650001402435650003502449650001702484650001702501650001502518700001702533700001902550700002102569700002802590700002002618773009202638856008102730852000902811655001202820IND60103486620221207073303.0141106e20110523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010348662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2010.09.0122doi7 aPMC31004752pmcid7 a209324952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPal, Dhananjay10aEfflux transporters- and cytochrome P-450-mediated interactions between drugs of abuse and antiretrovirals  ap. 959-971.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMultidrug regimens and corresponding drug interactions cause many adverse reactions and treatment failures. Drug efflux transporters: P-gp, MRP, BCRP in conjunction with metabolizing enzymes (CYPs) are major factors in such interactions. Most effective combination antiretrovirals (ARV) therapy includes a PI or a NNRTI or two NRTI. Coadministration of such ARV may induce efflux transporters and/or CYP3A4 resulting in sub-therapeutic blood levels and therapeutic failure due to reduced absorption and/or increased metabolism. A similar prognosis is true for ARV-compounds and drugs of abuse combinations. Morphine and nicotine enhance CYP3A4 and MDR1 expression in vitro. A 2.5 fold rise of cortisol metabolite was evident in smokers relative to nonsmokers. Altered functions of efflux transporters and CYPs in response to ARV and drugs of abuse may result in altered drug absorption and metabolism. Appropriate in vitro models can be employed to predict such interactions. Influence of genetic polymorphism, SNP and inter-individual variation in drug response has been discussed. Complexity underlying the relationship between efflux transporters and CYP makes it difficult to predict the outcome of HAART as such, particularly when HIV patients taking drugs of abuse do not adhere to HAART regimens. HIV⁺ pregnant women on HAART medications, indulging in drugs of abuse, may develop higher viral load due to such interactions and lead to increase in mother to child transmission of HIV. A multidisciplinary approach with clear understanding of mechanism of interactions may allow proper selection of regimens so that desired therapeutic outcome of HAART can be reached without any side effects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aadverse effects 3aantiretroviral agents 3ablood 3achildren 3acortisol 3adrug interactions 3aenzymes 3aillicit drugs 3ametabolites 3amodels 3amorphine 3anicotine 3apatients 3apharmacokinetics 3apregnant women 3aprognosis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atherapeutics 3atransporters 3aviral load1 aKwatra, Deep1 aMinocha, Mukul1 aPaturi, Durga K.1 aBudda, Balasubrahmanyam1 aMitra, Ashim K.0 tLife sciences.g2011 May 23, v. 88, no. 21-22 p.959-971dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2010.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245007200164300001400236520166900250592002801919650002901947650001401976650001201990650001602002650001802018650002502036650002902061650001102090650001502101650002602116650001502142650001702157651001102174651001002185651001202195651001602207651001902223651001802242700002202260773010102282856008202383990002302465852000902488655001202497IND60108071420221119173525.0141108e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010807142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2013.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYaoyang, Xu10aMapping biofuel field: A bibliometric evaluation of research output  ap. 82-91.  aAmong sustainable and renewable energies, biofuels appear to be the most promising and attractive, and related research has been expanding along with an exceptional growth of scientific knowledge. Based on the Science Citation Index Expanded from the Web of Science, a bibliometric evaluation of research output was carried out to map research activities and tendencies of the global biofuel field. The results indicate that annual output of scientific articles rocketed during the past decade (2003–2012). The United States of America (USA) is leading biofuels research and collaborated mainly with other productive countries (China, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada and South Korea). In general, international collaborative publications resulted in more citations than single country publications. Institutional collaborations became increasingly prevalent over time and the 15 most productive institutions of USA tended to collaborate more with each other. Most research publications on biofuels appeared in the journals Biomass and Bioenergy and Bioresource Technology. Furthermore, biofuels research was based on combinations of multi-subject categories including “Energy and fuels”, “Biotechnology and applied microbiology”, “Chemical engineering”, “Environmental sciences” and “Agricultural engineering”. The keyword analysis confirmed the production of biodiesel from microalgae as the mainstream of recent biofuels research. Biorefinery was the most common technology for conversions of biological feedstock and life cycle assessment was the most popular tool of decision support to evaluate the sustainability of biofuel development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural engineering 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3abiotechnology 3achemical engineering 3adecision support systems 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3alife cycle assessment 3amicroalgae 3amicrobiology 3aCanada 3aChina 3aGermany 3aSouth Korea 3aUnited Kingdom 3aUnited States1 aBoeing, Wiebke J.0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2013 Dec., v. 28 p.82-91dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2013.07.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245005800173300001800231520116300249592002801412650001301440650002601453650001001479650001801489650001701507650003901524650001501563650001101578650001901589650001301608650001101621650001901632700001801651700002301669700002001692700001801712773008401730856008501814990002301899852000901922655001201931IND60105799220221120204347.0141108e20130802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010579922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2013.06.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKępińska, Daria10aEncapsulation of Nile Red in polypyrrole microvessels  ap. 4538-4544.  aPolymeric hollow structures are a popular topic in modern chemistry and materials science because of their potential importance in biomedical applications such as smart drug delivery systems. We report on the preparation of polypyrrole microvessels that are capable of encapsulating Nile Red, a solvatochromic dye that serves as a model of lipophilic drugs. Using a range of modern physicochemical methods including electron and optical microscopy, vibrational and fluorescence spectroscopy, and zeta potential measurements, we show that the dye can be encapsulated effectively through chemical polymerization of pyrrole onto p-xylene droplets that contain Nile Red. The fluorophore resides within the organic core of the microvessels but interacts with the polymer wall material (or pyrrole oligomers formed during polymerization) which is manifested as slower rotational dynamics and shorter fluorescence lifetime of the dye in comparison to bulk solvent. We also demonstrate release of the dye to the surrounding solution and show that this process is governed primarily by the miscibility of the organic core (p-xylene) with the external phase (solvent).  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3axylene 3azeta potential1 aBudniak, Adam1 aKijewska, Krystyna1 aBlanchard, G.J.1 aMazur, Maciej0 tPolymer.g2013 Aug. 2, v. 54, no. 17 p.4538-4544dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2013.06.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01487naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016100167300001600328520052900344592002800873650002100901650002600922650001000948650002400958700001400982773008800996856008101084990002301165852000901188655001201197IND60108795020221118000236.0141108e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010879502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2013.07.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorotcenkov, G.10aEngineering approaches for the improvement of conductometric gas sensor parameters: Part 1.

In the pituitary, lactotrophs are the cell population with the greatest increase in cell death, whereas in the hypothalamus and cerebellum astrocytes are most highly affected. Insulin treatment can delay, but does not prevent, diabetic complications. As ghrelin and growth hormone (GH) secretagogues are reported to prevent apoptosis in different tissues, and to modulate glucose homeostasis, a combined hormonal treatment may be beneficial. Hence, we analyzed the effect of insulin and GH-releasing peptide 6 (GHRP-6) on diabetes-induced apoptosis in the pituitary, hypothalamus and cerebellum of diabetic rats. Adult male Wistar rats were made diabetic by streptozotocin injection (65mg/kg ip) and divided into four groups from diabetes onset: those receiving a daily sc injection of saline (1ml/kg/day), GHRP-6 (150μg/kg/day), insulin (1–8U/day) or insulin plus GHRP-6 for 8weeks. Control non-diabetic rats received saline (1ml/kg/day). Diabetes increased cell death in the pituitary, hypothalamus and cerebellum (P<0.05). In the pituitary, insulin treatment prevented diabetes-induced apoptosis (P<0.01), as well as the decline in prolactin and GH mRNA levels (P<0.05). In the hypothalamus, neither insulin nor GHRP-6 decreased diabetes-induced cell death. However, the combined treatment of insulin+GHRP-6 prevented the diabetes induced-decrease in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels (P<0.05). In the cerebellum, although insulin treatment increased GFAP levels (P<0.01), only the combined treatment of insulin+GHRP-6 decreased diabetes-induced apoptosis (P<0.05). In conclusion, insulin and GHRP-6 exert tissue specific effects in STZ-diabetic rats and act synergistically on some processes. Indeed, insulin treatment does not seem to be effective on preventing some of the diabetes-induced alterations in the central nervous system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aapoptosis 3aastrocytes 3acerebellum 3adiabetic complications 3aghrelin 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ahypothalamus 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aprolactin 3arats 3asomatotropin 3astreptozotocin 3atissues1 aGarcía-Cáceres, Cristina1 aTuda, María1 aFrago, Laura M.1 aChowen, Julie A.1 aArgente, Jesús,0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2011 Apr. 30, v. 337, no. 1-2 p.101-113dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2011.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009900166300001400265520097300279592002801252650002201280650002201302650002101324650000901345650002601354650001101380650001301391650002401404650002101428700001801449700001301467700001701480773008601497856008101583852000901664655001201673IND60110276720221118082713.0141109e20121110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011027672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2012.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Xianzhao10aSynthesis, characterization and thermal degradation kinetics of aluminum diisobutylphosphinate  ap. 70-75.  aThe novel flame retardant aluminum diisobutylphosphinate was synthesized and its structure was identified and studied by elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

Dense flat cellulose ester films were prepared and studied so that the influence of membrane fabrication, morphology and processing history on transport properties can be minimized. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) was employed to characterize the free volume of these cellulose esters. It was found that the transport and free volume properties can be correlated with the functional groups and their content in cellulose esters. High hydroxyl content leads to a high hydrophilicity hence resulting in a high water and salt partition coefficient. Hydrophilic cellulose esters suffer from low water/salt selectivity. On the other hand, an increase in bulky and hydrophobic propionyl or butyryl groups generally enhances cellulose esters' selectivity but brings down the permeability. However, a very high content of bulky functional group causes a drop in selectivity due to poor chain packing and the enlarged free volume as confirmed by PALS. Experimental results suggest that cellulose esters with moderate content of both hydroxyl and bulky side groups have the best diffusivity selectivity and may be suitable as membrane materials for salty water separation. An upper bound relationship between solubility selectivity and water partition coefficient was also observed in these cellulose esters as suggested in previous literature for other polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3achemical structure 3adiffusivity 3aesters 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3apartition coefficients 3apermeability 3apolymers 3asaline water 3asolubility 3aspectroscopy1 aChung, Tai-shung,1 aHelmer, Bradley J.1 ade Wit, Jos.

Based on the analysis of the adsorption isotherms, the total free energy change of adsorption was determined and a novel method was proposed to determine the maximum adsorbed amount of surfactant. It can be concluded that the driving force for adsorption first increases with increasing adsorbed amount of the sugar surfactants and then levels off in a plateau. This peculiar behaviour is interpreted as formation of a thin liquid-like alkane film of overlapping alkyl chains at the air/water interface once a certain adsorbed amount is exceeded. The driving force of adsorption depends on the alkyl chain length only and is not affected by the type of the head group. The hydrophobic contribution to the standard free energy change of adsorption was compared with the values of sodium alkylsulfate and alkyltrimethylammonium bromide surfactants. This comparison reveals that the hydrophobic driving force of adsorption is the largest for the sodium alkylsulfates, whereas it is the same for the sugar surfactants and the alkyltrimethylammonium bromides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3aalkanes 3abromides 3aenergy 3ahydrophobicity 3amethodology 3asorption isotherms 3asugars 3asurface tension 3asurfactants1 aMészáros, Róbert1 aStubenrauch, Cosima1 aGilányi, Tibor0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 379, no. 1 p.78-83dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.04.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014600163300001600309500001500325520121600340592002801556650001901584650001101603650002201614650002801636650001501664650002101679650001401700650001601714650002501730650001801755650001501773653001701788700001701805700001801822700001801840700001801858773008801876856008101964990002302045852000902068655001202077IND60108795520221118000001.0141108e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010879552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2013.07.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yumin13aAn electrochemical biosensor for rapid detection of bovine serum albumin damage induced by hydroxyl radicals in room temperature ionic liquid  ap. 741-746.  a2019-12-04  aOxidative protein damage has been widely implicated in carcinogenesis and other disorders. Sensitive and reliable detection of protein oxidative damage remains a significant challenge. Reported herein is a novel electrochemical biosensor for direct detection of bovine serum albumin (BSA) oxidative damage in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM][PF₆]). Oxidation of BSA immobilized on the electrode was induced by hydroxyl radical produced from Fenton reaction. An electroactive indicator, Tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)cobalt(III)perchlorate, was employed in the detection. The oxidative peak current of Co(bpy)₃ ³⁺ decreased with the incubation time of BSA film in Fenton reagents. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to study the interface properties of the protein modified electrode surface. More dramatic damage in [BMIM][PF₆] compared with that in an aqueous solvent media confirmed that [BMIM][PF₆] was suitable medium for the electrochemical detection of BSA damage. The influences of the incubation time, the concentrations of Fenton reagents and antioxidants on BSA damage were obtained. The method is promising for a rapid and sensitive detection of protein damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3acobalt 3ahydroxyl radicals 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aoxidation 3atemperature 3abovine serum albumin 3aionic liquids 3abiosensors 0aantioxidants1 aXiong, Huayu1 aZhang, Xiuhua1 aGu, Haoshuang1 aWang, Shengfu0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Nov., v. 188 p.741-746dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2013.07.0953Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010500166300001600271520127300287592002801560650000801588650001201596650001601608700001701624700001701641700001801658700001901676773010301695856008501798990002301883852000901906655001201915IND60101674220221120143910.0141106e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010167422DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-6058(13)60438-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Jing,10aExperimental study of the interaction between the spark-induced cavitation bubble and the air bubble  ap. 895-902.  aExperiments are carried out by using high-speed photography to investigate the interaction between the spark-generated cavitation bubble and the air bubble in its surrounding fluid. Three problems are discussed in detail: the impact of the air bubble upon the development of the cavitation bubble, the evolution of the air bubble under the influence of the cavitation bubble, and the change of the fluid pressure during the development of a micro jet of the cavitation bubble. Based on the experimental results, under the condition of no air bubble present, the lifetime of the cavitation bubble from expansion to contraction increases with the increase of the maximum radius. On the other hand, when there is an air bubble present, different sized cavitation bubbles have similarity with one another generally in terms of the lifetime from expansion to contraction, which does not depend on the maximum radius. Also, with the presence of an air bubble, the lifetime of the smaller cavitation bubble is extended while that of the bigger ones reduced. Furthermore, it is shown in the experiment that the low pressure formed in the opposite direction to the cavitation bubble micro jet makes the air bubble in the low pressure area being stretched into a steplike shape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abubbles 3aphotography1 aXu, Wei-Lin,1 aNIU, Zhi-pan1 aLUO, Shu-jing1 aZHENG, Qiu-wen0 tJournal of Hydrodynamics, Ser.B.g2013 Dec., v. 25, no. 6 p.895-902dElsevier Ltdx1001-60587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-6058(13)60438-23Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01956naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010000160300002000260520101800280592002801298650001401326650001301340650001401353650001301367650001101380700001801391700001801409773014401427856007401571852000901645655001201654IND60670496020221116212602.0191002e20130827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067049602DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta12116j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Young Hwa10aGraphene-supported Na₃V₂(PO₄)₃ as a high rate cathode material for sodium-ion batteries  ap. 11350-11354.  aSubstantial interest in sodium resources that are inexpensive and abundant in the earth has guided intense research on Na-based electrode materials. We report a facile synthetic strategy to improve the rate performance of Na-based electrode materials in sodium-ion batteries. Na₃V₂(PO₄)₃ (NVP) is one of the most promising cathode materials with a NASICON structure, and it has been synthesized on a graphene sheet surface using a simple method that combines sol–gel and solid-state reaction. The NVP/graphene composite displays an excellent high-rate performance; it delivers approximately 67% of the initial 0.2 C capacity at a 30 C rate, whereas bare NVP produces only 46% of the 0.2 C capacity at a 5 C rate. It also demonstrates high capacity retention both at 1 C and 10 C cycles as a promising cathode for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries. This outstanding result can be ascribed to the key role of graphene in enhancing the electronic conductivity of electrode materials compared with bare NVP.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acathodes 3achemistry 3agraphene 3asodium1 aLim, Chek Hai1 aKim, Do Kyung0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Aug. 27, v. 1, no. 37 p.11350-11354dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta12116j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245010300184300001600287520106900303592002801372650002901400650001301429650002701442650001301469650001201482650001501494650001101509650002401520650000901544650001301553650000901566650001301575650002501588650001201613650001601625650002901641650002201670650003301692650004901725650002401774700002001798700001901818700001901837700002001856700002701876773009501903856008101998852000902079655001202088IND50074479420221120214424.0150214e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007447942DNAL7 a245543422pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-014-0539-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBosch, Julian10aMetabolic Efficiency of Geobacter sulfurreducens Growing on Anodes with Different Redox Potentials  ap. 763-768.  aMicroorganisms respiring Fe(III) in the environment face a range of redox potentials of the prospective terminal ferric electron acceptors, because Fe(III) can be present in different minerals or organic complexes. We investigated the adaptation of Geobacter sulfurreducens to this range by exposing the bacteria to different redox potentials between the electron donor acetate and solid, extracellular anodes in a microbial fuel-cell set-up. Over a range of anode potentials from −0.105 to +0.645 V versus standard hydrogen electrode, G. sulfurreducens produced identical amounts of biomass per electron respired. This indicated that the organism cannot utilize higher available energies for energy conservation to ATP, and confirmed recent studies. Either the high potentials cannot be used due to physiological limitations, or G. sulfurreducens decreased its metabolic efficiency, and less biomass per unit of energy was produced. In this case, G. sulfurreducens “wasted” energy at high-potential differences, most likely as heat to fuel growth kinetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeobacter sulfurreducens 3aacetates 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abacteria 3abiomass 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3airon 3aminerals 2aAcetatesxmetabolism 2aBiomass 2aElectricity 2aElectrodesxmicrobiology 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFerric Compoundsxmetabolism 2aGeobacterxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aOxidation-Reduction1 aLee, Keun-Young1 aHong, Siang-Fu1 aHarnisch, Falk1 aSchröder, Uwe,1 aMeckenstock, Rainer U.0 tCurrent microbiology.g2014 June, v. 68, no. 6 p.763-768dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-014-0539-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02005naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013300166300001600299520083800315592002801153650001801181650002101199650001201220650001401232650001101246650001701257653001801274653002001292653001701312653001001329700001701339700001601356700001601372700001901388700001801407773012201425856005101547852000901598655001201607IND50088702020221119202008.0140414e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008870202DNAL7 a10.1080/15538362.2011.6083072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhat, Z.

The growth regulator treatments were applied by dipping the bunches at either 7 or 15, or both 7 and 15 days after fruit set. The results showed that two dips, i.e., (7th + 15th) days after fruit set were more effective than single dips. The treatments having a combination of either higher or lower concentration of both BR (0.4 ppm) and CPPU (4 ppm) along with brassinosteroid 20 ppm produced maximum bunch weight (371.13 g), berry weight (4.90 g), berry volume (4.22), and number of berries per bunch (90.88).  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzyladenine 3abrassinosteroids 3adipping 3afruit set 3agrapes 3asmall fruits 0abenzyladenine 0abrassinosteroid 0abunch weight 0agrape1 aReddy, Y.

The Target of Rapamycin (TOR) network is a major control mechanism in eukaryotes and influences processes such as translation, mitochondrial activity, production of reactive oxygen species, and the cytoskeleton. In Arabidopsis thaliana, inhibition of the TOR kinase causes changes in cell wall architecture and suppression of phenotypic defects of the cell wall formation mutant lrx1 (leucine-rich repeat extensin 1). The rol17 (repressor of lrx1 17) mutant was identified as a new suppressor of lrx1 that induces also a short root phenotype. The ROL17 locus encodes isopropylmalate synthase 1, a protein involved in leucine biosynthesis. Dependent on growth conditions, mutations in ROL17 do not necessarily alter the level of leucine, but always cause development of the rol17 mutant phenotypes, suggesting that the mutation does not only influence leucine biosynthesis. Changes in the metabolome of rol17 mutants are also found in plants with inhibited TOR kinase activity. Furthermore, rol17 mutants show reduced sensitivity to the TOR kinase inhibitor AZD-8055, indicating a modified TOR network. Together, these data suggest that suppression of lrx1 by rol17 is the result of an alteration of the TOR network.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-10-LABX-0040-SPS)cLabEx Saclay Plant Sciences-SPS  cPSC – Syngenta Research Fellowship Program  a31003A_166577/1cSwiss National Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/5011000017110 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aamino acid composition 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3acytoskeleton 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aenzymes 3aeukaryotic cells 3aextensin 3agrowth and development 3aleucine 3aloci 3ametabolome 3amitochondria 3amutants 3amutation 3anutrient availability 3aphenotype 3arapamycin 3areactive oxygen species 3aroot hairs 3atarget of rapamycin proteins 0aArabidopsis 0aAZD-8055 0aIPMS1 0aLRX1 0arol17 0aroot 0aroot hair 0aTOR1 aGalbier, Florian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4705-63061 aHerger, Aline1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1043-64411 ade Brito Francisco, Rita1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7728-84771 aRoffler, Stefan1 aClément, Gilles,1 aDiet, Anouck1 aHörtensteiner, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3751-50891 aWicker, Thomas1 aRingli, Christoph1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5533-22350 tJournal of experimental botany.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 70, no. 8 p.2313-2323dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44658x1460-24317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ery4633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245010600183520130800289592002801597650004401625650002301669650002201692650002601714650001901740650001001759650002201769650001301791650001801804650001801822650001601840650002601856650002001882650001101902650001801913650001701931650003301948650002301981650001802004650001602022653003002038653003402068653001902102700003102121700003002152700002802182700002802210700003702238700002102275700003302296773010102329856008602430852000902516655001202525IND60650998620221119014038.0200220e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065099862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1052172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNascimento da Silva, Milena10aPhysical and morphological properties of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose films with curcumin polymorphs  aNative curcumin (UC, untreated curcumin) was treated (TC, treated curcumin) using antisolvent precipitation technique and incorporated in hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) based film solution.

In addition, thickness, moisture content, color, barrier permeability (water, O₂ and CO₂), mechanical and thermal properties of films as well as the release of curcumin from film to food simulant was investigated. The results obtained by several techniques showed that TC polymorphs were obtained by antisolvent precipitation with lower particle size than native curcumin. HPMC films showed a partially crystalline structure and homogeneous distribution of ingredients analyzed by XRD and SEM, respectively. Thickness, moisture content, mechanical properties and water vapor permeability of HPMC films were not altered with the presence of UC or TC. A higher percentage of curcumin release (53.9%) was obtained for HPMC-TC films when compared with HPMC-UC films (curcumin release of 7.9%). Results suggest that HPMC films containing TC by antisolvent precipitation could be used as active packaging in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactive food packaging 3acarbon dioxide 3acolor 3acrystal structure 3acurcumin 3afood industry 3ahydrocolloids 3aingredients 3amechanical properties 3amethylcellulose 3aoxygen 3aparticle size 3apermeability 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal properties 3awater content 3awater vapor 0aAntisolvent precipitation 0aHydroxypropyl methylcellulose 0aFood packaging1 ade Matos Fonseca, Jéssica1 aFeldhaus, Helena Kirchner1 aSoares, Lenilton Santos1 aValencia, Germán Ayala1 aMaduro de Campos, Carlos Eduardo1 aDi Luccio, Marco1 aMonteiro, Alcilene Rodrigues0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2019 Dec., v. 97 p.105217-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1052173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012900159300002000288520139300308592002801701650001001729650000901739650002201748650002201770650001001792650001901802700001201821700002201833700001901855700001601874700001701890700002301907773011301930856007502043852000902118655001202127IND60529138520221119010734.0160717e20121120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052913852DNAL7 a10.1021/ac30255692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Chuanzhen10aTime-of-Flight-Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry Method Development for High-Sensitivity Analysis of Acid Dyes in Nylon Fibers  ap. 10085-10090.  aA minimally destructive technique for the determination of dyes in finished fibers provides an important tool for crime scene and other forensic investigations. The analytical power and the minimal sample consumption of time-of-flight-secondary ion mass spectrometric (TOF-SIMS) analysis provides the ability to obtain definitive molecular and elemental information relevant to fiber identification, including identification of dyes, from a very small volume of sample. For both fiber surface analysis and, with the aid of cryomicrotomy, fiber cross-section analysis, TOF-SIMS was used to identify various dyes in finished textile fibers. The analysis of C.I. Acid Blue 25 in nylon is presented as a representative example. The molecular ion of C.I. Acid Blue 25 with lower than 3% on weight-of-fiber (owf) dye loading cannot be identified on dyed nylon surfaces by TOF-SIMS using a Bi₃⁺ primary ion beam. Sputtering with C₆₀⁺ provided the ability to remove surface contamination as well as at least partially remove Bi-induced damage, resulting in a greatly improved signal-to-noise ratio for the Acid Blue 25 molecular ion. The use of C₆₀⁺ for damage removal in a cyclic manner along with Bi for data acquisition provided the ability to unambiguously identify Acid Blue 25 via its molecular ion at a concentration of 0.1% owf from both fiber surfaces and cross sections.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrime 3adyes 3aforensic sciences 3amass spectrometry 3anylon 3atextile fibers1 aLi, Min1 aGarcía, Roberto,1 aCrawford, Anne1 aBeck, Keith1 aHinks, David1 aGriffis, Dieter

A.10aMulch and Organic Herbicide Combinations for In-Row Orchard Weed Suppression  ap. 316-331.  aTrials were established at two locations to evaluate weed control provided by mulches and organic herbicides alone or in combination. Mulch treatments included barley straw, pine wood chips, paper, and no mulch (bare-ground control). Herbicide treatments included three organically certified herbicides: lemon grass oil (14% v/v), clove oil (8% v/v), and two rates of acetic acid (10 and 15% v/v). Other treatments included pelargonic acid (7% v/v), glyphosate (1.06 kg ai/ha), and no-herbicide (control). Individual herbicide treatments were applied according to weed pressure and were determined every 7 to 10 days. Herbicide applications were made two and three times in 2009 at Logan and Kaysville, respectively. Treatments were carried out for a second year at both locations with herbicide treatments applied a maximum of four times. A third trial was established in 2010 at Kaysville with four application times. Weed control evaluations were made once a month, and weed population densities were evaluated at the beginning and end of the season. Weed biomass and percent weed cover were collected at the end of the 2010 season. Mulches each provided significant weed suppression in the first year, but each mulch presented unique challenges over time. For example, paper mulch effectiveness decreased over time as cracks developed during wet-dry cycles allowing weed seedlings to emerge. Volunteer barley became problematic in straw mulch plots in the first year of each trial, and annual weed seed germination on top of the wood chip mulch became problematic in the second year. The straw mulch consistently provided among the highest weed control and the least end-of-season weed biomass. Glyphosate and pelargonic acid gave near 100% weed control among all mulch treatments, including the non-mulched plots. Lemon oil and clove oil displayed the same weed control ratings as the no-herbicide treatment in the three mulches (straw, wood chip, and paper), but displayed 41–95% weed control when applied without mulch. While organically certified herbicides generally did not provide sufficient weed control alone, some mulches and organic herbicide combinations provided weed suppression similar to conventional herbicide application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCymbopogon citratus 3aacetic acid 3aannual weeds 3abarley 3abarley straw 3abiomass 3aclove oil 3aglyphosate 3alemon oil 3aoils 3aorganic certification 3apaper 3apelargonic acid 3apesticide application 3apopulation density 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3astraw mulches 3aweed control 3awet-dry cycles 3awood chips 0aweed suppression 0aclove oil 0alemon grass oil 0aacetic acid 0astraw mulch 0apaper mulch 0aintegrated weed management1 aRansom, C.

We designed an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector for intracranial delivery of the secreted HSP70-targeted peptide APOPTIN derived from Apoptin to GBM tumors. We applied this therapy to GBM models using human U87MG glioma cells and GBM xenograft models in mice. In U87MG and U251MG cells, conditioned medium from AAV2-apoptin-derived peptide (ADP)-expressing cells induced 83% and 78% cell death. In mice bearing intracranial U87MG tumors treated with AAV2-ADP, treatment resulted in a significant decrease in tumor growth and longer survival in mice bearing orthotopic invasive GBM brain tumors. These data indicate that ssAAV2-ADP injection in the left hemisphere effectively prevented ipsilateral tumor growth but was insufficient to prevent distal tumor growth in the contralateral hemisphere. However, the systemic route is the most effective approach for treating widely dispersed tumors. In summary, systemic delivery of AAV2-ADP is an attractive approach for invasive GBM treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3agene transfer 3aDependoparvovirus 3acell death 3ahumans 3aneoplasms 3aadenosine diphosphate 3abrain 3atherapeutics 3aadenosine monophosphate 3amice 3aanimal models 3aadults 0aApoptin 0aDependovirus 0aGlioma 0aApoptin-derived-peptide (ADP) 0aHSP70 0aAAV21 aZhao, Hengyu1 aLiang, Songhe1 aZhou, DanYang1 aZhang, Wenjia1 aYuan, Lijie0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 482 p.506-513dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.10.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04654naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100001800181245015700199300001800356506007600374520182000450592002802270506003702298650002302335650002602358650002102384650002302405650002002428650001902448650001802467650002602485650001802511650001702529650001602546650001702562650001602579650001002595650002402605650000902629650003102638650001802669650007602687650001202763650007902775650004702854650003702901650004002938650003502978650003703013650004503050650001103095650004403106650002703150650007203177650000903249650002103258650003203279700001903311700002103330700002203351700001803373700001903391700002303410700001803433700002103451700001703472700001903489700002403508700001603532700002403548700001803572773013303590856008003723852000903803655001203812IND4488233920221207074243.0120320e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448823392DNAL7 a217884622pmid7 aPMC31870152pmcid7 a10.1128/AAC.00366-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHata, Katsura10aEfficacy of Oral E1210, a New Broad-Spectrum Antifungal with a Novel Mechanism of Action, in Murine Models of Candidiasis, Aspergillosis, and Fusariosis  ap. 4543-4551.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aE1210 is a first-in-class, broad-spectrum antifungal with a novel mechanism of action—inhibition of fungal glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis. In this study, the efficacies of E1210 and reference antifungals were evaluated in murine models of oropharyngeal and disseminated candidiasis, pulmonary aspergillosis, and disseminated fusariosis. Oral E1210 demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in infections caused by Candida species, Aspergillus spp., and Fusarium solani. In the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis, E1210 and fluconazole each caused a significantly greater reduction in the number of oral CFU than the control treatment (P < 0.05). In the disseminated candidiasis model, mice treated with E1210, fluconazole, caspofungin, or liposomal amphotericin B showed significantly higher survival rates than the control mice (P < 0.05). E1210 was also highly effective in treating disseminated candidiasis caused by azole-resistant Candida albicans or Candida tropicalis. A 24-h delay in treatment onset minimally affected the efficacy outcome of E1210 in the treatment of disseminated candidiasis. In the Aspergillus flavus pulmonary aspergillosis model, mice treated with E1210, voriconazole, or caspofungin showed significantly higher survival rates than the control mice (P < 0.05). E1210 was also effective in the treatment of Aspergillus fumigatus pulmonary aspergillosis. In contrast to many antifungals, E1210 was also effective against disseminated fusariosis caused by F. solani. In conclusion, E1210 demonstrated consistent efficacy in murine models of oropharyngeal and disseminated candidiasis, pulmonary aspergillosis, and disseminated fusariosis. These data suggest that further studies to determine E1210's potential for the treatment of disseminated fungal infections are indicated.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAspergillus flavus 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aCandida albicans 3aCandida tropicalis 3aFusarium solani 3aamphotericin B 3aanimal models 3aantifungal properties 3aaspergillosis 3abiosynthesis 3acandidiasis 3adrug therapy 3afluconazole 3afungi 3amechanism of action 3amice 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asurvival rate 2aAminopyridinesxadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aAnimals 2aAntifungal Agentsxadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aAspergillosisxdrug therapyxmicrobiology. 2aAspergillus flavusxdrug effects 2aAspergillus fumigatusxdrug effects 2aCandida albicansxdrug effects 2aCandida tropicalisxdrug effects 2aCandidiasisxdrug therapyxmicrobiology. 2aFemale 2aFusariosisxdrug therapyxmicrobiology. 2aFusariumxdrug effects 2aIsoxazolesxadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred ICR 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests1 aHorii, Takaaki1 aMiyazaki, Mamiko1 aWatanabe, Nao-aki1 aOkubo, Miyuki1 aSonoda, Jirō,1 aNakamoto, Kazutaka1 aTanaka, Keigo1 aShirotori, Syuji1 aMurai, Norio1 aInoue, Satoshi1 aMatsukura, Masayuki1 aAbe, Shinya1 aYoshimatsu, Kentaro1 aAsada, Makoto0 tAntimicrobial agents and chemotherapy.g2011 Oct., v. 55, no. 10 p.4543-4551dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0066-48047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AAC.00366-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001400112245015300126300001400279520157300293592002801866650001501894650001301909650001301922650000901935650001401944650001101958650001401969650000901983650002501992653001302017653004302030653001602073700002002089700001602109700001502125700001802140700001902158700002002177773011902197852000902316655001202325IND60562199720221120133717.0170202e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056219972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Y.

Effects of distillers' dried grains with solubles on behavior of sows kept in a group-housed system with electronic sow feeders or individual stalls. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 93: 57-66. A study was conducted to investigate the effects of diets that contained distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS) on stereotypic behaviors of gestating sows housed in stalls and aggression in a group-housed system. Sows were fed corn-soybean-based control (CON) or treatment (DDGS) diets starting from their previous breeding cycle (40% and 20% DDGS as-fed basis during gestation and lactation, respectively). Group-housed sows were mixed in pens with an electronic sow feeder within 1 wk after mating. Behaviors of focal sows (n=27 in stalls, n=40 in pens) were video-recorded for a period of 24 h between 4 and 8 d after mating. Salivary cortisol levels were measured on 32 focal sows (n=16 in stalls, n=16 in pens) during the week before mating (week 0), 1 wk and 12 wk after mating. In pens, DDGS sows fought for longer periods (P=0.05), tended to fight more frequently (P=0.06), and had greater cortisol concentrations (P<0.001) at mixing compared with CON sows. In stalls, DDGS sows spent more time resting (P=0.02), less time performing stereotypies (P=0.05), and had lower cortisol concentrations (P=0.03) in week 12 compared with CON sows. These results indicate that DDGS diets may compromise the welfare of sows in pens, but improve the welfare of sows in stalls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3abreeding 3acortisol 3adiet 3alactation 3amixing 3apregnancy 3asows 3astereotyped behavior 0aBehavior 0adistillers' dried grains with solubles 0asow housing1 aPhillips, C.

Although the role of p73 in the control of genomic stability explains part of these phenotypes, a clear mechanism of how p73 participates in the inflammatory response is still elusive. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has a crucial role in mediating the inflammatory response. Because of its high potency to induce inflammation, the activation and secretion of IL-1β is tightly regulated by large protein complexes, named inflammasomes. Inflammasomes regulate activation of proinflammatory caspase-1, which in turn proteolytically processes its substrates, including pro-IL-1β. Caspase-1 gene transcription is strongly activated by p53 protein family members including p73. Here, we have addressed whether p73 might be directly involved in IL-1β regulation and therefore in the control of the inflammatory response. Our results show that TAp73β upregulates pro-IL-1β mRNA and processed IL-1β protein. In addition, analysis of breast and lung cancer patient cohorts demonstrated that interaction between p73 and IL-1β predicts a negative survival outcome in these human cancers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomarkers 3abreast neoplasms 3acaspase-1 3agene expression regulation 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3alung neoplasms 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3aphenotype 3asecretion 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aInflammation 0aInterleukin 0ap53 family 0aCytokines 0aImmunotherapy1 aPetrova, Varvara1 aGokbulut, Tarik1 aPestlikis, Ilias1 aMancini, Mara1 aDi Daniele, Nicola1 aKnight, Richard A.1 aMelino, Gerry1 aAmelio, Ivano1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9126-53910 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 482 p.498-505dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.10.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245010400168300001800272520110700290592002801397650001801425650002101443650002901464650001101493650001601504650001901520650002501539650001501564650001001579650001701589650001501606700002401621773012101645856007501766852000901841655001201850IND60558089420221120143442.0161108e20120412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055808942DNAL7 a10.1021/jp206179c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuffy, Christopher
D. P.12aA Theoretical Investigation of Xanthophyll–Protein Hydrogen Bonding in the Photosystem II Antenna  ap. 4310-4318.  aPhotoprotective nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) in higher plants is the result of the formation of energy-quenching traps in the light-harvesting antenna of photosystem II (PSII). The primary driving forces behind NPQ are the protonation of the thylakoid lumen and the de-epoxidation of the xanthophyll violaxanthin to zeaxanthin in the antenna. There is currently some disagreement over whether de-epoxidation occurs only at the peripheral, V1, binding site of the major LHCII or also at the internal, L2, site of the minor antenna CP29 complex of PSII. We have used density functional theory (DFT) to study of hydrogen bonding between xanthophylls and the protein scaffold of LHCII and CP29. We argue that a lack of hydrogen bonding for violaxanthin in LHCII is consistent with it being weakly bound and accessible for de-epoxidation. Conversely, the strong violaxanthin–protein hydrogen bonding at the L2 site of CP29 is consistent with evidence that it is not readily accessible for de-epoxidation and therefore quenching by zeaxanthin at the L2 of CP29 is an unlikely candidate for in vivo NPQ.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3ahydrogen bonding 3alight harvesting complex 3alutein 3amethodology 3aphotosystem II 3ascaffolding proteins 3athylakoids 3atraps 3aviolaxanthin 3azeaxanthin1 aRuban, Alexander V.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Apr. 12, v. 116, no. 14 p.4310-4318dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp206179c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01847naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013800160300001800298520062900316592002800945650002300973650002300996650002601019650001501045650001701060650002201077650001801099650001601117650001701133700002501150700002201175700002801197700002301225773014201248856007401390852000901464655001201473IND60670496520221116212607.0191002e20130723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067049652DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta12135f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBella, Federico10aLight cured networks containing metal organic frameworks as efficient and durable polymer electrolytes for dye-sensitized solar cells  ap. 9033-9036.  aWe describe the preparation of a polymer composite containing a Mg-based metal–organic framework (MOF) through a rapid and environmentally friendly UV-induced free-radical process.

The enzymatic deglycosylation procedure resulted in the complete removal of carbohydrate moiety. Compared with the glycosylated PGUS-P, the deglycosylated PGUS-P exhibited 20–70% higher activity (p<0.05) within pH 6–9, but 15–45% lower activity (p<0.05) at 45–70°C. The apparent decrease in the thermal stability of the deglycosylated enzyme was reflected by a decrease in the denaturation temperature (Td) values determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The removal of N-linked glycans also reduced enzyme's sensitivity to certain metal ions. The deglycosylated PGUS-P displayed lower Kₘ vaules, but higher kcₐₜ/Kₘ ratios than the glycosylated isoform towards glycyrrhizin. The consequent conformational changes were also determined by circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy which revealed no significant difference in the secondary but a slight dissimilarity between the tertiary structures of both isoforms of PGUS-P.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTalaromyces purpurogenus 3abiotechnology 3adenaturation 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosylation 3aglycyrrhizin 3ametal ions 3apH 3apolysaccharides 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aXie, Luping1 aLiu, Yanli1 aKaleem, Imdad1 aZhang, Guifeng1 aLi, Chun0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2012 Feb. 10, v. 157, no. 3 p.399-404dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2011.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245010300169300001800272500002000290520130700310592002801617596007401645650002101719650001201740650001001752650001201762650001301774650002401787650001401811650001101825650001201836650001501848650001401863650002101877650002001898650002601918650001401944700002001958700003101978700002302009700002202032700003202054700002602086700006002112773013202172856007902304852000902383655001202392IND60614925520221118142618.0181002e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061492552DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.143682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatter, Letícia B.14aThe CpxRA stress response system regulates virulence features of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli  ap. 3363-3377.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAvian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) causes localized and systemic avian infections and is responsible for considerable economic losses in the poultry industry. This organism adheres and invades human and avian cells, however, the regulatory networks that dictate its virulence are largely unknown. The CpxRA two‐component system is responsible for sensing and controlling outer‐membrane stress and detecting misfolded proteins in the bacterial periplasmic space. CpxA is a membrane sensor kinase and CpxR is a cytoplasmic transcriptional regulator. In this study, we found that the CpxRA system regulates the virulence properties of APEC. Adherence, invasiveness, motility, production of type 1 fimbriae and biofilm were negatively affected in the ΔcpxA mutant indicating that the CpxA is required for full manifestation of these phenotypes. We also found that CpxR‐P directly bound to the fimA promoter, locking the fimS region of type 1 fimbriae in the phase‐OFF orientation. In addition, the absence of CpxA also reduced flagella production strongly suggesting that CpxRA regulates these two important surface organelles in APEC. This study provides compelling evidence of the role of the CpxRA two‐component system in the regulation of virulence factors of avian pathogenic E. coli.  aPublisher supplied data  aMT78cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aEscherichia coli 3abiofilm 3abirds 3aenzymes 3afimbriae 3afinancial economics 3aflagellum 3ahumans 3amutants 3aorganelles 3aphenotype 3apoultry industry 3astress response 3atranscription factors 3avirulence1 aAres, Miguel A.1 aAbundes‐Gallegos, Judith1 aCedillo, María L.1 aYáñez, Jorge A.1 aMartínez‐Laguna, Ygnacio1 aDe la Cruz, Miguel A.1 aGirón, Jorge A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6557-74470 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2018 Sept., v. 20, no. 9 p.3363-3377dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.143683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04382naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100003500156245023200191300001600423506002800439520285800467592002803325506003703353650002403390650002103414650001303435650001603448650001803464650001303482650001503495651001103510653002703521653001603548653001703564700003103581700002903612700003003641700002203671700003003693773012503723856009103848852000903939655001203948IND60773747720221207090346.0160303e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077374772DNAL7 a10.18227/1982-8470ragro.v9i4.2638	2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonteiro, Alynny Neftaly Lopes10aPlant density and levels of NPK on the production components of vegetable soybean in the Savannah of the state of Roraima=Densidade de plantas e doses de NPK nos componentes de produção de soja-hortaliça na Savana de Roraima  ap. 352-360.  aResource is Open Access  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two sowing densities and levels of NPK (02-24- 12) on the production components of the JLM 08 strain of vegetable soybean, in the Savannah of Boa Vista, in the state of Roraima, Brazil. The experiment was carried out from November 2013 to March 2014 in the experimental area of the Centre for Agrarian Sciences at the Cauamé Campus of the Federal University of Roraima in Boa Vista. The experimental design was of randomised blocks in a factorial scheme (2 x 5) with three replications. The two densities (40,000 and 80,000 plants per hectare) comprised the first factor, while five levels of NPK (02-24-12) made up the second (0, 200, 400, 600 and 800 kg ha-1). The following were evaluated: height of insertion of the first and last pod; stem diameter; number of pods per plant having 1, 2, and 3 grains; total number of pods per plant; 100 grain weight and estimated grain yield. The height of insertion of the first and last pod in the JLM 08 genotype of the vegetable soybean is not influenced by the planting densities or levels of formulated fertiliser. At a density of 80,000 plants per hectare, the number of pods per plant is influenced by the levels of fertiliser, demonstrating a positive quadratic response. The level of fertiliser with the maximum technical efficiency (492.86 kg ha-1) gives an 18% increase in grain yield at the highest planting density. = Objetivou-se com este trabalho avaliar o efeito de duas densidades de semeadura e doses de NPK (02-24-12) nos componentes de produção da soja hortaliça linhagem JLM 08, na Savana de Boa Vista, Roraima. O experimento foi conduzido no período de novembro de 2013 a março de 2014, na área experimental do Centro de Ciências Agrária da Universidade Federal de Roraima, Campus Cauamé, em Boa Vista, Roraima. O delineamento experimental adotado foi em blocos ao acaso, em esquema fatorial (2 x 5), com três repetições. O primeiro fator correspondeu a duas densidades (40.000 e 80.000 plantas por hectare), enquanto o segundo a cinco doses de NPK (02-24-12) (0, 200, 400, 600 e 800 kg ha-1). Avaliaram-se a altura de inserção da primeira e da última vagem, diâmetro do caule, número de vagens por planta com 1, 2 e 3 grãos, número de vagens totais por planta, massa de 100 grãos, bem como a estimativa da produtividade de grãos. A altura de inserção da primeira e da última vagem do genótipo de soja-hortaliça JLM 08 não é influenciada pelas densidades de plantio nem pelas doses do adubo formulado. Na densidade de 80.000 plantas por hectare, o número de vagem por planta é influenciado pelas doses do adubo, apresentando resposta quadrática positiva. A dose de máxima eficiência técnica (492,86 kg ha-1) do adubo determina aumento de 18% na produtividade de grãos para a maior densidade de plantio.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aexperimental design 3afertilizer rates 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3aplant density 3asoybeans 3avegetables 3aBrazil 0aChemical fertilisation 0aGlycine max 0aSoybean food1 aAlves, José Maria Arcanjo1 aMatos, Williams da Silva1 aSilva, Marcelo Ribeiro da1 aSilva, Diego Lima1 aBarreto, Glauber Ferreira0 tAgro@mbiente on-line.g2016 Feb., v. 9, no. 4 p.352-360dUniversidade Federal de RoraimawJournal:27788x1982-84707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18227/1982-8470ragro.v9i4.2638	3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245010800182300001800290520157100308592002801879650002201907650002301929650001601952650001101968650000901979650001001988650002601998650001402024650002402038650001302062650001202075650001202087650003202099650001102131650005702142650007102199650005202270650002402322650003802346650002702384650002302411650002202434651001102456651001102467700001902478700001702497700001802514700001902532773009902551856004802650852000902698655001202707IND50066669020221118022700.0130525e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006666902DNAL7 a234941562pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-013-3372-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDias, A.

The efficacy of a formulation containing the fungus Pochonia chlamydosporia in controlling Fasciola hepatica eggs in faeces was evaluated in an experimental field assay. Two bovine groups (six animals each) were used: A (control) and B (treated with fungus). At 30 days after deworming, the animals were separated into two similar paddocks with flooded areas and were given pellets containing 25 % mycelial mass (group B) or no fungus (group A) at a dose of 1 g/10 kg body weight, twice a week, during 18 months. Faecal samples were harvested fortnightly in the animals of groups A and B and they were submitted at examination of quantitative sedimentation. The mean count of F. hepatica eggs per grams of faeces was significantly higher in group A (1.19) compared with those from group B (0.82) (P < 0.01). After 18 months, animals from group B had gained 42.33 kg above (17.82 % more by weight) (P < 0.01), compared with the control group (A). Every month, faecal samples from paddocks A and B were collected and they were incubated. P. chlamydosporia was identified only in sample source of the paddock B.

To enhance the thermal conductivity of PCMs, graphite powder was dispersed into the PCM pellets. Meanwhile, cellulose particles, as sacrificial particles, were mixed with the PCM pellets to relieve the volumetric expansion of the PCMs during the phase change process. The effects of the latent heat, thermal conductivity, and thermal expansion behavior of the PCM/graphite capsule were investigated. The PCM capsules were able to work at temperatures up to 900 °C, including undergoing a solid-liquid phase change at 803 °C with a latent heat of 159.6 J g−1, and survived more than 300 thermal cycles as thermal energy storage devices. The thermal performance of the PCM capsules between 500 and 900 °C was numerically investigated using a modified one-dimensional (1-D) enthalpy-based model. The results indicated that the average heat transfer of the PCM capsules with graphite-dispersed core was significantly elevated during both the charging (by 92.5% for 99% charge) and discharging (by 168.4% for 99% discharge) processes, compared to the pure core PCMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3aencapsulation 3agraphene 3aheat transfer 3alatent heat 3amodels 3apellets 3aphase transition 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 3athermal energy 3athermal expansion 0aPhase change materials 0aThermal energy storage 0aThermal management 0aLatent heat 0aGraphite1 aZhao, Bingchen1 aLin, Jun1 aZhang, Feng1 aWang, Haoran1 aZhu, Zhiyong1 aDai, Zhimin0 tRenewable energy.g2019 Apr., v. 133 p.240-247dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2018.09.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245010000178300001600278520127300294592002801567650001801595650001901613650001401632650001401646650001901660650002501679650001201704650000901716650001101725700001901736700002701755700001901782700001701801700002001818700003001838700002501868773010901893856008302002990002302085852000902108655001202117IND60098059120221119172714.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009805912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexmp.2010.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Faria, Paulo Rogério10aAbsence of galectin-3 does not affect the development of experimental tongue carcinomas in mice  ap. 189-193.  aBACKGROUND: Galectin-3 is a lectin that presents pivotal roles in tumor biology and there are no studies evaluating their expression in dysplasias and carcinomas developed from tongue carcinogenesis models. AIMS: To investigate the role of galectin-3 in the development of tongue carcinomas using a mouse model of oral carcinogenesis. METHODS: Galectin-3-deficient (gal3⁻/⁻) and wild-type (gal3⁺/⁺) mice were challenged with 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in drinking water for 16weeks and killed at different times. Tongues were removed and the number of dysplasias and carcinomas was counted. An immunohistochemical study for galectin-3 was performed only in the tongue from gal3⁺/⁺ mice. RESULTS: In both groups, a reduction of dysplasias and an increase of carcinomas from week 16 to week 32 (p>0.05) were observed. A predominance of high cytoplasmic and nuclear galectin-3 expression was observed in carcinomas (64.7%) and dysplasias (55.5%), respectively (p>0.05). The perilesional areas always presented a statistical cytoplasmic and nuclear galectin-3 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: Absence of galectin-3 did not directly affect the process of carcinogenesis and a cytoplasm shift of galectin-3 seems to be associated with development of tongue carcinomas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinoma 3acytoplasm 3adrinking water 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alectins 3amice 3atongue1 aChammas, Roger1 ade Melo, Thaissa Lopes1 aHsu, Daniel K.1 aLiu, Fu-Tong1 aNonogaki, Suely1 aCardoso, Sérgio Vitorino1 aLoyola, Adriano Mota0 tExperimental and molecular pathology.g2011 Apr., v. 90, no. 2 p.189-193dElsevier Inc.x0014-48007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexmp.2010.12.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04021naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245012700214520202800341592002802369650003002397650002902427650002402456650001702480650001102497650001902508650002502527650001302552650002002565650001802585650002602603650001602629650003002645650001802675650001502693650002502708650002602733650001502759650001402774650002402788650002102812650001502833650001302848650001102861653002902872653002202901653002402923653002402947653001702971653001402988700002003002700006003022700001903082700002103101700005703122773011903179856008803298852000903386655001203395IND60686466220221120074752.0200607e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068646622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1377142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorcelli, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4901-083510aComparative life cycle assessment of microalgae cultivation for non-energy purposes using different carbon dioxide sources  aThe ability of microalgae to sequester carbon and at the same time synthesise valuable compounds with potential applications in nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries makes them attractive for commercial deployment, especially in view of a blue bioeconomy. Among microalgae, the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum is considered as an important potential source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as eicosapentanoic acid, an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The aim of this study was to perform the Life Cycle Assessment of the cultivation of P. tricornutum - at semi-industrial scale in photobioreactor - for the production of high-quality bioactive compounds comparing synthetic carbon dioxide supply to a supply with waste carbon dioxide from a biogas upgrading process hypothesizing industrial symbiosis network. The effect of renewable energy use instead of the European electricity mix was also examined. Primary data on the production process, including the stages of cleaning and sterilisation, cultivation, harvesting and freeze-drying, were used. The midpoint impact categories recommended in the ILCD Handbook were used for performing the impact assessment. A sensitivity analysis was also performed on algal productivity, culture medium recirculation factor and amount of solvents per cleaning cycle. Firstly, results indicate in general cultivation and freeze-drying as the most contributing stages to the impacts. Secondly, they demonstrate in the comparative assessment that the use of carbon dioxide from the biogas upgrading is a feasible and attractive alternative to the synthetic one, as it allows for the improvement of the environmental performance of the production process in all the analysed impact categories. Finally, sensitivity analysis suggests that the environmental performance could be further improved by acting on other key factors, such as electricity source, nutrients culture medium and cleaning solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3aantimicrobial properties 3abioactive compounds 3abioeconomics 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acleaning 3acleaning agents 3aculture media 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aelectricity 3aenvironmental performance 3afreeze drying 3aharvesting 3aindustrial symbiosis 3alife cycle assessment 3amicroalgae 3anutrients 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aphotobioreactors 3asanitizing 3asolvents 3awastes 0aEnvironmental assessment 0aMarine microalgae 0aBioactive compounds 0aHigh-value products 0aCO2 fixation 0aWaste CO21 aDotto, Federica1 aPezzolesi, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6260-27151 aMarazza, Diego1 aGreggio, Nicolas1 aRighi, Serena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3013-01750 tScience of the total environment.g2020 June 15, v. 721 p.137714-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1377143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02065naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245009200165300001600257520100400273592002801277650001401305650001301319650001401332650002001346653001401366653002001380653001701400653001901417653001601436653002001452700002201472773013301494856007901627852000901706655001201715IND60596838920221120194347.0180620e20171220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059683892DNAL7 a10.1515/cszma-2017-00242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKocian, Jiří,10aDistribution of mountain hawkweeds (Hieracium s. str.) in the Hrubý Jeseník Mountains  ap. 193-229.  aField revision of current distribution of mountain hawkweeds (Hieracium s. str.) in the Hrubý Jeseník Mts was undertaken.

Nonabokra and cv. MTU 1010 differing in salt tolerance grown under 25, 50 and 100 mM NaCl salinity levels. A contrasting response to salt stress on enzyme activities of TCA cycle and accumulation of organic acid was observed between two cultivars during twenty-one days period of study. Salinity caused enhanced organic acid production and increase in all five enzyme activities in cv. Nonabokra whereas in cv. MTU 1010 decrease in both organic acid production and enzymes activities were noted.

The goal of our study was to understand barriers and facilitators to adherence to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans for four nutrient-rich food groups in fifth-grade children and unrelated adult caregivers across six sites in a multistate study. A total of 281 unrelated adult caregivers (32% African American, 33% European American, and 35% Hispanic American) and 321 children (33% African American, 33% European American, and 34% Hispanic American) participated in 97 Nominal Group Technique sessions. Nominal Group Technique is a qualitative method of data collection that enables a group to generate and prioritize a large number of issues within a structure that gives everyone an equal voice. The core barriers specific to unrelated adult caregivers were lack of meal preparation skills or recipes (whole grains, fruit, vegetables); difficulty in changing eating habits (whole grains, fruit, vegetables), cost (milk, whole grains, fruit, vegetables), lack of knowledge of recommendation/portion/health benefits (milk, vegetables), and taste (milk, whole grains, vegetables). Specific to children, the core barriers were competing foods (ie, soda, junk foods, sugary foods [whole grains, milk, fruit, vegetables]), health concerns (ie, milk allergy/upset stomach [milk]), taste/flavor/smell (milk, whole grains, fruit, vegetables), forget to eat them (vegetables, fruit), and hard to consume or figure out the recommended amount (milk, fruit). For both unrelated adult caregivers and children, reported facilitators closely coincided with the barriers, highlighting modifiable conditions that could help individuals to meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aDietary Guidelines 3aHispanic Americans 3aadults 3acaregivers 3achildren 3adata collection 3aeating habits 3aflavor 3afood groups 3amilk 3amilk allergy 3amilk consumption 3arecipes 3asmell 3astomach 3ataste 3avegetables 3awhole grain foods 2aAdult 2aBeverages 2aEdible Grain. 2aChild 2aDairy Products 2aDietxstandards 2aDiet Surveys 2aEthnicity. 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aFruit 2aGuidelines as Topic 2aHealth Behavior 2aHealth Promotion 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aPatient Compliance 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aVegetables 3aUnited States 0aBarriers 0aFacilitators 0aDietary guidelines 0aChildren 0aCaregivers1 aJahns, Lisa1 aBogle, Margaret L.1 aChester, Deirdra N.1 aGiovanni, Maria1 aKlurfeld, David M.1 aLaugero, Kevin1 aLiu, Yan1 aLopez, Sandra1 aTucker, Katherine L.0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2013 Oct., v. 113, no. 10 p.1317-1331dElsevier Inc.aAcademy of Nutrition and DieteticswJournal:J000001156x2212-26727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2013.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014800166300002000314520115800334592002801492650001101520650001201531650001201543650001101555650001901566650001401585650001501599650001901614650001201633650001301645650001601658700001601674700001801690700001901708700001501727700001601742700001801758700001301776773012401789856008201913852000901995655001202004IND60593616920221121083844.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059361692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-018-2288-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chongbin10aInfluence of blending zwitterionic functionalized titanium nanotubes on flux and anti-fouling performance of polyamide nanofiltration membranes  ap. 10499-10512.  aOrganic–inorganic hybrid membranes represent an efficient approach to construct membranes with both improved membrane flux and solute selectivity. Zwitterions bearing equimolar number of anions and cations in one monomer unit exhibit excellent anti-fouling characteristics. Based on the exceptional separation performance of hybrid membrane and fouling resistance feature of zwitterions, a novel nanofiltration membrane was fabricated by incorporating zwitterionic functionalized titanium nanotubes (z-TNTs) into polyamide (PA) layer. The special tubular structure of z-TNTs can provide more and shorter internal channels to shorten flow lanes for water molecules. The zwitterionic functionalization on the titanium nanotubes surface improved not only the interfacial compatibility between nano-materials and polymer matrix but also the antifouling performance of membranes. The water flux of membrane prepared with z-TNTs was up to 220 L m⁻² h⁻¹ MPa⁻¹ while the Na₂SO₄ rejection remained above 90%. The as-prepared z-TNTs/PA membrane exhibited improved anti-fouling property against protein with a notably reduced flux decline ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acations 3afouling 3amixing 3ananofiltration 3ananotubes 3apolyamides 3asodium sulfate 3asolutes 3atitanium 3azwitterions1 aLi, Zhiyuan1 aChen, Jianxin1 aZhong, Yunlong1 aRen, Liang1 aPu, Yunping1 aDong, Zhipeng1 aWu, Hong0 tJournal of materials science.g2018 July, v. 53, no. 14 p.10499-10512dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-2288-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01015naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012600157300001800283520015600301592002800457650001500485650001900500650001700519773014200536856007400678852000900752655001200761IND60642487220221120115608.0190507e20160629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064248722DNAL7 a10.1039/c6tb90078j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Xiaogang10aJournal of Materials Chemistry B top picks web collection: “seeing the unseen: advances in bioimaging and biosensors”  ap. 4500-4501.  aXiaogang Qu introduces a Journal of Materials Chemistry B Top Picks web collection on advances in bioimaging and biosensors (http://rsc.li/bioimaging).  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3aimage analysis 3apublications0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2016 June 29, v. 4, no. 26 p.4500-4501dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6tb90078j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245011100174300002100285500001500306520134600321592002801667650001001695650002801705650002101733650002301754650002101777650002201798650000801820650002201828650001301850650002401863650001601887650000801903650001101911650002501922650001901947650002101966650002001987650002202007650002702029650003002056653001702086700001502103700001902118700002102137700002002158700002202178700002402200700001902224700002202243773010102265856008802366990002302454852000902477655001202486IND60098644720221122232412.0141105e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009864472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.11.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Venus W.10aCell membrane proteins from oviductal epithelial cell line protect human spermatozoa from oxidative damage  ap. 1444-1452.e3.  a2019-12-06  aOBJECTIVE: To study the potential protective action in vitro of oviductal epithelial cell membrane proteins against oxidative damage in human spermatozoa. DESIGN: Prospective in vitro study. SETTING: University research laboratory and infertility clinic. PATIENT(S): Semen from men attending the infertility clinic at the Queen Mary Hospital with normal semen parameters (World Health Organization, 2010). INTERVENTION(S): We studied the effect of oviductal epithelial cell membrane proteins on the sperm functions and endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Sperm motility, lipid peroxidation, DNA fragmentation, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities. RESULT(S): Oviductal epithelial cell membrane proteins bind to the human spermatozoa and protect them from ROS-induced damages in terms of sperm motility, membrane integrity, DNA integrity, and intracellular ROS level. Spermatozoa–oviduct epithelial cell interaction also enhances the antioxidant defenses in spermatozoa. CONCLUSION(S): Our results demonstrated the protective effects of spermatozoon–oviductal epithelial cell interaction against oxidative stress in human spermatozoa. The results enhance our understanding of the protective mechanism of oviduct on sperm functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3asemen 3areactive oxygen species 3aepithelial cells 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3aDNA 3amembrane proteins 3apatients 3auniversity research 3aspermatozoa 3amen 3ahumans 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asperm motility 3ain vitro studies 3aenzyme activity 3aDNA fragmentation 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aWorld Health Organization 0aantioxidants1 aZhao, Weie1 aLee, Cheuk-Lun1 aLee, Cherie Y.L.1 aLam, Kevin K.W.1 aKo, Jennifer K.Y.1 aYeung, William S.B.1 aHo, Pak Chung,1 aChiu, Philip C.N.0 tFertility and sterility.g2013 Apr., v. 99, no. 5 p.1444-1452.e3dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.11.0563Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245018700181300002000368500001500388520085800403592002801261650001301289650002101302650001601323650001401339650002201353650001201375650002401387650002801411650001301439650002001452650002501472650002701497650001001524653001901534700001701553700002001570700001401590700001501604700001801619700001601637773011801653856008101771852000901852655001201861IND50070918620221119231150.0150211e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007091862DNAL7 a240920082pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-013-5258-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yu-Cai10aHighly enantioselective oxidation of phenyl methyl sulfide and its derivatives into optically pure (S)-sulfoxides with Rhodococcus sp.

The n-octane–water biphasic system was chosen for the bio-oxidation of a water-insoluble phenyl methyl sulfide (PMS) by Rhodococcus sp. CCZU10-1. In this n-octane–water system, the optimum reaction conditions were obtained. (S)-phenyl methyl sulfoxide ((S)-PMSO) with >99.9 % enantiomeric excess formed at 55.3 mM in the n-octane–water biphasic system. Using fed-batch method, a total of 118 mM (S)-PMSO accumulated in 1-L reaction mixture after the 7th feed, and no (R)-PMSO and sulfone were detected. Moreover, Rhodococcus sp. CCZU10-1 displayed fairly good activity and enantioselectivity toward other sulfides. In conclusion, Rhodococcus sp.

INTERVENTION(S): In vitro growth of secondary mouse follicles in 0.25% or 1.5% alginate (ALG) in a three-dimensional culture system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Relative transcript levels of Gdf9, Bmp15, Nlrp5, Tcl1, and Zp3 were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction in oocytes during in vitro follicle development and oocyte maturation and in their first PBs after removal from metaphase II (MII) eggs. RESULT(S): All transcripts decreased earlier in oocytes cultured in 1.5% ALG compared with 0.25% ALG. Transcript levels were lower in MII eggs cultured in 1.5% ALG compared with in 0.25% ALG. All genes were expressed in PBs, and transcript levels were lower in PBs cultured in 1.5% ALG compared with in 0.25% ALG. Abundance of all transcripts was lower in PBs than in their sibling oocytes. CONCLUSION(S): Local follicle environment modulates oocyte-specific gene expression in the oocyte and first PB. There is a significant difference in the transcript levels of oocyte-specific genes in PBs of 1.5% versus 0.25% ALG that correlates with ovarian environment-related decreases in oocyte competence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeggs 3agene expression 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3ametaphase 3amice 3aoocytes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction1 aWoodruff, Teresa K.0 tFertility and sterility.g2013 Apr., v. 99, no. 5 p.1453-1459.e1dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.12.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009300164300002000257520158100277592002801858650001501886650001101901650002801912650001301940650002601953700005101979700001602030773012402046856008202170852000902252655001202261IND60593617020221121062037.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059361702DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-018-2298-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Jiahong10aMechanical behaviors of hierarchical cellular structures with negative Poisson’s ratio  ap. 10209-10216.  aAn investigation of the mechanical behaviors on hierarchical re-entrant honeycomb structures was undertaken using finite element method. The hierarchical structure with a hierarchy order n (n ≥ 1) was constructed by replacing each vertex of a re-entrant hexagonal structure of hierarchy order n − 1 with a smaller re-entrant hexagon with identical geometry aspect ratio. The Poisson’s ratio and energy absorption capacity of re-entrant structures of different hierarchy orders were studied under various compression velocities. The minimum Poisson’s ratios of the first-order (n = 1) and second-order (n = 2) hierarchical re-entrant structures were − 1.581 and − 1.823, respectively; they were 32.9 and 53.2% lower than that of a zeroth-order hierarchical structure (i.e., conventional re-entrant hexagon). The second-order hierarchical structure exhibited the highest rate of increase in energy absorption capacity with an increasing compression velocity. The plateau stresses of the first- and second-order hierarchical structures were lower than that of the zeroth-order hierarchical structure; however, the second-order hierarchical structure exhibited the highest energy absorption capacity at high compression velocity rate (v > 40 m/s). The energy absorption capacities of the first- and second-order hierarchical structures proposed in the present study are 1.5 and 1.8 times, respectively, higher than those of the hierarchical re-entrant structures proposed in our previous work (Li et al. in Smart Mater Struct 26:025014, 2017).  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aenergy 3afinite element analysis 3ageometry 3amechanical properties1 aLi, Dong1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2546-85261 aDong, Liang0 tJournal of materials science.g2018 July, v. 53, no. 14 p.10209-10216dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-2298-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245011000201300002000311520114800331592002801479650001401507650004401521650001501565650001501580650001501595650002201610650001901632650001701651650001301668650001301681650004401694650001301738650002001751700005501771700005601826700005701882700005601939773012401995856008202119852000902201655001202210IND60593617120221121062109.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059361712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-018-2243-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Shuqing1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1082-455110aSilane-based hyper-cross-linked porous polymers and their applications in gas storage and water treatment  ap. 10469-10478.  aA series of novel silane-based hyper-cross-linked porous polymers was prepared through the Friedel–Crafts alkylation reaction of dimethyldiphenylsilane as the monomer and formaldehyde dimethyl acetal as the external cross-linker. The structures of the polymers were confirmed by FTIR and solid-state cross-polarization magic-angle spinning ¹³C NMR. We investigated the porous polymers with different ratios of dimethyldiphenylsilane to formaldehyde dimethyl acetal. Porous properties were determined by nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen adsorptions. The results revealed that the porous materials possessed surface areas from 742 to 1205 m² g⁻¹ with the increasing amount of formaldehyde dimethyl acetal. Moreover, this material exhibited high thermal stabilities, good CO₂ capture, and H₂ storage capacities. The material was also used as adsorbent for organic dyes in aqueous solution and showed an excellent adsorption capacity of 952 mg g⁻¹ for Congo red dye. These results suggest that the silane-based hyper-cross-linked porous polymers are promising materials for CO₂ capture, H₂ storage, and water treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCongo red 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aalkylation 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon dioxide 3aformaldehyde 3ahydrogen 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3awater treatment1 aYao, Jinshui1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5244-69691 aYang, Zhizhou1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1368-992X1 aSun, Hongqiang1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7019-98261 aLiu, Weiliang1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0330-52350 tJournal of materials science.g2018 July, v. 53, no. 14 p.10469-10478dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-2243-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01191naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011800159300001300277520019300290592002800483650002700511650002500538650001400563650001600577700001600593700001100609700001600620700001500636773014300651856007400794852000900868655001200877IND60642487520221120115636.0190507e20160921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064248752DNAL7 a10.1039/c6tb90121b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Pingsheng10aCorrection: Anti-biofouling ability and cytocompatibility of the zwitterionic brushes-modified cellulose membrane  ap. 6279.  aCorrection for ‘Anti-biofouling ability and cytocompatibility of the zwitterionic brushes-modified cellulose membrane’ by Pingsheng Liu et al., J.

In this study we investigated whether treatment with proline and/or 24-epibrassinolide (EBL) to two contrasting cultivars of Brassica juncea (L.) Czern and Coss viz. Varuna and RH-30 could counteract with the adverse effects of salinity on photosynthesis and seed yield. Plants were treated with proline and/or 24-epibrassinolide (EBL) at 28 and 29d-stages of growth. Salt stress reduced plant growth, photosynthetic attributes, efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm), leaf water potential and finally seed yield, at harvest but improved the activity of antioxidant enzymes in both the cultivars in a concentration dependent manner. Exogenous application of EBL with proline completely neutralised the adverse effects of salt at 78 mM or 117 mM stress levels whereas the treatment partially neutralised the impact of highest salt concentration of 156 mM, through the upregulation of the antioxidant system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidants 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3aleaf water potential 3aphotosystem II 3aplant growth 3aproline 3asalinity 3asalt concentration 3asalt stress 3aseed yield 3asoil salinity 0aPhotochemical efficiency 0aBrassica juncea 0aSuperoxide dismutase 0aCatalase 0aTranspiration rate1 aAhmad, Aqil1 aHayat, Shamsul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2476-54091 aTahir, Inayatullah0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2019 Feb., v. 135 p.385-394dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01603naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245008600164300001600250520051300266592002800779650002600807650001700833650002300850650001300873650001000886650001400896651001100910653001800921653002500939653001900964653001900983700001801002773013301020856007901153852000901232655001201241IND60596839220221120194309.0180620e20171220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059683922DNAL7 a10.1515/cszma-2017-00272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPliszko, Artur10aFurther notes on the distribution of Dittrichia graveolens (Asteraceae) in Poland  ap. 259-262.  aThe paper presents a new record of Dittrichia graveolens in Poland.

Studies have shown that low levels of income and consumption indicate poverty, and the essence of poverty is “capability poverty,” which has formed a new understanding of the causes of poverty. This study extends the capability framework to energy poverty. It uses data from the 2014, 2016, and 2018 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) to build an empirical model to analyze the impact of cognitive capability on household energy poverty in terms of income levels and energy decision-making. A higher cognitive capability has a significant impact on encouraging households to eradicate energy poverty. Further, the non-linear moderation model is used to test the impact of the interaction between cognitive capability and income, information, and social network on energy poverty.

The two main categories of FA s, unsaturated fatty acids (UFA s) and saturated fatty acids (SFA s), exert distinct effects on reproductive functions, with UFA having a conclusively beneficial impact. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are of particular importance on account of their biological properties. Standard feedstuffs (such as soybean) are rich in n-6 FA s, whereas few feedstuffs contain n-3 FA s. Neither the n-3 nor n-6 PUFA s are synthetized by the animal. Several field experiments have indicated that the recommended schedule of n-3 supplementation should last 160–170 days, from the eighth week before calving to 100 or 120 days postpartum. Supplementation of the diet thus covers the period from the late preantral stage of the follicle, the entire development of the antrum, oocyte ovulation, and fertilization, as well as the development of the preattachment embryo and its implantation. The following effects are among the important beneficial results of supplementation with n-3 FA s: a higher number of antral follicles suitable for ovum pick-up (OPU), larger dominant follicles and corresponding CL, better quality oocytes and embryos, and higher implantation rates resulting from improved uterine environment (e.g., reduced synthesis of luteolytic PGF2α). We conclude that dietary supplementation for high-yielding dairy cows with n-3 FA s supports ovarian functions and helps the embryo to survive in the adverse environment of the reproductive tract of the postpartum cow.  aPublisher supplied data 3adietary supplements 3afeeds 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aoocytes 3aovulation 3areproductive performance 3asoybeans 0aPUFA s 0afertility 0aoocyte 0aembryo 0aquality 0acattle1 aWłodarek, Jan1 aWarzych, Ewelina1 aCieślak, Adam,1 aSzumacher-Strabel, Małgorzata1 aJankowiak, Tomasz1 aLechniak, Dorota0 tAnnals of animal science.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 20, no. 4 p.1169-1183dSciendowJournal:2194x2300-87337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aoas-2020-00403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01247naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009000157300001300247520016300260592002800423650002700451650001300478650001400491650001900505650002500524700001600549700001500565700001700580700001600597700001900613700001600632700001200648773014200660856007400802852000900876655001200885IND60642487720221120110459.0190507e20161012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064248772DNAL7 a10.1039/c6tb90139e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jingli10aCorrection: Multi-responsive nanocomposite hydrogels with high strength and toughness  ap. 6609.  aCorrection for ‘Multi-responsive nanocomposite hydrogels with high strength and toughness’ by Jingli Yang et al., J.

The assurance of meat safety is a complex task, which requires strong inter-sectoral cooperation between relevant stakeholders such as Competent Authority, Academia, Food Industry and Consumers. The emerging food safety risks due to climate change may pose a serious challenge to the meat safety control system.

DESIGN: Record-linkage study. SETTING: Health maintenance organization in Israel. PATIENT(S): A total of 87,403 women evaluated and/or treated for infertility on or after September 25, 1994, who were followed for cancer development through June 22, 2011: 522 breast, 41 endometrial, 45 ovarian, 311 in situ cervical, and 32 invasive cervical cancers were identified. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Hazard ratios (HRs) for specific cancers. RESULT(S): We found no significant relationships of IVF exposures to the risks of breast, endometrial, or ovarian cancers. However, compared with women with no fertility treatment, the HR for ovarian cancer associated with IVF was 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75–3.29), with higher risk among those receiving four or more cycles (HR 1.78, 95% CI 0.76–4.13). There was also a nonsignificantly elevated risk for endometrial cancer among women who received 1–3 IVF cycles (HR 1.94, 95% CI 0.73–5.12), but additional cycles were associated with less risk. In contrast, the risk of in situ cervical cancer was significantly reduced and invasive cervical cancer nonsignificantly reduced among women receiving IVF as well as other fertility treatments. CONCLUSION(S): Our results regarding long-term effects were largely reassuring, but women receiving IVF should continue to be monitored given that the procedures involve potent ovulation stimulators and repeated ovarian punctures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3aendometrium 3ahealth services 3ain vitro fertilization 3along term effects 3aovarian neoplasms 3aovulation 3apatients 3arisk 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3awomen 3aIsrael1 aTrabert, Britton1 aShalev, Varda1 aLunenfeld, Eitan1 aSella, Tal1 aChodick, Gabriel0 tFertility and sterility.g2013 Apr., v. 99, no. 5 p.1189-1196dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.12.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03721naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245016400213300001400377520142400391592002801815650002001843650001101863650001801874650001601892650001501908650001701923650001101940650001201951650001901963650001801982650001902000650001902019650002202038653002402060653001302084653002902097653002002126653000902146653003402155653001702189653001102206653000702217653000802224653000802232653000802240653000802248653000902256653001302265653001002278653001602288653001102304653000902315653000802324653000902332653000902341653000802350653000902358653001202367653000802379653000702387653000902394653001002403653001002413653000802423700006602431700005802497700002102555700006002576700006302636773012202699856008502821852000902906655001202915IND60629313620221119120100.0190410e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062931362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanečková, Helena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7338-892910aExogenous application of cytokinin during dark senescence eliminates the acceleration of photosystem II impairment caused by chlorophyll b deficiency in barley  ap. 43-51.  aRecent studies have shown that chlorophyll (Chl) b has an important role in the regulation of leaf senescence. However, there is only limited information about senescence of plants lacking Chl b and senescence-induced decrease in photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) function has not even been investigated in such plants. We have studied senescence-induced changes in photosynthetic pigment content and PSII and PSI activities in detached leaves of Chl b-deficient barley mutant, chlorina f2f2 (clo). After 4 days in the dark, the senescence-induced decrease in PSI activity was smaller in clo compared to WT leaves. On the contrary, the senescence-induced impairment in PSII function (estimated from Chl fluorescence parameters) was much more pronounced in clo leaves, even though the relative decrease in Chl content was similar to wild type (WT) leaves (Hordeum vulgare L., cv. Bonus). The stronger impairment of PSII function seems to be related to more pronounced damage of reaction centers of PSII. Interestingly, exogenously applied plant hormone cytokinin 6-benzylaminopurine (BA) was able to maintain PSII function in the dark senescing clo leaves to a similar extent as in WT. Thus, considering the fact that without BA the senescence-induced decrease in PSII photochemistry in clo was more pronounced than in WT, the relative protective effect of BA was higher in Chl b-deficient mutant than in WT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3abenzyladenine 3achlorophyll 3acytokinins 3afluorescence 3aleaves 3amutants 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem I 3aphotosystem II 3aplant hormones 3aprotective effect 0a6-Benzylaminopurine 0aChlorina 0aChlorophyll fluorescence 0aLeaf senescence 0aOJIP 0aPhotosystem II photochemistry 0aXanthophylls 0aABS/RC 0aBA 0aCAO 0acar 0aChl 0aclo 0aDEPS 0a(dV/dt)0 0aFv/Fm 0aFv′/Fm′ 0aLHC(s) 0aOJIP 0aPSI 0aPSII 0aP700 0aRCI 0aRCII 0aRE0/ABS 0aVAZ 0aVJ 0aδR0 0aΦf,D 0aΦNPQ 0aΦP1 aHusičková, Alexandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7988-60081 aLazár, Dušan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8035-40171 aFerretti, Ursula1 aPospisil, Pavel,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9126-20111 aŠpundová, Martina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2260-43020 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2019 Mar., v. 136 p.43-51dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01101naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136245006300154300001800217520021800235592002800453650002400481650001900505650002000524710007300544773009800617856008800715990002300803852000900826655001200835IND60098645320221122043646.0141105e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009864532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.12.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL10aDefinition of experimental procedures: a committee opinion  ap. 1197-1198.  aThis Practice Committee opinion provides a revised definition of experimental procedures.

SJL/J mice are deficient in dysferlin and display severe inflammatory changes, most notably the presence of cytokines, which may be related to destruction of the sarcolemma. We tested the hypothesis that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) contributes to myofibril necrosis. Administration of etanercept, an agent that blocks TNF, resulted in dose-dependent reductions in inflammatory change, necrosis, and fatty/fibrous change. These findings indicate that TNF does indeed play a role in the damage to muscle in SJL/J mice and that etanercept has the potential to reduce such damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3adose response 3amice 3amuscle fibers 3amuscular dystrophy 3anecrosis 3askeletal muscle 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factors1 aKonno, Shingo1 aSugimoto, Hideki1 aNakazora, Hiroshi1 aNomoto, Nobuatsu1 aMurata, Mayumi1 aKitazono, Hisao1 aFujioka, Toshiki0 tExperimental and molecular pathology.g2011 June, v. 90, no. 3 p.264-270dElsevier Inc.x0014-48007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexmp.2011.02.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007200170300001400242520122500256592002801481650001301509650001501522650001201537650001301549650002401562650001801586650001301604650001701617650001101634650002601645650001701671700001701688700002301705700002101728700001801749700002001767700001701787773009601804856008601900852000901986655001201995IND60095424120221118060513.0141104e20110505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009542412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2011.02.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuentes, C.A.10aWetting behaviour and surface properties of technical bamboo fibres  ap. 89-99.  aBamboo fibres recently attracted interest as a sustainable reinforcement fibre in (polymer) composite materials, due to specific mechanical properties which are comparable to glass fibres. To achieve good wetting and adhesion of the bamboo fibre with different polymers, the fibre surface needs to be characterized. The wetting behaviour of technical bamboo fibres is studied experimentally by using the Wilhelmy technique, and the results are modelled using the molecular-kinetic theory. A novel procedure, based on an autoclave treatment, allows stable and reproducible advancing contact angles to be measured. In this way, meaningful information on interfacial interactions can be obtained, allowing improvement of the bamboo-polymer interface. Additionally, for comparison, the wetting behaviour of synthetic poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fibre is studied. This article aims at contributing to a better understanding of the complex phenomena occurring during wetting of natural fibres. The results indicate that the high concentration of lignin on the surface of bamboo fibres is responsible for their wetting properties, whereas typical phenomena affecting wetting experiments on plant fibres can be minimized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aautoclaves 3abamboos 3acolloids 3acomposite materials 3acontact angle 3aethylene 3aglass fibers 3alignin 3amechanical properties 3aplant fibers1 aTran, L.Q.N.1 aDupont-Gillain, C.1 aVanderlinden, W.1 aDe Feyter, S.1 aVan Vuure, A.W.1 aVerpoest, I.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2011 May 5, v. 380, no. 1-3 p.89-99dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2011.02.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01708naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010900170300001400279506002800293520038000321592002800701506003700729650001400766650001300780650000900793650001300802650001700815653004800832653002400880653002300904653003800927653004400965700001801009700001801027773018001045856008801225852000901313655001201322IND60773749520221207090344.0180806e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077374952DNAL7 a10.22363/2312-797X-2015-2-24-322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlova, M E10aOntogenesis of Corydalis intermedia (l.)

The findings of some studies show that shrub expansion greatly corresponds with changes in temperature and precipitation in Arctic, whereas studies in Tibetan Plateau show that shrub expansion is more dependent on soil moisture. However, there has not been sufficient studies of shrub expansion in Central Asia, including our country. We carried out studies on 12 shrub species present in Khar Yamaat Natural Reserve Area (N47.645727, E112.043829) to determine the response of several shrub species to climate factors and disturbances. We were able to distinguish diverse pore arrangements, various growth patterns, climate-growth relationships and finally, pointer years were recorded as well. That being the case, shrubs in Mongolia have successfully been proven to have a high dendrochronological potential and it is practicable to apply it for rangeland and ecological assessments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate change 3adendrochronology 3aland use 3arangelands 3ashrubs 3asoil water 3asteppes 3atemperature 3aArctic region 3aCentral Asia 3aChina 3aMongolia 0adendrochronology 0ashrubs 0aclimate change 0avegetation shift1 aBayarsaikhan, Uudus1 aByambagerel, Suran0 tMongolian journal of biological sciences.g2020 Mar., v. 18, no. 1 p.23-29dNational University of MongoliawJournal:27928x2225-49947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22353/mjbs.2020.18.033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245019900172300001800371500001900389520135200408592002801760650002001788650001001808650000901818650001501827650000901842650002701851650001601878650001101894650002301905650001601928650003201944650002401976650001702000650002302017650001002040653001602050653001702066653001802083653003202101653002302133653001602156700002102172700002202193700001802215773011002233856007802343852000902421655001202430IND60717598620221120050029.0201113e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071759862DNAL7 a10.2478/aoas-2020-00472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrczewska-Dudek, Sylwia10aCamelina sativa Oil and Camelina Cake as Sources of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in the Diets of Laying Hens: Effect on Hen Performance, Fatty Acid Profile of Yolk Lipids, and Egg Sensory Quality  ap. 1365-1377.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study aimed to determine the effect of the use of Camelina sativa oil as a dietary ingredient for laying hens on their growth performance, fatty acid profile of yolk lipids, and egg quality parameters. In the experiment, 72 Hy-Line laying hens aged 26 weeks were randomly assigned to three groups with four treatments. Control group (I) was fed the diet containing 4% rapeseed oil (RO group). Experimental groups were fed diets containing 4% camelina oil (CSO group) and 10% camelina cake (group CSC). Feed consumption was measured for each group. The number of laid eggs and their weight were recorded every day. Eggs for the assessment of quality parameters were collected in the last 3 days of the experiment. Egg quality, chemical composition of yolk, and fatty acid profile were determined. Organoleptic evaluation was performed on boiled eggs. The inclusion of C. sativa oil or camelina cake in the laying hen diet did not affect egg weight, albumen quality, or taste and flavor. The experimental groups also showed a tendency toward an increase in the proportion of yolk in the egg (%). Addition of 4% camelina oil or 10% camelina cake to the diet of laying hens reduced monounsaturated fatty acid level in yolk lipids and significantly increased n-3 PUFA content, in particular ALA, EPA, and DHA, compared to the control group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelina sativa 3acakes 3adiet 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3afatty acid composition 3afeed intake 3aflavor 3agrowth performance 3aingredients 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3arapeseed oil 3asensory evaluation 3ataste 0alaying hens 0acamelina oil 0acamelina cake 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids 0alaying performance 0aegg quality1 aPietras, Mariusz1 aPuchała, Michał1 aNowak, Joanna0 tAnnals of animal science.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 20, no. 4 p.1365-1377dSciendowJournal:2194x2300-87337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aoas-2020-00473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245010000165300001600265500001500281520138200296592002801678650001401706650001701720650001301737650001901750650001101769650001501780650003101795650002301826650001801849650001501867650002701882653001401909700001901923700001701942700001401959700001701973700001701990700001302007700001902020773009802039856008602137852000902223655001202232IND60095424520221118060641.0141104e20110505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009542452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2011.02.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Han10aSorption of methylene blue by carboxymethyl cellulose and reuse process in a secondary sorption  ap. 143-151.  a2019-12-06  aThe sorption behaviors of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) for methylene blue (MB) were investigated in this work. The experimental results indicated that the sorption capacity increased from 50mgg⁻¹ for unmodified cellulose (UmC) to more than 300mgg⁻¹ for CMC. The most favorable sorption of MB was observed at an alkaline condition. The sorption isotherms closely followed the Langmuir mode, and the sorption kinetics was in agreement with the pseudo-second order equation. The results from the batch experiments illuminated that the sorption mechanism was ion-exchange controlled process. In fixed-bed tests, CMC also exhibited high efficiency for removal for MB, in which sorption behaviors followed Thomas model. Desorption of the dye from the MB-sorbed CMC (MBsCMC) indicated that MBsCMC was stable, and MB was seldom released at neutral and alkaline conditions. Furthermore, a more efficient method for reuse of the disused sorbents was tried. MBsCMC was employed for removal of methyl orange (MO) in a secondary sorption at neutral or alkaline conditions. The maximal MO uptake of MBsCMC was over 100mgg⁻¹, which was much higher than those of CMC and UmC. It was indicated that MBsCMC was efficient in sorption of MO for the electrostatic interaction between MO and MBsCMC, and secondary sorption was an appropriate way for reuse of this kind of disused sorbents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aion exchange 3acolloids 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3aadsorbents 3aelectrostatic interactions 3asorption isotherms 3amethyl orange 3adesorption 3acarboxymethylcellulose 0acellulose1 aZhang, Wenxuan1 aKan, Xiaowei1 aDong, Lei1 aJiang, Ziwen1 aLi, Haijiang1 aYang, Hu1 aCheng, Rongshi0 tColloids and surfaces.g2011 May 5, v. 380, no. 1-3 p.143-151dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2011.02.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245007600165300001400241520146700255592002801722650001301750650002001763650002701783650002001810650001501830650002501845650000901870650001401879650001101893650001301904653002701917653002601944653001501970653002901985653000902014700001502023700001902038700002102057700005702078700001302135773012202148856008502270852000902355655001202364IND60629314020221119115841.0190410e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062931402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuanya10aOver-expression of OsPT2 under a rice root specific promoter Os03g01700  ap. 52-57.  aIdentification of root-specific promoters is a good method to drive root-specific gene expression for nutrient uptake. Constitutive over-expression of OsPT2 may have negative effects on the growth of rice seedlings under high Pi condition. Thus, characterization and utilization of root-specific promoters are critical for genetic breeding. Here, a root-specific promoter (Os03g01700) with a number of specific regulatory elements has been confirmed. Interestingly, cis-regulatory element S449 is significantly enriched in the −1475∼-2013 bp and −1077∼-1475 bp regions of Os03g01700 promoter. The activities of several deletion derivatives of Os03g01700 promoter were analyzed using both transient expression and genetic transformation system. The results showed that the root-specific cis-acting elements might be present in the −2013 bp～-1475 bp and −1077 bp～-561 bp regions of Os03g01700 promoter. To determine the actual effect of root-specific expression of OsPT2, a construction consisting of Os03g01700 promoter and OsPT2 CDS was used to transform rice. Under Pi-sufficient condition, there were a series of symptoms of phosphorus toxicity in the shoots of OsPT2 over-expressing (Ov-OsPT2) seedlings. Under Pi-deficient condition, more soluble Pi was accumulated in the shoots of Ov-OsPT2 seedlings than that in the wild type. Our data provide a candidate root-specific promoter in the breeding of rice with high phosphorus uptake variety.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3agene expression 3agenetic transformation 3anutrient uptake 3aphosphorus 3aregulatory sequences 3arice 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3atoxicity 0acis-regulatory element 0aPhosphate transporter 0aPhosphorus 0aRoot-specific expression 0aRice1 aLi, Caixia1 aCheng, Lizhong1 aYu, Shuangshuang1 aShen, Chenjia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8575-05931 aPan, Yue0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2019 Mar., v. 136 p.52-57dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245007400173300001800247500001500265520141100280592002801691650001401719650001001733650001901743650001501762650000801777650002801785650002301813650001501836650001301851650001601864650003001880650002501910653001201935700002101947700001901968773009701987856008802084990002302172852000902195655001202204IND60098646020221122001627.0141105e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009864602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.01.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgarwal, Ashok10aEffect of an isotonic lubricant on sperm collection and sperm quality  ap. 1581-1586.  a2019-12-06  aOBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of an isotonic lubricant used during sperm sample collection on [1] ease of collection and [2] resultant sperm quality. DESIGN: Paired randomized cross-over design. SETTING: Tertiary hospital. DONOR(S): Healthy men over 18 years old with normal semen analysis as per World Health Organization 2010 guidelines. INTERVENTION(S): Collection of semen sample from 22 subjects by masturbation with or without the use of Pre-Seed personal lubricant. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Qualitative survey results and quantitative sperm function outcomes were measured to determine resultant sperm quality and collection experience with and without Pre-Seed lubricant. RESULT(S): The qualitative questionnaire results showed that 73% of donors prefer the semen collection process with the isotonic lubricant and 55% recommended the use of lubricant in their everyday collection. The motility, viability, membrane integrity, levels of reactive oxygen species, total antioxidant capacity, and percentage of DNA damage in collected semen samples were not affected by the use of the lubricant. CONCLUSION(S): More donors prefer, and find it easier, to collect semen samples with the use of the lubricant. The isotonic lubricant Pre-Seed did not compromise sperm quality as evaluated in an array of sperm assays, suggesting its safe use in fertility patients as required during sperm collection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aviability 3asemen 3aquestionnaires 3aDNA damage 3amen 3areactive oxygen species 3across-over studies 3aguidelines 3apatients 3aspermatozoa 3aWorld Health Organization 3aantioxidant activity 0asurveys1 aMalvezzi, Helena1 aSharma, Rakesh0 tFertility and sterility.g2013 May, v. 99, no. 6 p.1581-1586dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.01.1163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009600168300001600264500001100280520120400291592002801495596007101523650002301594650001701617650001801634650001901652650001701671650001101688650003301699650001201732650001601744650001601760700006801776773011901844856008301963852000902046655001202055IND60770517120221120211958.0220521e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077051712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-022-03222-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawant, Amol M.10aBiosynthetic process and strain improvement approaches for industrial penicillin production  ap. 179-192.  aReview  aPenicillins and cephalosporins are the most important class of beta (β) lactam antibiotics, accounting for 65% total antibiotic market. Penicillins are produced by Penicillium rubens (popularly known as P. chrysogenum) were used to synthesize the active pharmaceutical intermediate (API), 6-aminopenicillinic acid (6-APA) employed in semisynthetic antibiotic production. The wild strains produce a negligible amount of penicillin (Pen). High antibiotic titre-producing P. chrysogenum strains are necessitating for industrial Pen production to meet global demand at lower prices. Classical strain improvement (CSI) approaches such as random mutagenesis, medium engineering, and fermentation are the cornerstones for high-titer Pen production. Since, Sir Alexander Fleming Discovery of Pen, great efforts are expanded to develop at a commercial scale antibiotics producing strains. Breakthroughs in genetic engineering, heterologous expression and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools opened a new window for Pen production at a commercial scale to assure health crisis. The current state of knowledge, limitations of CSI and genetic engineering approaches to Pen production are discussed in this review.  aPublisher supplied data  aMLP 034926cCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research, India 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acephalosporins 3afermentation 3agenome 3aheterologous gene expression 3amarkets 3amutagenesis 3apenicillins1 aVamkudoth, Koteswara Rao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3131-00150 tBiotechnology letters.g2022 Feb., v. 44, no. 2 p.179-192dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-022-03222-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04123naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003100132024001100163040001800174100002300192245012300215300001600338500001500354506017300369520199200542650002202534650002802556650001902584650002902603650001702632650001402649650002302663650002202686650001102708650001502719650001902734650002202753650002802775650002002803650001702823650000902840650002702849650001502876653006002891653006002951700002003011700002303031700001803054700002003072773010703092856011203199856007703311956012703388961000903515852000903524655001203533IND60005968320221214225846.0141006e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000596832DNAL7 a2724592aris7 a10113/596832hdl7 a10.1089/fpd.2012.13662doi8 ans5525  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurtler, Joshua B.10aKinetics Model Comparison for the Inactivation of Serotypes Enteritidis and Oranienburg in 10% Salted Liquid Whole Egg  ap. 492-499.  a2019-12-06  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe goal of this study was to determine the inactivation kinetics of Salmonella in commercial 10% salted liquid whole egg (LWE) to assist the U.S. Department of Agriculture in writing new liquid egg pasteurization guidelines. Current data are not sufficient for predicting thermal inactivation kinetics of Salmonella spp. for use in updating pasteurization guidelines for many types of liquid egg products, including salted LWE (SLWE). This is, in part, due to variations in Salmonella strains and changes in the processing of liquid egg products that have arisen in the past 40 years. Pasteurization guidelines are currently being reevaluated in light of recent risk assessments. Heat-resistant Salmonella serovars Enteritidis and Oranienburg were composited and mixed into 10% SLWE, resulting in final populations of approximately 5.7-7.8 log colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Inoculated egg was injected into glass capillary tubes, flame-sealed, and heated in a water bath at 60, 62.2, 63.3, 64.3, or 66°C. Contents were surface-plated and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Survival curves were not log-linear (log levels versus time), but decreased rapidly, and after initial periods became linear. Asymptotic decimal reduction values at each temperature were calculated from survivor curves with a minimum inactivation of 5.0 log CFU/mL. The asymptotic thermal D-values for SLWE were 3.47, 2.23, 1.79, 1.46, and 1.04 min at 60, 62.2, 63.3, 64.3, or 66°C, respectively. The calculated thermal z-value was 11.5°C. A model that predicts lethality for given times and temperatures that was developed predicted that the current pasteurization requirements for 10% SLWE (i.e., 63.3°C for 3.5 min, or 62.2°C for 6.2 min) are not sufficient to inactivate 7 log CFU/mL of Salmonella and only achieve approximately 4 log CFU/mL inactivation. This model will assist egg-products manufacturers and regulatory agencies in designing pasteurization processes to ensure product safety. 3aheat inactivation 3abacterial contamination 3aheat tolerance 3ainactivation temperature 3achicken eggs 3aserotypes 3afood contamination 3apathogen survival 3amodels 3aguidelines 3apasteurization 3afood microbiology 3apredictive microbiology 3arisk assessment 3asalted foods 3aeggs 3aSalmonella Oranienburg 3aprediction 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Oranienburg 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis1 aMarks, Harry M.1 aBailey, Rebecca B.1 aJuneja, Vijay1 aJones, Deana R.0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2013 June, v. 10, no. 6 p.492-499wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/596833Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2012.13663Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/a23.Gurtler.Egg_.Kinetics.Salted.LWE_.FPD_.2013.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011000168500001900278520118800297592002801485650001301513650001401526650001401540650000901554650001301563650001701576650001701593650001301610653003701623653001701660653002401677653001901701653002101720700001901741700001701760700001701777700001601794700001701810700001901827700001401846773009501860856008601955852000902041655001202050IND60729651620221121115229.0210401e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072965162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2021.1084832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Chuanai10aTextural and gel properties of frankfurters as influenced by various κ-carrageenan incorporation methods  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe influence of different addition forms of κ-carrageenan, including powder, pre-suspended in water, and pre-suspended in brine, on the textural and gel properties of frankfurters were investigated. Compared with the control group, each addition form of κ-carrageenan led to a lower cooking loss, as well as higher emulsion stability with more trapped water within frankfurters (P < 0.05). Moreover, κ-carrageenan powder or κ-carrageenan water suspension addition could render higher hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, chewiness, fracturability, and resilience of frankfurters than control group (P < 0.05), which was verified by dynamic rheology analysis. However, κ-carrageenan brine suspension addition had negative effects on the above characteristics. Microstructural images indicated that κ-carrageenan could help form finer and denser protein matrices. However, the interaction modes between the meat protein matrix and each addition form of κ-carrageenan were distinct. Additionally, the addition of κ-carrageenan water suspension had the best effect on the improvement of the textural and gel properties of frankfurters with an enhanced overall acceptability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3achewiness 3aemulsions 3agels 3ahardness 3ameat protein 3ameat science 3arheology 0aAddition forms of κ-carrageenan 0aFrankfurters 0aTextural properties 0aMicrostructure 0aInteraction mode1 aFeng, Yangyang1 aKong, Baohua1 aXia, Xiufang1 aLiu, Meiyue1 aChen, Jiaxin1 aZhang, Fengxue1 aLiu, Qian0 tMeat science.g2021 June, v. 176 p.108483-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2021.1084833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245010700207300001600314506010400330506007600434520133700510592002801847506003701875650001101912650002301923650001501946653001801961653002101979653002602000653001702026653001502043700001802058700002202076700005802098773009702156856008502253852000902338655001202347IND60776121720221207134624.0220706e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077612172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.04.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHawari, Qusay1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4444-165212aA robust gain scheduling method for a PI collective pitch controller of multi-MW onshore wind turbines  ap. 443-455.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis work proposes a robust tuning method for full-load pitch control by deriving new design formulae for collective Proportional Integral (PI) pitch controllers. The paper investigates the frequency domain characteristics of a full state linearized turbine model extracted from the aeroelastic simulation tool HawcStab2, and suggests a reduced order model that captures the low-frequency behaviour and may be used to derive PI tuning formulae that account for collective blade flap modes. The proposed controllers are then compared to traditional PI controllers based on a single degree of freedom (1-DOF) model of the drive-train using linearized NREL5MW and DTU10MW models. The 10 MW model is investigated in more detail through non-linear simulations in HAWC2 using wind step and turbulent wind conditions. The proposed design formulae show robust results, giving more consistent gain and phase margins than 1-DOF designs throughout the above rated wind speed region, and may be used to increase controller bandwidth while maintaining acceptable stability margins, achieving 49% and 63% reductions in standard deviation of the output power for the DTU10MW model in turbulent conditions. Statistical analysis for both controllers was also performed to investigate fatigue loading on the main shaft caused by the pitch actuation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amodels 3astandard deviation 3awind speed 0aPI Controller 0aFrequency domain 0aCollective blade flap 0aPhase margin 0aTurbulence1 aKim, Taeseong1 aWard, Christopher1 aFleming, James1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2936-46440 tRenewable energy.g2022 June, v. 192 p.443-455dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.04.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245007000172300002100242520142600263592002801689650001301717650001501730650001401745650001801759650001901777650000901796650001401805650001001819650001601829651001801845700001901863773010001882856008801982990002302070852000902093655001202102IND60098646120221122001742.0141105e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009864612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.01.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsley, Lauren10aGenetic evaluation procedures at sperm banks in the United States  ap. 1587-1591.e7.  aOBJECTIVE: To assess how genetic evaluations of sperm donor applicants are performed in the United States. DESIGN: A questionnaire was designed to assess: 1) the professionals involved in the family history evaluation and genetic screening; 2) the genetic testing, counseling, and informed consent processes; and 3) how the results of genetic evaluations and new risk information is communicated to donors. SETTING: Semen donor facilities. PARTICIPANT(S): Representatives of semen donor facilities. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Descriptive data. RESULT(S): Thirteen responses were received. All of the facilities assessed donors’ family histories; eight of the facilities (62%) routinely informed donors about the results of these evaluations. At the majority of facilities (10/13), informed consent for genetic testing is obtained as part of the overall contract to be a sperm donor. Genetic counselors are employed full-time at two facilities and part-time at five others. CONCLUSION(S): There is variability in the education and informed consent processes for semen donor applicants, including variable communication about the limitations of genetic tests and the potential implications for the donors’ own children. Further research into the best practices for education and consent for sperm donor applicants may be beneficial to ensure the well-being of the donors and their future offspring.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3acounseling 3aeducation 3aprofessionals 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3ascreening 3asemen 3aspermatozoa 3aUnited States1 aCallum, Pamela0 tFertility and sterility.g2013 May, v. 99, no. 6 p.1587-1591.e7dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.01.0933Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011800161300001800279520178900297592002802086650002202114650002002136650001702156650002002173650001702193650001902210650001702229650001802246650003102264650001502295650001102310650001602321700002202337700002502359700002302384700001902407700002002426700002202446773011102468856007502579852000902654655001202663IND60529135720221119004750.0160717e20121120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052913572DNAL7 a10.1021/ac302306u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoda, A.q(Aldo),10aDioxetane-Doped Silica Nanoparticles as Ultrasensitive Reagentless Thermochemiluminescent Labels for Bioanalytics  ap. 9913-9919.  aThermochemiluminescence (TCL; the light emission originating by the thermally triggered decomposition of a molecule) was proposed in the late 1980s as a detection technique for immunoassays. However, after little pioneering work, this technique was abandoned because of the high temperatures required and the poor detectability in comparison to other labels. Here we describe for the first time a thermochemiluminescent acridine-based 1,2-dioxetane with a remarkably low (i.e., below 100 °C) emission-triggering temperature, which made it possible to obtain light emission even in an aqueous environment, as well as amino-functionalized silica nanoparticles loaded with this compound and the fluorescent energy acceptor dipyridamole. Thanks to the signal amplification due to the large number of 1,2-dioxetane molecules in each nanoparticle (about 10⁴) and the increased emission efficiency due to energy transfer to the fluorescent acceptor, the doped nanoparticles could be revealed with a detectability close to that of chemiluminescent enzyme labels (the limit of detection of doped nanoparticles by TCL imaging was 1 × 10–¹⁶ mol mm–², thus approaching the value of 5 × 10–¹⁷ mol mm–² obtained for the enzyme label horseradish peroxidase with chemiluminescence detection). They could thus be used as highly detectable labels in the development of sensitive TCL-based immunoassays and nucleic acid hybridization assays, in which the detection step does not require any additional chemical reagent. We believe that these doped silica nanoparticles could pave the way for the revival of TCL detection in bioanalytics, taking advantage of the reagentless detection and the high signal/noise ratio in comparison with conventional luminescence detection techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemiluminescence 3adetection limit 3adipyridamole 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3aimmunoassays 3ananoparticles 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aperoxidase 3asilica 3atemperature1 aDi Fusco, Massimo1 aQuintavalla, Arianna1 aGuardigli, Massimo1 aMirasoli, Mara1 aLombardo, Marco1 aTrombini, Claudio0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Nov. 20, v. 84, no. 22 p.9913-9919dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac302306u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04552naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245014100179300001600320500001500336520246900351592002802820650002102848650001802869650001402887650001902901650003802920650004402958650002803002650001303030650001803043650001103061650003703072650001303109650002603122650002903148650004403177650001203221650002603233650001203259650001903271650002403290650001703314650001603331650001303347650003503360653001303395653001603408653001603424653002303440653001203463653001803475653002403493700002103517700002603538700002603564700002203590700002103612700002303633773012803656856008503784852000903869655001203878IND60560150520221119064301.0170103e20170103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056015052DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b018062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLalitha, Krishnamoorthy10aIntrinsic Hydrophobic Antibacterial Thin Film from Renewable Resources: Application in the Development of Anti-Biofilm Urinary Catheters  ap. 436-449.  a2019-12-06  aThe use of renewable resources to develop functional materials is increasing in order to meet the sustainability challenges. In an era of inexorable evolution of antimicrobial resistance, there is a substantial increase in demand for the development of efficient antimicrobial thin film coating from renewable resources for public bacterial threats, food, biomedical, and industrial applications. In the present investigation, we have used cardanol, a phenolic compound having unsaturated hydrophobic tail isolated from cashew fruits, and linseed oil, a vegetable oil and an important biobased building block, which are cheap and easy to regenerate. This study reports the synthesis of cardanol based metal complexes having unsaturated hydrophobic unit and acrylated epoxidized linseed oil (AELO) prepared via epoxidation of double bonds followed by acrylation. The double bond present in the metal complexes and AELO is prone to form assembled thin film under atmospheric conditions, without the need of any initiators. Assembled thin film is one of the important aspects of nanotechnology holding a wide range of applications. ¹H NMR and FT-IR analysis revealed the existence of a strong interaction between ligand and metal, which paves a way to develop a nonleachable metal based thin film coating. The leaching behavior of thin film coating was investigated under various aggressive conditions with the aid of UV–vis spectroscopy. The mechanical properties of assembled thin film coating material composed of cardanol-based metal complex and AELO are described using oscillatory rheology. Morphological and SAXD analysis clearly revealed the formation of the assembled structure in thin films. Thermal response of these materials has been investigated using TGA and DSC measurements. Intrinsic hydrophobic character was identified by contact angle measurement. Antimicrobial and biofilm inhibitory behavior of synthesized compounds and thin films were investigated against various human pathogenic bacterial strains. The assembled thin film coated catheter tube completely inhibits the biofilm formation of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Thus, the developed thin film coating material holds promise to be used as metal enabled, nonleachable coating materials for public bacterial threats, and food and biomedical applications. In particular, this material can be potentially used for developing urinary catheter tubes with antibacterial properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3athermogravimetry 3avegetable oil 3acatheters 3ahydrophobicity 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aindustrial applications 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3ahumans 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3aleaching 3amechanical properties 3aantibacterial properties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3abiofilm 3aantibiotic resistance 3aligands 3ananotechnology 3arenewable resources 3acashew fruit 3alinseed oil 3arheology 3auropathogenic Escherichia coli 0aCardanol 0aAntibiofilm 0aLinseed oil 0aRenewable resource 0areports 0aAntibacterial 0aAssembled thin film1 aSandeep, Miryala1 aPrasad, Yadavali Siva1 aSridharan, Vellaisamy1 aMaheswari, C.

However, how the repertoire of SCF complexes is sustained remains unclear. Real-time measurements of formation and disassembly indicate that SCFFbxw7 is extraordinarily stable, but, in the Nedd8-deconjugated state, the cullin-binding protein Cand1 augments its dissociation by one-million-fold. Binding and ubiquitylation assays show that Cand1 is a protein exchange factor that accelerates the rate at which Cul1-Rbx1 equilibrates with multiple F box protein-Skp1 modules. Depletion of Cand1 from cells impedes recruitment of new F box proteins to pre-existing Cul1 and profoundly alters the cellular landscape of SCF complexes. We suggest that catalyzed protein exchange may be a general feature of dynamic macromolecular machines and propose a hypothesis for how substrates, Nedd8, and Cand1 collaborate to regulate the cellular repertoire of SCF complexes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adissociation 3areceptors 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aLee, J. Eugene1 aLiu, Xing1 aSweredoski, Michael J.1 aGraham, Robert L.J.1 aLarimore, Elizabeth A.1 aRome, Michael1 aZheng, Ning1 aClurman, Bruce E.1 aHess, Sonja1 aShan, Shu-ou1 aDeshaies, Raymond J.0 tCell.g2013 Mar. 28, v. 153 p.206-215dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012700167300001600294520145700310592002801767650000801795650001801803650001801821650001501839650001601854650002001870650003101890650001601921650001501937650002101952650001301973650001501986650001702001650001702018650000902035700001802044700002202062773009802084856004802182852000902230655001202239IND50060086720221119114047.0130220e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006008672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-012-9731-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuneer, Sowbiya10aFe modulates Cd-induced oxidative stress and the expression of stress responsive proteins in the nodules of Vigna radiata   ap. 421-433.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the protective role of Fe in providing tolerance against Cd-stress in root nodules of Vigna radiata, because Cd may be more deleterious in the absence of Fe. Biochemical, histological and proteomic responses to Cd-exposure (50 μM CdCl₂) were examined under Fe-sufficient (+Fe/+Cd) or Fe-deficient (−Fe/+Cd) soils by comparing non −Cd exposed control (+Fe/−Cd) plants with additional control of Fe-deficient and non-exposed Cd plants (−Fe/−Cd). Cd-exposure negatively affected on growth and some physiological parameters of host plant and nodules, and also induced oxidative stress with the decline of antioxidative enzyme activities. The negative effects of Cd-exposure in +Fe/+Cd plants were much less than those in −Fe/+Cd and −Fe/−Cd ones. When compared with −Fe/Cd and −Fe/−Cd plants, a marked improvement of bacteriod development and cell division was observed and deformation of cell wall remarkably alleviated in the nodules of (+Fe/Cd) plants. Proteomic study revealed that 20 proteins were differentially expressed by Fe/Cd combined treatment. Eleven proteins of interest were identified and classified as precursor for RNA metabolism, storage of seeds, hypothetical proteins, and unknown proteins. These results indicate that Fe plays a pivotal role in alleviating Cd-stress, as evidence by reduction in oxidative damage and protection of cell wall and bacteriods in nodules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aVigna radiata 3acell division 3acell walls 3adeformation 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression regulation 3ahost plants 3ametabolism 3aoxidative stress 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3aroot nodules 3aseed storage 3asoil1 aKim, Tae Hwan1 aQureshi, M.

We describe a modelling framework that is applicable to the evaluation of potential changes in urban water quality and associated hydrologic changes in response to ongoing climate and landscape alteration. The grid‐based spatially distributed model, Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model‐Water Quality (DHSVM‐WQ), is an outgrowth of DHSVM that incorporates modules for assessing hydrology and water quality in urbanized watersheds at a high‐spatial and high‐temporal resolution. DHSVM‐WQ simulates surface run‐off quality and in‐stream processes that control the transport of non‐point source pollutants into urban streams. We configure DHSVM‐WQ for three partially urbanized catchments in the Puget Sound region to evaluate the water quality responses to current conditions and projected changes in climate and/or land use over the next century. Here, we focus on total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) from non‐point sources (run‐off), as well as stream temperature. The projection of future land use is characterized by a combination of densification in existing urban or partially urban areas and expansion of the urban footprint. The climate change scenarios consist of individual and concurrent changes in temperature and precipitation. Future precipitation is projected to increase in winter and decrease in summer, while future temperature is projected to increase throughout the year. Our results show that urbanization has a much greater effect than climate change on both the magnitude and seasonal variability of streamflow, TSS and TP loads largely because of substantially increased streamflow and particularly winter flow peaks. Water temperature is more sensitive to climate warming scenarios than to urbanization and precipitation changes. Future urbanization and climate change together are predicted to significantly increase annual mean streamflow (up to 55%), water temperature (up to 1.9 °C), TSS load (up to 182%) and TP load (up to 74%).

A review of interception losses in forest plot studies  ap. 4674-4686.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aAfter several years of decreased annual rainfall and water shortages, the Chilean society is demanding that forest plantations take accountability of their role in consuming scarce water resources. Evidence has shown that interception losses are considerable when determining water production in watersheds. The aim of this study was to determine if site and stand variables explain interception losses by Chilean forests for the development of an empirical model that could predict the potential impacts of forest management practices and land‐use change. A total of 127 data from annual water balance plot studies in Chile were compiled to derive relationships between interception and precipitation, species composition, plantation age and other stand and site variables. The reviewed data indicated that annual interception losses are mainly explained by annual rainfall and basal area of the forest stands, with a clear difference between the northern (dryer) and southern (wetter) regions of Chile. For a wide latitudinal gradient, forest composition and age, annual interception accounted for approximately 21% of incoming precipitations. Broadleaved forest stands (including native broadleaved and eucalypt forests) generally presented higher interception losses than conifers. Interception was higher in northern zones, indicating that forests have greater impacts on water resources in dryer regions. Our results were compiled in empirical models, which can be used to estimate forest interception in a latitudinal gradient in Chile and to support policy making. These results are also proposed as an approximate analogue of the changes in forest interception losses, which may occur as vegetation belts shift latitudinally as a result of the impact of climate change.

Here, we show that developmental rate, reproduction, and lifespan are altered in C. elegans fed Comamonas DA1877 relative to those fed a standard E. coli OP50 diet. We identify a set of genes that change in expression in response to this diet and use the promoter of one of these (acdh-1) as a dietary sensor. Remarkably, the effects on transcription and development occur even when Comamonas DA1877 is diluted with another diet, suggesting that Comamonas DA1877 generates a signal that is sensed by the nematode. Surprisingly, the developmental effect is independent from TOR and insulin signaling. Rather, Comamonas DA1877 affects cyclic gene expression during molting, likely through the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-23. Altogether, our findings indicate that different bacteria elicit various responses via distinct mechanisms, which has implications for diseases such as obesity and the interactions between the human microbiome and intestinal cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aComamonas 3aEscherichia coli 3aNematoda 3abacteria 3adiet 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahormone receptors 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3alongevity 3amolting 3aobesity 3areproduction1 aWatson, Emma1 aArda, H. Efsun1 aZhu, Lihua Julie1 aWalhout, Albertha J.M.0 tCell.g2013 Mar. 28, v. 153 p.240-252dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012500155300001800280520206800298592002802366650003002394650001502424650001502439650001502454650001602469650002002485650001102505650001202516650001902528650001202547700002002559700001902579700001702598700001602615700001602631700001802647773012102665856007502786852000902861655001202870IND60558086820221121231250.0161108e20120329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055808682DNAL7 a10.1021/jp30076242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcharya, K.10aSite Energies of Active and Inactive Pheophytins in the Reaction Center of Photosystem II from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  ap. 3890-3899.  aIt is widely accepted that the primary electron acceptor in various Photosystem II (PSII) reaction center (RC) preparations is pheophytin a (Pheo a) within the D1 protein (PheoD₁), while PheoD₂ (within the D2 protein) is photochemically inactive. The Pheo site energies, however, have remained elusive, due to inherent spectral congestion. While most researchers over the past two decades placed the Qy-states of PheoD₁ and PheoD₂ bands near 678–684 and 668–672 nm, respectively, recent modeling [Raszewski et al.Biophys. J. 2005, 88, 986−998; Cox et al.J. Phys. Chem. B 2009, 113, 12364–12374] of the electronic structure of the PSII RC reversed the assignment of the active and inactive Pheos, suggesting that the mean site energy of PheoD₁ is near 672 nm, whereas PheoD₂ (∼677.5 nm) and ChlD₁ (∼680 nm) have the lowest energies (i.e., the PheoD₂-dominated exciton is the lowest excited state). In contrast, chemical pigment exchange experiments on isolated RCs suggested that both pheophytins have their Qy absorption maxima at 676–680 nm [Germano et al.Biochemistry 2001, 40, 11472−11482; Germano et al.Biophys. J. 2004, 86, 1664–1672]. To provide more insight into the site energies of both PheoD₁ and PheoD₂ (including the corresponding Qₓ transitions, which are often claimed to be degenerate at 543 nm) and to attest that the above two assignments are most likely incorrect, we studied a large number of isolated RC preparations from spinach and wild-type Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (at different levels of intactness) as well as the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant (D2-L209H), in which the active branch PheoD₁ is genetically replaced with chlorophyll a (Chl a). We show that the Qₓ-/Qy-region site energies of PheoD₁ and PheoD₂ are ∼545/680 nm and ∼541.5/670 nm, respectively, in good agreement with our previous assignment [Jankowiak et al.J. Phys. Chem. B 2002, 106, 8803−8814]. The latter values should be used to model excitonic structure and excitation energy transfer dynamics of the PSII RCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aD1 protein 3aD2 protein 3aabsorption 3achlorophyll 3aenergy transfer 3amodels 3amutants 3aphotosystem II 3aspinach1 aNeupane, Bhanu,1 aZazubovich, V.1 aSayre, R.

Exosomes derived from different sources have recently been used in cancer studies due to their anticancer effects. In this study, the effect of crab derived exosomes in 2 & 3-dimensional (2& 3D) in vivo models of breast cancer (BC) were investigated and compared with the doxorubicin (DOX). 2D and 3D models of BC were induced using the chitosan/β-glycerol phosphate hydrogel (Ch/β-GP) and 1 × 10⁶ 4T1 cells in the female mice aged 6–8 weeks. 1 mg/ml exosome and 5 mg/kg DOX were injected by intratumoral (IT), intravenous (IV), and intraperitoneal (IP) methods into mice on day 9, 13, and 17 with and without hydrogel as a drug delivery system. After 21 days, the mice were sacrificed, and the tissues (lung, liver, and tumor) were removed. The weight and size of the tumor were measured. Real-time PCR assessed changes of VEGF, Bcl2, and P53 genes expression levels. Nitric oxide (NO) secretion from the cancer 3D model was evaluated by Griess assay. Based on the results, the size and weight of tumors in treated groups with exosomes and DOX were reduced significantly (P ≤ 0.001, P ≤ 0.002, P ≤ 0.02) in 2D and 3D models. Changes in VEGF, Bcl2 and P53 gene expression levels were less in the 3D model than in the 2D model. Drug delivery with hydrogel increased tumor inhibition compared to drug injection without hydrogel. Decreased NO secretion was observed in all treatment groups compared to the control group (untreated). Crab exosomes showed anti cancer effects on 2&3D models of BC. 3D model of BC showed greater drug resistance than the 2D model after treating with crab derived exosomes and DOX. 3D model of BC mimics native tumor better than 2D and can be used in cancer studies and for drug screening with greater confidence than 2D model. Also, the use of slow release drug delivery system reduced drug resistance in both models.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acomparative study 3acrabs 3adoxorubicin 3adrug injection 3adrug resistance 3aexosomes 3afemales 3agene expression 3ahydrogels 3aintravenous injection 3aliver 3alungs 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3aphosphates 3aphysics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion 0aExosome 0aTwo-dimensional 0aThree-dimensional 0aBreast cancer 0aCrab1 aRahmati, Shima1 aGhasemi, Sorayya1 aAlizadeh, Morteza1 aAlizadeh, Akram0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2022 Mar., v. 243 p.105179-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2022.1051793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245013300167300001800300520184500318592002802163650002102191650002502212650001302237650001502250650001702265650001502282650003302297650001702330700002002347700001902367773011102386856007502497852000902572655001202581IND60529136220221119005056.0160717e20121120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052913622DNAL7 a10.1021/ac302375e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToh-Boyo, Gwendoline
M.10aComparison of Sample Preparation Methods and Evaluation of Intra- and Intersample Reproducibility in Bacteria MALDI-MS Profiling  ap. 9971-9980.  aA study is presented on the reproducibility of mass spectral profiles of the whole bacterium E. coli resulting from laser sampling at different regions within and between matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) samples deposited onto the plate. Samples were prepared with different deposition methods and using different MALDI matrices. The three most common matrices used in MALDI-mass spectrometry (MS) bacteria profiling, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA), sinapinic acid (SA), and ferulic acid (FA), were compared in this study along with two pipet-based sample deposition methods, dried-droplet and premix. Sample variability was determined by analysis of variances (ANOVA), principal component analysis (PCA), and multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA). For the two pipet-based sample deposition methods tested in this study, the intrasample variability (most commonly referred to as “spot-to-spot” reproducibility) was of the same magnitude as the intersample variability for all MALDI matrices tested. By incorporating a spray nebulizer sample deposition method to produce uniform sample/matrix mixtures onto the MALDI plate, we demonstrate that the crystalline morphology of the MALDI sample greatly influences the intrasample reproducibility (i.e., spot-to-spot) of the resulting whole cell MALDI-MS profiles. Overall, for the pipet-based deposition methods, results showed that the smallest variability in bacteria MALDI mass spectral profiles was obtained from samples deposited using the premix method, regardless of the MALDI matrix used, with the best reproducibility obtained with the CHCA matrix. It is concluded that a sample preparation strategy that reduces or eliminates the MALDI matrix morphology heterogeneity can reduce variability (i.e., spot-to-spot) of the bacteria mass spectral profiles by up to 90%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aanalysis of variance 3abacteria 3adesorption 3aferulic acid 3aionization 3aprincipal component analysis 3aspectroscopy1 aWulff, Shaun S.1 aBasile, Franco0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Nov. 20, v. 84, no. 22 p.9971-9980dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac302375e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013400168300001600302500001500318520106600333592002801399650001601427650001401443650001401457650001001471650001001481650001901491650001401510650002301524650002101547650001201568651001001580653002001590653003101610653002701641653002001668653002901688653001501717653002001732700002001752773011001772856005101882852000901933655001201942IND50088699520221119202039.0140414e20131117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008869952DNAL7 a10.1080/10549811.2013.8077442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoulos, H.

Four replicate fuel treatments (thin only, thin + burn, burn only, and control) were implemented to assess the effects of fire and fire surrogates on fuel loadings. The results suggested that the thin only and the thin + burn treatments significantly altered fuel loadings. The thin + burn treatment resulted in a 63% reduction in tree density, the thin only treatment resulted in a 23% reduction, and the burn only treatment showed an 8% reduction. Seedling density and tree basal area were not significantly affected by the treatments. Although thinning and thinning + burning were the most effective for reducing live fuels, they generated significant increases in surface fuels. Our results suggest that more aggressive thinning operations that target larger trees and prescribed burning during hotter, drier conditions could enhance future fuel management treatments in piñon-juniper woodlands in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3afire hazard 3aseedlings 3amountains 3afuels 3atrees 3apinyon-juniper 3awoodlands 3aprescribed burning 3astand basal area 3aforests 3aTexas 0afuel management 0asouthwestern United States 0afire hazard mitigation 0aprescribed fire 0apiñon-juniper woodlands 0abasal area 0aforest thinning1 aGatewood, R.

In this study, alkyl polyglucoside (APG), citric acid (CA), and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) were chosen to enhance the phytoremediation of pyrene and Pb co-contaminated soils by perennial ryegrass. Through the comparison of the results with different applications, it could be found that the application of NTA was beneficial to the growth of perennial ryegrass, the underground and aboveground biomass were increased by 172.9–236.1% and 61.9–142.8%, respectively, meanwhile, photosynthetic activity of perennial ryegrass was affected positively. More importantly, the combined application of APG and NTA maximally promoted the accumulation and translocation of Pb (BF/TF, 0.44/0.61) and dissipation of pyrene (71.6%). These results indicated that the combined application of APG and NTA could be promising for future practical application of phytoremediation. However, the optimal dosage ratio of APG and NTA for phytoremediation needs to be further researched.  aThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China(21677093, 41373097), Shanghai Natural Science Foundation(18ZR1414100).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium perenne 3aaboveground biomass 3aalkyl glucosides 3acitric acid 3aheavy metals 3alead 3anitrilotriacetic acid 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytoremediation 3apollutants 3apolluted soils 0aAPG 0aCA 0aNTA 0aperennial ryegrass 0apyrene 0alead1 aCao, Liya1 aZhang, Xinying1 aChen, Jing1 aHuo, Zhuhao1 aMao, Ying0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2018 Aug. 24, v. 20, no. 10 p.1055-1061dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2018.14603053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245011100198300001400309500002000323520184100343592002802184596004602212596008102258596002602339596006502365650002602430650001502456650000902471650002602480650001902506650001002525650002102535650001802556650001302574650002002587650001802607650001402625650001102639650001502650650001602665650001002681650001102691651001802702700001802720773012002738856007302858852000902931655001202940IND60627751020221119061237.0190128e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062775102DNAL7 a10.1111/een.126732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbarca, Mariana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6944-257410aLatitudinal variation in the phenological responses of eastern tent caterpillars and their egg parasitoids  ap. 50-61.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a1. Eastern tent caterpillars (Malacosoma americanum) are broadly distributed within North America, with populations spanning a wide range of environmental conditions. Their egg masses are consistently attacked by a variety of wasps in the superfamily Chalcidoidea. We performed a reciprocal transplant‐type experiment to assess the performance of three populations spanning 15° of latitude when subjected to temperature regimes resembling southern or northern conditions. 2. Exposure to warm temperatures and short overwintering periods (southern conditions) resulted in the increased survival of both caterpillars and parasitoids from all populations. By contrast, the ability of caterpillars to withstand starvation was maximised when exposed to conditions similar to their native region. 3. Caterpillar and wasp phenology differed among populations even when exposed to the same temperature regime. Individuals exposed to novel conditions hatched 2–6 weeks later than those experiencing native conditions. Under typical conditions, the relative phenology of wasps and their hosts exhibited a latitudinal gradient consistent with growing season length, with southern, central, and northern wasps, emerging 50, 45, and 36 days, respectively, after their hosts. 3. We identified four genera of primary parasitoids, which emerged within a narrow 2‐week span, and one hyperparasitoid, which emerged in distinct pulses over an approximately 5‐week span, possibly indicating the presence of a second generation. 4. Caterpillars and wasps exhibited distinct phenological responses according to population of origin, indicating that not only pre‐hatching winter and spring conditions, but also historical factors, which may include local adaptation, maternal effects, and oviposition time, influence their phenological responses.  aPublisher supplied data  cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología  cGeorge Melendez Wright Climate Change Fellowship, National Park Service, USA  cNational Park Service  cThe Washington Biologist's Field Club, The Harlan Trust Fund 3aMalacosoma americanum 3aegg masses 3aeggs 3aenvironmental factors 3agrowing season 3ahosts 3ahyperparasitoids 3ainsect larvae 3alatitude 3amaternal effect 3aoverwintering 3aphenology 3aspring 3astarvation 3atemperature 3awasps 3awinter 3aNorth America1 aLill, John T.0 tEcological entomology.g2019 Feb., v. 44, no. 1 p.50-61dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl7132x0307-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.126733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245009600182300001400278520091500292592002801207650001301235650001401248650001201262650002101274650002001295650001601315650002401331650001001355650001901365650001101384650000901395650001501404651001301419653002901432653002401461653002901485653003601514653004501550700002201595773011101617856008501728852000901813655001201822IND60562197320221121062411.0170202e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056219732DNAL7 a10.1080/10496505.2016.12470012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAonngernthayakorn, Kijsart10aDeterminants of Rice Farmers’ Utilization of Agricultural Information in Central Thailand  ap. 25-43.  aThis study investigated factors affecting the utilization of agricultural information among rice farmers in central Thailand. About 240 rice farmers in the Bang Pla Ma District of Suphanburi Province were surveyed and interviewed to describe how they utilize agricultural information. Respondents were divided into small, medium, and large rice farmers according to farm size. Small farmers had more access to information on farming practices and postharvesting activities, while large and medium farmers utilized more information on marketing, covering future market and farmgate prices. The multinomial logit model showed that length of farming experience, household labor size, distance to the Rice Research Center, and number of information sources, as well as access to the Internet, television, extension program, and relatives, significantly influence farmers’ utilization of agricultural information.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3afarm size 3afarmers 3afarmers' markets 3afarming systems 3ainformation 3ainformation sources 3alabor 3alogit analysis 3aprices 3arice 3atelevision 3aThailand 0aagricultural information 0ainformation sources 0aintensity of utilization 0amultinomial logistic regression 0adeterminants of agricultural information1 aPongquan, Soparth0 tJournal of agricultural & food information.g2017 Jan. 2, v. 18, no. 1 p.25-43dRoutledgex1540-47227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10496505.2016.12470013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013900170300001800309520141800327592002801745650002201773650001501795650001501810650002201825650001801847650001301865650001201878650002001890650001301910650001901923650000701942650002101949650003401970650002302004650001602027653002302043653002402066653003102090653003002121653002502151700002202176700002502198773014102223856008602364852000902450655001202459IND60608936120221119004518.0190727e20180824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060893612DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2018.14603062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMansour, R.

The characterization and adsorption efficiency for methylene blue was evaluated using date pits. Fourier Transform Infra-Red, Scanning Electron Microscope, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis were performed to determine the characteristics of the material. The effect of contact time, initial dye concentration, adsorbent dosage, temperature, and solution pH were investigated. The adsorption was found to increase with increasing time, decreasing concentration of dye, decreasing temperature and increasing dosage up to equilibrium values which was 20 min, 25°C, and 0.1 g adsorbent, respectively. The adsorption was favorable at high and low pH (pH 3, pH 7). The adsorption equilibrium data were best fitted by Freundlich isotherm. The adsorption kinetics was found to follow the pseudo second order kinetic model. Thermodynamic parameters such as free energy, enthalpy, and entropy were calculated and found to be −4.6 kJ/mole, −7.9 kJ/mole, and −11.8 kJ/mole, respectively. The thermodynamic parameters of the uptake of methylene blue onto the date pits indicated that, the process is exothermic and proceeds spontaneously at low temperature. A single stage batch adsorber was designed for adsorption of methylene blue by Date Pits based on optimum isotherm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abatch systems 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aheat production 3akinetics 3amethylene blue 3apH 3aphytoremediation 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 0aAgriculture wastes 0aadsorption isotherm 0aadsorbent characterization 0aremoval of methylene blue 0awastewater treatment1 aAboeleneen, N.

They will, however, usually not have a predictive capability at model grid scale due to limitations of data availability and uncertainty of model conceptualizations. In previous publications, we have introduced the Representative Elementary Scale (RES) concept as the theoretically minimum scale at which a model with a given conceptualization has a potential for obtaining a predictive accuracy corresponding to a given acceptable accuracy. The new RES concept has similarities to the 25‐year‐old Representative Elementary Area concept, but it differs in the sense that while Representative Elementary Area addresses similarity between subcatchments by sampling within the catchment, RES focuses on effects of data or conceptualization uncertainty by Monte Carlo simulations followed by a scale analysis. In the present paper, we extend and generalize the RES concept to a framework for assessing the minimum scale of potential predictability of a distributed model applicable also for analyses of different model structures and data availabilities. We present three examples with RES analyses and discuss our findings in relation to Beven's alternative blueprint and environmental modeling philosophy from 2002. While Beven here addresses model structural and parameter uncertainties, he does not provide a thorough methodology for assessing to which extent model predictions for variables that are not measured possess opportunities to have meaningful predictive accuracies, or whether this is impossible due to limitations in data and models. This shortcoming is addressed by the RES framework through its analysis of the relationship between aggregation scale of model results and prediction uncertainties and for considering how alternative model structures and alternative data availability affects the results. We suggest that RES analysis should be applied in all modeling studies that aim to use simulation results at spatial scales smaller than the support scale of the calibration data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3ahydrologic models 3aphilosophy 3aprediction 3asubwatersheds 3auncertainty1 aHøjberg, A.L.1 aHe, X.1 aHansen, A.L.1 aRasmussen, S.H.1 aStisen, S.0 tHydrological processes.g2016 Dec. 30, v. 30, no. 26 p.4956-4965dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.110293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04118naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245022100171300001800392520210800410592002802518650001802546650002402564650002802588650001402616650001502630650001302645650002002658650002002678650002102698650002402719650001202743650000902755650001102764650001502775650001402790650001602804650002402820650001302844653001302857653001302870653001802883653001202901653001702913653002302930653002702953653000802980653001302988653001303001653001303014653001003027653001403037653001003051653000903061700001603070700003403086700001703120700005903137700002403196700001803220773009903238856008603337852000903423655001203432IND60650996720221119014040.0211106e20190814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065099672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVolckmar, Julia14aThe STING activator c-di-AMP exerts superior adjuvant properties than the formulation poly(I:C)/CpG after subcutaneous vaccination with soluble protein antigen or DEC-205-mediated antigen targeting to dendritic cells  ap. 4963-4974.  aVaccination is the most efficient strategy to protect from infectious diseases and the induction of a protective immune response not only depends on the nature of the antigen, but is also influenced by the vaccination strategy and the co-administration of adjuvants. Therefore, the precise monitoring of adjuvant candidates and their immune modulatory properties is a crucial step in vaccine development. Here, one central aspect is the induction of appropriate humoral and cellular effector mechanisms.In our study we performed a direct comparison of two promising candidates in adjuvant development, the STING activator bis-(3,5)-cyclic dimeric adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) and the Toll-like receptor ligand formulation poly(I:C)/CpG. These were evaluated in C57BL/6 mice using the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) in subcutaneous vaccination with soluble protein as well as in a dendritic cell (DC) targeting approach (αDEC-OVA). Strikingly, c-di-AMP as compared to poly(I:C)/CpG resulted in significantly higher antigen-specific IgG antibody levels when used in immunization with soluble OVA as well as in antigen targeting to DC. In vaccination with soluble OVA, c-di-AMP induced a significantly stronger CTL, Th1 and IFNγ-producing CD8⁺ memory T cell response than poly(I:C)/CpG. The response was CTL and Th1 cell dominated, a profile shared by both adjuvants. In the context of targeting OVA to DC, c-di-AMP induced significantly increased Th1 and Th2 cell responses as compared to poly(I:C)/CpG. Interestingly, the Th1 response dominated the overall T cell response only when c-di-AMP was used, indicating a distinct modulatory property of c-di-AMP when the DC targeting immunization approach was exploited.Taken together, we describe superior properties of c-di-AMP as compared to poly(I:C)/CpG in subcutaneous vaccination with soluble antigen as well as antigen targeting to DC. This indicates exceptionally effective adjuvant properties for c-di-AMP and provides compelling evidence of its potential for further adjuvant development, especially also when using DC targeting approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aToll-like receptors 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aadjuvants 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3adendritic cells 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainfectious diseases 3aligands 3amice 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aovalbumin 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3avaccines 0aAdjuvant 0ac-di-AMP 0aPoly(I:C)/CpG 0aDEC-205 0aDC targeting 0aSubcutaneous route 0aCell mediated immunity 0aCDN 0ac-di-AMP 0ac-di-GMP 0ac-di-IMP 0aDDX41 0aPoly(I:C) 0aSTING 0aTBK11 aKnop, Laura1 aStegemann-Koniszewski, Sabine1 aSchulze, Kai1 aEbensen, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8906-063X1 aGuzmán, Carlos A.,1 aBruder, Dunja0 tVaccine.g2019 Aug. 14, v. 37, no. 35 p.4963-4974dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001900150245015100169300001400320520105600334592002801390650001701418650001101435650001001446650001301456650001001469650002901479650001901508650001101527650001501538651001001553700002301563700001801586700001901604700001901623700002401642773007701666856008601743852000901829655001201838IND4475697620221119114135.0141111e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447569762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInoue, Yudzuru10aUsing Â¹â´C dating of stable humin fractions to assess upbuilding pedogenesis of a buried Holocene humic soil horizon, Towada volcano, Japan  ap. 85-90.  aThe genesis of a 40-cm-thick buried Holocene humic soil horizon in a 6-m-high sequence near Towada volcano, Japan, was examined by dating stable, plant-derived humin particles by AMS-based radiocarbon (Â¹â´C), and by analyzing stable carbon isotope ratios (Î´Â¹Â³C), phytolith composition, and soil chemical properties. The AMS dating yielded calibrated ages ranging from 7570â7679 to 6180â6313calyr BP. We obtained a strong correlation (r=0.99, ***p<0.001) between sample depth and the mean age. The (now buried) humic soil was formed by the incremental accumulation of tephric loess and aeolian dust at a constant rate of ~30mm per century for at least 1200years. Whilst the soil surface was slowly rising, graminaceous vegetation was supplied at a constant rate so that developmental upbuilding pedogenesis ensued. The soil was buried and isolated by the fall of the Towada-Chuseri tephra about 6200calyr BP. Thus the tephra-soil sequence near Towada volcano represents both developmental and retardant upbuilding pedogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburied soils 3acarbon 3ahumin 3aisotopes 3aloess 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil formation 3atephra 3avegetation 3aJapan1 aHiradate, Syuntaro1 aSase, Takashi1 aHosono, Mamoru1 aMorita, Sayaka1 aMatsuzaki, Hiroyuki0 tGeoderma.g2011 Nov., v. 167-168 p.85-90dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002100187245009600208300001400304506007600318520073100394592002801125506003701153650003801190650002101228650001601249650002501265650002501290653001201315653003101327653000801358653001001366653001701376653000801393653000901401653000801410653000801418653000701426653000901433653000801442653000801450653001001458653000901468653000901477653000801486700005301494773009101547856008001638852000901718655001201727IND60560953220221207090253.0170719e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056095322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2017.01.0082doi7 aPMC53031372pmcid7 a280884512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarpong, Kwabena10aEfficient sortase-mediated N-terminal labeling of TEV protease cleaved recombinant proteins  ap. 55-58.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA major challenge in attaching fluorophores or other handles to proteins is the availability of a site-specific labeling strategy that provides stoichiometric modification without compromising protein integrity.

To achieve stoichiometrically-labeled protein, we included a short affinity tag in the fluorophore-containing peptide for post-labeling purification of the modified protein. This strategy can be easily applied to any recombinant protein with a TEV site and we demonstrate this on Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Membrane Scaffold Protein (MSP) constructs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3afluorescent dyes 3aproteinases 3arecombinant proteins 3ascaffolding proteins 0aSortase 0aPost-labeling purification 0aTEV 0aLPXTG 0aAffinity tag 0aTEV 0aEGFR 0aMSP 0aHER 0aKD 0aSrtA 0aACP 0aLAP 0aTAMRA 0aEDTA 0aEGTA 0aNTA1 aBose, Ron1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1977-88940 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 521 p.55-58dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2017.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011200160300001800272500002000290520125100310592002801561650002001589650001301609650002301622650001601645650002701661650002101688650001101709651001201720700001801732700002401750700002001774773011001794856007301904852000901977655001201986IND60571907120221119072645.0170712e20161230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057190712DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.109702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Debapi K.10aQuantifying changes of effective springshed area and net recharge through recession analysis of spring flow  ap. 5053-5062.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe average flow of Silver Springs, one of the largest magnitude springs in Central Florida, declined 32% from 2000 to 2012. The average groundwater head in the springshed declined 0.14 m, and the spring pool altitude increased 0.24 m during the same period. This paper presents a novel explanation of the spring flow recession curve for Silver Springs using the Torricelli model, which uses the groundwater head at a sentinel well, the spring pool altitude and the net recharge to groundwater. The effective springshed area and net recharge (defined as recharge minus groundwater pumping and evapotranspiration) were estimated based on the observed recession slopes for spring flow, groundwater head and spring pool altitude. The results indicate that the effective springshed area continuously declined since 1989 and the net recharge declined since the 1970s with a significant drop in 2002. Subsequent to 2002, the net recharge increased modestly but not to the levels prior to the 1990s. The reduction in net recharge was caused by changes in hydroclimatic conditions including precipitation and air temperature, along with groundwater withdrawals, which contributed to the declined spring flow.

The first experiment examined the fruit growth pattern in the litchi ‘Shahi’. The second experiment focused on the limitation of assimilate supply to litchi fruits by leaf removal and girdling. The third experiment was aimed at fulfilling the assimilate requirement of growing litchi bunches through current photosynthesis by foliar application of a photosynthesis enhancer (triacontanol). The fruits exhibited a sigmoidal growth pattern with a phase of rapid growth 40 to 60 days after fruit set. Irrespective of method or distance of source limitation, the maximum percent of fruit drop was observed when the source limitation treatments were imposed 30 days after fruit set. Source limitation at all the distances resulted in significant increases in percent of fruit drop over those with no source limitations. With respect to different treatments, all forms of source limitation resulted in significant increase in fruit drop over the control. The results suggest that a contribution of carbohydrate from current photosynthesis for partial fulfillment of total carbon demand of growing fruits is necessary. Only no limitation of current photosynthesis contributed towards 0% loss in fruit weight while a limitation of carbohydrate translocation (girdling) contributed towards an 8.5% loss in fruit weight. However, under the condition of limited carbohydrate translocation, restriction on current photosynthesis caused a 19.1% loss in average fruit weight. Studies on foliar application of photosynthesis enhancers (triacontanol) on fruit drop in litchi under restricted (girdled) and unrestricted translocation of assimilate from other parts of the plant were conducted. These indicated a reduction in the rate of fruit drop with an increase in the concentration of triacontanol in case of unrestricted translocation of assimilate. However, under restricted assimilate translocation, increasing concentrations of triacontanol did not result in reducing the percent of fruit drop. Hence, the study clearly indicated the major role of translocated assimilates from other plant parts in fulfilling the assimilate demand of growing fruits in litchi where current photosynthesis contributes partially towards assimilate demand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitchi 3acarbon 3afoliar application 3afruit drop 3afruit growing 3afruit set 3afruits 3agirdling 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3atriacontanol 0alitchi 0aLitchi chinensis 0acarbohydrate 0afruit weight 0atriacontanol1 aJana, B.

However, the cultivation of large quantities of unicellular microalgae to support rotifer population growth is a heavy burden on many hatcheries. The effects of artificial detritus (detritus) from the macroalgae Ulva pertusa, Undaria pinnatifida, and Chondrus ocellatus, on the population growth and nutritional content (amino acid and fatty acid composition) of B. plicatilis were evaluated as potential substitute diets. We used the microalgae Nannochloropsis sp. as comparative food. The results show that the nutritional value of the detritus from each macroalgal species is not as good as Nannochloropsis in terms of population growth, maximum population density, and population growth rate. However, when Nannochloropsis was mixed with the detritus from the other three macroalgae, for the resulting B. plicatilis populations maintained high levels and attained higher maximum population densities and population growth rates. The nutritional value of B. plicatilis fed U. pertusa detritus, specifically, the free amino acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), were better than those fed with other diets. The DHA/eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ratio in rotifers fed U. pertusa detritus was the highest at 6.9 times higher than those fed Nannochloropsis. Therefore, the detritus of macroalgae, especially U. pertusa, is an appropriate substitute diet, at least partly, for the culture and dietary enrichment of B. plicatilis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachionus plicatilis 3aChondrus 3aUlva 3aUndaria pinnatifida 3aamino acids 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aenrichment culture 3afatty acid composition 3afish feeds 3afoods 3afree amino acids 3alive feeds 3amacroalgae 3amicroalgae 3anutritive value 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3aprotein content 0aRotifer 0aSeaweed 0aPopulation growth rate 0aHighly unsaturated fatty acid 0aFree amino acid1 aMin, Wen Wu1 aLin, Hua Jian1 aChen, Wei0 tAquaculture.g2013 Mar. 04, v. 380-383 p.62-69dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2012.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245026800180300001800448520108200466592002801548650002701576650002901603650002301632650001701655650001901672650001201691650001401703650001301717653003501730653003601765653002201801653001901823653001201842653000801854653000801862653000901870653001001879653000901889653001201898653000801910653000801918653001101926653001301937653000801950653000801958700006901966700002002035700002602055700003502081700006102116700002202177700002002199700001802219773009902237856008602336852000902422655001202431IND60650996920221119014203.0211106e20190814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065099692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.07.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafadi, Marco Aurelio P.10aImmunogenicity of the pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) administered concomitantly with the meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB) vaccine in infants: A post-hoc analysis in a phase 3b, randomised, controlled trial  ap. 4858-4863.  aNo data are currently available on immunogenicity of higher-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines when co-administered with a 4-component meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (4CMenB).Post-hoc analysis of pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) immunogenicity when co-administered with 4CMenB (2 + 1 schedule) and/or a CRM-conjugated meningococcal serogroup C vaccine (MenC-CRM) in a trial assessing 4CMenB reduced schedules and co-administration with MenC-CRM (NCT01339923).

Here, chloroform extraction, nanoelectrospray (nanoESI) negative ionization, together with Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (MS) determined the topographic and age-related GG specificity in normal adult human brain. Mapping of GG mixtures extracted from 20 to 82 year old frontal and occipital lobes revealed besides a decrease in the GG number with age, a variability of sialylation degree within the brain regions. From the 111 species identified, 105 were distinguished in the FL20, 74 in OL20, 46 in FL82 and 56 in OL82. The results emphasize that within the juvenile brain, GG species exhibit a higher expression in the FL than in OL, while in the aged brain the number of GG species is higher in the OL. By applying MS/MS analysis, the generated fragment ions confirmed the incidence of GT1c (d18:1/18:0) and GT1c (d18:1/20:0) in the investigated samples. The present findings are of major value for further clinical studies carried out using Orbitrap MS in order to correlate gangliosides with CNS disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abrain 3achloroform 3aclinical trials 3agangliosides 3ahumans 3aionization 3aions 3ajuveniles 3amass spectrometry 3atopography 0aGangliosides 0aHuman brain 0aHigh resolution mass spectrometry 0aAge-and topographic specificity 0aMapping 0aSequencing1 aDehelean, Liana1 aMunteanu, Cristian V.A.1 aVukelić, Željka1 aZamfir, Alina D.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 521 p.40-54dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2017.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02162naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013100160300002000291520098400311592002801295650002301323650001201346650001401358650001901372650001501391650001401406650001501420650001101435700001501446700001501461700001501476700002001491700001801511700002001529773014401549856007401693852000901767655001201776IND60670494020221116212541.0191002e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067049402DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta12065a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Changfeng10aDirect two-phase interfacial self-assembly of aligned silver nanowire films for surface enhanced Raman scattering applications  ap. 13496-13501.  aAssembly of nanowires into ordered macroscopic structures has attracted great scientific interest in the past decade. In this work, we report on a rapid low-cost scalable oil–water (two-phase) interfacial self-assembly process for fabricating aligned Ag nanowire (AgNW) films on solid substrates. This process is much simpler than traditional Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) techniques and allows the assembly of one-dimensional Ag nanowires on any solid substrate without extra pretreatment of either the surface of silver nanowires or the solid substrate. The resultant aligned AgNW films can be used as robust surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates for chemical and biomolecular detection with highly uniform and repeatable SERS signals over the entire substrate. Sensitive and quantitative detection of the toxicant arsenic in drinking water using these AgNW films are subsequently presented to demonstrate potential applications for environmental pollutant analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aarsenic 3achemistry 3adrinking water 3ananosilver 3ananowires 3apollutants 3asilver1 aHao, Jumin1 aZhu, Leyun1 aYao, Yuqin1 aMeng, Xiaoguang1 aWeimer, Wayne1 aWang, Qingwu K.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 1, no. 43 p.13496-13501dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta12065a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245014800165300001800313520109700331592002801428650001501456650001701471650001801488650001301506650001501519650002201534650001301556650001901569700002101588773012101609856007501730852000901805655001201814IND60558087420221120092444.0161108e20120405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055808742DNAL7 a10.1021/jp210728s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsakawa, D.q(Daiki),10aFragmentation Processes of Hydrogen-Deficient Peptide Radicals in Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization In-Source Decay Mass Spectrometry  ap. 4016-4023.  aThe mechanism of in-source decay (ISD) in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) has been described. The MALDI-ISD with an oxidizing matrix is initiated by hydrogen abstraction from peptides to matrix molecules, leading to hydrogen-deficient peptide radicals. Subsequently, the Cα–C and Cα–H bonds are cleaved, forming the a•/x fragment pair and [M–2H], respectively. Those reactions competitively occur during MALDI-ISD processes. Our results suggest that the Cα–H bond cleavage to form [M–2H] was induced by collisions between hydrogen-deficient peptide radicals and matrix molecules in the MALDI plume. In contrast, the Cα–C bond cleavages occur via a unimolecular dissociation process and independently of the collision rate in the MALDI plume. The formation mechanism of the a-, b-, and d-series fragments are also described. We report 2,5-bis(2-hydroxyethoxy)-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (bisHE-TCNQ), being known as an organic semiconductor and an electron acceptor, as a novel suitable matrix for the MALDI-ISD of peptides via hydrogen abstraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesorption 3adissociation 3afree radicals 3ahydrogen 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3apeptides 3asemiconductors1 aTakayama, Mitsuo0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Apr. 05, v. 116, no. 13 p.4016-4023dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp210728s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245009900163300001800262520143700280592002801717650002201745650002201767650001301789650001201802650002001814650002101834650003701855650001201892650001101904650003301915650001101948650002101959650003701980700001102017700001602028700002002044700001702064773012602081856008202207852000902289655001202298IND60567549920221116192421.0170423e20160218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056754992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b124072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Hongbin14aThe Role of Sodium in LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 Cathode Material and Its Electrochemical Behaviors  ap. 3235-3241.  aSodium is first introduced to modify Ni-rich LiNi₀.₈Co₀.₁₅Al₀.₀₅O₂ cathode material in this work, and Li₁–ₓNaₓNi₀.₈Co₀.₁₅Al₀.₀₅O₂ (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05) is successfully synthesized by using Na₂CO₃ as sodium resource through coprecipitation and solid state calcination route.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show that all the synthesized materials have typical hexagonal structure without impurities. The lattice parameters calculated from the XRD data are also refined by Rietveld refinement methods, confirming that the position of Na in the NCA is occupying the Li slab as designed.

In this study MFC-based biosensing was integrated with two nonlinear programming methods, artificial neural networks (ANN) and time series analysis (TSA). During laboratory testing, the MFCs generated well-organized normally-distributed peaks when the influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) was 150mg/L or less, and multi-peak signals when the influent COD was 200mg/L. The area under the response peak correlated well with the influent COD concentration. During field testing, we observed normally-distributed and multi-peak profiles at low COD concentrations. The ANN predicted the COD concentration without error with just one layer of hidden neurons, and the TSA model predicted the temporal trends present in properly functioning MFCs and in a device that was gradually failing. This report is the first to integrate ANN and TSA with MFC-based biosensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical oxygen demand 3alaboratory techniques 3amicrobial fuel cells 3amonitoring 3aneural networks 3atime series analysis 3awater quality 2aBioelectric Energy Sources 2aBiological Oxygen Demand Analysis 2aBiosensing Techniques 2aModels, Theoretical 2aNeural Networks, Computer. 2aSystems Integration 0aMicrobial fuel cells 0aBiosensing 0aNeural network algorithms 0aWater quality 0aTime series analysis1 aKayode, Olubanke1 aHarper, Willie F.0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 Apr. 01, v. 449 p.223-228dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010500173300001600278520132300294592002801617650002401645650002301669650001301692650001001705650001101715650001101726650001201737650001101749650001401760650002501774650002401799650001001823650003001833651001801863653002401881653002001905653002301925653001701948700001901965700002601984700002002010773011502030856008502145852000902230655001202239IND60534616220221119063013.0190416e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053461622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2015.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, Chelsea L.10aExperimental vertical transmission of Rickettsia parkeri in the Gulf Coast tick, Amblyomma maculatum  ap. 568-573.  aRickettsia parkeri, an obligate intracellular bacterium, is a member of the spotted fever group of rickettsiae (SFGR), and is transmitted to humans and other animals by invertebrate vectors. In the United States, the primary vector of R. parkeri is the Gulf Coast tick, Amblyomma maculatum Koch. This study investigates the vertical transmission dynamics of R. parkeri within a field-derived, naturally infected colony of A. maculatum. Transovarial and transstadial transmission of the pathogen was observed over three generations, with transovarial transmission efficiency averaging 83.7% and transstadial transmission rates approaching 100%. Fitness costs were determined by comparing reproduction values of the R. parkeri-infected A. maculatum colony to values from a R. parkeri-free colony. No significant reproductive fitness costs to the host ticks were detected in the R. parkeri-infected A. maculatum colony. Significantly fewer engorged F1 nymphs and F2 larvae of the R. parkeri-free colony succeeded in molting, suggesting that there may be some advantage to survival conferred by R. parkeri. The results of this study indicate that R. parkeri is maintained in A. maculatum populations efficiently by transovarial and transstadial transmission without any noticeable effects on tick reproduction or survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma maculatum 3aRickettsia parkeri 3abacteria 3afever 3ahumans 3alarvae 3amolting 3anymphs 3apathogens 3areproductive fitness 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3atransovarial transmission 3aUnited States 0aAmblyomma maculatum 0aGulf Coast tick 0aRickettsia parkeri 0aTransmission1 aGaff, Holly D.1 aSonenshine, Daniel E.1 aHynes, Wayne L.0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2015 July, v. 6, no. 5 p.568-573dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2015.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012900172300001600301520146600317592002801783650000801811650002501819650001601844650001901860650001101879650000901890650001301899650001001912650002001922650003001942650001401972650001701986650001002003651002402013651002002037653002502057653001102082653001102093653002002104700002102124700002402145700001902169700001802188700002302206700005702229773011502286856008502401852000902486655001202495IND60534616320221119063155.0190416e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053461632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2015.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGebrekidan, Hagos10aInvestigating the first outbreak of oriental theileriosis in cattle in South Australia using multiplexed tandem PCR (MT-PCR)  ap. 574-578.  aThis study investigated the first outbreak of oriental theileriosis in a herd of beef cattle in South Australia using a newly established multiplexed tandem PCR (MT-PCR) to identify, differentiate and quantitate the four genotypes (buffeli, chitose, ikeda and type 5) of Theileria orientalis recognised to occur in Australasia. Following clinical diagnosis of oriental theileriosis (based on clinical signs, laboratory findings and post mortem examination), 155 blood samples were collected from individual cows (n=85) and calves (n=70), and tested by MT-PCR. In total, 117 (75.48%) cattle were shown to be test-positive for T. orientalis. All four genotypes were detected, and ikeda had the highest prevalence (90.6%; 106/117), followed by buffeli (83.8%; 98/117), chitose (18.8%; 22/117) and type 5 (5.1%; 6/117). Mixed infections with genotypes buffeli and ikeda had a higher prevalence (55.5%; 65/117) than any other combination of genotypes. The prevalences of buffeli and ikeda were significantly higher (P<0.005) than those of chitose and type 5. The average intensity of infection with genotype ikeda (329,775 DNA copies) was significantly higher (P<0.0001) than buffeli (212,843) and chitose (125,462). This study reinforces the utility of MT-PCR as a diagnostic tool for rapidly investigating oriental theileriosis outbreaks in cattle herds and as a pre-movement screening test for preventing the introduction of this disease into non-endemic regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aTheileria orientalis 3abeef cattle 3ablood sampling 3acalves 3acows 3agenotype 3aherds 3amixed infection 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3atheileriosis 3aticks 3aAustralasian region 3aSouth Australia 0aTheileria orientalis 0aCattle 0aMT-PCR 0aSouth Australia1 aGasser, Robin B.1 aPerera, Piyumali K.1 aMcGrath, Sarah1 aMcGrath, Sean1 aStevenson, Mark A.1 aJabbar, Abdul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8888-00460 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2015 July, v. 6, no. 5 p.574-578dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2015.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245006900202300001800271506007600289520105600365592002801421506003701449650002501486650001001511650002201521650001301543650001701556650001101573650002201584650002601606650002401632650002501656653001701681653002101698653002201719653001901741700002201760700002301782700002101805700002201826700002301848773013601871856007402007852000902081655001202090IND60673331020221207061338.0191018e20190220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067333102DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/ery4472doi7 aPMC63823412pmcid7 a305617272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakou, Margarita10aLinking genes with ecological strategies in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 1141-1151.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aArabidopsis thaliana is the most prominent model system in plant molecular biology and genetics. Although its ecology was initially neglected, collections of various genotypes revealed a complex population structure, with high levels of genetic diversity and substantial levels of phenotypic variation. This helped identify the genes and gene pathways mediating phenotypic change. Population genetics studies further demonstrated that this variation generally contributes to local adaptation. Here, we review evidence showing that traits affecting plant life history, growth rate, and stress reactions are not only locally adapted, they also often co-vary. Co-variation between these traits indicates that they evolve as trait syndromes, and reveals the ecological diversification that took place within A. thaliana. We argue that examining traits and the gene that control them within the context of global summary schemes that describe major ecological strategies will contribute to resolve important questions in both molecular biology and ecology.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3alife history 3amodels 3amolecular biology 3aphenotypic plasticity 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation structure 0aCSR strategy 0alocal adaptation 0anatural variation 0atrait syndrome1 aWieters, Benedict1 aKopriva, Stanislav1 aCoupland, George1 aLinstädter, Anja1 aDe Meaux, Juliette0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2019 Feb. 20, v. 70, no. 4 p.1141-1151dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44658x1460-24317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ery4473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245017700169300001600346520147800362592002801840650001701868650001101885650001401896650002301910650001101933650002301944650001501967650001501982650002201997650001802019650002202037650002402059650001802083650001802101650001302119650002202132650001502154650001502169650001702184650002902201650001402230653002302244653002402267653001702291653003602308653001702344700001202361700001602373700001702389700001302406773012802419856008502547852000902632655001202641IND60560151920221119064528.0170103e20170103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056015192DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b019522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Zhixiong10aElectropolymerization Fabrication of Co Phosphate Nanoparticles Encapsulated in N,P-Codoped Mesoporous Carbon Networks as a 3D Integrated Electrode for Full Water Splitting  ap. 571-579.  aThe development of high-performance nonprecious electrocatalysts toward both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance for overall water splitting but remains a grand challenge. In this study, Co phosphate (CP) nanoparticles encapsulated in three-dimensional porous N,P-codoped carbon networks (NPC) were fabricated by direct growth on carbon cloth (CC), which were further used as an integrated three-dimensional (3D) electrode for cost-effective and energy efficient HER and OER both in acid and alkaline medium. Impressively, the as-obtained flexible integrated electrode exhibited excellent activities and robust stability, due to the unique 3D architecture with improved electron transport capability, high number of active sites, and channels for reactant/product transfer. Our experimental results show significantly enhanced performance for such engineered nanostructures due to the synergistic effect from nanoparticles encapsulation and nitrogen and phosphorus doping on carbon structures. Such an versatile electrode can serve as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting with excellent catalytic performance and durability in a more direct and simple way, which reduces the production cost of practical technological devices. The new design demonstrated here opened avenues for simple, low-cost, and scalable manufacture of high performance bifunctional catalysts for renewable energy technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acost effectiveness 3adurability 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aencapsulation 3aenergy efficiency 3ahydrogen production 3amanufacturing 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3aoxygen production 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aporous media 3arenewable energy sources 3asynergism 0aN,P-codoped carbon 0aCarbon encapsulated 0aCo phosphate 0aElectrochemical water splitting 0a3D electrode1 aXu, Wei1 aLi, Feiming1 aYao, Qiuhong1 aChen, Xi0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 Jan. 03, v. 5, no. 1 p.571-579dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b019523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012700157300001800284520084900302592002801151650001401179650002301193650001501216650001501231650001301246650001601259650001301275700001501288700001401303700001301317700001601330700001601346700001701362700001501379773014101394856007401535852000901609655001201618IND60670494520221116212400.0191002e20130806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067049452DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta12077e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Mingxing10aTiC/Pt composite catalyst as counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells with long-term stability and high efficiency  ap. 9672-9679.  aTitanium carbide/platinum (TiC/Pt) composites were prepared by a simple chemical route and subsequently introduced into dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) as counter electrode (CE) catalysts to improve the catalytic activity and reduce the cost of DSCs. The DSC using TiC/Pt (containing 0.12 wt% of Pt) CE showed high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.63%, higher than those of DSCs using TiC and Pt CEs (6.40% and 7.16%, respectively). After a long-term (one year) stability test, the PCE of the DSC using this CE retained 86.9% of its highest value, proving the outstanding durability of the TiC/Pt composite. In large-scale DSCs (55 mm × 75 mm), the DSC using TiC/Pt CE yielded a PCE of 4.98%, comparable to that of a DSC using Pt CE (4.94%). This work points out the feasibility of using TiC/Pt composite CEs in practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adurability 3aelectrodes 3aplatinum 3asolar cells 3atitanium1 aWang, Yudi1 aLin, Xiao1 aGuo, Wei1 aWu, Kezhong1 aLin, Ya-nan1 aGuo, Hongyue1 aMa, Tingli0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Aug. 6, v. 1, no. 34 p.9672-9679dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta12077e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002200124024001900146040001800165100002300183245008000206300001800286506007600304520117200380592002801552506003701580650001601617650001401633650001801647650002001665650002101685650002001706650001901726650002801745650002501773650001401798650001101812700002001823700002501843773012701868856004501995852000902040655001202049IND4524924120221207074255.0160105e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452492412DNAL7 a10.1099/vir.0.040790-02doi7 aPMC37555122pmcid7 a223775832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlauser, Daniel L.10aVirion endocytosis is a major target for murid herpesvirus-4 neutralization  ap. 1316-1327.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHerpesviruses consistently transmit from immunocompetent carriers, implying that their neutralization is hard to achieve. Murid herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) exploits host IgG Fc receptors to bypass blocks to cell binding, and pH-dependent protein conformation changes to unveil its fusion machinery only after endocytosis. Nevertheless, neutralization remains possible by targeting the virion glycoprotein H (gH)âgL heterodimer, and the neutralizing antibody responses of MuHV-4 carriers are improved by boosting with recombinant gHâgL. We analysed here how gHâgL-directed neutralization works. The MuHV-4 gHâgL binds to heparan sulfate. However, most gHâgL-specific neutralizing antibodies did not block this interaction; neither did they act directly on fusion. Instead, they blocked virion endocytosis and transport to the late endosomes, where membrane fusion normally occurs. The poor endocytosis of gHâgL-neutralized virions was recapitulated precisely by virions genetically lacking gL. Therefore, driving virion uptake appears to be an important function of gHâgL that provides a major target for antibody-mediated neutralization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aendocytosis 3aendosomes 3aglycoproteins 3aheparan sulfate 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amembrane fusion 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aprotein conformation 3areceptors 3avirion1 aGillet, Laurent1 aStevenson, Philip G.0 tJournal of general virology.g2012 June, v. 93, no.

However, the contamination and correlation between the two pollutants in the groundwater of drinking-water source areas has not yet been considered. In this study, eight antibiotics were detected in 81 groundwater samples from a drinking-water source area. These were trimethoprim (TMP), sulfadimidine (SDD), sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfachloropyridazine (SCP), norfloxacin (NOR), ciprofloxacin (CIP) and enrofloxacin (ENRO). Detection rates ranged from 1.23% to 95.06% and the maximum concentration ranged from 0.44 ng/L to 45.40 ng/L. Antibiotics in the groundwater pose no threat to human health, while only ENRO, CIP, NOR, SMX, and SDZ posed medium to low risks to the aquatic ecosystem. In contrast, the detection rate of microplastics was 100% with abundance values ranging from 4 n/L to 72 n/L, with an average of 29 n/L. Microplastic polymers were identified as polyamide, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene. These also occurred in surface water but the particle sizes in groundwater were lower than those in the surface water. Through correlation analysis, it was found that NOR, ENRO and total antibiotic concentrations were significantly correlated with microplastic abundances. This study revealed the contamination and potential risks of antibiotics and microplastics in the groundwater of a drinking-water source area and found a correlation between them, indicating that risk management of antibiotics and microplastics in groundwater should be highly concerned.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aciprofloxacin 3adrinking water 3aenrofloxacin 3agroundwater 3ahuman health 3amicroplastics 3anorfloxacin 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolyamides 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3apolystyrenes 3aresearch 3arisk assessment 3arisk management 3asulfadiazine 3asulfamethazine 3asulfamethoxazole 3asurface water 3atrimethoprim 3aChina 0aEmerging organic contaminants (EOC) 0aAntibiotics 0aMicroplastics 0aRisk assessment 0aCorrelation1 aDong, Yingbo1 aShi, Yuanyuan1 aYin, Tingting1 aHe, Wei1 aAn, Tongyan1 aTang, Yalu1 aHou, Xuewen1 aChong, Shijia1 aChen, Danni1 aQin, Kangjia1 aLin, Hai0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 July, v. 210 p.112855-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1128553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245005900168300001600227520116700243592002801410650001801438650001201456650002101468650001301489650001301502650002001515650002201535650001701557650001101574650002101585650001301606650001101619650002201630650001301652650001501665650002301680650002501703650001601728653001101744653001901755653001601774653001501790653002801805700002201833773012201855856005101977852000902028655001202037IND50088700620221119202001.0140414e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008870062DNAL7 a10.1080/15538362.2011.5785122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGol, Neeta B.10aBanana Fruit Ripening as Influenced by Edible Coatings  ap. 119-135.  aThe effects of chitosan 1% and 1.5%, calcium chloride (CaCl₂) 1% and 1.5%, chitosan 1% + gibberellic acid 100 ppm, chitosan 1.5% + gibberellic acid 100 ppm, jojoba wax, and glycerol (98%) coatings were evaluated on the shelf life and postharvest quality characteristics of banana fruits stored at 34 ± 1°C and 70–75% relative humidity, while uncoated fruits served as a control. The coatings of chitosan, chitosan + gibberellic acid, and jojoba wax delayed the changes in the weight loss percentage, decay percentage, total soluble solids, pH, titrable acidity, sugar accumulation, pigment degradation, and ascorbic acid compared to uncoated ones. Further, the least disease incidence was found to occur in the banana fruits treated with chitosan and chitosan + gibberellic acid. Hence, it can be concluded that coating with chitosan and chitosan + gibberellic acid has the potential to control decay percentage, prolong the shelf life, and preserve valuable attributes of banana.

For insect herbivores with complex life histories, selection is predicted to favor those combinations of traits that increase the size at metamorphosis while minimizing the risk of mortality from natural enemies. Studies quantifying selection on life-history traits in natural insect herbivore populations, however, have been rare. The purpose of this study was to measure phenotypic selection imposed by elements of the first and third trophic levels on variation in two life-history traits, the timing of egg hatch and pupal mass, in a population of oak-feeding caterpillars, Psilocorsis quercicella (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae). Larvae were collected from the field throughout each of two generations per year for three years and reared to determine the effects of the date of egg hatch on both the risk of attack from parasitoids and the pupal mass of the survivors. The direction and strength of phenotypic selection attributed to aspects of the first and third trophic levels, as well as their combined effects, on the date of egg hatch was measured for each of the six generations. Heritabilities of and genetic correlations between pupal mass and the date of adult emergence from diapause (the life-history trait expected to have the largest influence on the timing of egg hatch, and thus larval development) were estimated from laboratory matings. In four of the six generations examined, significant directional selection attributed to the first trophic level was detected, always favoring early-hatching cohorts predicted to experience higher leaf quality than late-hatching cohorts. Directional phenotypic selection by the third trophic level was detected in only one of three years, and in that year the direction of selection was in opposite directions during the two successive generations. The combined effect of selection by both trophic levels indicated that the third trophic level acted to either reduce or enhance the more predictable pattern of selection attributed to the first trophic level. In addition, I found evidence of truncation selection acting to increase the mean and decrease the variance of pupal mass during the pupa-adult transition in the laboratory. Pupal mass and diapause duration were found to vary significantly among full-sibling families; upper bounds for heritability estimates were 0.57 and 0.30, respectively. Furthermore, these two traits were found to be positively genetically correlated (families with larger pupae had longer diapause durations), resulting in a fitness trade-off, because larger pupae enjoy higher survival through metamorphosis and female fecundity but emerge later, when average leaf quality for offspring is generally poorer.Corresponding Editor: J.

For this, we developed DEH-PPV-based polymers with two different anchor groups (sulfide and amine) acting as surfactants for CdSe nanoplatelets, which are atomically flat semiconductor nanocrystals. Hybridization of the polymers with the nanoplatelets in the solution phase was observed to cause strong photoluminescence quenching in both materials. Through steady-state photoluminescence and excitation spectrum measurements, photoluminescence quenching was shown to result from dominant exciton dissociation through charge transfer at the polymer/nanoplatelet interfaces that possess a staggered (i.e., type II) band alignment. Importantly, we found out that sulfide-based anchors enable a stronger emission quenching than amine-based ones, suggesting that the sulfide anchors exhibit more efficient binding to the nanoplatelet surfaces. Also, shorter surfactants were found to be more effective for exciton dissociation as compared to the longer ones. In addition, we show that nanoplatelets are homogeneously distributed in the hybrid films owing to the functional polymers. These nanocomposites can be used as building blocks for hybrid optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3adissociation 3afilms (materials) 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aphysical chemistry 3asemiconductors 3asulfides 3asurfactants1 aMenk, Florian1 aPhilipps, Kai1 aKelestemur, Yusuf1 aOlutas, Murat1 aZentel, Rudolf1 aDemir, Hilmi Volkan0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Feb. 18, v. 120, no. 6 p.3573-3582dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b126613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245011500132300001600247506002800263520141900291592002801710506003701738650002301775650001001798650002401808650001701832650001801849650001701867650001501884650001901899653002901918653001301947653001901960653002501979700001502004700001902019700001702038700001702055773012702072852000902199655001202208IND60773745120221207090639.0090317e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077374512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDolcemascolo, G10aUltrastructural comparative analysis on the adhesive papillae of the swimming larvae of three ascidian species  ap.

The investigations, carried out at ultrastructural level and at confocal laser microscope, have evidenced, in the adhesive papillae of the three studied species, three different cell-types: axial columnar cells, collocytes, sensory cells respectively. The adhesive papillae of A. malaca and P. mammillata show central axial columnar cells with long microvilli emerging from the apical edge and extending throughout the hyaline cap. Collocytes are elongated secreting cells, lying in middle-lateral side. Sensory cells have a cilium at the apical side and an axon proceeding from the basal side. The adhesive papillae of C. intestinalis present some differences in the ultrastructure of the axial columnar cells, which bear a big digitiform protrusion, extending throughout the hyaline cap and a lot of microtubules along the cell axis. The investigations, carried out at confocal microscopy, have evidentiated a clear fluorescence in the papillae of the three studied species and a network of nervous fibers projecting from the papillar base up to cerebral vesicle of the cephalenteron. The characteristic of simple and coniforme type and the adhesive and sensorial functions of adhesive papillae of three ascidian species examined are confirmed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCiona intestinalis 3aaxons 3aconfocal microscopy 3afluorescence 3ainvertebrates 3amicrotubules 3amicrovilli 3aultrastructure 0aswimming larvae ascidiae 0apapillae 0aultrastructure 0acomparative analysis1 aPennati, R1 aBernardi, F De1 aDamiani, F.,1 aGianguzza, M0 tInvertebrate survival journal.g2009 Mar., v. 6, no. 1S p.S77-S86dUniversity of Modena and Reggio Emiliax1824-307X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001500147245009600162300001800258500000900276520147200285592002801757650001701785650000901802650001001811650001101821650001701832650002301849650002501872650001601897650001401913650002501927650002101952650002601973651001001999700001702009700001702026700002002043700001902063773012302082852000902205856008402214655001202298IND4428886820221119212654.0191228e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442888682DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2009.02.00992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hao13aAn Alternate Wetting and Moderate Soil Drying Regime Improves Root and Shoot Growth in Rice  ap. 2246-2260.  aepub  aA major challenge in rice (Oryza sativa L.) production is to achieve the dual goal of increasing food production and saving water. This study aimed to investigate if alternate wetting and drying regimes could improve root and shoot growth and consequently increase grain yield and water use efficiency (WUE). Two rice varieties were field-grown at Yangzhou, China in 2005 and 2006. Three irrigation regimes, alternate wetting and moderate soil drying (WMD, re-watered when soil water potential reached −15 kPa at 15–20 cm depth), alternate wetting and severe soil drying (WSD, re-watered when soil water potential reached −30 kPa), and a conventional irrigation (CI, continuously flooded), were imposed during the whole growing season. Compared with the CI, the WMD regime significantly increased, whereas the WSD regime reduced, root oxidation activity, cytokinin concentrations in roots and shoots, leaf photosynthetic rate, and activities of key enzymes involved in sucrose-to-starch conversion in grains. Grain yield of the two varieties, on the average, was increased by 11% under the WMD regime, and was reduced by 32% under the WSD regime when compared with that under the CI regime. Averaged WUE of the two varieties was increased by 55% under the WMD regime and 36% under the WSD regime. We conclude that a moderate wetting and drying regime can enhance root growth which benefits other physiological processes and result in higher grain yield and WUE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3aroots 3ashoots 3aplant growth 3asoil water content 3awater use efficiency 3agrain yield 3acultivars 3asoil water potential 3aflood irrigation 3airrigation scheduling 3aChina1 aXue, Yaguang1 aWang, Zhiqin1 aYang, Jianchnag1 aZhang, Jianhua0 tCrop science.g2009 Nov., v. 49, no. 6 p.2246-2260dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2009.02.00993Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01541naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245007500176300001800251520054000269592002800809650001900837650001500856650001600871650003300887650003300920650001200953650001300965650001900978773009800997856008801095990002301183852000901206655001201215IND60098642820221120091951.0141105e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009864282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindenberg, Svend10aNew approach in patients with polycystic ovaries, lessons for everyone  ap. 1170-1172.  aIn vitro maturation is a safe and simple procedure for both the clinician and the patient.

Major gross cellular changes in the vascular wall of persons with CAD include endothelial injury and foam cell formation, as well as smooth muscle cell and fibroblast proliferation. This study examined the effects of glycated low density lipoprotein (glyLDL), a biochemical marker of diabetes, on cell viability, proliferation, and the expression of multiple growth factors in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF). The results demonstrated that exposure to ≥150 μg/mL of glyLDL for 24 h or 100 μg/mL of glyLDL for ≥48 h either significantly reduced cell viability or increased DNA fragmentation in MEF. GlyLDL treatment (25–100 μg/mL for up to 12 h) significantly increased the abundance of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and achieved a peak after 4 h exposure to glyLDL. Abundances of fibroblast growth factor-basic (FGF), transforming growth factor-β (TGF), and platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF) in MEF reached maximal levels after 2 h exposure to 50 μg/mL of glyLDL. The maximal increase of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected in MEF after 4 h of exposure to 50 μg/mL of glyLDL. Inhibitors for FGF (AZD4547), VEGF, or PDGF receptors (Axitinib), but not that for TGF receptor (LY364947), significantly decreased the abundance of (PCNA) in endothelial cells. The findings suggest that early exposure to a low dosage of glyLDL transiently increases the proliferation of MEF through the upregulation of FGF, VEGF, and (or) PDGF, and prolonged exposure to high concentrations of glyLDL reduced cell viability, which possibly accelerates atherogenesis under diabetic condition.  aPublisher supplied data 0aglycated low density lipoprotein 0afibroblasts 0acell viability 0aproliferation 0agrowth factors1 aXie, Xueping1 aShen, Garry X.0 tCanadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology.g2013 Jan. 21, v. 91, no. 1 p.64-70dNRC Research Pressx1205-75417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjpp-2012-02343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002700154245008600181300001600267520163600283592002801919650001501947650001501962650001701977650003501994650002002029650002102049650002102070650002202091650001502113650001802128650002802146650002302174650001702197650001902214650001802233650001702251650001902268650001302287650001202300653003102312653001502343653002902358653001902387700002402406700001902430700002702449700002102476700002802497700002602525700002102551700002202572700002002594700002002614773012202634856008902756852000902845655001202854IND60635951220221119171626.0190425e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063595122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2019.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, Jéssika F.F.10aQuantum dots-based fluoroimmunoassay for anti-Zika virus IgG antibodies detection  ap. 135-139.  aZika virus (ZIKV) has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. ZIKV has been associated with some neurological disorders, and their long-term effects are not completely understood. The majority of the methods for ZIKV diagnosis are based on the detection of IgM antibodies, which are the first signs of immunological response. However, the detection of IgG antibodies can be an important approach for ZIKV past infection diagnosis, especially for pregnant women, helping the comprehension/treatment of this disease. There has been a growing interest in applying nanoparticles for efficient ZIKV or antibodies detection. Quantum dots (QD) are unique fluorescent semiconductor nanoparticles, highly versatile for biological applications. In the present study, we explored the special QD optical properties to develop an immunofluorescence assay for anti-ZIKV IgG antibodies detection. Anti-IgG antibodies were successfully conjugated with QDs and applied in a fluorescence sensing nanoplatform. After optimization using IgG antibodies, the conjugates were employed to detect anti-ZIKV IgG antibodies in polystyrene microplates sensitized with ZIKV envelope E protein. The nanoplatform was able to detect anti-ZIKV IgG antibodies in a concentration at least 100-fold lower than the amount expected for protein E immune response. Moreover, conjugates were able to detect the antibodies for at least 4 months. Thus, our results showed that this QDs-based fluoroimmunoplatform can be considered practical, simple and promising to detect Zika past infections and/or monitoring immune response in vaccine trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZika virus 3aantibodies 3afluorescence 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3along term effects 3amonitoring 3ananoparticles 3anervous system diseases 3aoptical properties 3apolystyrenes 3apregnant women 3apublic health 3aquantum dots 3asemiconductors 3avaccines 3aviruses 0aSemiconductor nanocrystals 0aZika virus 0aImmunofluorescence assay 0aIgG antibodies1 aPereira, Maria I.A.1 aAssis, Lara G.1 aCabral Filho, Paulo E.1 aSantos, Beate S.1 aPereira, Giovannia A.L.1 aChaves, Claudilene R.1 aCampos, Gubio S.1 aSardi, Sílvia I.1 aPereira, Goreti1 aFontes, Adriana0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2019 May, v. 194 p.135-139dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2019.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245017500165300001800340520148100358592002801839650001501867650001201882650002101894650001901915650001601934650002001950650001901970650001701989650001402006650001402020650001002034650001302044653002902057653001502086653002002101653001202121700001502133700001702148700001702165700001802182700001702200700001602217700001302233700001502246700001502261773012802276856008302404852000902487655001202496IND60776748120221119212416.0220620e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077674812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.04.1822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Lingmin10aCO2-assisted ‘Weathering’ of Steel Slag-Derived Calcium Silicate Hydrate: A Generalized Strategy for Recycling Noble Metals and Constructing SiO2-Based Nanocomposites  ap. 1008-1019.  aThe spent adsorbent loaded by toxic metals is a solid hazardous waste which could cause significant secondary pollution due to potential possible additional release of metal ions. Therefore, the main subject is direct reutilization of spent adsorbents which can further economically and realistically offer new features, like recycling metal adsorbed, or formation of functional SiO₂-based nanocomposites. The nanoporous structure and negative surface charges enable steel slag-derived amorphous calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) to retain effectively the incoming metal ions (e. g. Au³⁺, Ag⁺, Pd²⁺, Fe³⁺, Co²⁺, Ni²⁺, Cu²⁺, Zn²⁺, Ce³⁺, Y³⁺, and Gd³⁺) by chemisorption. Sparked by natural carbonation ‘weathering’, which ultimately sequestrates atmospheric CO₂ by alkaline silicate minerals to leach calcium from mineral matrix, the decalcification reactions of metal-bearing CSH results in successful recovery of noble metals (Ag, Au, Pd) upon NaOH etching the resultant SiO₂ support. Further, SiO₂-based heterostructures, containing nanocrystalline metals (e. g. Au⁰, Ag⁰, Pd⁰, Fe⁰, Co⁰, Ni⁰, Cu⁰, and Zn⁰) or rare-earth oxides (e. g. CeO₂, Y₂O₃, and Gd₂O₃), are formed after reduction in H₂/Ar (5 vol% H₂) flow, which is also very important for the multipurpose immobilization of diverse hybrid materials on SiO₂ surface (e. g. Cu⁰-Ag⁰@SiO₂, Cu⁰-CeO₂@SiO₂, and Cu⁰-Ag⁰-CeO₂@SiO₂).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3acalcium 3acalcium silicate 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonation 3ahazardous waste 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3ananopores 3apollution 3asteel 3atoxicity 0aCalcium silicate hydrate 0aAdsorption 0aDecalcification 0aRecycle1 aWu, Junshu1 aWang, Jinshu1 aYang, Yunfei1 aZhou, Wenyuan1 aYang, Yilong1 aDu, Yucheng1 aHu, Peng1 aLi, Yongli1 aLi, Hongyi0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 622 p.1008-1019dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.04.1823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03666naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245015700174300001600331520180400347592002802151650000802179650002802187650001302215650001802228650001502246650001002261650001402271650001502285650001902300650001902319650001102338650001402349650001302363650001002376650001102386650001402397651001002411651001302421651001202434653001902446653004402465653001002509653002802519653002402547700002202571700002202593700001702615700002402632700002202656700001702678700006202695700006902757700002502826773010202851856009002953852000903043655001203052IND60532326120221119030950.0190318e20140520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053232612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.03.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJośī, Jyoti,10aVariation in Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates from a single Thai shrimp farm experiencing an outbreak of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND)  ap. 297-302.  aThe Thai Department of Fisheries (DOF), 2013 estimated that outbreaks of acute early mortality (often called early mortality syndrome or EMS) in cultivated shrimp were responsible for a 33% drop in shrimp production during the first quarter of 2013. Similar early mortality in Vietnam was ascribed to specific isolates of Vibrio parahaemolyticus that caused acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) but the status of EMS/AHPND in Thailand was unclear. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of bacteria isolated from the hepatopancreas (HP) of shrimp collected from an early mortality outbreak farm in Thailand. Four independent bacterial isolates were identified as V. parahaemolyticus by BLAST analysis and by gene-specific marker detection of a lecithin dependent hemolysin (LDH) considered to be specific for the species. Immersion challenges with 3 of these and a reference isolate, obtained from China in 2010, using a previously published laboratory infection model caused very high mortality accompanied by characteristic AHPND histopathology in the shrimp HP. Tests with one of these isolates (5HP) revealed that rate of mortality was dose dependent. Using the same challenge protocol, the 4th isolate (2HP) also caused high mortality, but it was not accompanied by AHPND histopathology. Instead, it caused a different histopathology of the HP including collapsed epithelia and unique vacuolization of embryonic cells (E-cells). These results revealed the possibility of diversity in isolates of V. parahaemolyticus that may cause early mortality in shrimp cultivation ponds. Genomic and episomic DNA of these isolates and isolates of V. parahaemolyticus that cause no disease need to be compared to better understand the molecular basis of bacterial virulence in AHPND.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3abacteria 3adose response 3aepithelium 3afarms 3afisheries 3ahemolysins 3ahepatopancreas 3ahistopathology 3amodels 3amortality 3anecrosis 3aponds 3ashrimp 3avirulence 3aChina 3aThailand 3aVietnam 0aPenaeid shrimp 0aAcute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease 0aAHPND 0aVibrio parahaemolyticus 0aVirulence variation1 aSrisala, Jiraporn1 aTruong, Viet Hong1 aChen, I-Tung1 aNuangsaeng, Bunlung1 aSuthienkul, Orasa1 aLo, Chu Fang1 aFlegel, Timothy W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1913-213X1 aSritunyalucksana, Kallaya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8967-15881 aThitamadee, Siripong0 tAquaculture.g2014 May 20, v. 428-429 p.297-302dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.03.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245007800179300001400257520097900271592002801250650001601278650001101294650001801305650002201323650002201345650000901367650001201376650001401388650001801402650002101420650001201441650002201453650001801475650001501493650001401508650001101522650001201533653002201545653001201567653002101579653001501600653001401615700002201629700002301651700002501674700002401699700002701723773011101750856008201861852000901943655001201952IND60553898320221121035315.0170713e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055389832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2014.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapiotti, Katiucia Marques10aPersistent impaired glucose metabolism in a zebrafish hyperglycemia model  ap. 58-65.  aDiabetes mellitus (DM) affects over 10% of the world's population.

In this paper, hyperglycemic zebrafish, when immersed in a 111mM glucose solution for 14days, developed increased glycation of proteins from the eyes, decreased mRNA levels of insulin receptors in the muscle, and a reversion of high blood glucose level after treatment with anti-diabetic drugs (glimepiride and metformin) even after 7days of glucose withdrawal. Additionally, hyperglycemic zebrafish developed an impaired response to exogenous insulin, which was recovered after 7days of glucose withdrawal. These data suggest that the exposure of adult zebrafish to high glucose concentration is able to induce persistent metabolic changes probably underlined by a hyperinsulinemic state and impaired peripheral glucose metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3ablood glucose 3adiabetes mellitus 3adisease diagnosis 3aeyes 3aglucose 3aglycation 3ahyperglycemia 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin receptors 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3ametformin 3amodels 3amuscles 0aDiabetes mellitus 0aGlucose 0aInsulin receptor 0aMetabolism 0aZebrafish1 aAntonioli, Régis1 aKist, Luiza Wilges1 aBogo, Maurício Reis1 aBonan, Carla Denise1 aDa Silva, Rosane Souza0 tComparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Part B.g2014 May, v. 171 p.58-65dElsevier Inc.x1096-49597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2014.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013800168300001800306520110300324592002801427596007301455650001501528650002201543650001601565650002101581650001601602650001401618650002201632650002801654650001001682650001901692650002501711650002501736650002101761700003301782700002701815700002801842700002701870773011101897856008302008852000902091655001202100IND60767654320221119075852.0220220e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076765432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-021-04360-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorba, Pedro B.10aBacterial nanocellulose containing diethylditiocarbamate bio-curatives: physicochemical characterization and drug delivery evaluation  ap. 1557-1565.  aBacterial nanocellulose (BNC) is a natural biopolymer produced by different strains of acetic acid bacteria. Biocompatibility, lack of immunogenicity, mechanical strength and crystallinity make BNC a highly applicable product for drug delivery and wound dressing. Previously, we demonstrated that diethylditiocarbamate (DETC), a Superoxide Dismutase 1 inhibitor, incorporated into BNC bio-curatives was effective for treating Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) lesions, a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania. We herein investigated the interactions between DETC and BNC. For this purpose, DETC was incorporated into BNC and thermal analysis, x-ray diffraction and Scanning electron microscopy were performed. Furthermore, in vitro DETC release and stability tests as well as degradation studies were also performed. Our results show that DETC is well incorporated into BNC, however it is short lived as suggested by degradation experiments. Future use of BNC DETC-based bio-curatives for the treatment of CL shall require further development in order to increase stability of DETC in the bio-curative.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aLeishmania 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetic acid 3abiocompatibility 3abiopolymers 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3acutaneous leishmaniasis 3adrugs 3aimmunogenicity 3astrength (mechanics) 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athermal analysis1 aMeneguin, Andréia Bagliotti1 aSilva, Jhonatan Miguel1 ada Silva Barud, Hernane1 ade Oliveira, Camila I.0 tCellulose.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 3 p.1557-1565dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-021-04360-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03581naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005500139245015200194300001600346500002000362520198200382592002802364596006702392596002902459650002002488650001402508650002602522650003602548650002602584650001602610650000902626650001702635651001502652700005602667700005302723700005402776700005502830700005502885773013702940856007303077852000903150655001203159IND60749414320221118001338.0210903e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074941432DNAL7 a10.1111/avj.130932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalnins, NJ1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4437-095710aTreatment of moderate grade dog bite wounds using amoxicillin–clavulanic acid with and without enrofloxacin: a randomised non‐inferiority trial  ap. 369-377.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Dog‐to‐dog bite wounds are a common veterinary emergency presentation: despite this, there is insufficient information to guide veterinarians on appropriate empirical antimicrobial management. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the effectiveness of amoxicillin–clavulanic acid with and without enrofloxacin in the treatment of moderate grade dog bite wounds (DBW). To describe common pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a single‐centre parallel group pragmatic trial, 50 dogs presenting with moderate grade DBW were prospectively randomised to receive amoxicillin–clavulanic acid (group A) or amoxicillin–clavulanic acid and enrofloxacin (group B). Swabs were taken for culture and susceptibility testing at admission. Stabilisation, wound care and surgical debridement were performed at the discretion of admitting clinicians. The primary outcome was complication due to infection at 10 days, with Bayesian inference used to estimate the difference in proportions between treatment groups. RESULTS: Of the 24 dogs in treatment group A, 1 required the addition of enrofloxacin at re‐examination. None of the 26 dogs in group B required alteration of antimicrobial coverage. The difference in complication rate due to infection between treatment groups was 4.2%. Twenty‐one different organisms were identified: Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Neisseria spp., Pasteurella multocida and P. canis were the most common. Over 90% of gram‐negative and gram‐positive isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin–clavulanic acid. Ninety‐six percent of gram‐negative and 86% of gram‐positive isolates were susceptible to enrofloxacin. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Amoxicillin–clavulanic acid is an appropriate empirical antimicrobial choice for moderate DBW in South East Queensland. Reduced empirical enrofloxacin use will promote antimicrobial stewardship and potentially antimicrobial resistance.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe University of Queensland's John and Mary Kibble Trust Fund  cUniversity of Queensland 3aBayesian theory 3aNeisseria 3aPasteurella multocida 3aStaphylococcus pseudintermedius 3aantibiotic resistance 3adebridement 3adogs 3aenrofloxacin 3aQueensland1 aHaworth, M.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3387-99821 aCroton, C1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2179-69791 aGibson, JS1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2202-80821 aStewart, AJ1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2464-39541 aPurcell, SL1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2228-86100 tAustralian veterinary journal.g2021 Sept., v. 99, no. 9 p.369-377dWiley Publishing Asia Pty LtdwJournal:jnl45498x0005-04237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avj.130933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010100164300001600265520119000281592002801471650001101499650001001510650001201520650001101532650001801543650001201561650001501573653001101588653002101599653001801620653002001638653001601658700001801674700001601692700001501708700001701723700001401740773010101754856008501855852000901940655001201949IND60687281020221120054525.0210212e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068728102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.03.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Dong10aFlow mechanisms and solid flow rate prediction of powders discharged from hoppers with an insert  ap. 277-284.  aIn this paper, lignite and glass beads with different particle size were selected as experimental materials. These powder materials were discharged from hoppers in the situations of without insert (NoIn), with confined insert (ConIn) and with unconfined insert (Ucon-In), respectively. The discharge processes were first discussed in detail and consequently, the solid flow rate of powders was obtained and analyzed. The flow zones in hoppers were divided based on the radial flow model of powder flow and the effects of inserts on the flow zone evolution were revealed. Experimental results show that both confined and unconfined inserts are beneficial to the increase of the solid flow rate, especially for the weaker flowability powders. The lignite, with the worst flowability, shows the largest increment of solid flow rate giving a value of 58% under ConIn. Considering characteristics of the inserted hopper structure as well as the development of flow zones, a modified model derived from the minimum energy theory was developed. The model was able to predict the solid flow rate through both the traditional hoppers and the inserted hoppers, with the deviation below than 10%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aglass 3alignite 3amodels 3aparticle size 3apowders 3aprediction 0aInsert 0aHopper discharge 0aFlow behavior 0aSolid flow rate 0aPowder flow1 aLü, Haifeng,1 aCao, Jiakun1 aWu, Yuting1 aGuo, Xiaolei1 aGong Xin,0 tPowder technology.g2020 May 01, v. 367 p.277-284dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.03.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008700175300001600262500001400278520124700292536012501539592002801664596007801692596004201770596002301812650002701835650001401862650001201876650001001888653002301898653002801921653001301949653002001962653001401982700002101996773012602017856008502143852000902228655001202237IND60694470820221120171917.0200513e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069447082DNAL7 a10.1080/1828051X.2016.12707812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantilli, Francesco10aEffect of perches on morphology, welfare and behaviour of captive reared pheasants  ap. 317-320.  aNAL-light  aThis study investigated the effect of providing elevated perches in growing pens on the morphology and behaviour of young pheasants. Pheasants reared with perches from one week old were observed roosting off the ground significantly more frequently when moved into a pen containing trees at five weeks old than pheasants reared without perches (roosting pheasants: 24.3% vs. 6.7%; p < .01). The presence of perches reduced the level of plumage damage caused by feather pecking (damage scores: 2.3% vs. 2.1%; p < .05). Pheasants reared in huts with perching were larger overall than those from control huts, in particular were heavier (weights: 356.9 g vs. 345.2 g) and had longer and thicker tarsi than control pheasants (60.61 mm vs. 59.35 mm and 4.715–6.571 mm vs. 4.705–6.412 mm, respectively). Since roosting on tree branches is an important anti-predator behaviour, providing perches at an early stage of life in the captive rearing environment may be helpful in order to improve survival of the captive reared pheasant after release in the wild. Furthermore, the study suggests that a simple and easy husbandry technique, providing elevated perches, may improve the welfare and fitness of farm-reared game birds.  aThe study was funded by Confederazione Cacciatori Toscana, Ambito Territoriale di Caccia Livorno and University of Pisa.  aPublisher supplied data  cConfederazione Cacciatori Toscana e Ambito Territoriale di Caccia Livorno  cAmbito Territoriale di Caccia Livorno  cUniversity of Pisa 3aantipredatory behavior 3apheasants 3aplumage 3atrees 0aGame-birds rearing 0aanti-predator behaviour 0aroosting 0afeather pecking 0areleasing1 aBagliacca, Marco0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 16, no. 2 p.317-320dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2016.12707813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245017300166300001800339500001900357520136100376592002801737650001201765650001301777650001501790650002601805650001701831650001601848650001101864650000701875650001301882650001501895650001201910650001301922651001901935700005801954773013902012856007902151852000902230655001202239IND60688076820221120024812.0200407e20200313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068807682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b064712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoyte, Rachel M.10aFactors Controlling the Risks of Co-occurrence of the Redox-Sensitive Elements of Arsenic, Chromium, Vanadium, and Uranium in Groundwater from the Eastern United States  ap. 4367-4375.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe co-occurrence of contaminants in drinking water may pose enhanced risks to health beyond the effects of single contaminants. Here, we investigated the co-occurrence of four health-relevant redox-sensitive elements (U, As, V, and Cr) in 1494 groundwater wells across North Carolina. The highest concentrations of these elements were measured mostly in groundwater from fractured igneous and metamorphic formations throughout the Piedmont region. Arsenic occurred most frequently in suboxic to mixed redox character groundwater, whereas U, V, and Cr occurred mostly in oxic groundwater. Occurrences of As, and to a lesser extent U, increased with pH, likely reflecting desorption, while higher Cr and V levels were measured in near-neutral pH and oxic groundwater, reflecting greater sensitivity to redox conditions. Due to similar geochemistry, V and Cr co-occurred most frequently. Concentrations of V and Cr(VI) co-exceeded health recommendations from the NC Department of Health and Human Services in up to 84% of wells from the King’s Mountain Belt and the Charlotte and Milton Belts of the Piedmont region. This study highlights the large gap between health recommendations and enforceable regulations and demonstrates a degree of co-occurrence between redox-sensitive elements, which may pose additional risks to groundwater-reliant individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3achromium 3adesorption 3aenvironmental science 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3apH 3apiedmont 3atechnology 3auranium 3avanadium 3aNorth Carolina1 aVengosh, Avner1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8928-01570 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Mar. 13, v. 54, no. 7 p.4367-4375dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b064713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245008400166300001800250520131600268592002801584650001401612650002701626650002401653650002401677650002901701650001401730650002101744650000901765650001601774650001101790650003201801650001101833650002001844650001001864650002201874650001001896651001301906653001701919653001701936653001301953653002501966700002501991700001802016700002102034700001902055700001802074700001902092700002202111700001802133700001702151773015302168856007702321852000902398655001202407IND60759964120221119131058.0211216e20211119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075996412DNAL7 a10.11158/saa.26.12.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamīl, Muḥammad,10aIdentification of tick species infesting livestock in Dera Ismail Khan Pakistan  ap. 2247-2252.  aTicks are blood-feeding obligate ectoparasites that belong to order Arachnida with three main families (Ixodidae, Argasidae, and Nuttalleillidae). Ticks transmit viral, bacterial, and zoonotic diseases in humans, and animals (wild and domestic). Ticks directly and indirectly affect the livestock industry which plays an important role in the rural economy of Pakistan. These are the main source of income and a source of food for poor people. The current study was conducted to identify the tick species infesting livestock in Dera Ismail Khan Pakistan. For this purpose, different farms were randomly visited and 130 ticks were collected from 200 scanned animals. The collected ticks were identified to species level using morphological keys. In the current study, four tick species were identified as Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Hyalomma marginatum, Hyalomma anatolicum, and Dermacentor marginatus were identified. The most dominant species were Hy. anatolicum (35.39%) followed by R. sanguineus (30.00%), Hy. marginatum (23.85%) and D. marginatus (10.77%). Hy. anatolicum was the predominant tick species and accounted for 35.39% of the ticks. Tick infestation was highest in buffaloes followed by cows, sheep, and goats. Tail and ear were the most preferable sites for tick infestation than other body parts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgasidae 3aDermacentor marginatus 3aHyalomma anatolicum 3aHyalomma marginatum 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3aacarology 3adominant species 3aears 3ahematophagy 3aincome 3alivestock and meat industry 3apeople 3arural economics 3asheep 3atick infestations 3aticks 3aPakistan 0aSurveillance 0aTick species 0aHyalomma 0aDomesticated animals1 aKāshif, Muḥammad,1 aHabibullah, .1 aMubeen, Muhammad1 aJelani, Ghulam1 aUllah, Naimat1 aTariq, Ambrina1 aRasheed, Muhammad1 aHussain, Abid1 aAli, Mubarik0 tSystematic and applied acarology.g2021 Nov. 19, v. 26, no. 12 p.2247-2252dSystematic and Applied Acarology SocietywJournal:23061x1362-19717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.11158/saa.26.12.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011100167300001800278520104700296592002801343596008901371650001601460650001201476650001401488650002201502650001401524650003301538650001901571650001401590650001901604700001401623700001801637700001701655700001601672700005701688773011101745856008301856852000901939655001201948IND60767654620221119080634.0220220e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076765462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-021-04397-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Chaochao10aHighly acetylated lignocellulose prepared by alkaline extrusion pretreatment assisted acetylation reaction  ap. 1487-1500.  aGreen and renewable cellulosic materials are considered promising candidates for replacing conventional petroleum-based plastics. Herein, alkaline extrusion pretreatment (AEP) assisted with acetylation was applied to prepare a thermoplastic material with a high degree of acetylation (52.2%) and directly from lignocellulose biomass. AEP, utilized as an innovative and industrial process, can efficiently swell lignocellulose fibres, destroy their structure, and promote the accessibility of lignocellulose. To explore the mechanism of the AEP process on the transformation of lignocellulose polymorphism, the compositions and crystalline structure of all samples were characterized and analysed. The obtained acetylated lignocellulose possesses great thermal and thermoplastic properties (low glass transition temperature of 135 °C). In general, the proposed industrially-viable approach in this work is conducive to developing a highly acetylated lignocellulose material via high-value utilization of the whole lignocellulose composition.  aPublisher supplied data  aSJCX18-0320cPostgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province 3aacetylation 3abiomass 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3aextrusion 3aglass transition temperature 3alignocellulose 3apetroleum 3athermoplastics1 aYan, Ming1 aHuang, Xingyu1 aZhong, Yidan1 aLu, Hailong1 aZhou, Xiaofan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7028-69430 tCellulose.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 3 p.1487-1500dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-021-04397-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01504naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013600161300001800297520042400315592002800739650001800767650001200785650001800797650002200815650001300837700001900850700002500869700001800894700001900912700001900931773013300950856007401083852000901157655001201166IND60644465420221122082820.0190516e20190514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064446542DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc02418b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Michael S.10aReduction of 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene by a molecular calcium hydride: an even electron polarised insertion/deprotonation mechanism  ap. 5732-5735.  aReaction of a dimeric β-diketiminato calcium hydride with 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene enables two electron aromatisation of the [8]annulene to provide an inverse sandwich dicalcium cyclooctatetraenyl derivative.

On the other hand, multifaceted effects of phytochemicals, such as triterpene saponins, on cancer cells have been suggested. A promising safety and tolerability profile indicate their possible application in the treatment of advanced prostate cancers. We analyzed the specificity, selectivity and versatility of desglucoanagalloside B effects on human prostate cancer cells derived from prostate cancer metastases to brain (DU-145 cells) and bone (PC-3 cells). Prominent growth arrest and apoptotic response of both cell types was observed in the presence of sub-micromolar desglucoanagalloside B concentrations. This was accompanied by cytochrome c release and caspase 3/7 activation. A relatively low cytostatic and pro-apoptotic response of cancer cells to a desglucoanagalloside B analog, anagallosaponin IV, illustrated the specificity of the effects of desglucoanagalloside B, whereas the low sensitivity of normal prostate PNT2 cells to desglucoanagalloside B showed the selectivity of its action. Inhibition of cancer cell motility was observed in the presence of both saponins, however only desglucoanagalloside B attenuated cancer cell invasive potential, predominantly through an effect on cell elastic properties. These data demonstrate the versatility of its effects on prostate cancer cells. In contrast to PNT2 cells, cancer cells tested in this study were relatively resistant to mitoxantrone. The multifaceted action of desglucoanagalloside B on basic cellular traits, crucial for prostate cancer progression, opens perspectives for elaboration of combined palliative therapies and new prostate cancer prophylaxis regimens.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3atriterpenoid saponins 3acell movement 3acaspases 3ahumans 3aphytochemicals 3aLysimachia 3adisease control 3ametastasis 3acytochrome c 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aapoptosis 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aCell Differentiationxdrug effects 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Screening Assays, Antitumor 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMolecular Structure 2aNeoplasm Invasivenessxpathology 2aPrimulaceaexchemistry 2aProstatic Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aTumor Cells, Cultured 0agrowth arrest1 aPodolak, Irma1 aSkrzeczyńska-Moncznik, Joanna1 aSarna, Michał1 aWójcik, Katarzyna Anna1 aRyszawy, Damian1 aGalanty, Agnieszka1 aLasota, Sławomir1 aMadeja, Zbigniew1 aCzyż, Jarosław1 aMichalik, Marta0 tChemico-biological interactions.g2013 Oct. 25, v. 206, no. 1 p.6-17dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-27977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2013.08.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245010400206300001800310500001900328520147900347592002801826650002401854650001701878650001801895650003101913650001001944650002601954650001401980650001301994650001902007650001502026700001902041700005502060700001902115700001702134700005702151773013902208856007902347852000902426655001202435IND60688077020221120024854.0200407e20200228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068807702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b066072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEwald, Jessica D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7555-736X10aEcoToxModules: Custom Gene Sets to Organize and Analyze Toxicogenomics Data from Ecological Species  ap. 4376-4387.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTraditional results from toxicogenomics studies are complex lists of significantly impacted genes or gene sets, which are challenging to synthesize down to actionable results with a clear interpretation. Here, we defined two sets of 21 custom gene sets, called the functional and statistical EcoToxModules, in fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) to (1) re-cast predefined molecular pathways into a toxicological framework and (2) provide a data-driven, unsupervised grouping of genes impacted by exposure to environmental contaminants. The functional EcoToxModules were identified by re-organizing KEGG pathways into biological processes that are more relevant to ecotoxicology based on the input from expert scientists and regulators. The statistical EcoToxModules were identified using co-expression analysis of publicly available microarray data (n = 303 profiles) measured in livers of fathead minnows after exposure to 38 different conditions. Potential applications of the EcoToxModules were demonstrated with two case studies that represent exposure to a pure chemical and to environmental wastewater samples. In comparisons to differential expression and gene set analysis, we found that EcoToxModule responses were consistent with these traditional results. Additionally, they were easier to visualize and quantitatively compare across different conditions, which facilitated drawing conclusions about the relative toxicity of the exposures within each case study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPimephales promelas 3acase studies 3aecotoxicology 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3apollution 3atoxicity 3atoxicogenomics 3awastewater1 aSoufan, Othman1 aCrump, Doug1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2915-49891 aHecker, Markus1 aXia, Jianguo1 aBasu, Niladri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2695-10370 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Feb. 28, v. 54, no. 7 p.4376-4387dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b066073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245023500164300001400399520101900413592002801432650001601460650002601476650001301502650001401515650001101529650001101540650001501551650002101566650001301587650001601600650001901616650001201635653001501647653001401662653001201676653002901688653001501717653001701732700001801749700002001767700002301787700002701810773008601837856008101923852000902004655001202013IND60561033120221119160940.0170713e20170310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056103312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2016.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumari, Alka10aIsobaric phase equilibrium of morpholine+1-decanol, volumetric properties and molar refractivity from 293.15 to 333.15K of morpholine+1-decanol and 1-octanol+toluene system with applications of Prigogine–Flory–Patterson theory  ap. 41-53.  aMorpholine, having its applications in process industries is also used as an anticancer agent as well as a building block in the preparation of linezolid antibiotic. 1-decanol can be used as a suitable solvent for recovery of morpholine from its aqueous stream.

Our contribution investigates the environmental impacts, in terms of methane and nitrous oxide emissions, of animal-based policies supported by the European Union. We examine factors affecting the adoption and the magnitude of related budget of Measure 215&mdash;animal welfare&mdash;of Rural Development Programmes 2007&ndash;2013. Our focus is cattle farming in Italy. The results highlight that the problem of animal welfare is highly perceived in regions with greater livestock intensity, also where GHG emissions are relevant. Given the adoption of measure 215, more budget tends to be allocated in regions where livestock units are particularly high. In addition, from the analysis emerges the bargaining position of regions with a higher propensity to the agricultural sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aanimal welfare 3acattle 3aenvironmental impact 3afarming systems 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3alivestock and meat industry 3amethane 3anitrous oxide 3arural development 3asocial sustainability 3aItaly1 aLamonaca, Emilia 1 aTappi, Marco 1 aDi Gioia, Leonardo 0 tSustainability.g2019 Apr. 17, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110823163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02085naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009000167300001600257520095800273592002801231650001501259650002801274650001401302650001101316650001801327650001401345653001601359653002301375653002001398653003201418700001801450700001201468700001101480700001301491773010101504856008501605852000901690655001201699IND60687281420221120045428.0210212e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068728142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.03.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guang10aExperimental study on the two-phase flow of gas-particles through a model brake valve  ap. 172-182.  aTwo-phase flows of gas and particles are often encountered in the transport system of pipelines in various industrial applications. A brake valve is usually employed to control the transport process of two-phase flows. In case fine solid particles collide with the valve system or the wall surface of pipeline, surface erosion occurs, which affects the performance of the valve as well as its durability, leading to the deterioration of the efficiency of transport system. In the present study, experimental study has been made for the purpose of optimization of the brake valve under the two-phase flow of gas and particles. A model brake valve has been fabricated and its valve opening degree, the particle diameter, and the particle mass flow rate were varied to investigate the particle-gas flows through the valve and the resulting erosion characteristics. Particle accumulation layers along wall surface were also observed and discussed in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3adurability 3aindustrial applications 3amass flow 3amodels 3aparticle size 3apipelines 0aBrake valve 0aParticle-gas flows 0aSurface erosion 0aParticle accumulation layer1 aZhang, Yi Fan1 aLiu, Qi1 aLi, Yi1 aLin, Zhe0 tPowder technology.g2020 May 01, v. 367 p.172-182dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.03.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01466naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013100167300001600298520040000314592002800714650001800742650001500760650001400775650001600789650001600805653001600821653001500837653001500852653003400867700002100901700002600922773007800948856008101026852000901107655001201116IND60519864920221118062759.0160511e20100812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051986492DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-010-0097-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalina, Radovan10aDevelopmental rates of the aphid Aphis pomi (Aphidoidea: Aphididae) and its parasitoid Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae)  ap. 899-902.  aDevelopmental rates of the aphid Aphis pomi and its parasitoid Aphidius ervi were compared at four constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30°C).

Our previous work showed an inhibitory effect of alcohol on hepatocyte proliferation. However, the effect of alcohol on hepatocyte differentiation has not yet been precisely characterized. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of alcohol on hepatocyte differentiation in relationship with changes of iron metabolism in HepaRG cells. This unique bipotent human cell line can differentiate into hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells, paralleling liver development. Results showed that alcohol reduced cell viability, total protein level and enhanced hepatic enzymes leakage in differentiated HepaRG cells. Moreover, it caused cell enlargement, decreased number of hepatocyte and expression of C/EBPα as well as bile canaliculi F-actin. Alcohol increased expression of hepatic cell-specific markers and alcohol-metabolizing enzymes (ADH2, CYP2E1). This was associated with a lipid peroxidation and an iron excess expressed by an increase in total iron content, ferritin level, iron uptake as well as an overexpression of genes involved in iron transport and storage. Alcohol-induced hepatoxicity was amplified by exogenous iron via exceeding iron overload. Taken together, our data demonstrate that in differentiated hepatocytes, alcohol reduces proliferation while increasing expression of hepatic cell-specific markers. Moreover, iron overload could be one of the underlying mechanisms of effect of alcohol on the whole differentiation process of hepatocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aalcohols 3abile 3acell growth 3acell viability 3aenzymes 3aepithelial cells 3aferritin 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3airon 3airon overload 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3ametabolism 2aActinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAlcohol Dehydrogenasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alphaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Differentiationxdrug effects 2aCell Line 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP2E1xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEthanolxtoxicity 2aFerritinsxmetabolism 2aHepatocytesxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aIronxmetabolism 2aLipid Peroxidation1 aGaboriau, François1 aCannie, Isabelle1 aBatusanski, Florence1 aRopert, Martine1 aMoirand, Romain1 aBrissot, Pierre1 aLoreal, Olivier1 aLescoat, Gérard0 tChemico-biological interactions.g2013 Nov. 25, v. 206, no. 2 p.117-125dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-27977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2013.08.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245007500187300001600262520163200278592002801910650001501938650001301953650002201966650001501988650001302003650001702016650001402033651001002047651000902057773010802066856004802174852000902222655001202231IND4487689520221123032143.0120815e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448768952DNAL7 a217018682pmid7 a10.1007/s10739-011-9286-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCassata, Francesco14aThe Italian Communist Party and the “Lysenko Affair” (1948–1955)  ap. 469-498.  aThis article explores the impact of the VASKhNIL conference upon the cultural policy of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and Italian communist biology, with particular attention to the period between 1948 and 1951. News of the Moscow session did not appear in the Italian news media until October, 1948, and for the next three years party biologists struggled over whether to translate the official transcript of the proceedings, The Situation in Biological Science, into Italian. This struggle reveals the complex efforts of the PCI to confirm the ideological and political connection with the Soviet Union, without completely alienating significant milieus of the democratic and antifascist culture in Italy. The apparent impossibility of doing both is indicated by the fact that the project was finally abandoned in March–April, 1951. The article is divided into three sections, each focused on different actors and their response to Lysenkoism. The first section outlines the features of the PCI’s pro-Lysenko campaign, with particular regard to the intellectual militancy and organizational commitment of Emilio Sereni, head of PCI’s Cultural Commission between 1948 and 1951. The second section analyzes the reaction of the three most important figures in Italian communist biology during this period, Massimiliano Aloisi, Franco Graziosi and Emanuele Padoa. The third section interprets the decision not to publish a translation of The Situation in Biological Science as a consequence of the conflicts between PCI cultural program and the editorial policy of the left-wing publishing house Giulio Einaudi Editore.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiologists 3agenetics 3aissues and policy 3anews media 3apolitics 3apublications 3asocialism 3aItaly 3aUSSR0 tJournal of the history of biology.g2012 Aug., v. 45, no. 3 p.469-498dSpringer-Verlagx0022-50107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10739-011-9286-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03532naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245007200165300001600237520159800253536012201851592002801973650001202001650002902013650002202042650002102064650001402085650001302099650001202112650001402124650001102138650001802149650001702167650001002184650001902194650001402213650001402227650001602241650002502257650001302282650001202295650001002307650001302317650001702330650003002347650001502377650001002392653002902402653001502431653001102446653001102457653002902468653001002497700001402507700001502521700001502536700001702551700002002568700001602588700001902604700001602623773010602639856008002745852000902825655001202834IND60615025620221120153331.0181003e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061502562DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858166889452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro, M.

The trematode Fasciola hepatica has been commonly reported as the main predisposing factor that triggers this condition. The authors evaluated 20 naturally occurring cases of bovine BH to characterize the pathology and pathogenesis of the disease. Grossly, the most consistent finding was a large, frequently single focus of necrosis surrounded by a red to purple halo, observed most frequently on the parietal surface of the right and left hepatic lobes. Other findings were jaundice, dark-brown discoloration of kidneys, and red urine in the urinary bladder. Microscopically, characteristic lesions were locally extensive, necrotizing hepatitis with thrombosis and numerous intralesional Gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria, and acute renal tubular necrosis. By immunohistochemistry, many hepatocytes outside the necrotic focus in the liver were positive for activated caspase 3, suggesting that those cells were undergoing apoptosis. Ultrastructural evaluation revealed hepatocyte necrosis, hemolysis, and clumps of vegetative and sporulating bacilli within the liver. Polymerase chain reaction for the C. haemolyticum beta toxin gene was positive in randomly selected liver samples. No gross or microscopic lesions indicative of fascioliasis were detected in the liver of any animal, suggesting that other yet undetermined predisposing factors were associated with these cases of BH.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacilli 3aClostridium haemolyticum 3aFasciola hepatica 3aanimal pathology 3aapoptosis 3abacteria 3abladder 3acaspase-3 3acattle 3adiscoloration 3afascioliasis 3agenes 3ahemoglobinuria 3ahemolysis 3ahepatitis 3ahepatocytes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ajaundice 3akidneys 3aliver 3anecrosis 3apathogenesis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3athrombosis 3aurine 0abacillary hemoglobinuria 0abeta toxin 0abovine 0acattle 0aClostridium haemolyticum 0aliver1 aDutra, F.1 aBriano, C.1 aRomero, A.1 aPersiani, M.1 aFreedman, J.

The evolution of these species and the results of the characterization (nitrogen physisorption, temperature-programmed oxidation, and catalyst leaching) of catalysts samples taken in a continuous reactor at different temperatures (523, 623, and 723K) and times on stream allow to determine that two concomitant deactivation causes are present in this reaction: the strong adsorption of dimers and trimers on the catalyst surface (especially important at the lowest temperature) and the formation of heavy condensation products physically deposited on the catalyst surface (more relevant at the highest temperature).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetone 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3aleaching 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxides 3atemperature 0aDRIFT 0aIsophorones 0aMesitylene 0aMixed oxides 0aBase catalysis1 aFaba, Laura1 aDiaz, Eva,1 aBennici, Simona1 aAuroux, A.q(Aline),1 aOrdóñez, Salvador,0 tJournal of catalysis.g2015 Sept., v. 329 p.1-9dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2015.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01602naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245004600166300001800212520075900230592002800989650002201017650001601039650002201055650001701077650001501094773012701109856007901236852000901315655001201324IND60312947220221119225009.0150714e20141219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031294722DNAL7 a10.1126/science.aaa27212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLupas, Andrei N.10aWhat I cannot create, I do not understand  ap. 1455-1456.  aLife today depends on the chemical activity of proteins. Scientists have attempted for decades to understand their intricate structures and diverse chemical activities and to emulate their properties by design. However, designing structured polypeptide chains—a prerequisite for creating functional proteins—has proven extremely challenging. Recent years have seen progress in the design of folded proteins in aqueous solution (1) and of proteins that are catalytically active (2), but the design of membrane proteins remains in its infancy (3). A landmark study by Joh et al. on page 1520 of this issue (4) meets two major challenges in the quest to engineer new proteins: the design of a folded membrane protein that performs a biomimetic function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abiomimetics 3amembrane proteins 3apolypeptides 3ascientists0 tScience.g2014 Dec. 19, v. 346, no. 6216 p.1455-1456dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa27213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245006900164300001600233520099300249592002801242650000901270650001501279650001801294650000901312650001701321650002301338650001601361650002401377653002201401653001101423653003201434653003301466653002601499700001701525700001801542700001301560700001801573700001601591773010101607856008501708852000901793655001201802IND60687281620221120045359.0210212e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068728162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.03.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yan10aSuppression of polyethylene dust explosion by sodium bicarbonate  ap. 206-212.  aSodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) was used to suppress the explosion of polyethylene (PE) dust. The maximum explosion pressure, flame propagation behaviour, and the minimum ignition temperature of PE dust mixed with NaHCO₃ powder were measured, aiming to evaluate the suppression effect of NaHCO₃ on PE dust explosion. The results showed that NaHCO₃ powder can effectively suppress PE dust explosions and the suppression effect increases gradually as the inert ratio increases. PE dust explosions can be suppressed by NaHCO₃ through physical and chemical mechanisms. From the physical aspect, the thermal decomposition of NaHCO₃ particles can effectively absorb heat from the flame front of PE dust. From the chemical aspect, the Na-containing species generated can effectively react with and scavenge the radicals in the PE flame, especially the O radical. Both the rate of chain reaction and the rate of heat release are then decreased, leading to an effective suppression effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3adust 3aexplosions 3afree radicals 3aheat 3apolyethylene 3asodium bicarbonate 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 0aPE dust explosion 0aNaHCO3 0aFlame propagation behaviour 0aMinimum ignition temperature 0aSuppression mechanism1 aLin, Chen-di1 aQi, Ying-quan1 aPei, Bei1 aWang, Lan-yun1 aJi, Wen-tao0 tPowder technology.g2020 May 01, v. 367 p.206-212dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.03.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01980naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245006600163300001600229520087300245592002801118650001801146650001701164650001101181650001301192700002301205700003201228700002301260700001801283700003601301700002001337700002201357700002601379773012901405856007501534852000901609655001201618IND60539435620170629000000.0160816e20140122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053943562DNAL7 a10.1021/ja41092092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Luciana
C.10aNontemplate Synthesis of CH3NH3PbBr3 Perovskite Nanoparticles  ap. 850-853.  aTo date, there is no example in the literature of free, nanometer-sized, organolead halide CH₃NH₃PbBr₃ perovskites. We report here the preparation of 6 nm-sized nanoparticles of this type by a simple and fast method based on the use of an ammonium bromide with a medium-sized chain that keeps the nanoparticles dispersed in a wide range of organic solvents. These nanoparticles can be maintained stable in the solid state as well as in concentrated solutions for more than three months, without requiring a mesoporous material. This makes it possible to prepare homogeneous thin films of these nanoparticles by spin-coating on a quartz substrate. Both the colloidal solution and the thin film emit light within a narrow bandwidth of the visible spectrum and with a high quantum yield (ca. 20%); this could be advantageous in the design of optoelectronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3ananoparticles 3aporous media 3aquartz 3asolvents1 aPertegás, Antonio1 aGonzález-Carrero, Soranyel1 aMalinkiewicz, Olga1 aAgouram, Said1 aMínguez

However, the mechanisms for nitrate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of Fe(II) and As(III) remain unclear. In this study, we isolated two bacterial strains from arsenic-contaminated paddy soils, Ensifer sp. ST2 and Paracoccus sp. QY30. Both strains were capable of anaerobic As(III) oxidation, but only QY30 could oxidize Fe(II) under nitrate-reducing conditions. Both strains contain the As(III) oxidase gene aioA, whose expression was induced greatly by As(III) exposure. Both strains contain the whole suite of genes for complete denitrification, but the nitrite reductase gene nirK was not expressed in QY30 and nitrite accumulated under nitrate-reducing conditions. When the functional nirK gene was knocked out in strain ST2, its nitrite reduction ability was completely abolished and nitrite accumulated in the medium. Moreover, the ST2Δⁿⁱʳᴷ mutant gained the ability to oxidize Fe(II). When nirK gene from ST2 was introduced to QY30, the recombinant strain QY30::nirK gained the ability to reduce nitrite but lost the ability to oxidize Fe(II). These genetic manipulations did not affect the ability of both strains to oxidize As(III). Our results indicate that nitrite accumulation is required for anaerobic oxidation of Fe(II) but not for As(III) oxidation in these strains. The results suggest that anaerobic Fe(II) oxidation in the two bacterial strains is primarily driven by abiotic reaction of Fe(II) with nitrite, while reduction of nitrate to nitrite is sufficient for redox coupling with anaerobic As(III) oxidation catalyzed by Aio. Deletion of nirK gene in denitrifiers can enhance anaerobic Fe(II) oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnsifer 3aarsenites 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aenvironmental science 3agenes 3airon 3amutants 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates 3anitrite reductase 3anitrites 3aoxidation 3apaddies 3aphylogeny 3atechnology1 aChai, Cheng-Wei1 aThomasArrigo, Laurel K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6758-37601 aZhao, Shi-Chen1 aKretzschmar, Ruben1 aZhao, Fang-Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0164-169X0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Mar. 04, v. 54, no. 7 p.4036-4045dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b067023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245008400198300001600282500001100298506007600309520141700385592002801802596001701830596001901847596005901866596004901925596004901974506003702023650002302060650001202083650001102095650001202106650002702118650001802145650002502163650002202188650001602210650001802226650001602244650001102260650001702271650002402288650001102312650001902323650001102342650001402353650001402367650001202381650002302393650001702416650001302433650001602446650001902462700001702481700001802498700001502516700002002531700002002551700001802571773013802589856007402727852000902801655001202810IND60686259620221207060213.0200314e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068625962DNAL7 a10.1111/jipb.127932doi7 aPMC67039822pmcid7 a307912002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Junhui10aApplication and future perspective of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in fruit crops  ap. 269-286.  aREVIEW  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFruit crops, including apple, orange, grape, banana, strawberry, watermelon, kiwifruit and tomato, not only provide essential nutrients for human life but also contribute to the major agricultural output and economic growth of many countries and regions in the world. Recent advancements in genome editing provides an unprecedented opportunity for the genetic improvement of these agronomically important fruit crops. Here, we summarize recent reports of applying CRISPR/Cas9 to fruit crops, including efforts to reduce disease susceptibility, change plant architecture or flower morphology, improve fruit quality traits, and increase fruit yield. We discuss challenges facing fruit crops as well as new improvements and platforms that could be used to facilitate genome editing in fruit crops, including dCas9‐base‐editing to introduce desirable alleles and heat treatment to increase editing efficiency. In addition, we highlight what we see as potentially revolutionary development ranging from transgene‐free genome editing to de novo domestication of wild relatives. Without doubt, we now see only the beginning of what will eventually be possible with the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit. Efforts to communicate with the public and an emphasis on the manipulation of consumer‐friendly traits will be critical to facilitate public acceptance of genetically engineered fruits with this new technology.  aPublisher supplied data  a1444987cNSF  a11889048cUSDA  cMaryland Agricultural Experiment Station Hatch Project  a201606320096cMinistry of Education of China  a201706850061cMinistry of Education of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aalleles 3aapples 3abananas 3adisease susceptibility 3adomestication 3aeconomic development 3aflower morphology 3afruit crops 3afruit quality 3afruit yield 3afruits 3agene editing 3agenetic improvement 3agrapes 3aheat treatment 3ahumans 3akiwifruit 3anutrients 3aoranges 3aplant architecture 3astrawberries 3atomatoes 3awatermelons 3awild relatives1 aLi, Dongdong1 aWang, Guoming1 aWang, Fuxi1 aKunjal, Merixia1 aJoldersma, Dirk1 aLiu, Zhongchi0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2020 Mar., v. 62, no. 3 p.269-286dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949844x1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.127933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02209naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003600149245006600185300001400251500001900265520074500284592002801029650002501057650003101082650002201113650001501135650005201150650001701202650002001219650002601239650001401265650001401279650001401293650001301307650001801320653002401338653001201362653001601374653002501390700002101415700002001436700002301456700002701479773012801506856008401634852000901718655001201727IND60715150220221122213043.0201206e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071515022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.coesh.2020.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez-Montero, Jose Vicente10aCoronavirus and other airborne agents with pandemic potential  ap. 41-48.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe recent emergence of a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has caused a pandemic, which is the most severe infectious disease outbreak in many decades.

Cleavage of APP by β-secretase produces a 99 amino acid C-terminal fragment of APP (C99) consisting of a single transmembrane (TM) helix. Simulations of C99 congeners and structural studies of C99 in surfactant micelles and lipid vesicles have shown that a key peptide structural motif is a prominent “GG kink,” centered at two glycines dividing the TM helix. The flexibility of the GG kink is important in the processing of C99 by γ-secretase. We performed multiscale simulations of C99₁₅–₅₅ in a DPC surfactant micelle and POPC lipid bilayer in order to elucidate the role of membrane surface curvature in modulating the peptide structure. C99₁₅–₅₅ in a DPC surfactant micelle possesses a “GG kink,” in the TM domain near the dynamic hinge located at G37/G38. Such a kink is not observed in C99₁₅–₅₅ in a POPC lipid bilayer. Intramolecular interaction between the extracellular and TM domains of C99₁₅–₅₅ is enhanced in the micelle environment, influencing helical stability, TM helix extension, exposure to water, and depth of insertion in the lipophilic region. Our results show that the fluctuations of the structural ensemble of APP are strongly influenced by membrane surface curvature.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamino acids 3aamyloid 3alipid bilayers 3alipids 3amicelles 3asurfactants1 aMeredith, Stephen

The NADH dehydrogenase 4 (nad4) gene encodes mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I subunit IV, but the mechanism underlying nad4 transcript splicing is unclear. Here, we report that the P‐type pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein DEFECTIVE KERNEL 43 (DEK43) is responsible for cis‐splicing of the nad4 transcript in maize. We demonstrate that DEK43 localizes to both the nucleus and mitochondria. The mutation of Dek43 resulted in embryo‐lethal and light‐colored defective kernels. Among the 22 mitochondrial group II introns, the splicing efficiency of nad4 introns 1 and 3 was reduced by up to 50% compared to the wild type. The levels of complex I and supercomplex I+III₂ were also reduced in dek43. Furthermore, in‐gel NADH dehydrogenase assays indicated that the activities of these complexes were significantly reduced in dek43. Further, the mitochondrial ultrastructure was altered in the mutant. Together, our findings indicate that DEK43, a dual‐localized PPR protein, plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial function and maize kernel development.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cNational Plant Transgenic Program  cTaishan Scholars Project  cFunds of Shandong “Double Tops” Program  cState Key Laboratory of Crop Biology 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADH dehydrogenase 3aZea mays 3acolor 3acorn 3aelectron transport chain 3aenergy 3aintrons 3amessenger RNA 3amitochondria 3amutants 3amutation 3aseed development 3aseeds 3aultrastructure1 aWang, Lili,1 aZhang, Lin1 aZhao, Ya Jie1 aWu, Jia Wen1 aWei, Yiming,1 aZhang, Xian Sheng1 aZhao, Xiang Yu0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2020 Mar., v. 62, no. 3 p.299-313dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949844x1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.128433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005300145245009500198300001800293500001900311520109900330592002801429650001501457650001501472650002001487650001301507650001501520650002001535700005801555773013901613856007901752852000901831655001201840IND60688077620221120024806.0200407e20200317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068807762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b068122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Baile1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4816-341810aSurface Functional Group Engineering of CeO₂ Particles for Enhanced Phosphate Adsorption  ap. 4601-4608.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSurface functional groups play a dominating role in determining the adsorption performance of metal oxide particles. The ability to manipulate the surface functional groups is vital in designing an effective adsorbent for water decontamination. In this study, a facile method is proposed for tuning the amount of the surface hydroxyl groups of CeO₂ particles. The volume of water added during the ethylene glycol-mediated solvothermal synthesis of CeO₂ particles can be used to adjust the amount of surface hydroxyl groups. By simple reduction in the volume of water, the number of surface hydroxyl groups of CeO₂ particles can be increased and the phosphate adsorption capacity can be greatly improved. Our results show that the obtained CeO₂ particles have high phosphate adsorption capacity at low phosphate concentrations, fast adsorption kinetics, and the ability to achieve an ultralow phosphate concentration in the real sewage effluent. This study provides an effective strategy for designing highly effective metal oxide adsorbents through surface functional group engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3adecontamination 3aethylene 3aphosphates 3asewage effluent1 aLo, Irene M.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7001-69000 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Mar. 17, v. 54, no. 7 p.4601-4608dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b068123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04150naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005300147245010000200520251200300592002802812650001502840650002302855650002802878650001902906650001102925650002002936650001602956650001102972650001102983650002402994650001903018650001503037650001203052650000903064650002503073651002103098651001503119653002103134653001503155653001603170653003203186653002103218700005903239700005403298700005703352700001803409773011403427856008203541852000903623655001203632IND60687282020221120021521.0200412e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068728202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1117822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Miae1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9805-726110aObject-based landfast sea ice detection over West Antarctica using time series ALOS PALSAR data  aLandfast sea ice (fast ice) is an important feature prevalent around the Antarctic coast, which is affected by climate change and energy exchanges with the atmosphere and ocean. This study proposed a method for detection of the West Antarctic fast ice using the Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array L-band SAR (ALOS PALSAR) images. The algorithm has combined image segmentation, image correlation analysis, and machine learning techniques (i.e., random forest (RF), extremely randomized trees (ERT), and logistic regression (LR)). We used SAR images with a baseline of 5 days that are not in the same orbit but overlap each other as overlaps between swaths in adjacent orbits are often available in the polar regions. The underlying assumption for the proposed fast ice detection algorithm is that fast ice regions in SAR images with a time interval of 5 days are highly correlated. The object-based approach proposed in this study was well suited to high-resolution SAR images in deriving spatially homogeneous fast ice regions. The image segmentation results using the optimized parameters showed a distinct difference in the backscatter temporal evolution between fast ice and pack ice regions. Correlation and STD of backscattering coefficients were found to be the most significant variables for the object-based fast ice detection from two temporally separated images. In overall, the quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrated that the algorithm was an effective approach to detect fast ice with high accuracies. The models well detected various fast ice regions in the West Antarctica but misclassified some objects. The misclassifications occurred toward the edge of fast ice regions with relatively rapid changes in backscattering between both data acquisitions. On the other hand, few fast ice objects were misclassified as uniform backscattering over time occurred by chance on very small objects far from the coast. Very old multi-year fast ice regions with high backscattered signals were also a source for some misclassifications. This may be due to the sensitivity of L-band to snow structure to some extent and a thinner ice over the region with either ice growth (no deformation) or closing (slight deformation) between both images. Heavy snow load on the ice could be another error source for some misclassification as well. The approach allowed for the reliable detection of fast ice regions by using L-band SAR images with a small local incidence angle difference.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aangle of incidence 3aartificial intelligence 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3adata collection 3adeformation 3aenergy 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asea ice 3asnow 3atime series analysis 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 0aLandfast sea ice 0aL-band SAR 0aALOS PALSAR 0aObject correlation analysis 0aMachine learning1 aKim, Hyun-Cheol1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4387-92681 aIm, Jungho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4506-68771 aLee, Sanggyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7604-11621 aHan, Hyangsun0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 June 01, v. 242 p.111782-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1117823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009300164520115300257592002801410650002301438650001301461650002201474650001501496650004001511653004601551653001001597653001701607653001501624653001401639653000801653653002701661700001901688700001501707700002101722700003001743700001501773700002301788700001601811773011801827856008201945852000902027655001202036IND60694122420221122224506.0201025e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069412242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2020.1008792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl Amin, Md.10aRecent advances in the analysis of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)—A review  aPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), that are widely used in different industrial and commercial activities, have become emerging contaminants of concern. Thus, the evaluation of PFAS presence in diverse environmental matrices is of paramount importance, leading to the necessity in development of different types of analytical methods to analyse the trace amounts of PFAS with varying selectivity and sensitivity. Analytical methods that have been advanced and employed for PFAS identification are critically described with their strengths, limitations and future potentials in this review. This review includes, (i) instrument analytical methodologies, mainly focusing on sample preparation, extraction and recovery analysis, (ii) nanoparticle-based sensors, and an app-based smartphone portable sensor, for the monitoring and sensing of PFAS in different environmental matrices. Furthermore, (iii) total oxidisable precursor assay (TOPA), content of total organic fluorine (TOF) as well as total fluorine (TF) are also reviewed, which provide fundamental tools towards achieving precursor quantification and closing mass balance analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3afluorine 3amobile telephones 3amonitoring 3aper- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 0aPer-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) 0aLC-MS 0aNanoparticle 0aSmartphone 0aTOP assay 0aTOF 0aEnvironmental matrices1 aSobhani, Zahra1 aLiu, Yanju1 aDharmaraja, Raja1 aChadalavada, Sreenivasulu1 aNaidu, R.,1 aChalker, Justin M.1 aFang, Cheng0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2020 Aug., v. 19 p.100879-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2020.1008793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245007200166500001400238520131500252592002801567650001501595650002001610650001401630650001001644650003001654650002101684651001401705651001401719651001201733651001501745653001901760653001301779653001701792653001301809653001701822653001401839700002101853700002101874700002101895773011201916856007702028852000902105655001202114IND60727407320221122125201.0210308e20200518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072740732DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.8.e510942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoyce, Elizabeth M.10aChecklist of the vascular flora of the Sunda-Sahul Convergence Zone  aNAL-light  aBackground The Sunda-Sahul Convergence Zone, defined here as the area comprising Australia, New Guinea, and Southeast Asia (Indonesia to Myanmar), straddles the Sunda and Sahul continental shelves and is one of the most biogeographically famous and important regions in the world. Floristically, it is thought to harbour a large amount of the world’s diversity. Despite the importance of the area, a checklist of the flora has never before been published. Here we present the first working checklist of vascular plants for the Sunda-Sahul Convergence Zone. The list was compiled from 24 flora volumes, online databases and unpublished plot data. Taxonomic nomenclature was updated, and each species was coded into nested biogeographic regions. The list includes 60,415 species in 5,135 genera and 363 families of vascular plants. New information This is the first species-level checklist of the region and presents an updated census of the region’s floristic biodiversity. The checklist confirms that species richness of the SSCZ is comparable to that of the Neotropics, and highlights areas in need of further documentation and taxonomic work. This checklist provides a novel dataset for studying floristic ecology and evolution in this biogeographically important region of very high global biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3adata collection 3aevolution 3aflora 3ageographical distribution 3aspecies richness 3aAustralia 3aIndonesia 3aMyanmar 3aNew Guinea 0aSoutheast Asia 0aWallacea 0abiogeography 0aexchange 0aspecies list 0adiversity1 aThiele, Kevin R.1 aSlik, Ferry J.W.1 aCrayn, Darren M.0 tBiodiversity data journal.g2020 May 18, v. 8 p.e51094-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:21364x1314-28287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.8.e510943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245007700165300001400242520140600256592002801662650001801690650001201708650001401720650001501734650002801749650000901777650001901786650001901805650002101824650000901845650002201854653002101876653001601897653001101913653002301924700002101947700002601968773009601994856007802090852000902168655001202177IND60759965020221119131025.0220104s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075996502DNAL7 a10.1139/cjb-2021-00782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsorio, Evelyn E.10aHigh temperatures disturb ovule development in field pea (Pisum sativum)  ap. 47-61.  aHigh temperatures affect reproductive growth and lead to yield loss in many crops. Field pea is heat sensitive, but little is known about the effect of high temperatures on field pea ovules. We investigated the impact of heat on ovules of flowers at various reproductive nodes of field pea using growth chambers. We exposed 6 cultivars exhibiting diverse heat tolerance to 4 days of heat (35 °C day/18 °C night) during early flowering. Post-treatment ovules and embryo sacs were assessed using clearing by light microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Results indicated that greater ovule and embryo sac development occurred on some nodes, but poor ovule and embryo sac expansion resulted on other nodes of the same heat-treated plants. Whereas advanced ovule and embryo sac development were identified on heat-tolerant cultivars, a combination of advanced and less advanced ovule and embryo sac development occurred in intermediate and heat-sensitive cultivars. More than 90% of the affected ovules displayed embryos at various stages of development, which indicated disruption around fertilization or shortly thereafter. Callose accumulation around the vascular bundle within ovules suggested disruption of assimilate transport to the embryo sac. The contrasting pattern of ovule development at different nodes implied a conflict between early aging and maternal supply of heat-treated plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPisum sativum 3acallose 3acultivars 3aembryo sac 3afluorescence microscopy 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3aheat treatment 3alight microscopy 3apeas 3athermosensitivity 0aPisum sativum L. 0aheat stress 0aovules 0areproductive nodes1 aDavis, Arthur R.1 aBueckert, Rosalind A.0 tBotany.g2022, v. 100, no. 1 p.47-61dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44657x1916-28047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2021-00783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010800157300001600265500002000281520125600301592002801557596005901585596005901644596008001703650001701783650001201800650001201812650001601824650001401840650001301854650002101867650001901888650002801907650000901935650001301944650002301957650000901980700001701989700001802006700001402024700002002038700002002058700001602078700001502094700001702109700001802126700001502144700001502159700001602174773013802190856007402328852000902402655001202411IND60686260120221116175536.0200314e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068626012DNAL7 a10.1111/jipb.129092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chaolei10aDevelopment of nutritious rice with high zinc/selenium and low cadmium in grains through QTL pyramiding  ap. 349-359.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEnriching zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se) levels, while reducing cadmium (Cd) concentration in rice grains is of great benefit for human diet and health. Large natural variations in grain Zn, Se, and Cd concentrations in different rice accessions enable Zn/Se‐biofortification and Cd‐minimization through molecular breeding. Here, we report the development of new elite varieties by pyramiding major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that significantly contribute to high Zn/Se and low Cd accumulation in grains. A chromosome segment substitution line CSSLᴳCC⁷ with the PA64s‐derived GCC7 allele in the 93‐11 background, exhibited steadily higher Mn and lower Cd concentrations in grains than those of 93‐11. This elite chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL) was used as the core breeding material to cross with CSSLs harboring other major QTLs for essential mineral elements, especially CSSLᴳZC⁶ for grain Zn concentration and CSSLᴳSC⁵ for grain Se concentration. The CSSLᴳCC⁷⁺ᴳZC⁶ and CSSLᴳCC⁷⁺ᴳSC⁵ exhibited lower Cd concentration with higher Zn and Se concentrations in grains, respectively. Our study thus provides elite materials for rice breeding targeting high Zn/Se and low Cd concentrations in grains.  aPublisher supplied data  a91735304cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31671761cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFD0100902‐07cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aOryza sativa 3aalleles 3acadmium 3achromosomes 3amanganese 3aminerals 3anutrient content 3aplant breeding 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3aselenium 3asubstitution lines 3azinc1 aDing, Shilin1 aZhang, Anpeng1 aHong, Kai1 aJiang, Hongzhen1 aYang, Shenglong1 aRuan, Banpu1 aZhang, Bin1 aDong, Guojun1 aGuo, Longbiao1 aZeng, Dali1 aQian, Qian1 aGao, Zhenyu0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2020 Mar., v. 62, no. 3 p.349-359dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949844x1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.129093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013600160300001600296500002000312520139600332592002801728596005901756596006201815596005901877596007801936650001702014650002102031650001202052650002002064650001202084650001602096650001402112650001502126650002202141650002102163650002802184650000902212650002302221650001102244700001902255700002402274700002302298700001902321700001802340700002102358700002102379700002302400700001502423773013802438856007402576852000902650655001202659IND60686260320221116175345.0200314e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068626032DNAL7 a10.1111/jipb.127942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chao‐Lei10aNatural variation in the promoter of OsHMA3 contributes to differential grain cadmium accumulation between Indica and Japonica rice  ap. 314-329.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRice is a major source of cadmium (Cd) intake for Asian people. Indica rice usually accumulates more Cd in shoots and grains than Japonica rice. However, underlying genetic bases for differential Cd accumulation between Indica and Japonica rice are still unknown. In this study, we cloned a quantitative trait locus (QTL) grain Cd concentration on chromosome 7 (GCC7) responsible for differential grain Cd accumulation between two rice varieties by performing QTL analysis and map‐based cloning. We found that the two GCC7 alleles, GCC7ᴾᴬ⁶⁴ˢ and GCC7⁹³‐¹¹, had different promoter activity of OsHMA3, leading to different OsHMA3 expression and different shoot and grain Cd concentrations. By analyzing the distribution of different haplotypes of GCC7 among diverse rice accessions, we discovered that the high and low Cd accumulation alleles, namely GCC7⁹³‐¹¹ and GCC7ᴾᴬ⁶⁴ˢ, were preferentially distributed in Indica and Japonica rice, respectively. We further showed that the GCC7ᴾᴬ⁶⁴ˢ allele can be used to replace the GCC7⁹³‐¹¹ allele in the super cultivar 93‐11 to reduce grain Cd concentration without adverse effect on agronomic traits. Our results thus reveal that the QTL GCC7 with sequence variation in the OsHMA3 promoter is an important determinant controlling differential grain Cd accumulation between Indica and Japonica rice.  aPublisher supplied data  a31601284cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31661143006cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cAgricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program  cShanghai Center for Plant Stress Biology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aOryza sativa 3aagronomic traits 3aalleles 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3ahaplotypes 3amolecular cloning 3apromoter regions 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3asequence diversity 3ashoots1 aGao, Zhen‐Yu1 aShang, Lian‐Guang1 aYang, Chang‐Hong1 aRuan, Ban‐Pu1 aZeng, Da‐Li1 aGuo, Long‐Biao1 aZhao, Fang‐Jie1 aHuang, Chao‐Feng1 aQian, Qian0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2020 Mar., v. 62, no. 3 p.314-329dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949844x1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.127943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245006400209300001800273500001100291520126700302592002801569650001601597650001501613650001401628650002701642650001701669650001101686650001001697773011101707856008301818852000901901655001201910IND60767656120221119080541.0220220e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076765612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-022-04425-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalmén, Lennart,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3534-110710aOn the organization of hemicelluloses in the wood cell wall  ap. 1349-1355.  aReview  aThe structural arrangement of the polymers in the cell wall of wood has still not been fully established. This relates specifically to the role of the two hemicelluloses, glucomannan and xylan, in the secondary cell wall. In softwoods there is a good consensus with regard to the glucomannan as associated with the cellulose microfibrils while the role of the xylan has been more questioned. Recent NMR-studies have now strongly indicated a close association of xylan also to the cellulose microfibrils in softwoods. In order to assess these findings, studies utilizing complementary techniques are here re-examined in order to scrutinize these results. By analyzing results from polymer orientation (polarized FTIR), molecular blending (dynamic mechanical analysis), polymer interaction (dynamic FTIR) and moisture induced swelling (synchrotron X-ray) a close association of xylan to cellulose is here fully supported. Thus, the overall results from all multiple techniques strongly advocate an association of both glucomannan and xylan to the cellulose microfibrils and aggregates while the lignin is considered as encompassing the remaining space between the undulating cellulose/hemicellulose aggregate structures and acting as an independent polymer entity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acell walls 3acellulose 3acellulose microfibrils 3aglucomannans 3alignin 3axylan0 tCellulose.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 3 p.1349-1355dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-022-04425-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006000138245008800198500002000286520181700306592002802123650001302151650001502164650002002179650001402199650002502213650001902238650001602257650001602273700002002289773010902309856007202418852000902490655001202499IND60749415620221121064859.0210903e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074941562DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.34662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValdés, Alicia,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9281-287110aPlant–animal interactions mediate climatic effects on selection on flowering time  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSelection on flowering time in plants is often mediated by multiple agents, including climatic conditions and the intensity of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions with animals. These selective agents can have both direct and indirect effects. For example, climate might not only influence phenotypic selection on flowering time directly by affecting plant physiology, but it can also alter selection indirectly by modifying the seasonal activity and relative timing of animals interacting with plants. We used 21 yr of data to identify the drivers of selection on flowering time in the perennial herb Lathyrus vernus, and to examine if antagonistic plant–animal interactions mediate effects of climate on selection. We examined the fitness consequences of vertebrate grazing and predispersal seed predation, and how these effects varied among years and among individuals within years. Although both antagonistic plant–animal interactions had important negative effects on plant fitness, only grazing intensity was consistently related to plant phenology, being higher in early‐flowering individuals. Spring temperature influenced the intensity of both plant–animal interactions, as well as the covariance between seed predation and plant phenology. However, only differences in grazing intensity among years were associated with differences in selection on flowering time; the strength of selection for early flowering being stronger in years with lower mean intensity of grazing. Our results illustrate how climatic conditions can influence plant–animal interactions that are important selective agents for plant traits. A broader implication of our findings is that both ecological and evolutionary responses to climatic changes might be indirect, and largely mediated by species interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLathyrus 3acovariance 3aearly flowering 3aphenology 3aphenotypic selection 3aseed predation 3atemperature 3avertebrates1 aEhrlén, Johan,0 tEcology.g2021 Sept., v. 102, no. 9 p.e03466-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.34663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03581naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013000158520228000288592002802568650001702596650002302613650001302636650002202649650002202671650002202693650001102715650001402726650001302740650001202753650003002765650001202795650001302807650001702820650001502837650001102852651001002863651001802873700001802891700001602909773012702925856007403052852000903126655001203135IND60652903520221121040224.0190713e20190418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065290352DNAL7 a10.3390/su110823252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jifei 12aA New Approach for Multifunctional Zoning of Territorial Space: The Panxi Area of the Upper Yangtze River in China Case Study  aMultifunctional zoning is the primary basis for developing differentiated spatial planning systems and management policies of territorial spaces. The purpose of the paper is to generate an integrated multifunctional zoning scheme of the territorial space in Panxi by employing the functional significance assessment funded on the niche theory and its measurement models, in order to benefit the high efficiency land utilization and other socioeconomic development initiatives, such as the industrial poverty alleviation and mountainous urbanization in the regional scale. In this paper, the six main functions of territorial space were selected and the corresponding index systems were established for the Panxi Area. First, the significances of six territorial functions were evaluated using two niche models. Second, the K-means clustering method was employed to cluster the functional significance grades, acquiring the integrated multifunctional zoning scheme after qualitative adjustment. The results showed that the spatial distribution characteristics of the functional significance for territorial spaces were different. Prominent regions with higher functional significance of agricultural production were concentrated in the vicinity of the Anning River Basin. The distributions of higher significance for industrial development and mineral resources supply functions were correlated with the overall economic development in the Panxi Area. The regions with higher functional significance for tourism &amp; leisure showed advantages on tourist attractions&rsquo; quality. The regions with higher significance for habitat service and ecosystem services functions presented advantages on good livability and ecological conditions. The integrated multifunctional zoning scheme for territorial space was highly in consistence with the Major Function Oriented Zoning of Sichuan Province and the &ldquo;Thirteen Five&rdquo; Development Plan for Panxi Economic Zone. Generally, the results indicated the rationality and feasibility of the research method, which provides a theoretical basis for coordinating and shaping the structure and pattern of territorial spaces, especially in the mountainous environment with distinct geographical as well as functional differences.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aecosystem services 3ahabitats 3aindustrialization 3aissues and policy 3amineral resources 3amodels 3amountains 3aplanning 3apoverty 3asocioeconomic development 3atourism 3atourists 3aurbanization 3awatersheds 3azoning 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aLiu, Chunyan 1 aZhang, Fei,0 tSustainability.g2019 Apr. 18, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110823253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245009600160500001400256520124800270592002801518650001901546650002201565650001101587650001701598650001701615650002001632650000801652650001201660650001201672650002001684650001501704650001301719650000901732653002801741653001801769700002101787700002601808700002301834773011301857856007701970852000902047655001202056IND60727407820221122042836.0210308e20200710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072740782DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.8.e515862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalavin, Stas10aFrozen Zoo: a collection of permafrost samples containing viable protists and their viruses  aNAL-light  aPermafrost, frozen ground cemented with ice, occupies about a quarter of the Earth’s hard surface and reaches up to 1000 metres depth. Due to constant subzero temperatures, permafrost represents a unique record of past epochs, whenever it comes to accumulated methane, oxygen isotope ratio or stored mummies of animals. Permafrost is also a unique environment where cryptobiotic stages of different microorganisms are trapped and stored alive for up to hundreds of thousands of years. Several protist strains and two giant protist viruses isolated from permafrost cores have been already described. In this paper, we describe a collection of 35 amoeboid protist strains isolated from the samples of Holocene and Pleistocene permanently frozen sediments. These samples are stored at −18°C in the Soil Cryology Lab, Pushchino, Russia and may be used for further studies and isolation attempts.

The pH, ammonia-N (NH₃-N) and volatile fatty acids (VFA) were measured at 6, 24, 48 h, whilst the cellulolytic bacteria population was determined at 6 and 24 h. The 0.6 mg/ml MCP inclusion decreased the theoretical maximum of gas production and the half-life. The NH₃-N concentration was decreased by MCP at all doses at 24 h. The MCP inclusion increased the concentration of total VFA at 24 and 48 h and the acetate to propionate ratio, the molar proportion of isovalerate at 6 h, while decreased that of isobutyrate at 24 h and that of isovalerate, valerate at 24 and 48 h, respectively. The relative abundances of Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were decreased at 6 h, while that of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was increased at all times of incubation and that of Fibrobacter succinogenes reached the greatest value at 0.6 mg/ml MCP supplementation at 24 h. This study demonstrated that the MCP had the ability to enhance the total VFA production, modulate the rumen fermentation pathway and influence the number of cellulolytic bacteria population.  aThe authors wish to acknowledge the financial support received from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31201826, 31320103917) and Tianjin Science and Technology Support Plan Project (13ZCZDNC01800).  aPublisher supplied data  a31201826a31320103917cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2013TF3006cHunan Provincial Creation Development Project  a13ZCZDNC01800cTianjin Science and Technology Support Plan Project  a31201826,31320103917cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aButyrivibrio fibrisolvens 3aFibrobacter succinogenes 3aMomordica charantia 3aRuminococcus albus 3aRuminococcus flavefaciens 3aacetates 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanimal science 3afermentation 3ahalf life 3apH 3apolysaccharides 3apropionic acid 3arumen fermentation 0aPlant components 0ain vitro fermentation 0acellulolytic bacteria 0aroughage1 aZeng, Bo1 aTang, Shaoxun1 aWang, Min1 aHan, Xuefeng1 aZhou, Chuanshe1 aYan, Qiongxian1 aLiu, Jinfu1 aTan, Zhiliang0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 16, no. 2 p.226-233dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2017.12898253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245012100175520141400296592002801710650003501738650001501773650000901788650002301797650001301820650002501833650002201858650000901880651001201889653002601901653003401927653001901961653001701980653003201997700001802029700002002047773010202067856008702169852000902256655001202265IND60743861120221117103027.0210813e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074386112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.1071372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalkner, Katharina10aIntegrated modelling of cost-effective policies to regulate Western Corn Rootworm under climate scenarios in Austria  aThe continuous spread of the invasive Western Corn Rootworm (WCR; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) poses a threat to maize production regions. We develop a spatially explicit integrated modelling framework to analyse the performance of cost-effective WCR regulation policies for 2010–2040 at 1 km spatial resolution in Austria. A modelled future baseline WCR abundance is used to design 15 alternative WCR regulation policies differing in regional delineation, risk propensity, and maize restriction levels. We calculate cost-effectiveness ratios to rank the overall performance of alternative WCR regulation policies considering three climate scenarios and two policy implementation levels. The model results show that with the best performing WCR regulation policy, reducing 1 ha high WCR abundance area comes with a decrease in total net returns of 112 €, assuming optimal cropland use under similar climate conditions. Moreover, marginal opportunity costs of policy compliance (costs for switching to the second-best alternative) vary spatially, by policy configuration, and among climate scenarios. According to the results, wetter climate conditions lead to higher and drier climate conditions to lower marginal opportunity costs compared to climate conditions similar to the past. The analysis provides a sound basis for cost-effective policy design and implementation to regulate WCR infestation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 3acompliance 3acorn 3acost effectiveness 3acropland 3aecological economics 3aissues and policy 3arisk 3aAustria 0aWestern Corn Rootworm 0aIntegrated land use modelling 0aClimate change 0aPest control 0aCost-effectiveness analysis1 aSchmid, Erwin1 aMitter, Hermine0 tEcological economics.g2021 Oct., v. 188 p.107137-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.1071373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013200164300001800296520143200314592002801746650001201774650001201786650001401798650002301812650001501835650001401850650001301864650001301877650002101890650001201911650002601923650002001949650001701969650001901986650001602005650001802021650001102039700001802050700001902068700001702087700001702104700001502121700005802136773011102194856008302305852000902388655001202397IND60767656420221119080552.0220220e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076765642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-021-04375-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Ting10aConversion of carbohydrates into furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural using furfuryl alcohol resin-based solid acid as catalyst  ap. 1419-1433.  aA furfuryl alcohol resin-based solid acid (SC-FAR-800) was prepared and applied in the conversion of carbohydrates into furan platform compounds in microwave. The results showed that SC-FAR-800 was an irregular mesoporous material containing sulfonic acid groups with an acid density of 3.43 mmol/g, which was quite stable below 200 °C. SC-FAR-800 showed good catalytic activity, and the yield of furfural from xylose could reach 60.46%; the yield of 5-HMF from fructose, glucose, cellobiose and cellulose macromolecules could reach 89.35%, 38.17%, 42.6%, 14.73%, respectively. However, the effect of reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst dosage and water content on various carbohydrate’s conversion was different. SC-FAR-800 could be reused more than 6 times in fructose conversion, and could be regenerated after a re-sulfonation process. Moreover, the catalytic activity of SC-FAR-800 was super to some biomass-based solid acid. Therefore, this catalyst may be an attractive alternative in the conversion of biomass to prepare furan compounds. Furfuryl alcohol resin-based solid acid (SC-FAR-800), which has a high acidity of 3.43 mmol/g, was applied in the conversion of carbohydrates in a microwave oven. The peak yield of furfural from D-xylose could reach 60.46%; the yield of 5-HMF from D-fructose, glucose, cellobiose and cellulose macromolecules could reach 89.35%, 38.17%, 42.6%, 14.73%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acellobiose 3acellulose 3afructose 3afurfural 3afurfuryl alcohol 3aglucose 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3amicrowave ovens 3aporous media 3asulfonic acids 3atemperature 3awater content 3axylose1 aZhou, Yaohong1 aZhang, Xiaohua1 aPeng, Dayong1 aNie, Xuliang1 aChen, Jing1 aXiong, WanMing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0404-18220 tCellulose.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 3 p.1419-1433dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-021-04375-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245017600204300001800380500001900398520148700417592002801904650004401932650001501976650001801991650003102009650001402040650001502054650001102069650001302080650002502093650001502118651001802133700002102151700005902172700006202231700002502293700001902318700006102337773013902398856007902537852000902616655001202625IND60688078220210804000000.0200407e20200306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068807822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b069812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTekman, Mine B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6915-017610aTying up Loose Ends of Microplastic Pollution in the Arctic: Distribution from the Sea Surface through the Water Column to Deep-Sea Sediments at the HAUSGARTEN Observatory  ap. 4079-4090.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecent studies have shown that despite its remoteness, the Arctic region harbors some of the highest microplastic (MP) concentrations worldwide. Here, we present the results of a sampling campaign to assess the vertical distribution of MP particles (>11 μm) at five stations of the HAUSGARTEN observatory. Water column samples were taken with large volume pumps by filtering 218–561 L of seawater at two to four depth strata (near-surface, ∼300 m, ∼1000 m, and above seafloor), and sediment samples were taken with a multiple corer. MP concentrations in the water column ranged between 0 and 1287 N m–³ and in the sediment from 239 to 13 331 N kg–¹. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) imaging with automated data analysis showed that polyamide (39%) and ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (23%) were the most abundant polymers within the water samples and polyethylene-chlorinated (31%) in sediments. MPs ≤ 25 μm accounted for more than half of the synthetic particles in every sample. The largest MP particle recorded was in the 200 μm size class. The concentrations of fibers were not reported, as fiber detection by FTIR imaging was not available at the time of analyses. Two- and three-dimensional simulations of particle transport trajectories suggest different pathways for certain polymer types. A positive correlation between MP size composition and particulate organic carbon indicates interactions with biological processes in the water column.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aautomation 3amicroplastics 3aparticulate organic carbon 3apollution 3apolyamides 3arubber 3aseawater 3aspatial distribution 3atechnology 3aArctic region1 aWekerle, Claudia1 aLorenz, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7898-77281 aPrimpke, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7633-85241 aHasemann, Christiane1 aGerdts, Gunnar1 aBergmann, Melanie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5212-98080 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Mar. 06, v. 54, no. 7 p.4079-4090dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b069813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015600163300001400319520122900333592002801562650002501590650002301615650000901638650002001647650001001667650003501677650001101712650001001723650001801733650001701751650001701768650002001785650002101805650001701826653002301843653001501866653001301881653002201894653002201916700001901938700002001957700002201977773011201999856008202111852000902193655001202202IND60553895520221119195052.0161023e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055389552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2013.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Na Na10aKisspeptin regulates the hypothalamus–pituitary–gonad axis gene expression during sexual maturation in the cinnamon clownfish, Amphiprion melanopus  ap. 19-32.  aKisspeptins (Kiss) have been recognized as potent regulators of reproduction in teleosts, and Kiss is suggested to be a key regulator of the hypothalamus–pituitary–gonad axis (HPG). However, its regulatory role on reproduction in fish remains unclear. Therefore, to investigate the role of Kiss on fish reproduction, this study aimed to test differences in the hormones of the HPG axis, Kiss as neuropeptides, and sex steroids on the sexual maturation of paired cinnamon clownfish, Amphiprion melanopus, following treatment with Kiss. We investigated the actions of sex maturation hormones, including HPG axis hormones and sex steroid hormones, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormones, gonadotropin hormones (GTHs), GTH receptors, estrogen receptors, and vitellogenin in the pituitary, gonads, and liver following treatment with Kiss. The expression levels of HPG axis genes increased after the Kiss injection. In addition, the levels of plasma 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, estradiol-17β, and 11-ketotestosterone increased. These results support the hypothesis that Kiss play important roles in the regulation of the HPG axis and are most likely involved in gonadal development and sexual maturation in cinnamon clownfish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphiprion melanopus 3aestrogen receptors 3afish 3agene expression 3agenes 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3agonads 3aliver 3aneuropeptides 3areproduction 3asex hormones 3asexual maturity 3asteroid hormones 3avitellogenin 0aCinnamon clownfish 0aKisspeptin 0aHPG axis 0aSexual maturation 0aEstrogen receptor1 aShin, Hyun Suk1 aChoi, Young Jae1 aChoi, Cheol Young0 tComparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Part B.g2014 Feb., v. 168 p.19-32dElsevier Inc.x1096-49597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2013.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245009200167300001600259506002800275520094700303592002801250506003701278650001201315650001301327650000901340650001401349650002101363650000901384650001101393653002801404653001601432653001001448653002701458700002101485700001801506700001901524700001801543773016701561856007901728852000901807655001201816IND60773927420221207072750.0160902e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077392742DNAL7 a10.19113/sdufbed.858802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKARAHANCER, Sebnem10aInvestigation of Using Waste Welded Tuff Material as Mineral Filler in Asphalt Concrete  ap. 399-404.  aResource is Open Access  aIn this paper, the welded tuff waste- known as koyke in Isparta region - was used in the hot mix asphalt (HMA) as mineral filler for reduction of the moisture susceptibility of HMA. Optimum binder content was assessed with Marshall Design Method. First of all, welded tuff was substituted as filler with limestone filler in proportion of 50% and 100%. After that Marshall Stability test was performed on specimens. The results showed that the 50% substitution was more effective than the 100% substitution. Therefore, welded tuff was substituted with limestone filler in proportion of 25%, 50%, 65% and 75%. Next, Indirect Tensile Strength test was practiced on the fabricated specimens and the results were assessed. According to the Indirect Tensile Strength results, welded tuff with 65% was given higher strength than the limestone filler. As a result, it has come up that welded tuff can be used as mineral filler in the hot mix asphalt.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abitumen 3aconcrete 3afens 3alimestone 3atensile strength 3atuff 3awastes 0aMoisture susceptibility 0aWelded tuff 0aKoyke 0aTensile strength ratio1 aERISKIN, Ekinhan1 aCAPALI, Buket1 aSALTAN, Mehmet1 aTERZI, Serdal0 tSüleyman Demirel üniversitesi fen bilimleri enstitüsü dergisi.g2016 Aug., v. 20, no. 3 p.399-404dSuleyman Demirel UniversitywJournal:27744x1308-65297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.19113/sdufbed.858803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01787naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012000166300001600286520066100302592002800963650001500991650002701006650001501033650001001048650001801058650001401076650001501090650001301105650001201118650002201130651001701152700002001169773014601189856008101335852000901416655001201425IND60518156420221119191622.0160406e196610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051815642DNAL7 a10.7589/0090-3558-2.4.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamuel, W.

Illumina sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA genes revealed a large shift in the proportion of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes during the treatment process, with the proportion of Actinobacteria decreased sharply, whereas that of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes increased and predominated in treated water. Both microbial activity and bacterial diversity during the treatment process showed obvious spatial variation, with higher levels observed during the dry season and lower levels during the wet season. Clustering analysis and principal component analysis indicated dramatic shifts in the bacterial community after chlorination, suggesting that chlorination was highly effective at influencing the bacterial community. The bacterial community structure of finished water primarily comprised Pseudomonas, Citrobacter, and Acinetobacter, and interestingly showed high similarity to biofilms on granular activated carbon. Additionally, the abundance of bacterial communities was relatively stable in finished water and did not change with the season. A large number of unique operational taxonomic units were shared during treatment steps, indicating the presence of a diverse core microbiome throughout the treatment process. Opportunistic pathogens, including Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, Mycobacterium, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Legionella, Streptococcus and Enterococcus, were detected in water including finished water, suggesting a potential threat to drinking-water safety. We also detected bacteria isolated from each treatment step using the pure-culture method. In particular, two isolates, identified as Mycobacterium sp. and Blastococcus sp., which belong to the phylum Actinobacteria, were obtained from finished water during the dry season. Together, these results provided evidence of spatial and temporal variations in DWTPs and contributed to the beneficial manipulation of the drinking water microbiome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aBlastococcus 3aCitrobacter 3aEnterococcus 3aLegionella 3aMycobacterium 3aPseudomonas 3aSalmonella 3aStaphylococcus 3aStreptococcus 3aactivated carbon 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiofilm 3achlorination 3acluster analysis 3adrinking water 3adry season 3agenes 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobiome 3aprincipal component analysis 3aribosomal RNA 3asecondary infection 3asequence analysis 3atemporal variation 3awater treatment 3awet season 3aChina 0aATP 0aAWCD 0aBAC 0aCCA 0aCOD 0aDO 0aDWT 0aDWDS 0aDWTP 0aDWTS 0aGAC 0aHPC 0aOTU 0aPCA 0aPCR 0aTOC 0aDrinking water treatment system 0aBacterial diversity 0aHigh-throughput sequencing 0aBiofilm 0aCore microbiome 0aOpportunistic pathogens1 aZhou, Qin1 aWu, Qingping1 aGu, Qihui1 aSun, Ming1 aZhang, Jumei0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 June 01, v. 625 p.449-459dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.3013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01700naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008500164300001600249520064700265592002800912650002300940650000900963650000900972650001000981650000900991650002301000650001401023650002101037650002201058700001801080700001601098773014601114856008101260852000901341655001201350IND60518156620221119191523.0160406e196610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051815662DNAL7 a10.7589/0090-3558-2.4.1272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLOCKE, L.

We have developed an approach to recapitulate various aspects of endosymbiont genome minimization using a synthetic system consisting of Escherichia coli endosymbionts within host yeast cells. As a first step, we identified a number of E. coli auxotrophs of central metabolites that can form viable endosymbionts within yeast cells. These studies provide a platform to identify nonessential biosynthetic pathways that can be deleted in the E. coli endosymbionts to investigate the evolutionary adaptations in the host and endosymbiont during the evolution of mitochondria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aauxotrophs 3abiochemical pathways 3aendosymbionts 3agenes 3ametabolites 3amitochondria 3ayeasts1 aKo, Yeonjin1 aSupekova, Lubica1 aPestonjamasp, Kersi1 aLi, Jack1 aSchultz, Peter G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3188-12020 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Aug. 16, v. 141, no. 35 p.13799-13802dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b082903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01347naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002000191245010700211506007600318520013100394592002800525506003700553650001700590650002700607650002300634650001200657700002700669700002000696700002700716700001800743700002500761773010500786856008500891852000900976655001200985IND60679545220221207054919.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067954522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2019.1079002doi7 aPMC70127562pmcid7 a319014542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlex, Catherine10aSynthesis of 2-azido-2-deoxy- and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-manno derivatives as versatile building blocks  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReported herein is the synthesis of a number of building blocks of 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-mannose from common d-glucose precursors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino sugars 3acarbohydrate structure 3achemical reactions 3aglucose1 aVisansirikul, Satsawat1 aZhang, Yongzhen1 aYasomanee, Jagodige P.1 aCodee, Jeroen1 aDemchenko, Alexei V.0 tCarbohydrate research.g2020 Feb., v. 488 p.107900-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45609x0008-62157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2019.1079003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02017naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245010400206300001400310506007600324520073000400592002801130506003701158650002901195650000901224650001501233650001401248650001101262650002301273650001301296653004801309653002501357653001601382700002001398773011001418856008201528852000901610655001201619IND60584235720221207092348.0180904e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058423572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2017.07.0062doi7 aPMC58613522pmcid7 a287542852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Soo Chan10aDynamics of parasitophorous vacuoles formed by the microsporidian pathogen Encephalitozoon cuniculi  ap. 20-23.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt has been a long-standing debate if sexual development occurs in the microsporidian lineages.

This study presents another line of evidence by monitoring the parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) formed by Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Time lapse observations of infection cycles of E. cuniculi revealed that multiple PVs can be formed in a single host cell and the PVs in the single cell can merge (fusion) or split (fission).

Regeneration forestry practices disturb the natural development and proportion of oak root systems by repeated undercutting of the taproots of seedlings in nurseries, or the repeated cutting of stems in coppice systems. Thus, regeneration practices may affect tree growth and susceptibility to environmental stresses, including increasingly frequent and severe droughts. To test this hypothesis, tree-ring dendroclimatological and stable isotope data were used to assess the physiological responses of acorn-sown, planted, and coppiced Quercus robur trees of different health classes (healthy, defoliated and recently dead) to interannual climatic variations over the last 41 years. Annual basal area increment (BAI) was negatively and positively related with δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O, respectively; although the intensity of these relations depended on tree regeneration origin and current vigor. Compared to healthy oaks, dead acorn-sown oaks exhibited significantly higher BAI, and lower δ¹³C and intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) during drought periods, but not during non-drought periods; in contrast, dead coppiced oaks showed lower BAI, δ¹³C, iWUE and δ¹⁸O irrespective of climatic conditions. Acorn-sown and planted oaks growing fast at early stages of regeneration exhibited sudden decreases in BAI before dying following a severe drought period. In comparison, growth decline preceding the death of coppiced stems was progressive, suggesting that long-term C limitations to increasingly weakened trees underline drought-induced decline and eventual dieback. Different climate sensitivity of Q. robur trees of different regeneration origin suggests that regeneration forestry practices should be taken into account when adapting forest management plans to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus robur 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acoppicing 3acutting 3adeath 3adieback 3adrought 3aforest management 3agrowth rings 3alongevity 3aoxygen 3aphysiological response 3aroot systems 3aseedlings 3asilvicultural practices 3astable isotopes 3astems 3atree growth 3atrees 3avigor 3awater use efficiency 0aPedunculate oak 0aRoot morphology 0aRoot to shoot ratio 0aTree mortality 0aTree die-off 0aClimate change1 aJagodziński, Andrzej M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6899-09851 aŁakomy, Piotr1 aMucha, Joanna1 aOleksyn, J.,1 aRodríguez-Calcerrada, Jesús1 aUfnalski, Krzysztof0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 278 p.107685-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.1076853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245018400157300001600341520140400357592002801761650001501789650002701804650002201831650001501853650002401868650001501892650001601907650001501923650001201938650001701950650001001967650001201977650001001989651002201999653002802021653001502049653002802064653001602092653001802108700002502126773009902151856003802250852000902288655001202297IND50064608320221116152250.0130405s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006460832DNAL7 a10.1071/BT130322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradbury, Donna10aLimited impact of fragmentation and disturbance on the mating system of tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala, Myrtaceae): implications for seed-source quality in ecological restoration  ap. 148-160.  aVariation in patterns of mating within and among plant populations can be impacted by habitat disturbance and have significant implications for offspring fitness. An understanding of this variation will inform predictions of seed genetic quality, benefiting ecological restoration through better seed-sourcing guidelines. We assessed mating system variation in six populations of tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala DC.), an iconic tree of significance to ecological restoration in Western Australia. A mixed mating system was observed with predominant outcrossing (tm=0.76±0.05) and low biparental inbreeding (tm–ts=0.03±0.02). We detected some evidence of increased inbreeding in a naturally fragmented population (tm–ts=0.10±0.04) and in a disturbed urban remnant (tm=0.52±0.12), including a family with complete selfing. However, most variation in outcrossing rate occurred among individuals within populations (82%), rather than among populations (2.6%) or among groups of populations defined by fragmentation or disturbance (15.4%). Genetic diversity was not consistently lower in offspring from fragmented, smaller and/or disturbed populations. These data reinforce the importance of sourcing seeds from multiple trees for ecological restoration, and emphasise that tuart’s mating system and the genetic diversity of offspring is robust to some habitat disturbance and/or fragmentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aecological restoration 3agenetic variation 3aguidelines 3ahabitat destruction 3ainbreeding 3aoutcrossing 3aprediction 3aprogeny 3aseed quality 3aseeds 3aselfing 3atrees 3aWestern Australia 0aforest tree restoration 0ainbreeding 0amating system variation 0aoutcrossing 0aseed sourcing1 aKrauss, Siegfried L.0 tAustralian journal of botany.g2013, v. 61, no. 2 p.148-160dCSIRO Publishingx0067-19247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT13032  aDNAL 7aarticle03991naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245010100155300001600256520245900272592002802731650002102759650003602780650001402816650002602830650002002856650001002876650001902886650001002905650001202915650001302927650001502940650002102955650000802976650001002984650001402994650001603008650002103024650001703045650001103062650001403073650001103087650002203098650001603120650001303136650001003149650001103159650001203170650000903182650001403191651001803205773011003223856007103333852000903404655001203413IND60518333620221123032926.0160412e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051833362DNAL7 a10.2307/29372832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpear, Ray W.10aLate‐Quaternary History of High‐Elevation Vegetation in the White Mountains of New Hampshire  ap. 125-151.  aThe pollen and plant—macrofossil records from four small lakes in the subalpine and alpine zone of the White Mountains, New Hampshire, give a 13 000—yr paleoenvironmental history. The White Mountains were deglaciated before 13 000 yr BP. Downwasting of the continental ice sheet was rapid. The summits projected above the ice as nunataks for only a brief period of time. Residual ice may have existed in Franconia Notch until 11 000 yr BP. From 13 000 to 11 750 yr BP a barren periglacial desert covered the highest altitudes in the White Mountains. Tundra vegetation occupied the lower slopes and valleys. The mean annual temperature was roughly 5°—10°C colder than today. Sparse tundra vegetation surrounded all four high—elevation sites from 11 750 to 10 300 yr ago and several taxa, particularly Artemisia and Caryophyllaceae, indicate disturbance. The summits were subjected to intense periglacial activity. The mean annual temperature was 4—6° lower than present. By 10 300 yr BP shrubs such as willow, juniper, and dwarf birch had invaded the tundra at Lake of the Clouds. Spruce woodland dominated the lower slopes and valleys. At 10 300 yr BP spruce populations arrived at high—elevation sites. Macrofossils of fir, birch, and shrubs also occur in sediments of this age. The temperature increased to or exceeded modern levels. Tree species did not reach the Franconia Notch sites until 9750 yr BP. At these sites the establishment of subalpine forests spanned a much shorter time period. Forest with poplar, spruce, and birch replaced the spruce woodlands of low elevations. Subalpine fir forests became well established by 9000 yr BP. Evidence from the alpine site shows that the fir trees were more abundant and treeline higher than today from 10 300 to 5000 yr BP. After 5000 yr BP, the pollen percentages of alpine indicators increased and the numbers of fir macrofossils dropped. Of the three sites in subalpine fir firest, only the lowest shows any evidence of a warmer interval in the early Holocene. Treeline is apparently a poor temperature indicator because wind and moisture are the major factors determining its position. Taxa of the Northern Hardwood Forest (e.g., white pine, hemlock, yellow birch, sugar maple, and beech) arrived at lower elevations by 6500 yr BP, but the zones of modern vegetation became established only after 2000 yr BP when spruce populations expanded at low elevations between 750 and 1200 m.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies lasiocarpa 3aAcer saccharum subsp. saccharum 3aArtemisia 3aBetula alleghaniensis 3aCaryophyllaceae 3aFagus 3aHolocene epoch 3aPicea 3aPopulus 3aaltitude 3aglaciation 3ahardwood forests 3aice 3alakes 3amountains 3apaleobotany 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3apollen 3asediments 3ashrubs 3asubalpine forests 3atemperature 3atreeline 3atrees 3atundra 3avalleys 3awind 3awoodlands 3aNew Hampshire0 tEcological monographs.g1989 Feb., v. 59, no. 2 p.125-151dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/29372833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01393naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009300164300001400257520046400271592002800735650001600763650002100779650001000800650002100810650001700831650002200848773014400870856008001014852000901094655001201103IND60518156920221119191545.0160406e196701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051815692DNAL7 a10.7589/0090-3558-3.1.142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKIRMSE, PETER10aHost Specificity and Long Persistence of Pox Infection in the Flicker (Colaptes auratus)  ap. 14-20.  aThe persistence of cutaneous lesions of avian pox virus infection in a yellow-shafted flicker (Colaptes auratus) over a period of 13 months is described.

Previous studies have shown that the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) is involved in controlling this process, but it is unknown if 5-HT availability is under central nervous control or if the 5-HT signal originates from a peripheral source. Following up on a previous study, cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal) and X (vagus) were sectioned to further characterize their role in controlling pulsatile urea excretion and 5-HT release within the gill. In contrast to an earlier study, nerve sectioning did not result in a change in urea pulse frequency. Total urea excretion, average pulse size, total nitrogen excretion, and percent ureotely were reduced the first day post-surgery in nerve-sectioned fish but recovered by 72h post-surgery. Nerve sectioning also had no effect on toadfish urea transporter (tUT), 5-HT transporter (SERT), or 5-HT2A receptor mRNA expression or 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) abundance in the gill, all of which were found consistently across the three gill arches except 5-HIAA, which was undetectable in the first gill arch. Our findings indicate that the central nervous system does not directly control pulsatile urea excretion or local changes in gill 5-HT and 5-HIAA abundance.  aPublisher supplied data 3a5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid 3aOpsanus beta 3aammonia 3acentral nervous system 3aexcretion 3afish 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3anerve tissue 3aneurotransmitters 3anitrogen content 3aserotonin 3aurea 3awastes 0a5-HT 0a5-HIAA 0aVagus 0aGlossopharyngeal 0aGills 0atUT 0aSERT 0a5-HT2A1 aAmador, Molly H.B.1 aTzaneva, Velislava1 aMilsom, William K.1 aMcDonald, M.

(AM) was proposed by using high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) combined with alternating trilinear decomposition (ATLD) algorithm. Utilizing the "second-order advantage", three common problems in HPLC could be resolved, namely baseline drifts, peak overlaps, and unknown interferences. 12 compounds were rapidly eluted within 12.5 min, and the average spiked recoveries were 80.8–109.9%. The figures of merit reflected the feasibility of the proposed method. Compared with the results of the traditional univariate calibration method based on HPLC-UV technique, the proposed strategy further verified the reliability and simplicity of the mathematical separation. On this basis, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was applied to discriminate 113 AM samples from different geographical origins, and variable importance in projection (VIP) was used to further screen the main differential components that affect the regional division of AM. A series of results show that the AM samples from the three regions have obviously different clustering trends. Overall, the strategy is expected to provide a scientific basis for the modern research of medicinal materials, and it is also conducive to the clinical use and market supervision of AM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtractylodes macrocephala 3aalgorithms 3achemometrics 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amarkets 3aprovenance 0aAlternating trilinear decomposition algorithm 0aSecond-order advantage 0aHigh-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection 0aPattern recognition 0aAtractylodes macrocephala Koidz1 aWu, Hai-Long1 aWang, Tong1 aChang, Yue-Yue1 aChen, Yao1 aYang, Jian1 aFu, Hai-Yan1 aYang, Xiao-Long1 aLi, Xu-Fu1 aYu, Ru-Qin0 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 July 05, v. 1674 p.463121-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4631213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245006900158300001400227520177200241592002802013650001402041650001602055650001802071650001502089650001002104650003202114650001002146651001102156773010102167856004802268856001202316852000902328655001202337IND50062121620221116152306.0130321e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006212162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-012-0270-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBirger10a# Stem taper equations for poplars growing on farmland in Sweden  ap. 15-22.  aWe developed a simple polynomial taper equation for poplars growing on former farmland in Sweden and also evaluated the performance of some well-known taper equations. In Sweden there is an increasing interest in the use of poplar. Effective management of poplar plantations for high yield production would be facilitated by taper equations providing better predictions of stem volume than currently available equations. In the study a polynomial stem taper equation with five parameters was established for individual poplar trees growing on former farmland. The outputs of the polynomial taper equation were compared with five published equations. Data for fitting the equations were collected from 69 poplar trees growing at 37 stands in central and southern Sweden (lat. 55–60° N). The mean age of the stands was 21 years (range 14–43), the mean density 984 stems·ha⁻¹ (198–3,493), and the mean diameter at breast height (outside bark) 25 cm (range 12–40). To verify the tested equations, performance of accuracy and precision diameter predictions at seven points along the stem was closely analyzed. Statistics used for evaluation of the equations indicated that the variable exponent taper equation presented by Kozak (1988) performed best and can be recommended. The stem taper equation by Kozak (1988) recommended in the study is likely to be beneficial for optimising the efficiency and profitability of poplar plantation management. The constructed polynomial equation and the segmented equation presented by Max & Burkhart (1976) were second and third ranked. Due to the statistical complexity of Kozak’s equation, the constructed polynomial equation is alternatively recommended when a simple model is requested and larger bias is accepted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aplantations 3aprofitability 3astatistics 3astems 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aSweden0 tJournal of forestry research.g2013 Mar., v. 24, no. 1 p.15-22dSpringer-Verlagx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-012-0270-440uhttp://  aDNAL 7aarticle01494naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002700138245012500165300001600290520030900306592002800615650001500643650002700658650002300685650001300708650001500721650001700736650000900753650001200762650003100774650001300805650001500818700002000833700002200853700002000875773013100895856007301026852000901099655001201108IND60658515920221118031843.0190826e20091222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065851592DNAL7 a10.1039/b915223g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarsi, Muhammad Farooq10aGd-functionalised Au nanoparticles as targeted contrast agents in MRI: relaxivity enhancement by polyelectrolyte coating  ap. 451-453.  aMonolayer-protected, Gd³⁺-functionalised gold nanoparticles with enhanced spin–lattice relaxivity (r₁) were prepared; adsorption of polyelectrolytes on these materials further increased r₁ and ligand exchange with a biotin-derivatised disulfide led to a prototype avidin-targeted contrast agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3acoatings 3adisulfides 3aelectrolytes 3agold 3aligands 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3ananogold 3aprototypes1 aAdams, Ralph W.1 aDuckett, Simon B.1 aChechik, Victor0 tChemical communications.g2009 Dec. 22, v. 46, no. 3 p.451-453dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b915223g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01938naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245008200164300001600246520101400262592002801276650001501304650001501319650002201334650002401356650002201380650001101402650002101413651001601434651001101450773009401461856004801555852000901603655001201612IND4478867320221118024235.0121003e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447886732DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738120500282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabenko, A.

Altogether, 104 collembolan species of 55 genera and 16 families were found. Analysis of the faunal composition revealed its high similarity to that of the faunas of the neighboring regions of Norway as well as a marked decline in species richness as compared to the Siberian analogues. A high share of littoral forms with increased vagility and the predominance of species with “southern” (= boreal) and “western” distribution patterns are the main characteristics of the fauna studied; only a few true arctic forms were found, always with low abundance and occurrence levels. Most of the studied collembolan assemblages are characterized by the dominance of a few species which inhabit a part of or the entire range of plant communities. As a result, collembolan assemblages under various types of vegetation cover in different landscape elements often show only insignificant differences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCollembola 3alandscapes 3aplant communities 3apopulation dynamics 3aspecies diversity 3atundra 3avegetation cover 3aBarents Sea 3aRussia0 tEntomological revue.g2012 Aug., v. 92, no. 5 p.497-515dSpringer-Verlagx0013-87387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0013873812050028  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100006100183245010900244506007600353520117700429592002801606596002601634506003701660650002201697650001401719650001801733650002801751650001701779650001601796650001801812650000701830650001101837650001301848650001601861650001101877650002001888700003601908773012101944856007602065852000902141655001202150IND60662533020221207064025.0190904e20190819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066253302DNAL7 a10.1155/2019/46081352doi7 aPMC67208232pmcid7 a315312632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulyasuryani, Ani1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9984-000710aDevelopment of Potentiometric Phenol Sensors by Nata de Coco Membrane on Screen-Printed Carbon Electrode  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNata de coco, a bacterial cellulose as a result of coconut water fermentation, is a conductive polymer with a electrical conductivity of 553 μS/cm and has high mechanical stability. In this study, nata de coco was used as a supporting membrane for the development of phenol sensors in potentiometry. Nata de coco membrane containing phenol is coated on the surface of the printed carbon electrode (screen-printed carbon electrode). The cross-sectional area of the carbon electrode coated with the membrane is 1.5 × 3 mm², while the reference electrode is Ag/AgCl. The thickness of the electrode membrane affects the Nernstian factor. The optimum Nernstian factor is produced by 100 μm membrane thickness containing 117.5 μg of phenol. Measurement of phenol solution was carried out at pH 11, in the concentration range of 10⁻⁸ to 10⁻² mol/L, resulting in a Nernstian factor of 41.8 ± 1.3 mV/decade. The Nernstian factor increased to 55.7 ± 0.4 mV/decade if the membrane of the electrode contained 0.1% Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles. This sensor has been applied in the real sample of river water, resulting in good accuracy and precision.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversitas Brawijaya0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon electrodes 3acellulose 3acoconut water 3aelectrical conductivity 3afermentation 3airon oxides 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aphenol 3apolymers 3ariver water 3asilver 3asilver chloride1 aMustaghfiroh, Afifah Muhimmatul0 tJournal of Analytical Methods in Chemistry (Online).g2019 Aug. 19, v. 2019dHindawiwJournal:26807x2090-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/46081353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04655naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245006300158300001600221520296900237592002803206650001603234650002503250650001703275650002803292650001803320650002003338650001103358650001103369650001003380650001603390650001503406650001203421650001603433650001103449650001203460650001003472650001903482650001503501650002803516650001403544650001403558650001103572650002303583650002003606650001403626650001003640650002203650650001103672650001103683650002303694650001003717650001503727650001703742651001003759700002603769700002003795773011003815856007103925852000903996655001204005IND60518333920221123033350.0160412e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051833392DNAL7 a10.2307/29372852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStreng, Donna R.10aWoody Seedling Dynamics in an East Texas Floodplain Forest  ap. 177-204.  aWe monitored woody plant seed deposition, seedling emergence, and the survival and growth of seedlings (i.e., plants ≤0.5 m tall regardless of age) in an East Texas river floodplain forest from 1979 through 1984. In addition, we estimated the relative importance of flooding, drought, fungal attack, herbivory, proximity to a conspecific adult, and shade in causing seedling mortality. Tree species fell into two major groups on the basis of their demographic characteristics and responses to unfavorable conditions. The first group was composed of heavy—seeded species, of which water oak (Quercus nigra) was the primary example. They produced few seeds, but had high seedling survival. Seedlings of these species emerged late in the summer, thereby avoiding peak periods of flooding and damping—off mortality. Seedling survival was little affected by drought, herbivory, or proximity to a conspecific adult. The second group included most of the common tree species (e.g., ironwood, Carpinus caroliniana; sweetgum, Liquidambar styraciflua; red maple, Acer rubrum; American elm, Ulmus americana). They produced large crops of light seeds which dispersed throughout the study area. In these species, seedling survival was low for the 1st yr, but increased substantially thereafter. Flooding, drought, damping—off, proximity to a conspecific adult, and herbivory were important causes of 1st—yr seedling mortality. for these species was not constant over the growing season, but was concentrated in peaks associated with particular events (e.g., a drought in 1980, and flooding and damping—off in 1981 and 1982). Seedlings emerging earlier in the spring were usually better able to survive these periods of environmental stress. During the course of the study, extensive flooding in 1979 and during 1983—1984 resulted in increases in the proportion of water oak in the seedling layer, while periods of reduced flooding during 1980—1982 allowed several of the more prolific, lighter seeded species (especially ironwood, sweetgum, and deciduous holly, Ilex decidua) to increase in importance. The two spring—dispersing, light—seeded species, red maple and elm, emerged late in the spring and therefore increased in relative abundance during 1984 when early floods killed seedlings of earlier emerging, autumn—dispersing species. Thus, spatial and temporal variation in understory seedling composition in our study was due largely to (1) species differences in the ability to increase rapidly in numbers during favorable periods as compared to the ability to survive stressful periods, and (2) the interaction of emergence phenology with the occurrence of environmental stress. These results demonstrate that variation in flooding or other environmental stresses can alter seedling layer species composition and may thereby influence opportunities for canopy replacement, thus helping to maintain species diversity in southern floodplain forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer rubrum 3aCarpinus caroliniana 3aIlex decidua 3aLiquidambar styraciflua 3aQuercus nigra 3aUlmus americana 3aadults 3acanopy 3acrops 3adamping off 3ademography 3adrought 3afloodplains 3afloods 3aforests 3afungi 3agrowing season 3aherbivores 3ainterspecific variation 3amortality 3aphenology 3arivers 3aseedling emergence 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3atrees 3aunderstory 3awoody plants 3aTexas1 aGlitzenstein, Jeff S.1 aHarcombe, P.

In addition, we compared our study to data on group size and group class frequency of various goitered gazelle populations in Kazakhstan with very variable population densities. We found that mean group size was a more variable index than group class frequency. Population density had some effect on mean group sizes, but the strength of the influence was quite weak, and only in cases where densities of two populations varied more than sevenfold did group sizes start to change. Group class frequency was not correlated with population density at all. The impact of the yearly breeding cycle on group size was bigger than population density. The density-dependent response of goitered gazelle population was curvilinear in fashion, and it may be classified as intermediate between social-dwelling ungulate species, living in large groups and demonstrating continuous (linear) increases of group size with population density and those that are solitary or territorial ungulate species with no relationship between population size and group size, though the goitered gazelle population’s weak response was distinctively closer to the one of solitary ungulate species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGazella subgutturosa 3agazelles 3agroup size 3apopulation density 3aKazakhstan1 aRuckstuhl, Kathreen1 aYang, Weikang0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2012 Dec., v. 58, no. 6 p.981-989dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl4237928x1612-46427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-012-0641-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245016400176300001400340520174300354592002802097650002202125650002802147650001102175650001202186650001302198650000902211650002202220650002702242650001102269650001302280653002202293653000902315653002202324653000802346653001002354653001802364700003302382700002802415700002402443773011902467856008302586852000902669655001202678IND60584236020221120082405.0181002e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058423602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2017.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRissoli, Rafael Zanelli10aEffects of exercise training on excitation-contraction coupling, calcium dynamics and protein expression in the heart of the Neotropical fish Brycon amazonicus  ap. 85-93.  aMatrinxã (Brycon amazonicus) is a great swimming performance teleost fish from the Amazon basin. However, the possible cardiac adaptations of this ability are still unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to investigate the effects of prolonged exercise (EX group - 60days under 0.4BL·s⁻¹) on ventricular contractility by (i) in-vitro analysis of contractility comparing the relative roles of sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling and (ii) molecular analysis of NCX, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase (SERCA2) and phospholamban (PLB) expression and quantification. The exercise training significantly improved twitch tension, cardiac pumping capacity and the contraction rate when compared to controls (CT). Inhibition of the NCX function, replacing Na⁺ by Li⁺ in the physiological solutions, diminished cardiac contractility in the EX group, reduced all analyzed parameters under both high and low stimulation frequencies. The SR blockage, using 10μM ryanodine, caused ~50% tension reduction in CT at most analyzed frequencies while in EX, reductions (34–54%) were only found at higher frequencies. SR inhibition also decreased contraction and relaxation rates in both groups. Additionally, higher post-rest contraction values were recorded for EX, indicating an increase in SR Ca²⁺ loading. Higher NCX and PLB expression rates and lower SERCA2 rates were found in EX. Our data indicate that matrinxã presents a modulation in E-C coupling after exercise-training, enhancing the SR function under higher frequencies. This was the first study to functionally analyze the effects of swimming-induced exercise on fish cardiac E-C coupling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrycon amazonicus 3aCa2-transporting ATPase 3abasins 3acalcium 3aexercise 3afish 3aprotein synthesis 3asarcoplasmic reticulum 3asodium 3aswimming 0aBrycon amazonicus 0aFish 0aSwimming exercise 0aNCX 0aSERCA 0aPhospholamban1 aVasconcelos, Eliton da Silva1 aRantin, Francisco Tadeu1 aKalinin, Ana Lúcia0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2017 Dec., v. 214 p.85-93dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12014x1095-64337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2017.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03726naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002900146245011800175300001600293506002800309520212500337592002802462506003702490650002302527650001502550650001302565650000902578650002102587650002802608650001502636650001302651650001502664650001102679650001902690650001502709650001802724650001402742650001602756650000902772653001402781653001102795653001502806653001702821653001302838700001902851700001802870700002302888700002602911773015702937856008103094852000903175655001203184IND60775162220221207093401.0191021e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077516222DNAL7 a10.24845/ijfac.v4.i3.1262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyabania, Nyimas Febrika14aThe Light Transmittance and Electrical Conductivity Properties of Gelam Wood Carbon Nanosheet and Its Derivatives  ap. 126-131.  aResource is Open Access  aThe research on the preparation and characterization of transparent electrode carbon nanosheet based gelam woods bark doped with SnO2-SbO2.

The ratio of the integrated intensities (IG/ID = 0.89 for CNS, 0.85 for CNS-O, and 0.93 for rCNSO of Raman spectroscopy is significantly high. Electrical conductivity of transparent electrode ranges from 1.26 x 10-7 Scm-1 – 5.03 x 10-7Scm -1. The highest conductivity value on transparent electrode contained rCNSO. This result inferred that the usage of rCNSO can increase electrical conductivity. Therefore, the higher value of electrical conductivity can be related to the value of La. The average maximum absorption wavelength is observed at 350-530 nm which means that the transition of the electronic transition π→π* occurs in the conjugated carbons system. Electrical conductivity of transparent electrode ranges from 1.26 x 10-7 Scm-1 – 5.03 x 10-7 Scm -1. The highest conductivity value on transparent electrode contained rCNSO. The band gap values in the transparent electrode range from 2 eV - 3 eV which means they have conductor – semiconductor characters.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aalcohols 3abark 3acarboxylic acids 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3ananosheets 3aoxygen 3asemiconductors 3asonication 3atransmittance 3avibration 3awavelengths 3awood 0aNanosheet 0aCarbon 0aElectrical 0aConductivity 0aDerivate1 aSyarif, Nirwan1 aRohendi, Dedi1 aWandasari, Mellysa1 aRengga, Wara Dyahpita0 tIJFAC (Indonesian Journal of Fundamental and Applied Chemistry).g2019 Oct., v. 4, no. 3 p.126-131dSriwijaya UniversitywJournal:27892x2540-94097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.24845/ijfac.v4.i3.1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03527naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001200183245011200195520175500307592002802062596004802090596006802138596007702206650002102283650002602304650002602330650001602356650001602372650001302388650002002401650002902421650001302450650001202463700001902475700001302494700001402507700001802521700001902539700001902558700001402577700005502591700001702646700001402663700001302677700005302690700005402743773010302797856007602900852000902976655001202985IND60662533120221116203747.0190904e20190818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066253312DNAL7 a10.1155/2019/54591902doi7 aPMC67215002pmcid7 a315313392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Fei10aMolecular Characterization of a Multidrug-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae Strain R46 Isolated from a Rabbit  aTo investigate the mechanisms of multiple resistance and the horizontal transfer of resistance genes in animal pathogens, we characterized the molecular structures of the resistance gene-related sequences in a multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain R46 isolated from a rabbit. Molecular cloning was performed to clone the resistance genes, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured to determine the resistance characteristics of the cloned genes and related strains. A conjugation experiment was conducted to assess the transferability of the resistance plasmids. Sequencing and comparative genomic methods were used to analyze the structures of the resistance gene-related sequences. The K. pneumoniae R46 genome consisted of a chromosome and three resistance plasmids named pR46-27, pR46-42, and pR46-270, respectively. The whole genome encoded 34 antibiotic resistance genes including a newly identified chromosome-encoded florfenicol resistance gene named mdfA2. pR46-270, besides encoding 26 antibiotic resistance genes, carried four clusters of heavy metal resistance genes and several virulence-related genes or gene clusters. The plasmid-encoded resistance genes were mostly associated with mobile genetic elements. The plasmid with the most similarity to the floR gene-harboring plasmid pR46-27 was pCTXM-2271, a plasmid from Escherichia coli. The results of this work demonstrated that the plasmids with multidrug resistance genes were present in animal-derived bacteria and more florfenicol resistance genes such as mdfA2 could be present in bacterial populations. The resistance genes encoded on the plasmids may spread between the bacteria of different species or genera and cause the resistance dissemination.  aPublisher supplied data  a201802125cInner Mongolia Autonomous Region  a80215049 31500109cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aLY14C060005 LQ17H190001cNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aantibiotic resistance 3achromosomes 3aflorfenicol 3agenomics 3ametal tolerance 3amultiple drug resistance 3aplasmids 3arabbits1 aYing, Yuanyuan1 aYin, Min1 aJiang, Yi1 aWu, Chongyang1 aQian, Changrui1 aChen, Qianqian1 aShen, Kai1 aCheng, Cong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2154-28211 aZhu, Licheng1 aLi, Kewei1 aXu, Teng1 aBao, Qiyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9550-82661 aLu, Junwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7378-67830 tInternational Journal of Genomics.g2019 Aug. 18, v. 2019dHindawiwJournal:26808x2314-43787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/54591903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100007500153245010800228300001600336520107500352592002801427650003701455650001601492650002201508650001501530650001201545650001801557650001401575650001901589650001401608650002401622650002001646650001301666650002601679650001401705650001301719650001601732650001701748650001001765650002101775653000801796653001601804653001701820653002601837653002001863653001401883700003001897700007001927773012101997856008802118852000902206655001202215IND60625804620221120072309.0200621e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062580462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVargas Aguirre, Carlos Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6203-412410aEffect of arbuscular mycorrhizae and mercury on Lactuca sativa (Asteraceae) seedling morpho—histology  ap. 197-202.  aGermination and postgermination are essential processes in plant establishment, which are affected by several biotic and abiotic factors. In this job we performed an experiment to evaluate the effect of the arbuscular – mycorrhizal fungi and mercury pollution in postgerminated seedlings of Lactuca sativa, assessing their morphogenesis and cell architecture. Seeds of L. sativa were planted in substrates polluted with mercury with and without arbuscular mycorrhizae. The colonization percentage in seedlings, root length and cell morphology state were measured with histological staining in seedlings harvested seven days after planting. It was found that arbuscular – mycorrhizae enhance root elongation and seedling development, but do not prevent cell damage in roots and hypocotyl caused by oxidative stress. Mercury and arbuscular – mycorrhizal fungi effects where more sharpen in roots than in hypocotyl. It is hypothesized that the better condition of mycorrhizal seedlings occurs due to the nutritional benefits that mycorrhizae cause in these seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3agermination 3amycorrhizal fungi 3ahypocotyls 3amercury 3amorphogenesis 3ahistology 3aLactuca sativa 3aseedlings 3aplant establishment 3anutritive value 3astaining 3aenvironmental factors 3apollution 3aplanting 3aroot growth 3acell biology 3aroots 3aoxidative stress 0aAMF 0aCell damage 0aHeavy metals 0aMycorrhizal symbiosis 0aPostgermination 0aTolerance1 aRivera Páez, Fredy Arvey1 aEscobar Vargas, Sebastián1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2773-53440 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2018 Dec., v. 156 p.197-202dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245010500208300001600313520137200329592002801701650002201729650002201751650001101773650002201784650002101806650001701827650000901844650001801853650001301871650002201884650003401906650001301940650001601953700005501969700001602024700002002040773009002060856008502150852000902235655001202244IND60679546020221121232839.0200221e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067954602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.12.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDang, Dingying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1243-985710aFreeze-dried low-tortuous graphite electrodes with enhanced capacity utilization and rate capability  ap. 133-139.  aLithium ion battery electrodes with high rate capability are important for extreme fast charging (XFC) for electric vehicle applications. Making low-tortuous electrodes is one of the approaches to achieve XFC by enhancing ionic transport in the electrodes. In this study, we conducted directional freeze-drying of slurries cast on a copper foil to make graphite electrodes. Low-tortuous structure was created and verified by cross-sectional scanning electron microscope observations and tortuosity measurements. The out-of-plane alignment of graphite flakes, enhanced electrolyte wettability, and low tortuosity of the freeze-dried electrodes were confirmed by X-ray diffraction measurements, wettability tests, and electrochemical impedance measurements, respectively. Electrochemical measurements showed that the freeze-dried electrodes have higher capacity retention (over 8% higher after 90 cycles at C/5) and better rate capability (60% higher capacity at 1C) than the electrodes prepared by the conventional tape-casting method. These enhancements mainly arise from the improved ionic transport by the freeze-drying induced low-tortuous structure. This study provides a proof-of-concept example that tape-casting/freeze-drying can be an effective, low cost, and scalable method to reduce tortuosity and improve electrochemical performance of battery electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon electrodes 3acopper 3aelectric vehicles 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3afoil 3afreeze drying 3agraphene 3alithium batteries 3ascanning electron microscopes 3aslurries 3awettability1 aWang, Yikai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1156-03241 aGao, Shuang1 aCheng, Yang-Tse0 tCarbon.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 159 p.133-139dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.12.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04763naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015500168300001600323520246900339592002802808650001502836650002402851650002502875650002502900650001802925650001302943650001102956650002302967650001402990650004203004650003603046650002203082650001403104650001103118650001103129650002003140650001503160650001503175650001803190650000903208650002103217650002503238651001803263653003503281653002203316653002503338653002003363653003303383653001103416653001303427653000803440653000903448653000803457653000703465653000803472653000803480653001003488653000903498653000803507653000803515653000803523653000803531653000803539653000703547653000903554653000803563653000803571653000703579700001903586700001203605700003003617700005603647773012403703856008503827852000903912655001203921IND60635949320221119165619.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063594932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.03.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haimiao10aShort-term soil-waterlogging contributes to cotton cross tolerance to chronic elevated temperature by regulating ROS metabolism in the subtending leaf  ap. 333-341.  aChronic elevated temperature and soil-waterlogging events often occur concomitantly in the Yangtze River Valley; however, a clear understanding of the effects of aforementioned co-occurring stresses on antioxidant defense in cotton has not been attained. To address this, two temperature conditions during the whole flowering and boll development periods, and three soil-waterlogging levels (0, 3, 6 d) starting on the day of anthesis were established. In the current study, no siginificant difference was observed on plant performance for 3 d soil-waterlogging, whereas 6 d soil-waterlogging event and elevated temperature in isolation negatively affected plant performance (i.e. leaf area declined by 33.3% and 14.7% in AW6 (soil waterlogging for 6 d under ambient temperature regime) and EC (soil well-watered (SRWC(75 ± 5) %) under elevated temperature for 2–3 °C) relative to AC (soil well-watered (SRWC(75 ± 5) %) under ambient temperature regime)) and induced ROS (reactive oxygen species) production and scavenging mechanisms in the subtending leaf of cotton. SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), and POX (peroxidase) activities were increased, and ASA (ascorbic acid) concentration was enhanced due to higher H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) and O2− accumulations. Whereas, APX (ascorbate peroxidase), DHAR (dehydroascorbate reductase) and GR (glutathione reductase) activities were inhibited under elevated temperature regime or waterlogging event, especially in the treatment of EW6 (soil waterlogging for 6 d under elevated temperature for 2–3 °C), which resulted in increasing H2O2 concentration and higher O2− generation rate. However, plants acclimated to a short-term waterlogging stress (3 d) performed a cross tolerance to chronic elevated temperature regime (leaf number increased by 11.4%, whereas the abscission rate decreased by 4.6% in EW3 (soil waterlogging for 3 d under elevated temperature for 2–3 °C) compared with EC (soil well-watered (SRWC(75 ± 5) %) under elevated temperature for 2–3 °C)).

On seven occasions during the year in the central Spain site, and along the soil moisture gradient in north-eastern Spain, we measured rates of leaf RD, RL (using the Kok method), light-saturated photosynthesis (A) and related light response characteristics, leaf mass per unit area (MA) and leaf nitrogen (N) content. At the central Spain site, significant seasonal changes in soil water content and ambient temperature (T) were associated with changes in MA, foliar N, A and stomatal conductance. RD measured at the prevailing daily T and in instantaneous R–T responses, displayed signs of partial acclimation and was not significantly affected by time of year. RL was always less than, and strongly related to, RD, and RL/RD did not vary significantly or systematically with seasonal changes in T or soil water content. Averaged over the year, RL/RD was 0.66±0.05s.e. (n=14) at the central Spain site. At the north-eastern Spain site, the soil moisture gradient was characterised by increasing MA and RD, and reduced foliar N, A, and stomatal conductance as soil water availability decreased. Light inhibition of R occurred across all sites (mean RL/RD=0.69±0.01s.e. (n=18)), resulting in ratios of RL/A being lower than for RD/A. Importantly, the degree of light inhibition was largely insensitive to changes in soil water content. Our findings provide evidence for a relatively constrained degree of light inhibition of R (RL/RD ~ 0.7, or inhibition of ~30%) across gradients of water availability, although the combined impacts of seasonal changes in both T and soil water content increase the range of values expressed. The findings thus have implications in terms of the assumptions made by predictive models that seek to account for light inhibition of R, and for our understanding of how environmental gradients impact on leaf trait relationships in Mediterranean plant communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus ilex 3aacclimation 3aambient temperature 3aforests 3aleaves 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant available water 3aplant communities 3aseasonal variation 3asoil water content 3astomatal conductance 3awoodlands 3aSpain 0aKok effect 0aleaf functional traits 0aleaf dark respiration 0aleaf light respiration 0aleaf mass per unit area 0anitrogen 0aphotosynthesis 0aplasticity 0aseason 0asoil moisture 0atemperature1 aOgaya, Romà1 aBarbeta, Adrià1 aPeñuelas, Josep1 aZaragoza-Castells, Joana1 aAtkin, Owen K.1 aValladares, Fernando1 aGimeno, Teresa E.1 aPías, Beatriz1 aGriffin, Kevin L.0 tFunctional plant biology.g2017, v. 44, no. 12 p.1178-1193dCSIRO Publishingx1445-44087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP170323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100004800149245013500197300001600332520175500348592002802103650002002131650002602151650002702177650002402204650001702228650001102245650002102256650002902277650002602306650001202332650001502344650001902359650001402378650001502392653002502407653004002432653001202472653002002484653001702504653001602521700003102537700002402568700002302592700001702615700002002632700002202652773014702674856008402821852000902905655001202914IND60584236420221121230934.0181002e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058423642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2017.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenriques de Jesus, Maria Perestrello Ramos10aTat proteins as novel thylakoid membrane anchors organize a biosynthetic pathway in chloroplasts and increase product yield 5-fold  ap. 108-116.  aPhotosynthesis drives the production of ATP and NADPH, and acts as a source of carbon for primary metabolism. NADPH is also used in the production of many natural bioactive compounds. These are usually synthesized in low quantities and are often difficult to produce by chemical synthesis due to their complex structures. Some of the crucial enzymes catalyzing their biosynthesis are the cytochromes P450 (P450s) situated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), powered by electron transfers from NADPH. Dhurrin is a cyanogenic glucoside and its biosynthesis involves a dynamic metabolon formed by two P450s, a UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT) and a P450 oxidoreductase (POR). Its biosynthetic pathway has been relocated to the chloroplast where ferredoxin, reduced through the photosynthetic electron transport chain, serves as an efficient electron donor to the P450s, bypassing the involvement of POR. Nevertheless, translocation of the pathway from the ER to the chloroplast creates other difficulties, such as the loss of metabolon formation and intermediate diversion into other metabolic pathways. We show here that co-localization of these enzymes in the thylakoid membrane leads to a significant increase in product formation, with a concomitant decrease in off-pathway intermediates. This was achieved by exchanging the membrane anchors of the dhurrin pathway enzymes to components of the Twin-arginine translocation pathway, TatB and TatC, which have self-assembly properties. Consequently, we show 5-fold increased titers of dhurrin and a decrease in the amounts of intermediates and side products in Nicotiana benthamiana. Further, results suggest that targeting the UGT to the membrane is a key factor to achieve efficient substrate channeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abioactive compounds 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3acytochrome P-450 3aelectron transport chain 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aenzymes 3aglucosides 3aphotosynthesis 3asynthesis 3athylakoids 0aSubstrate channeling 0aTwin-arginine translocation pathway 0aDhurrin 0aFusion proteins 0aLight-driven 0aChloroplast1 aZygadlo Nielsen, Agnieszka1 aBusck Mellor, Silas1 aMatthes, Annemarie1 aBurow, Meike1 aRobinson, Colin1 aErik Jensen, Poul0 tMetabolic engineering.g2017 Nov., v. 44 p.108-116dElsevier Inc.aInternational Metabolic Engineering SocietywJournal:12015x1096-71767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2017.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015200168520142700320592002801747650001501775650002001790650002201810650002001832650001201852650002801864650001501892650001601907650002301923653002001946653003001966653001601996653004302012700001602055700001902071700005702090773011402147856008502261852000902346655001202355IND60776746320221119214101.0220706e20220621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077674632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4631332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Hui-Ling10aUrea-linked covalent organic framework functionalized polytetrafluoroethylene film for selective and rapid thin film microextraction of rhodamine B  aIncorporation of highly selective and stable adsorbent with facile extraction technology is desired in practical analysis.

The COF-117-PTFE based TFME coupled with high performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLD) successfully realized the determination of RB with the limit of detection of 0.007 μg L⁻¹, the linear range of 0.1 - 100 μg L⁻¹. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of intraday (n = 5) and interday (n = 5) for the determination of 10 μg L⁻¹ RB were 2.3% and 6.8%, respectively. The absolute recoveries were 80.3%, 71.2% and 67.9% in river water, chili powder and Sichuan pepper powder, respectively. The recoveries for RB spiking in complicated real samples (dry chili, chili powder, dry Sichuan pepper, Sichuan pepper powder and river water) ranged from 90.4% to 107.5%. The developed COF-117-PTFE based TFME-HPLC-FLD method is promising in practical application. This work reveals the high potential of functionalized COF film as the adsorbent for effective extraction of trace contaminants in complicated samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3adetection limit 3afilms (materials) 3amicroextraction 3apeppers 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3arhodamines 3ariver water 3astandard deviation 0aUrea-linked COF 0aThin film microextraction 0aRhodamine B 0aHigh performance liquid chromatography1 aYang, Cheng1 aQian, Hai-Long1 aYan, Xiu-Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9953-76810 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 June 21, v. 1673 p.463133-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4631333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012800162506002800290520136000318592002801678506003701706653000601743653000901749653003201758653001501790700001201805773015601817856007901973852000902052655001202061IND60773928920221207064010.0160115e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077392892DNAL7 a10.19113/sdufbed.049022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaydar, N.G. 10aIsparta Koşullarında Aşılı Asma Fidanı Üretiminde Farklı Çeşit/Anaç Kombinasyonlarının Karşılaştırılması  aResource is Open Access  aBu araştırmada farklı çeşit/anaç kombinasyonlarının Isparta koşullarında aşı yerinde kallus oluşum oranı, fidan randımanı, 1. boy fidan randımanı ile fidanlarda sürgünlerin odunlaşma düzeyi üzerine olan etkileri incelenmiştir.

Pigs were randomly allotted to one of three dietary treatments such as CON (basal diet); MC1 (basal diet + 0.1% protected organic acids); and MC2 (basal diet + 0.2% protected organic acids). Pigs fed the MC1 and MC2 diets increased (P < 0.05) average daily gain and gain to feed ratio compared with the CON diet from weeks 0 to 5 and during the whole experiment. Pigs fed the MC1 and MC2 diets increased (P < 0.05) concentration of immunoglobulin G (IgG) compared with the CON diet at the 5th week. Administration of the MC1 and MC2 diets increased Lactobacillus counts and decreased Escherichia coli counts compared with the CON diet (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences were found on nutrient digestibility, meat quality, and faecal noxious gas emission among treatments. In conclusion, the blend of OAs and MCFAs supplementation increased growth performance, the concentration of IgG, and the Lactobacillus counts, as well as decreased the E. coli counts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus 3aYorkshire (swine breed) 3aaverage daily gain 3ablood 3abody weight 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afinishing 3agrowth performance 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alandraces 3amedium chain fatty acids 3apork quality 3aswine 3aswine feeding 0afinishing pig 0amicroflora 0ablend of organic acids and medium-chain fatty acids1 aLee, K.Y.1 aTran, H.N.1 aKim, I.H.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2018 Nov. 13, v. 99, no. 3 p.448-455dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1932x1918-18257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjas-2016-01743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012800169300001600297500001900313520111800332592002801450650001501478650001501493650001601508650001201524650001401536650002501550650002201575650001801597650001501615650001301630650001101643650001901654650000701673650001501680650001501695653001701710653002801727700001901755700001901774700002101793773013501814856008701949852000902036655001202045IND60698529020221120195729.0200913e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069852902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.06.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBisla, Vivek10aGreen and novel adsorbent from rice straw extracted cellulose for efficient adsorption of Hg (II) ions in an aqueous medium  ap. 194-203.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCellulose nanofibrils (CNF) were extracted from rice straw, a waste lignocellulosic biomass, using soda cooking, which resulted in a reduction of the recalcitrance of biomass, leading to hydrolysis of hemicellulose into sugars, which was subsequently washed, leaving a residue of cellulose. FTIR confirmed the removal of lignin and hemicellulose to yield pure CNF while XRD, DTG and TGA results showed increased crystallinity and thus higher thermal stability.CNFs were functionalized using l-methionine, a natural amino acid, to graft sulfides and amino functional groups onto the surface of fibers. Structural and morphological changes induced by grafting were confirmed by FTIR, XRD, TEM, Mapping and Elemental analysis. Modified fibers exhibited a high adsorption capacity of 131.86 mg/g for Hg (II) ions even at low concentration i.e. 300 ppm owing to sulfides. Optimization of pH on adsorption behavior was established through extensive pH studies and adsorption kinetics. Adsorption follows pseudo second order kinetic model indicating chemisorption for removal of Hg (II) ions from simulated wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aamino acids 3abiomass 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3acrystal structure 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysis 3akinetics 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3apH 3arice straw 3awastewater 0aL-methionine 0aMercury ions adsorption1 aRattan, Gaurav1 aSinghal, Sonal1 aKaushik, Anupama0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 161 p.194-203dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.06.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245008200158300001800240520136300258592002801621650002001649650001101669650001401680650001801694650001401712650001401726650001701740650001601757650001901773650001101792650002001803650001801823650001301841653001701854653001901871653001701890653002001907653001901927700002701946700002001973700002501993700002702018700002202045700001902067700001702086700001902103700001702122700001902139773009802158856007102256852000902327655001202336IND60585285520221119071349.0171108s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058528552DNAL7 a10.1071/FP170492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTilbrook, Joanne10aVariation in shoot tolerance mechanisms not related to ion toxicity in barley  ap. 1194-1206.  aSoil salinity can severely reduce crop growth and yield. Many studies have investigated salinity tolerance mechanisms in cereals using phenotypes that are relatively easy to measure. The majority of these studies measured the accumulation of shoot Na+ and the effect this has on plant growth. However, plant growth is reduced immediately after exposure to NaCl before Na+ accumulates to toxic concentrations in the shoot. In this study, nondestructive and destructive measurements are used to evaluate the responses of 24 predominately Australian barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) lines at 0, 150 and 250mM NaCl. Considerable variation for shoot tolerance mechanisms not related to ion toxicity (shoot ion-independent tolerance) was found, with some lines being able to maintain substantial growth rates under salt stress, whereas others stopped growing. Hordeum vulgare spp. spontaneum accessions and barley landraces predominantly had the best shoot ion independent tolerance, although two commercial cultivars, Fathom and Skiff, also had high tolerance. The tolerance of cv. Fathom may be caused by a recent introgression from H. vulgare L. spp. spontaneum. This study shows that the most salt-tolerant barley lines are those that contain both shoot ion-independent tolerance and the ability to exclude Na+ from the shoot (and thus maintain high K+:Na+ ratios).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3acultivars 3aintrogression 3alandraces 3aphenotype 3aplant growth 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asoil salinity 3atoxicity 0aHordeum spp. 0aosmotic stress 0aplant growth 0aplant phenomics 0asalt tolerance1 aSchilling, Rhiannon K.1 aBerger, Bettina1 aGarcia, Alexandre F.1 aTrittermann, Christine1 aCoventry, Stewart1 aRabie, Huwaida1 aBrien, Chris1 aNguyen, Martin1 aTester, Mark1 aRoy, Stuart J.0 tFunctional plant biology.g2017, v. 44, no. 12 p.1194-1206dCSIRO Publishingx1445-44087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP170493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245013700164300001600301500001900317520147100336592002801807650002501835650001701860650001901877650001501896650001101911650001101922650002101933650002001954650001301974650001701987650002102004650001602025653002202041653003202063700001302095700001302108700001302121700001602134700001702150773013502167856008702302852000902389655001202398IND60698529120221120195658.0200913e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069852912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.06.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Di10aStructural characterization and antioxidant activity of water-soluble lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCCs) isolated from wheat straw  ap. 315-324.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLignin-carbohydrate complex (LCC) was proven to possess antioxidant activities. To understand structures and antioxidant activities of LCC, water-soluble LCC-stalk, LCC-sheath and LCC-leaf were isolated from ball-milled wheat straw stalk, sheath and leaf by successive dissolution in LiCl/DMSO solvent, water extraction and purification. LCCs were later structurally characterized by wet chemistry, chromatography and spectroscopy respectively. Their antioxidant activities were evaluated by ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and DPPH radical scavenging assays. The results showed that three LCCs were carbohydrate-rich (≈70%) and presented relatively narrow molecular weight distribution (PI < 2.0). The lignin moieties of LCCs were mainly connected with β-O-4′ structures, and phenyl glycoside and γ-ester linkages were main LCC linkages in LCCs. However, guaiacyl units were the predominant lignin units in LCC-stalk and LCC-sheath, while syringyl units were predominant in LCC-leaf. Intermolecular cross-linkages were mainly pCA-bridges in LCC-stalk and FA-bridges in LCC-sheath and LCC-leaf. Besides, LCC-sheath featured higher polysaccharide content exhibited higher molecular weight, fewer LCC linkages and better antioxidant activities (DPPH radical scavenging rate up to 74.91%) than both LCC-stalk (74.55%) and LCC-leaf (64.52%). This work helped to know LCCs in wheat straw well and inspire the application of LCC as potential antioxidants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3achromatography 3aglycosides 3aleaves 3alignin 3amolecular weight 3apolysaccharides 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 3awater solubility 3awheat straw 0aWater-soluble LCC 0aStructural characterization1 aGan, Tao1 aSu, Chen1 aHan, Yin1 aLiu, Zhulan1 aCao, Yunfeng0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 161 p.315-324dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.06.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245011200164300001400276520156800290592002801858650002001886650002101906650002901927650001301956650001101969650002401980650002502004650001702029650001702046650001102063650001602074650001102090650001702101650001402118650001902132653001702151653002202168653002002190653002102210653002502231700002102256700002502277700001702302700001802319700002202337700001602359700001502375773014502390856008402535852000902619655001202628IND60584236720221121230914.0181002e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058423672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2017.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jian10aEngineering a bacterial platform for total biosynthesis of caffeic acid derived phenethyl esters and amides  ap. 89-99.  aCaffeic acid has been widely recognized as a versatile pharmacophore for synthesis of new chemical entities, among which caffeic acid derived phenethyl esters and amides are the most extensively-investigated bioactive compounds with potential therapeutical applications. However, the natural biosynthetic routes for caffeic acid derived phenethyl esters or amides remain enigmatic, limiting their bio-based production. Herein, product-directed design of biosynthetic schemes allowed the development of thermodynamically favorable pathways for these compounds via acyltransferase (ATF) mediated trans-esterification. Production based screening identified a microbial O-ATF from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a plant N-ATF from Capsicum annuum capable of forming caffeic acid derived esters and amides, respectively. Subsequent combinatorial incorporation of caffeic acid with various aromatic alcohol or amine biosynthetic pathways permitted the de novo bacterial production of a panel of caffeic acid derived phenethyl esters or amides in Escherichia coli for the first time. Particularly, host strain engineering via systematic knocking out endogenous caffeoyl-CoA degrading thioesterase and pathway optimization via titrating co-substrates enabled production enhancement of five caffeic acid derived phenethyl esters and amides, with titers ranging from 9.2 to 369.1mg/L. This platform expanded the capabilities of bacterial production of high-value natural aromatic esters and amides from renewable carbon source via tailoring non-natural biosynthetic pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aEscherichia coli 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalcohols 3aamides 3abioactive compounds 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acaffeic acid 3acarbon 3aengineering 3aesters 3apharmacology 3ascreening 3athermodynamics 0aCaffeic acid 0aEsters and amides 0aAcyltransferase 0aHost engineering 0aPromoter engineering1 aMahajani, Monika1 aJackson, Sheneika L.1 aYang, Yaping1 aChen, Mengyin1 aFerreira, Eric M.1 aLin, Yuheng1 aYan, Yajun0 tMetabolic engineering.g2017 Nov., v. 44 p.89-99dElsevier Inc.aInternational Metabolic Engineering SocietywJournal:12015x1096-71767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2017.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01998naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001500137245007100152300001600223520111000239592002801349650002301377650002501400650002401425650001201449650001501461650001301476700001701489773011001506856007101616852000901687655001201696IND60518334620221120060848.0160412e198902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051833462DNAL7 a10.2307/19430752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDay, R.

Monte Carlo simulations on normal and lognormal data indicate that many of the tests commonly used are inappropriate or inefficient. Particular tests are recommended for unplanned multiple comparisons on the basis of controlling experimentwise type I error rate and providing maximum power. These include tests for parametric and nonparametric cases, equal and unequal sample sizes, homogeneous and heterogeneous variances, non—independent means (repeated measures or adjusted means), and comparing treatments to a control. Formulae and a worked example are provided. The problem of violations of assumptions, especially variance heterogeneity, was investigated using simulations, and particular strategies are recommended. The advantages and use of planned comparisons in ecology are discussed, and the philosophy of hypothesis testing with unplanned multiple comparisons is considered in relation to confidence intervals and statistical estimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aanalysis of variance 3aconfidence interval 3aecology 3aphilosophy 3avariance1 aQuinn, G.

Both commercially available alkali-earth metal oxides as well as three synthetic MgO catalysts were used in this study. Chemical composition and physico-chemical properties, such as morphology, crystal surface geometry and porosity of catalysts were demonstrated to influence the yield and quality of graphene-like carbon nanosheets. Among investigated oxides, the MgO, CaO and SrO displayed different catalytic ability towards the growth of graphene-like carbon nanosheets determined by chemical compositions. The effect of physico-chemical properties was suggested by different properties of carbon products over synthetic MgO. MgO catalysts synthesized with ammonia produced the lowest defect level (ID/IG = 0.26) while MgO synthesized with urea and ethylene glycol produced the highest yield (12.1% per catalyst mass) of graphene-like carbon nanosheets compared to the other catalysts. The lower defect level and higher graphitization degree were attributed to well-defined morphology with uniform oxide crystal particle size and improvement of crystal orientation along (200) lattice plane in the catalyst. The higher yield was related to the higher porosity of catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline earth metals 3aammonia 3aatmospheric pressure 3acalcium oxide 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical composition 3aethanol 3aethylene glycol 3ageometry 3amagnesium oxide 3ananosheets 3aparticle size 3aphysicochemical properties 3aporosity 3aurea 3avapors1 aVeksha, Andrei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4647-03421 aLisak, Grzegorz0 tCarbon.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 159 p.378-389dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.12.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016200164300001500326520162200341592002801963650001501991650002202006650001702028650003102045650002202076650001802098650001102116650001602127650001102143651001202154653003102166653003102197653001702228653001502245653002202260700002502282700001702307700001902324700002002343700002002363700002102383773012202404856008202526852000902608655001202617IND60635949820221119165913.0190711e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063594982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2019.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAjtai, Tibor10aDiurnal variation of aethalometer correction factors and optical absorption assessment of nucleation events using multi-wavelength photoacoustic spectroscopy  ap. 96-109.  aA field measurement campaign was carried out during the late winter and early spring of 2015 in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. The size distribution (SD) and optical absorption of carbonaceous particulate matter (CPM) was measured online using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), a 7λ-aethalometer and an inhouse developed 4λ-Photoacoustic Spectrometer. Based on the SD data, the measurement period could be classified into days with and without new particle formation events (normal days and nucleation days), although particular nucleation-like events were observed on normal days as well. Three characteristic size modes were observed with CMDs of circa 15, 25 and 110 nm that corresponded to the nucleation, traffic and heating modes. Based on the temporal behavior of these modes both types of days were divided into distinctive daily periods (heating hours, traffic hours and nucleation hours). The optical absorption spectra (OAC and AAE) also displayed the same part of day behavior to that of SD. That way this paper is among the first to assess the optical response of urban nucleation events. Due to the simultaneous measurement of OAC by the 7λ-aethalometer and a 4λ-Photoacoustic Spectrometer, OAC was measured overall at 11 wavelengths. That way aethalometer correction factors (f and C) were determined at all aethalometer wavelengths using in situ reference photoacoustic measurements. Correction factors were found to have both wavelength and time of the day variation. In the case of f, no clear trend could be observed, however, Cref values increased both as a function of wavelength.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adiurnal variation 3aparticulates 3aphotoacoustic spectroscopy 3aspectral analysis 3aspectrometers 3aspring 3awavelengths 3awinter 3aHungary 0aPhotoacoustic spectroscopy 0aAerosol Angström exponent 0aAethalometer 0aNucleation 0aSize distribution1 aKiss-Albert, Gergely1 aUtry, Noémi1 aTóth, Ádám,1 aHoffer, András1 aSzabó, Gábor,1 aBozóki, Zoltán0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2019 Sept., v. 83 p.96-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2019.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02226naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245005600157300001800213520132900231592002801560653002001588653002801608653003101636653002001667653001001687700002701697773013001724856007301854852000901927655001201936IND60516948120221119042629.0160327e20120814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051694812DNAL7 a10.1139/y2012-0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOstadal, Petr10aWomen and the management of acute coronary syndrome  ap. 1151-1159.  aCoronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both men and women in the developed countries. Despite this fact, females are still under-represented in the majority of clinical trials. At the present time, only limited evidence is available with respect to the female-specific aspects of pathogenesis, management, and outcomes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Women less frequently undergo coronary intervention, and a lower proportion of women receive evidence-based pharmacotherapy, compared with men. It has been shown that women benefit from an invasive approach and coronary intervention in ACS as much as men, despite their advanced age and higher rate of bleeding complications. Also, administration of beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, and intensive statin therapy is associated with a comparable reduction of cardiovascular event rates in women and men. On the other hand, women may profit less than men from fibrinolytic or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy. Both sexes benefit equally from aspirin therapy, whereas contradictory data are available on the efficacy of clopidogrel in women. There is an urgent need for intensive research in the development of female-specific therapeutic strategy in ACS, even though the detailed mechanisms of sex differences are still unknown.  aPublisher supplied data 0asex differences 0aacute coronary syndrome 0acoronary revascularization 0apharmacotherapy 0awomen1 aOšt̕ádal, Bohuslav,0 tCanadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology.g2012 Aug. 14, v. 90, no. 9 p.1151-1159dNRC Research Pressx1205-75417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/y2012-0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002200163245009800185300001400283520100800297592002801305650001301333650001701346650001901363650002001382650001601402650002301418650001901441650001901460650001201479650002401491650001201515650002401527650000901551650001301560650001601573650001001589650003401599650004301633650001901676650005801695650002001753650001101773650003001784650001101814650002501825650002001850650005701870650002701927650002401954650001101978650003101989650001902020650001402039650002602053650001602079651000902095651000902104700003002113700002202143773010102165856008402266852000902350655001202359IND4481108120221121001121.0120502e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448110812DNAL7 a220581202pmid7 a10.1177/08903344114227032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatias, Susana L.10aDeterminants of Exclusive Breastfeeding in a Cohort of Primiparous Periurban Peruvian Mothers  ap. 45-54.  aThe authors aimed to identify factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) among 117 Peruvian mothers planning to breastfeed exclusively. Data were collected on days 0 and 3, and months 1, 3, and 6. Exclusive breastfeeding status was evaluated with a 24-hour recall of infant diet. Exclusive breastfeeding rates were 74%, 72%, and 35% at 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively. At 3 months, lower maternal education, greater breastfeeding frequency (day 3), greater breast pain (day 3), and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate use (3 months) were associated with EBF, after adjusting for EBF intentions. At 6 months, greater infant birth weight and mother–not employed were associated with EBF, after controlling for EBF intentions. More educated and working mothers, and infants with lower birth weight should be targeted in interventions to promote EBF in urban Peru. Research is also warranted to explore the factors linking depot medroxyprogesterone acetate use and breast pain with EBF duration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3abirth weight 3abreast feeding 3adata collection 3adiet recall 3aeducational status 3aemployed women 3ainfant feeding 3ainfants 3amedroxyprogesterone 3amothers 3anutrition education 3apain 3aplanning 3aurban areas 2aAdult 2aAttitude to Healthxethnology 2aBreast Feedingxethnologyxpsychology. 2aCohort Studies 2aContraceptive Agents, Femalexadministration & dosage 2aDecision Making 2aFemale 2aHealth Promotionxmethods 2aHumans 2aInfant Carexmethods 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMedroxyprogesterone Acetatexadministration & dosage 2aMother-Child Relations 2aMothersxpsychology 2aParity 2aPatient Education as Topic 2aPostnatal Care 2aPregnancy 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aYoung Adult 3aPeru 0aPeru1 aNommsen-Rivers, Laurie A.1 aDewey, Kathryn G.0 tJournal of human lactation.g2012 Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.45-54dSAGE Publicationsx0890-33447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08903344114227033Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02001naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016400166300001600330520092300346592002801269650001101297650001701308650001201325650002201337650001101359650001401370650001501384650001101399700002101410700002001431700002001451773009001471856008101561852000901642655001201651IND60119919920221117224509.0150112e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011991992DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078150100542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsupova, M.

Water discharge in the Ashamba R. is estimated, and the obtained values are compared with the standard hydrological characteristics accepted for design works. The existing calculation procedures and the standard climate characteristics are shown to allow the observed flood to have been anticipated. The hydrological-morphological changes in the river caused by the passage of an extreme flood are demonstrated. The land inundation and the destruction of economic facilities is shown to be a result of violation or neglect of the regulations for estimating the characteristics of extreme natural phenomena. The natural landscapes not disturbed by human activity are found to show a high stability under the effect of an extreme shower.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aephemeral streams 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3alandscapes 3arivers1 aDzaganiya, E.

Therefore, we examined the effects of repeated exposure to a gonadotropin-based ES protocol on hormonal profiles in 47 female Xinong Saanen dairy goats. Goats were randomly assigned to receive an ES protocol either three consecutive times with 14 d interval between each protocol (3 × ES group), or once (1 × ES group) starting concurrently with the third protocol of the 3 × ES group. The estradiol concentrations in 1 × ES group were significantly lesser than those of 3 × ES group at 0, 24, 36, 60 h after controlled internal drug release withdrawal. The progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations did not differ between 1 × ES and 3 × ES groups. No differences (P > 0.05) were observed in the estrus interval, estrus duration, gestation length, birth weight of kids, and the incidences of estrus, pregnancy, single birth, twinning birth, triplet birth between 1 × ES and 3 × ES groups. Litter size was smaller in goats of the 3 × ES group than in 1 × ES goats, and there were more female offspring in 3 × ES group than 1 × ES group (P < 0.05).

A gradual reduction in proliferative capacity throughout development culminates in permanent cell cycle exit by the vast majority of cardiomyocytes around the perinatal period. Accordingly, the adult heart has severely limited capacity for regeneration in response to injury or disease. The D-type cyclins (cyclin D1, D2, and D3) along with their catalytically active partners, the cyclin dependent kinases, are positive cell cycle regulators that play important roles in regulating proliferation of cardiomyocytes during normal heart development. While expression of D-type cyclins is generally low in the adult heart, expression levels are augmented in association with cardiac hypertrophy, but are uncoupled from myocyte cell division. Accordingly, re-activation of D-type cyclin expression in the adult heart has been implicated in pathophysiological processes via mechanisms distinct from those that drive proliferation during cardiac development. Growth factors and other exogenous agents regulate D-type cyclin production and activity in embryonic and adult cardiomyocytes. Understanding differences in the precise intracellular mediators downstream from these signalling molecules in embryonic versus adult cardiomyocytes could prove valuable for designing strategies to reactivate the cell cycle in cardiomyocytes in the setting of cardiovascular disease in the adult heart.  aPublisher supplied data 0aD-type cyclins 0aheart development 0ahypertrophy 0acell cycle 0acardiovascular disease1 aRobinson, Jessica1 aMacLean, Jessica1 aFeridooni, Tiam1 aWafa, Karim1 aPasumarthi, Kishore B.S.0 tCanadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology.g2012 Aug. 17, v. 90, no. 9 p.1197-1207dNRC Research Pressx1205-75417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/y2012-0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006500155245009700220300001600317520186100333592002802194650001302222650001202235650002702247650000902274650002902283650001602312650001402328650001702342650001602359650001702375650002002392653000802412653000802420653000802428653000802436653000802444653002602452653002402478653001602502653002002518653001702538653002302555700002902578700003102607773010202638856009002740852000902830655001202839IND60532324920221119030839.0190318e20140520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053232492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoosen, Neill Jurgens1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6484-347814aThe effects of protein hydrolysates on the immunity and growth of the abalone Haliotis midae  ap. 243-248.  aDietary hydrolysed proteins have been shown to stimulate the non-specific immunity of various finfish species, whilst the potential for immune stimulation of these feed ingredients in abalone has not been investigated. The immune-stimulating potential of two hydrolysed protein sources (self-prepared fish silage and a commercial fish protein hydrolysate) at two dietary inclusion levels in abalone diets was therefore measured in the South African abalone Haliotis midae, using animals of initial mean weight of 123g–128g. Diets containing the high inclusion levels were also fed in two feeding regimes: continuous feeding, or phase feeding, where the hydrolysed protein diets were alternated monthly with the control diet. In low inclusion diets, hydrolysate inclusion contributed 6g·kg−1 protein in the final diet, whilst in high inclusion diets this was increased to 18g·kg−1. It was found that the low inclusion level of the commercial hydrolysate significantly increased the cellular immunity through increasing the phagocytic activity of haemocytes by 18% compared to the control diet, whilst none of the other diets showed any significant differences compared to the control. Both inclusion levels of the commercial hydrolysed protein significantly improved daily weight increase of animals. Phase feeding had no positive impacts on immunity or production performance. The inclusion of both types of hydrolysed protein sources significantly decreased the water stability of feeds compared to the control, except at the lowest inclusion level of the commercial hydrolysate. It is concluded that the use of dietary hydrolysed proteins can lead to improved cellular immunity and growth in abalone, however it is important to determine appropriate inclusion levels to prevent negative impacts on feed water stability and production performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaliotis 3aabalone 3acell-mediated immunity 3afish 3afish protein hydrolysate 3afish silage 3ahemocytes 3ahydrolysates 3aingredients 3aphagocytosis 3aprotein sources 0aDOH 0aLSD 0aDWG 0aFCR 0aRFI 0aSouth African abalone 0aHydrolysed proteins 0aFish silage 0aWater stability 0aPhagocytosis 0aImmune stimulation1 ade Wet, Lourens Francois1 aGörgens, Johann Ferdinand0 tAquaculture.g2014 May 20, v. 428-429 p.243-248dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011700164300001600281520091500297536012201212592002801334650003101362650002401393650001501417650002101432650001301453650001001466650001801476650002301494650001101517650001101528650001501539650001401554650000901568650001501577650001301592650001301605650001601618650000901634650001801643650001401661651001401675653001801689653003901707653002401746653003101770653001401801653001401815653002401829700001901853700001801872773010601890856008001996852000902076655001202085IND60615023720221123043049.0181003e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061502372DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858166771492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakaguchi, K.10aSalmonella Enterica Serovar Pomona Infection in Farmed Juvenile American Alligators (Alligator Mississippiensis)  ap. 316-319.  aA fatal epizootic of salmonellosis occurred in farmed juvenile American alligators in Louisiana. Six animals were examined. Gross lesions included severe fibrinonecrotizing enterocolitis, necrotizing splenitis, coelomic effusion, and perivisceral and pulmonary edema. Microscopic examination revealed severe necrotizing enterocolitis and splenitis with intralesional bacteria and pneumocyte necrosis with fibrin thrombi. Salmonella enterica serovar Pomona was isolated from intestine and lung. Clinical salmonellosis is a rare finding in reptiles and salmonellosis caused by S. Pomona is not previously reported in American alligators. Since S. Pomona is a commonly isolated Salmonella serotype from patients with reptile-associated salmonellosis in the United States, and since alligator meat is consumed and the skin is exported to numerous countries, risk of human and animal infection should be considered.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlligator mississippiensis 3aSalmonella enterica 3aalligators 3aanimal pathology 3abacteria 3aedema 3aenterocolitis 3aepizootic diseases 3afibrin 3ahumans 3aintestines 3ajuveniles 3ameat 3amicroscopy 3anecrosis 3apatients 3apneumocytes 3arisk 3asalmonellosis 3aserotypes 3aLouisiana 0asalmonellosis 0aSalmonella enterica serovar Pomona 0aAmerican alligators 0aAlligator mississippiensis 0aenteritis 0asplenitis 0aintestinal diseases1 aNevarez, J.

It belongs to the commercially frequently exploited biocatalysts. The major application of glucoamylase is in the starch bioprocessing to produce glucose and in alcoholic fermentations of starchy materials. Filamentous fungi have been the source of glucoamylases for industrial purposes as well as an object of numerous research studies. Some yeasts also secrete a large amount of glucoamylase with biochemical characteristics slightly different from those of filamentous fungi. Modern biotechnological applications require glucoamylases of certain properties optimal for a given process. Novel biocatalysts can be prepared from already existing enzymes using techniques of protein engineering or directed evolution. Tailoring of a commercial glucoamylase requires knowledge, on a molecular level, of structure/function relationships of enzymes originating from various sources and having different catalytic properties. Sequences of the cloned genes, their recombinant expression and the tertiary structure determination of glucoamylase are prerequisite to obtain such information. The presented review focuses on molecular-genetic and structural aspects of yeast glucoamylases, supplemented with the basic biochemical characterization of the given enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysts 3abioprocessing 3adirected evolution 3afermentation 3agenes 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3aglucose 3aprotein engineering 3astarch 3ayeasts 0ayeast 0aglucoamylase 0agene cloning 0acrystal structure 0araw-starch degradation1 aGašperík, Juraj0 tBiologia.g2010 June 10, v. 65, no. 4 p.559-568dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-010-0077-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04256naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245013600185300001600321520217100337592002802508650001302536650001202549650001502561650001102576650001002587650001902597650001702616650003102633650001002664650001302674650002102687650004002708650002402748650001502772650001402787650004002801650002902841650003202870650001602902650001902918650003002937650001102967650001702978650005902995650002503054650007403079650004403153650004003197650005203237650003603289700002703325700001803352700002103370773011403391856008103505990002303586852000903609655001203618IND60093670120221119090542.0141103e20131005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009367012DNAL7 a239118762pmid7 a10.1016/j.cbi.2013.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoszak, Joanna10aCharacterization of arsenic trioxide resistant clones derived from Jurkat leukemia T cell line: Focus on PI3K/Akt signaling pathway  ap. 198-211.  aIn this study the role of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in arsenic trioxide (ATO)-treated parental Jurkat cells and also in derived ATO-resistant clones grown in the presence of given ATO concentration was investigated. ATO-resistant clones (cultured for 8–12weeks in the presence of 1, 2.5 and 5μM ATO) were characterized by high viability in the presence of ATO but slower growth rate compared to the parental cells. Morphological and functional characterization of derived ATO-resistant clones revealed that they did not differ fundamentally from parental Jurkat cells in terms of cell size, level of GSH, the lysosomal fluorescence or CD95/Fas surface antigen expression. However, a slight increase in the mitochondrial potential (JC-1 staining) was detected in the clones compared to parental Jurkat cells. Side population analysis (Vybrant DyeCycle Violet™ staining) in ATO resistant clones did not indicate any enrichment withcancer stem cells. Akt1/2, AktV or wortmannin inhibitors decreased viability of ATO-resistant clones grown in the presence of ATO, with no effect on ATO-treated parental cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that ATO decreased the level of p-Akt in ATO-treated parental cells, while the resistant clones exhibited higher levels of p-Akt immunostaining than parental Jurkat cells. Expression analysis of 84 genes involved in the PI3K/Akt pathway revealed that this pathway was predominantly active in ATO-resistant clones. c-JUN seems to play a key role in the induction of cell death in ATO-treated parental Jurkat cells, as dose-dependent strong up-regulation of JUN was specific for the ATO-treated parental Jurkat cells. On the other hand, changes in expression of cyclin D1 (CCND1), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and protein kinase C isoforms (PRKCZ,PRKCB and PRKCA) may be responsible for the induction of resistance to ATO. The changes in expression of growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (GRB10) observed in ATO-resistant clones suggest a possibility of induction of different mechanisms in development of resistance to ATO depending on the drug concentration and thus involvement of different signaling mediators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3aarsenic 3acell death 3aclones 3adrugs 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aleukemia 3aprotein kinase C 3asignal transducing adaptor proteins 3asignal transduction 3astem cells 3aviability 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aArsenicalsxpharmacology 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aClone Cells 2aFlow Cytometry 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aHumans 2aJurkat Cells 2aLeukemia, T-Cellxdrug therapyxenzymologyxpathology. 2aOxidesxpharmacology 2aPhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Kinase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aRNA, Neoplasmxchemistryxgenetics. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology1 aSmok-Pieniążek, Anna1 aNocuń, Marek1 aStępnik, Maciej0 tChemico-biological interactions.g2013 Oct. 5, v. 205, no. 3 p.198-211dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-27977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2013.07.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245012200180520177700302592002802079650001502107650001402122650002102136650002202157650002902179653002102208653003602229653002902265653001002294653002002304653001602324653001402340700005802354700002102412700005902433700002002492700001802512700002502530700001602555700005702571700006102628773012002689856008802809852000902897655001202906IND60743858020221120031734.0211009e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074385802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1057352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlöser-Chahoud, Simon10aIndustrial disassembling as a key enabler of circular economy solutions for obsolete electric vehicle battery systems  aElectro-mobility is considered a key strategy to reduce GHG emissions in the transport sector and to make individual mobility more sustainable. However, the production of electric vehicles is accompanied by high environmental impacts, mainly due to the resource intensive high-voltage battery systems. Hence, a prerequisite for sustainable electro-mobility – beside the provision of renewable energy for vehicle charging – is a well-functioning and efficient circular use system of electric vehicle battery systems (EVBs). While the production of EVBs has been continuously improved in recent years with high levels of automation to reduce production costs and to increase capacities, end-of-life (EoL) treatment of EVBs is still rather simplistic with rough manual disassembling before in most cases pyro-metallurgical treatment. In this paper, we argue for the need of industrial disassembly systems to reach higher levels of circularity. In the best case, these systems are highly automated and use lifecycle information including production and use-phase data for decision support to enable optimum utilization at a module or even cell level. These pathways include both second-life concepts such as repurposing or reconditioning and high-level direct recycling of active materials. To demonstrate the advantages of an industrial disassembling in EoL battery treatment, we systematically analyze different utilization pathways and we compare state-of-the-art treatment with an advanced disassembly system. The qualitative argumentation is substantiated by quantitative stochastic simulation as well as cost and lifecycle data. We show that only with a well-functioning industrial disassembling, efficient closed-loop-supply-chains (CLSCs) for EVBs can be achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3abatteries 3acircular economy 3aelectric vehicles 3arenewable energy sources 0aElectro-Mobility 0aElectric Vehicle Battery System 0aIndustrial Disassembling 0aReuse 0aRemanufacturing 0aRepurposing 0aRecycling1 aHuster, Sandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8423-50041 aRosenberg, Sonja1 aBaazouzi, Sabri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5207-084X1 aKiemel, Steffen1 aSingh, Soumya1 aSchneider, Christian1 aWeeber, Max1 aMiehe, Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1129-88801 aSchultmann, Frank1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6405-97630 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2021 Nov., v. 174 p.105735-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1057353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009200171520171000263592002801973650001102001650001902012650001202031650002902043650001602072650001202088650001102100650002602111650001902137650002202156650001502178650001502193650001102208650002202219650001702241650001302258651001002271653001702281653002802298653002802326653001402354653000902368653002102377700001602398700001602414700002102430700001302451700001602464700001502480700001402495700002102509700001102530773013302541856008502674852000902759655001202768IND60687279320221119010436.0200419e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068727932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1097022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xiaoshuang10aHolocene climate change and its influence on early agriculture in the Nile Delta, Egypt  aTo investigate how Holocene climate patterns influenced the development of early Egyptian agriculture at the archaeological site of Sais on the Nile Delta, we conducted a palynological study. Seven palynological zones were defined to reveal Holocene climate fluctuations. Zone I (ca. 9000–7000 cal yr BP) was a period of warming climate, succeeded by a progressive drying climate phase in Zones II–VII (ca. 7000–2000 cal yr BP). Pollen records indicate Nile flooding prevailed before 7000 years ago, making the study area uninhabitable, before it later developed into a wetland setting. The earliest farming started at ca. 6700 cal yr BP, as indicated by the abrupt appearance of cereal (Poaceae > 35 μm), during a time of climate warming (Zone III), This material can be differentiated from wild Poaceae (<35 μm), which occurs throughout the profile, indicating the cereal was introduced to this area for agriculture. Results further reveal the transformation of human activities, from passive adaptation to climate, to actively remolding the environment against the background of long-term drying. During the early farming stage (ca. 6700–5500 cal yr BP), climate-human indicators were synchronous in distribution, suggesting lower pressure from climate change on population growth; however, this reversed from ca. 5500 cal yr BP, as intensive agriculture was required to meet shortages of natural resources during climate drying. Perhaps, the best evidence for adaptation is the increased abundance of Azolla from ca. 4000 years ago, a fern that favours growing in still-water bodies, hinting that much more irrigation was required at the time to sustain societal development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzolla 3aHolocene epoch 3aPoaceae 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarchaeology 3aclimate 3adrying 3aferns and fern allies 3aglobal warming 3aintensive farming 3airrigation 3apalynology 3apollen 3apopulation growth 3ariver deltas 3awetlands 3aEgypt 0aPollen-spore 0aCultural transformation 0aAgricultural adaptation 0aNile flow 0aITCZ 0aHolocene climate1 aThomas, Ian1 aSalem, Alaa1 aAlassal, Said E.1 aLiu, Yan1 aSun, Qianli1 aChen, Jing1 aMa, Fuwei1 aFinlayson, Brian1 aAyuan,0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2020 June 01, v. 547 p.109702-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1097023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014000167300001400307520063300321592002800954650003400982650001901016650001401035650001101049650001301060650001201073650002301085650001101108650001401119650002301133653001601156653001901172653001701191653003201208653001601240653001701256700002601273700002001299700002101319700002501340773010001365856008201465852000901547655001201556IND60603010720221118065745.0180712e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060301072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2015.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMutz, Benjamin10aMethanation of CO2: Structural response of a Ni-based catalyst under fluctuating reaction conditions unraveled by operando spectroscopy  ap. 48-53.  aThe methanation of CO2 as a relevant strategy for energy storage has been studied by operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy under dynamic H2/CO2 and CO2 reaction atmospheres. A typical CO2 conversion of 81% was reached at 400°C with a 23wt.-% Ni/CaO–Al2O3 catalyst, yielding 80% of CH4. The operando XAS experiment under working conditions revealed pronounced structural changes, e.g., a fast bulk oxidation of the Ni particles after removal of H2 from the H2/CO2 (4:1) gas stream. A lower performance of the catalyst was observed in the subsequent methanation cycle due to the presence of a residual oxidized fraction of Ni.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3amethane production 3anickel 3aoxidation 3aworking conditions 0aMethanation 0aCarbon dioxide 0aOperando XAS 0aDynamic reaction conditions 0aNi catalyst 0aDeactivation1 aCarvalho, Hudson W.P.1 aMangold, Stefan1 aKleist, Wolfgang1 aGrunwaldt, Jan-Dierk0 tJournal of catalysis.g2015 July, v. 327 p.48-53dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2015.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245011700159300001600276520086400292592002801156650000801184650002301192650001601215650003901231650001001270650001801280650001601298650002701314650002101341650002801362650001001390650001901400653003001419653002201449653002701471653002301498700001701521700001601538700001601554700001401570700001801584700002901602700002401631700001701655700001501672773009901687856008101786852000901867655001201876IND60694120020221122210128.0210121e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069412002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cj.2020.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Jia10aDevelopment of oligonucleotide probes for FISH karyotyping in Haynaldia villosa, a wild relative of common wheat  ap. 676-681.  aHaynaldia villosa is a wild relative of wheat and a valuable gene resource for wheat improvement. Owing to the limited number of probes available for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the resolution at which the karyotype of H. villosa can be characterized is poor, hampering accurate characterization of small segmental alien introgressions. We designed ten oligonucleotide probes using tandem repeats in DNA sequences derived from the short arm of H. villosa chromosome 6V (6VS). FISH with seven of them resulted in clear signals on H. villosa chromosomes. Using these, we constructed FISH karyotypes for H. villosa using oligo-6VS-1 and oligo-6VS-35 oligonucleotides and characterized the distribution of the two probes in five different H. villosa accessions. The new FISH probes can efficiently characterize H. villosa introgressions into wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDasypyrum villosum 3achromosomes 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3aintrogression 3akaryotyping 3aoligonucleotide probes 3aoligonucleotides 3atandem repeat sequences 3awheat 3awild relatives 0aChromosome identification 0aHaynaldia villosa 0aOligonucleotide probes 0aTandem DNA repeats1 aZhou, Jiawen1 aSun, Haojie1 aWan, Wentao1 aXiao, Jin1 aYuan, Chunxia1 aKarafiátová, Miroslava1 aDoležel, Jaroslav,1 aWang, Haiyan1 aWang, Xiue0 tcrop journal.g2020 Aug., v. 8, no. 4 p.676-681dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23202x2214-51417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cj.2020.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245010100204300001800305500001900323520142300342592002801765650002901793650002401822650002701846650003501873650001101908650001501919650001701934650001101951650001301962650002501975650001502000700006702015700001802082700002002100700006202120773013902182856007902321852000902400655001202409IND60688075520210804000000.0200407e20200319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068807552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b059962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchis, Josep,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6812-998110aOccurrence of Cerium-, Titanium-, and Silver-Bearing Nanoparticles in the Besòs and Ebro Rivers  ap. 3969-3978.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe presence of anthropogenic nanoparticles (NPs) in the aquatic environment has become an emerging concern in terms of environmental and health safety. In the present study, we assessed the presence of Ag-bearing, Ti-bearing, and Ce-bearing NPs in the Barcelona catchment area, including the Besòs River basin and the Barcelona coast, and in the Ebro River Delta, using single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (sp-ICP-MS). Ti-NPs and Ce-NPs were ubiquitously detected in surface waters, and their presence was related to a high natural background. Concentrations of Ti-NPs ranged from 23.2 × 10⁶ to 298 × 10⁶ Ti-NPs/L, with high concentrations being detected in areas with little anthropogenic pressure, while the presence of nanosilver (17.9 × 10⁶ to 45.1 × 10⁶ Ag-NPs/L) in the analyzed rivers was limited to certain hotspots close to wastewater treatment plants discharge points. The concentrations of Ce-NPs in the river ranged from 18.1 × 10⁶ to 278 × 10⁶ NPs/L, and they were related to the natural occurrence of the mineral Monazite-(Ce). Overall, the concentrations of these nanomaterials in the Barcelonan coast were significantly attenuated by river-sea environmental dilution. Nevertheless, Ce-NPs were eventually detected in some seawater samples with low levels of lanthanum-NPs, suggesting anthropogenic inputs of nanoCeO₂, probably from atmospheric deposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic environment 3aatmospheric deposition 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acoasts 3ananosilver 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3aseawater 3awastewater treatment 3awatersheds1 aJiménez-Lamana, Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6467-65341 aAbad, Esteban1 aSzpunar, Joanna1 aFarré, Marinella,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8391-62570 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Mar. 19, v. 54, no. 7 p.3969-3978dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b059963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008200175300001600257520128000273592002801553650002401581650002501605650001301630650001501643650001301658650002601671650001701697650001301714650001501727650001101742650002101753650002001774650002001794651001101814653002701825653001801852653001501870653003101885653001901916700002501935700002101960773011301981856008602094852000902180655001202189IND60565557620221120225104.0181015e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056555762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.02.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeraldo, Rodrigo H.10aWater treatment sludge and rice husk ash to sustainable geopolymer production  ap. 146-155.  aWater Treatment Sludge (WTS) comes from a basic sanitation service and has increased generation. In Brazil, WTS is widely discarded into watercourses, or when it is treated to increase the solids content, the residue is landfilled. The objective of this research was to produce geopolymer using non-calcined WTS as partial replacement of metakaolin (MK). The alkali source was an alternative sodium silicate solution made from the mixture of NaOH and rice husk ash (RHA). MK was partially replaced by WTS in the proportions of 0%, 15%, 30%, and 60% in mass. Additional RHA was used in the geopolymer mixtures to keep SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio constant. Geopolymer mortars were cured at room temperature. Mechanical properties and durability characteristics were investigated. WTS replacement decreased the flow, flexural and compressive strengths, and increased porosity and permeability of geopolymer mortar. The replacement of 15% of MK by WTS had 25 MPa of compressive strength at 28 days, which is a good result to make concrete or building components. The results show that the use of non-calcined WTS and sodium silicate solution from RHA in geopolymer is technically feasible, resulting in a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative for WTS and RHA disposal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acompression strength 3aconcrete 3adurability 3ahusk ash 3amechanical properties 3apermeability 3aporosity 3asanitation 3asludge 3asodium hydroxide 3asodium silicate 3awater treatment 3aBrazil 0aWater treatment sludge 0aRice husk ash 0aMetakaolin 0aCuring at room temperature 0aSustainability1 aFernandes, Luiz F.R.1 aCamarini, Gladis0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 149 p.146-155dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.02.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005500144245010500199300002000304500001900324520150800343592002801851650002801879650001301907650001101920650001601931653001501947653001401962653002001976653002001996653001802016653003002034653003402064700006102098700002302159700002402182700002202206700006302228700002002291700001802311773014302329856007802472852000902550655001202559IND60713742920221119135040.0201023e20200924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071374292DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c106412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToth, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9875-861510aNanoscale Charge Accumulation and Its Effect on Carrier Dynamics in Tri-cation Perovskite Structures  ap. 48057-48066.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNanoscale investigations by scanning probe microscopy have provided major contributions to the rapid development of organic–inorganic halide perovskites (OIHP) as optoelectronic devices. Further improvement of device level properties requires a deeper understanding of the performance-limiting mechanisms such as ion migration, phase segregation, and their effects on charge extraction both at the nano- and macroscale. Here, we have studied the dynamic electrical response of Cs₀.₀₅(FA₀.₈₃MA₀.₁₇)₀.₉₅PbI₃–ₓBrₓ perovskite structures by employing conventional and microsecond time-resolved open-loop Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Our results indicate strong negative charge carrier trapping upon illumination and very slow (>1 s) relaxation of charges at the grain boundaries. The fast electronic recombination and transport dynamics on the microsecond scale probed by time-resolved open-loop KPFM show diffusion of charge carriers toward grain boundaries and indicate locally higher recombination rates because of intrinsic compositional heterogeneity. The nanoscale electrostatic effects revealed are summarized in a collective model for mixed-halide CsFAMA. Results on multilayer solar cell structures draw direct relations between nanoscale ionic transport, charge accumulation, recombination properties, and the final device performance. Our findings extend the current understanding of complex charge carrier dynamics in stable multication OIHP structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3alighting 3amodels 3asolar cells 0aperovskite 0ananoscale 0acharge-dynamics 0aoptoelectronics 0aphotovoltaics 0ascanning probe microscopy 0akelvin probe force microscopy1 aHailegnaw, Bekele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4427-27721 aRichheimer, Filipe1 aCastro, Fernando A.1 aKienberger, Ferry1 aScharber, Markus C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4918-48031 aWood, Sebastian1 aGramse, Georg0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Sept. 24, v. 12, no. 42 p.48057-48066dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c106413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013700169300002000306520102800326592002801354596007501382596006501457650002501522650001701547650002201564650001501586650001901601650001901620700001601639700006401655700006501719773013101784856008501915852000902000655001202009IND60788972320221118083413.0220818e20220805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078897232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.2c014332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatts, Eleanor10aIntegrated Top-Down and Bottom-Up Mass Spectrometry for Characterization of Diselenide Bridging Patterns of Synthetic Selenoproteins  ap. 11175-11184.  aWith the rapid acceleration in the design and development of new biotherapeutics, ensuring consistent quality and understanding degradation pathways remain paramount, requiring an array of analytical methods including mass spectrometry. The incorporation of non-canonical amino acids, such as for synthetic selenoproteins, creates additional challenges. A comprehensive strategy to characterize selenoproteins should serve dual purposes of providing sequence confirmation and mapping of selenocysteine bridge locations and the identification of unanticipated side products. In the present study, a combined approach exploiting the benefits of both top-down and bottom-up mass spectrometry was developed. Both electron-transfer/higher-energy collision dissociation and 213 nm ultraviolet photodissociation were utilized to provide complementary information, allowing high quality characterization, localization of diselenide bridges for complex proteins, and the identification of previously unreported selenoprotein dimers.  aPublisher supplied data  aCHE-2203602cDivision of Chemistrydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000165  aF-1155cWelch Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000928 3aanalytical chemistry 3adissociation 3amass spectrometry 3aphotolysis 3aselenocysteine 3aselenoproteins1 aThyer, Ross1 aEllington, Andrew D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6246-53381 aBrodbelt, Jennifer S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3207-02170 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Aug. 05, v. 94, no. 32 p.11175-11184dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c014333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245012500208300001600333520139300349592002801742650001501770650002201785650001901807650002101826650002201847650001101869653002401880653002401904653003301928653002901961653003001990653002802020700001402048700001402062700001602076700001802092773009002110856008502200852000902285655001202294IND60584797120221117233517.0180912e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058479712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.07.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Zhongwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5834-158310aImplementation of reduced-order physics-based model and multi-parameters identification strategy for lithium-ion battery  ap. 509-519.  aPhysics-based models for lithium-ion battery have been regarded as a promising alternative to equivalent circuit models due to their ability to describe internal electrochemical states of battery. However, the huge computational burden and numerous parameters of these models impede their application in embedded battery management system. To deal with the above problem, a reduced-order physics-based model for lithium-ion battery with better tradeoff between the model fidelity and computational complexity is developed. A strategy is proposed to extend the operation from a fixed point to full state of charge range. As the model consists of constant, varying, identifiable and unidentifiable parameters, it is impractical to identify the full set of parameters only using the current-voltage data. To sort out the identifiable parameters, a criterion based on calculating the determinant and condition number of Fisher information matrix (FIM) is employed. A subset with maximum nine identifiable parameters is obtained and then identified by nonlinear least square regression algorithm with confidence region calculated by FIM. Compared with the outputs from commercial software, the effectiveness of the battery model and extending strategy are verified. The estimated parameters deviate from the true values slightly, and produce small voltage errors at different current profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium batteries 3amodels 0aPhysics-based model 0aReduced-order model 0aExtend state of charge range 0aParameter identification 0aFisher information matrix 0aNonlinear least squares1 aDeng, Hao1 aYang, Lin1 aCai, Yishan1 aZhao, Xiaowei0 tEnergy.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 138 p.509-519dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.07.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014100162300001100303520185800314592002802172650002102200650001102221650002302232650001602255650001702271650001102288650001002299650001502309650001302324700002002337700002402357700002002381700002002401700002002421700002102441700002202462700002202484700002102506700002202527700002602549700003702575700002802612700001902640773011102659856008202770852000902852655001202861IND60712820120221121092300.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071282012DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-3937-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeuer, Lea10aEfficacy of imidacloprid 10%/moxidectin 1% spot-on formulation (Advocate®) in the prevention and treatment of feline aelurostrongylosis  ap. 65.  aBACKGROUND: In three randomized, controlled laboratory efficacy studies, the efficacy in the prevention of patent infections of a topical combination of imidacloprid 10%/moxidectin 1% (Advocate® spot-on formulation for cats, Bayer Animal Health GmbH) against larval stages and immature adults of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, as well as the treatment efficacy of a single or three monthly treatments against adult A. abstrusus, were evaluated. METHODS: Cats were experimentally inoculated with 300–800 third-stage larvae (L3). Each group comprised 8 animals and the treatment dose was 10 mg/kg bodyweight (bw) imidacloprid and 1 mg/kg bw moxidectin in each study. Prevention of the establishment of patent infections was evaluated by two treatments at a monthly interval at three different time points before and after challenge infection. Curative efficacy was tested by one or three treatments after the onset of patency. Worm counts at necropsy were used for efficacy calculations. RESULTS: In Study 1, the control group had a geometric mean (GM) of 28.8 adult nematodes and the single treatment group had a GM of 3.4 (efficacy 88.3%). In Study 2, the control group had a GM of 14.3, the prevention group had a GM of 0 (efficacy 100%), while the treatment group had a GM of 0.1 (efficacy 99.4%). In Study 3, the GM worm burden in the control group was 32.6 compared to 0 in all three prevention groups (efficacy 100% for all of those groups). CONCLUSIONS: The monthly administration of Advocate® reliably eliminated early larval stages and thereby prevented lung damage from and patent infections with A. abstrusus in cats. Regarding treatment, a single application of Advocate® reduced the worm burden, but it did not sufficiently clear the infection. In contrast, three monthly treatments were safe and highly efficacious against A. abstrusus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAelurostrongylus 3aadults 3aaelurostrongylosis 3abody weight 3aimidacloprid 3alarvae 3alungs 3amoxidectin 3anecropsy1 aPetry, Gabriele1 aPollmeier, Matthias1 aSchaper, Roland1 aDeuster, Katrin1 aSchmidt, Holger1 aBlazejak, Katrin1 aStrube, Christina1 aDi Cesare, Angela1 aTraversa, Donato1 aSchnyder, Manuela1 aMcKay-Demeler, Janina1 aSamson-Himmelstjerna, Georg von,1 aMangold-Gehring, Sandra1 aBöhm, Claudia0 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.65-65dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-3937-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245016000178300001800338520121300356592002801569650001201597650001601609650002401625650001101649650002001660650001601680650001301696650001701709653002501726653001301751653002201764653002601786653002801812653002601840700002401866700002601890700003701916700001801953700002701971773012601998856008602124852000902210655001202219IND60788963720221122004023.0220818e20221021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078896372DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2022.20642952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSassine, Youssef Najib10aCumulative effects of Lithovit-standard, monopotassium-phosphate and acetyl salicylic acid applied at different growth stage of tomato salt-stressed plants  ap. 2710-2726.  aIn the current study, different combinations of three products (Lithovit-Standard: Litho, monopotassium-phosphate: MKP and acetyl salicylic acid: ASA) were tested on tomato plants irrigated with five saline solutions (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 dS/m). The aim was to determine the possible complementary effects of these products applied separately and in different sequence at vegetative (11DAT: days after transplantation), flowering (25DAT) and fruit formation (39DAT). Control salt-stress plants were not subjected to product application. The data showed that the combination Asp-Litho-MKP improved total chlorophyll content and reduced the most cell electrolyte leakage compared to control. ASP-MKP-Litho treatment improved fruit number by an average of three to four fruits compared to control at all EC levels and maximized weight of individual fruits under EC 2, 4, and 10 dS/m. Yields in plants treated with ASP-MKP-Litho were higher by almost two to three folds than those of control plants. Plants treated by ASP-MKP-Litho had the highest contents of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg at all ECs. It was concluded that the three products had complementary effects on salt-stressed tomato crop if applied in combination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspirin 3achlorophyll 3aelectrolyte leakage 3afruits 3aplant nutrition 3asalt stress 3atomatoes 3atransferases 0aSolanum lycopersicum 0asalinity 0aLithovit-standard 0aacetyl salicylic acid 0amonopotassium phosphate 0atiming of application1 aSajyan, Tony Kevork1 aGermanos, Maria Walid1 aAbdelmawgoud, Abdelmawgoud Ragab1 aKhawand, Lara1 aAlturki, Saleh Mobarak0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2022 Oct. 21, v. 45, no. 17 p.2710-2726dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2022.20642953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245015500161300002000316520161800336592002801954650001501982650002201997650001902019650001802038650001802056650001302074650001102087650002102098650002302119650002102142650002102163700001802184773012402202856007402326852000902400655001202409IND60669131920221116200310.0190920e20150714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066913192DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra12562f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinari, Mohammad10aThermal, mechanical and optical transport properties of nanocomposite materials based on triethoxysilane-terminated polyimide and TiO₂ nanoparticles  ap. 60745-60753.  aIn the preparation of polymer based nanocomposites (NCs), compatibility between the organic phase and inorganic nanoparticles as the filler can be improved by a variety of methods, such as functionalizing polymer chains at their ends, adding a coupling agent to bond the polymer chains and inorganic network etc. In this study, several novel polyimide/titanium dioxide nanocomposites (PI/TiO₂ NCs) were prepared by the incorporation of TiO₂ nanoparticles into silane terminated PI. To this point, 3-(bis(4-aminophenyl)amino)benzonitrile as a diamine monomer was first synthesized and then it was reacted with an excess amount of 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene) diphthalic anhydride. The triethoxysilane terminal groups were introduced by reacting the anhydride end-groups of the polymer with (3-aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane. Different hybrid materials based on the silane-terminated PI with inorganic TiO₂ network were successfully fabricated by thermal imidization. The resulting materials were characterized by different techniques. According to the transmission electron microscopy images, the TiO₂ nanoparticles were well dispersed into the PI matrix with a particle size around 20–40 nm. The resulting composite's mechanical, optical and thermal properties are effectively enhanced by the incorporation of 8 wt% TiO₂ nanoparticles. According to the thermogravimetric analysis curves, the T₅% of the NC was increased with the TiO₂ loading and approximately a 63 °C improvement in T₅% is found. The tensile strength of the hybrid films is significantly increased compared with the pure PI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanhydrides 3afilms (materials) 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3apolymers 3asilane 3atensile strength 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3atitanium dioxide1 aAsadi, Parvin0 tRSC advances.g2015 July 14, v. 5, no. 75 p.60745-60753dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra12562f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245009900201500002000300520150100320592002801821650002001849650002201869650002501891650002301916650001601939650001001955650002001965650003101985650002202016650001502038650001402053650002602067650002902093650003402122650001602156651001002172700002102182700002802203700002202231700002102253700005902274773011802333856007302451852000902524655001202533IND60649738820221117235410.0190705e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064973882DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.019652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilvitis, Holly J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9436-906810aDNA methylation predicts immune gene expression in introduced house sparrows Passer domesticus  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPopulations undergoing range expansions are often faced with novel selective pressures, and to cope with such challenges, populations must either adapt quickly or exhibit phenotypic plasticity. This latter option allows for rapid phenotypic adjustments and persistence in novel environments, and thus could be advantageous at range‐edges. Our previous research on house sparrows in Kenya – a site of ongoing range expansion – and a growing literature suggests that invasion success is facilitated by epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Previously, we found 1) differences in the expression of a microbial surveillance gene (i.e. Toll‐like receptor 4‐TLR4), and 2) extensive variation in genome‐wide DNA methylation among house sparrows across Kenya. Here, our goal was to investigate whether these two observations are related, specifically whether DNA methylation within a target sequence upstream of the TLR4 transcription start site is associated with variation in TLR4 expression. We found that DNA methylation in the aforementioned region was quite variable among individuals, and variation at one CpG site predicted differences in TLR4 expression. Moreover, we found genetic variation within the same sequence upstream of the TLR4 exon, but this variation did not predict TLR4 expression. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate an association between DNA methylation and the expression of an ecologically relevant trait in a range‐expanding vertebrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aPasser domesticus 3aToll-like receptor 4 3acolonizing ability 3aepigenetics 3aexons 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic variation 3amonitoring 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription initiation site 3avertebrates 3aKenya1 aSchrey, Aaron W.1 aRagsdale, Alexandria K.1 aBerrio, Alejandro1 aPhelps, Steve M.1 aMartin, Lynn B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5887-49370 tJournal of avian biology.g2019 June, v. 50, no. 6dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3949829x0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.019653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009300166300001600259520100200275592002801277650000801305650002501313650001201338650001901350650002601369650001201395650002101407650001001428650001401438650002501452650001201477650002301489650001701512650001901529650001101548650001101559650002501570650002501595700002401620700001901644700002501663773012901688856008501817852000901902655001201911IND60536818820221120091158.0160807e20160614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053681882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.estlett.6b001502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Kam W.10aMethane Production in Oxic Lake Waters Potentially Increases Aquatic Methane Flux to Air  ap. 227-233.  aActive methane production in oxygenated lake waters challenges the long-standing paradigm that microbial methane production occurs only under anoxic conditions and forces us to rethink the ecology and environmental dynamics of this powerful greenhouse gas. Methane production in the upper oxic water layers places the methane source closer to the air–water interface, where convective mixing and microbubble detrainment can lead to a methane efflux higher than that previously assumed. Microorganisms may produce methane in oxic environments by being equipped with enzymes to counteract the effects of molecular oxygen during methanogenesis or using alternative pathways that do not involve oxygen-sensitive enzymes. As this process appears to be influenced by thermal stratification, water transparency, and primary production, changes in lake ecology due to climate change will alter methane formation in oxic water layers, with far-reaching consequences for methane flux and climate feedback.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aanaerobic conditions 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental science 3aenzymes 3agreenhouse gases 3alakes 3alimnology 3aliquid-air interface 3amethane 3amethane production 3amicrobubbles 3amicroorganisms 3amixing 3aoxygen 3aprimary productivity 3atemperature profiles1 aMcGinnis, Daniel F.1 aIonescu, Danny1 aGrossart, Hans-Peter0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology Letters.g2016 June 14, v. 3, no. 6 p.227-233dAmerican Chemical Societyx2328-89307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.estlett.6b001503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04622naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011200171300001600283520255200299592002802851650001902879650001802898650001902916650001102935650002502946650002402971650001102995650001003006650002103016650002103037650002403058650001003082650001703092650001103109650001503120650001903135650001403154650003003168650001403198650000903212650001803221650001003239650001803249650002103267650001703288650001803305653001603323653002303339653004103362653001903403653001803422653001903440653001703459653002103476653001703497653002003514653002703534700002103561700002703582700002803609700002503637700002703662773011703689856008503806852000903891655001203900IND60647511520221118071649.0190807e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064751152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2019.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDulya, Olesya V.10aPollution-induced slowdown of coarse woody debris decomposition differs between two coniferous tree species  ap. 312-320.  aBoreal forests store a large portion of the planet’s terrestrial carbon. A significant portion of this carbon is stored in coarse woody debris (CWD). Industrial pollution greatly inhibits organic matter decomposition and thus enhances carbon sequestration in the soil. However, little is known about the decomposition of CWD in polluted areas. In this work, by means of dendrochronological cross-dating, we determined the death dates of 90 downed Siberian spruce (Picea obovata Ledeb.) and Siberian fir (Abies sibirica Ledeb.) logs in the latest stages of decay in an undisturbed boreal forest and in two industrially polluted forests with 10-fold and more than 100-fold higher copper content in the soil. We found that, in the unpolluted area, the mean halftime of fir and spruce decomposition was 26 years and 23 years, respectively. In polluted areas, this time increased by approximately 16 years for fir and 5 years for spruce. Based on an exponential decay model, pollution caused a 16–60% decrease in the wood decomposition rate constant. Copper concentrations in CWD were similar between tree species and were about 10–20 times lower than in the surrounding soil. These values are comparable with the concentrations tolerated by fungi in laboratory tests, indicating that heavy metal excess cannot be considered a primary inhibitor of wood decomposer activity. The greater pollution-induced delay in the decomposition of fir trees, which are lighter and smaller in size than spruce trees, suggests that dead tree leaning is an important factor in the wood decomposition slowdown in polluted areas where stand density increases due to intensive forest regeneration because of the reduced competition of tree seedlings with toxically inhibited herbaceous vegetation.We also evaluated dynamic probing as a rapid, low-cost, and nondestructive surrogate of wood density measuring. Dynamic probing performed in the field on heavily decayed CWD explained about 40% of wood density variability and about 70% of variability when taking into account the gravimetrically measured wood moisture content. With negligible modifications, this method can be applied in the field monitoring of wood density loss. For the purpose of between-study comparisons, we recommend transforming the widely used measure of penetration depth to specific resistance to penetration and encourage the elaboration of reference tables that relate specific resistance to penetration and wood density for different tree species across distinct ecological zones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies sibirica 3aPicea obovata 3aboreal forests 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acoarse woody debris 3acopper 3adeath 3adendrochronology 3aecological zones 3aforest regeneration 3afungi 3aheavy metals 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aorganic matter 3apollution 3aresistance to penetration 3aseedlings 3asoil 3astand density 3atrees 3awater content 3awood degradation 3awood density 3awood moisture 0aDowned logs 0aWood decay classes 0aRate of organic matter decomposition 0aResidence time 0aAir pollution 0aCopper smelter 0aHeavy metals 0aDendrochronology 0aWood density 0aDynamic probing 0aPenetration resistance1 aBergman, Igor E.1 aKukarskih, Vladimir V.1 aVorobeichik, Evgenii L.1 aSmirnov, Georgii Yu.1 aMikryukov, Vladimir S.0 tForest ecology and management.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 448 p.312-320dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011300166520164100279592002801920650001101948650001601959650002301975650002201998650002002020650001802040650001502058651001002073653002002083653003502103653002202138653001502160653001302175700005602188700001302244700001202257700001602269700005402285700005602339700002002395773010402415856008602519852000902605655001202614IND60768734320221119020025.0220706e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076873432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1276412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Yubin10aDecreasing relative humidity dominates a reversal of decreasing pan evaporation in mainland China after 1989  aPan evaporation (Eₚₐₙ) reflects the evaporation potential of surface water and is a key indicator of atmospheric evaporative demand. Previous studies have found a substantial decrease in Eₚₐₙ across China, dominated by declining wind speed and solar radiation before the late 2000 s. However, how Eₚₐₙ responds to the recovery of wind speed and solar radiation since the late 2000 s remains unclear. Here, we investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of Eₚₐₙ and analyze its controlling factors, based on the daily meteorological observations during 1965–2018 at 2,018 stations over China. We find that the annual Eₚₐₙ in the northwest and south of China is higher than that in the northeast and central parts of China. The national mean Eₚₐₙ decreases significantly during 1965–1989 at a rate of −6.57 mm yr⁻², then reverses at a rate of 4.58 mm yr⁻². Distinct seasonal discrepancies and geographical heterogeneities in Eₚₐₙ trends are observed. Declining wind speed mainly contributes to the decrease in Eₚₐₙ before 1989, while relative humidity is shown as the dominant factor that drives the growth of Eₚₐₙ after the turning point. The recovery of wind speed still has significant impact on Eₚₐₙ variation in parts of China, while Eₚₐₙ is only mainly affected by solar radiation in parts of central China in autumn. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding Eₚₐₙ variations and driving factors, and call for precautions and adaptation actions to combat and prevent flash droughts over China, especially in the south of China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3aevaporation 3aevaporative demand 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation 3asurface water 3awind speed 3aChina 0aPan evaporation 0aAtmospheric evaporative demand 0aRelative humidity 0aWind speed 0aReversal1 aWang, Dashan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9743-48061 aFeng, Yu1 aWu, Jie1 aCui, Wenhui1 aHe, Xinyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2214-93381 aChen, Aifang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3237-31221 aZeng, Zhenzhong0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 May, v. 608 p.127641-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1276413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245011900209300001400328520142100342592002801763596006401791596009801855650002601953650002201979650002902001650002302030650003002053650002202083650001202105650001302117650001302130650001402143650001402157650002302171651001102194700002002205700002002225700002302245700002002268700002702288700001702315773013002332856008202462852000902544655001202553IND60635341120221122004232.0190816e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063534112DNAL7 a10.1007/s40858-018-0256-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicot, Philippe C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9272-375310aDifferential susceptibility to the mycoparasite Paraphaeosphaeria minitans among Sclerotinia sclerotiorum isolates  ap. 82-93.  aThe mycoparasitic fungus Paraphaeosphaeria minitans (formerly Coniothyrium minitans), is increasingly used by farmers to reduce soilborne inoculum of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. In France, its field efficacy tends to be higher in the North than in the South, leading to the hypothesis of possible regional differences in the susceptibility of the pathogen to the biocontrol agent. A standardized assay was developed and four quantitative criteria were used to assess the susceptibility to P. minitans of 75 S. sclerotiorum isolates collected from different regions of France. There was no significant difference between the group of isolates from the North and that from the South, but wide differences were observed among isolates, with consistent responses for all quantitative criteria. This study suggests that biocontrol efficacy might vary locally depending on the frequency of less susceptible isolates and it brings to attention the possibility that selection pressure could lead to a gradual increase in the frequency of less susceptible isolates, as this biocontrol method becomes widely adopted by farmers. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the variable susceptibility of S. sclerotiorum to a commercialized strain of P. minitans and the first detailed characterization of a large group of isolates from France for traits related to fitness, such as mycelial growth and production of sclerotia.  aPublisher supplied data  a633184 ("EUCLID" project)cHorizon 2020 Framework Programme  aCASDAR "ScleroLeg project"cMinistère de l'Agriculture, de l'Agroalimentaire et de la Forêt 3aConiothyrium minitans 3aParaphaeosphaeria 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acommercialization 3afarmers 3ainoculum 3amycelium 3apathogens 3asclerotia 3aselection pressure 3aFrance1 aAvril, Félicie1 aDuffaud, Magali1 aLeyronas, Christel1 aTroulet, Claire1 aVilleneuve, François,1 aBardin, Marc0 tTropical plant pathology.g2019 Feb., v. 44, no. 1 p.82-93dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:19494x1983-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40858-018-0256-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008900156520146400245592002801709650001501737650003101752650002001783650001601803700001801819700001701837700001701854773012801871856007501999852000902074655001202083IND60771426920221120120357.0220325e20220321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077142692DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140615172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei 12aA GNSS/5G Integrated Three-Dimensional Positioning Scheme Based on D2D Communication  aThe fifth generation (5G) communication has the potential to achieve ubiquitous positioning when integrated with a global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The device-to-device (D2D) communication, serving as a key technology in the 5G network, provides the possibility of cooperative positioning with high-density property. The mobile users (MUs) collaborate to jointly share the position and measurement information, which can make use of more references for positioning. In this paper, a GNSS/5G integrated three-dimensional positioning scheme based on D2D communication is proposed, where the time of arrival (TOA) and received signal strength (RSS) measurements are jointly utilized in the 5G network. The density spatial clustering of application with noise (DBSCAN) is exploited to reduce the position uncertainty of the cooperative nodes, and the positions of the requesting nodes are obtained simultaneously. The particle filter (PF) algorithm is further conducted to improve the position accuracy of the requesting nodes. Numerical results show that the position deviation of the cooperative nodes can be significantly decreased and that the proposed algorithm performs better than the nonintegrated one. The DBSCAN brings an increase of about 50% in terms of the positioning accuracy compared with GNSS results, and the PF further increases the accuracy about 8%. It is also verified that the algorithm suits the fixed and dynamic condition well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aglobal positioning systems 3asignal strength 3auncertainty1 aYang, Yuanxi 1 aZeng, Anmin 1 aXu, Yangyin 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Mar. 21, v. 14, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140615173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003300139245014300172300001600315500002000331520108300351592002801434596004101462596004701503596007201550596006901622596007101691596003901762596003301801596003601834596003801870650002301908650001101931650001101942650001701953650001601970650003801986650002102024650001702045650001802062650001602080651002002096700002302116700001902139700006902158773013502227856007402362852000902436655001202445IND60776465720221122082951.0220506e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077646572DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.125632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZengenene, Munyaradzi Prince10aEffect of larval density and additional anchoring surface on the life‐history traits of a laboratory colonized Anopheles funestus strain  ap. 168-175.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOptimal rearing conditions, inclusive of larval rearing density, are critical for sustained mosquito productivity. There is limited information on favourable conditions for the larval rearing of Anopheles funestus, the dominant malaria vector in east and southern Africa. This work investigated the effects of larval rearing densities and additional anchoring surface on An. funestus development using a life table approach. Larval cohorts were reared at four different larval densities using the same rearing surface area, larval food concentrations and temperature conditions. Rearing larvae at high densities extended the larval developmental time and reduced adult productivity. Adding an extra larval anchoring surface when rearing larvae at high density resulted in extended larval developmental time, increased larval survivorship and produced bigger adults. These findings improve our understanding of the relationship between larval density and developmental traits in An. funestus and provides baseline information for An. funestus rearing under laboratory conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aOPP1177156cIfakara Health Institute  aSAF 5014/5017cInternational Energy Agency  a119765cSouth African Agency for Science and Technology Advancement  aUIDcSouth African Agency for Science and Technology Advancement  a64763cSouth African Agency for Science and Technology Advancement  cInternational Atomic Energy Agency  cNational Research Foundation  cUniversity of the Witwatersrand  cBill and Melinda Gates Foundation 3aAnopheles funestus 3aadults 3alarvae 3alife history 3alife tables 3amedical and veterinary entomology 3amosquito vectors 3asurface area 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 3aSouthern Africa1 aMunhenga, Givemore1 aOkumu, Fredros1 aKoekemoer, Lizette Leonie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4236-63450 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2022 June, v. 36, no. 2 p.168-175dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl42323x0269-283X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mve.125633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04600naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245007000214520281400284592002803098650002403126650002003150650001303170650001503183650001403198650001803212650002203230650001003252650001303262650002403275650001503299651001103314653000803325653000903333653000703342653000803349653000803357653000803365653000803373653000903381653000803390653001703398653001203415653001103427653000703438653000703445653000903452653000803461653002403469653001403493653002203507653002203529700006003551700006003611700001803671700006103689773011503750856008803865852000903953655001203962IND60734556520221122014107.0220423e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073455652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.1053582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayes, Brandon H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6778-054810aMechanistic modelling of African swine fever: A systematic review  aThe spread of African swine fever (ASF) poses a grave threat to the global swine industry. Without an available vaccine, understanding transmission dynamics is essential for designing effective prevention, surveillance, and intervention strategies. These dynamics can often be unraveled through mechanistic modelling. To examine the assumptions on transmission and objectives of the mechanistic models of ASF, a systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted. Articles were examined across multiple epidemiological and model characteristics, with filiation between models determined through the creation of a neighbor-joined tree using phylogenetic software. Thirty-four articles qualified for inclusion, with four main modelling objectives identified: estimating transmission parameters (11 studies), assessing determinants of transmission (7), examining consequences of hypothetical outbreaks (5), assessing alternative control strategies (11). Population-based (17), metapopulation (5), and individual-based (12) model frameworks were represented, with population-based and metapopulation models predominantly used among domestic pigs, and individual-based models predominantly represented among wild boar. The majority of models (25) were parameterized to the genotype II isolates currently circulating in Europe and Asia. Estimated transmission parameters varied widely among ASFV strains, locations, and transmission scale. Similarly, parameter assumptions between models varied extensively. Uncertainties on epidemiological and ecological parameters were usually accounted for to assess the impact of parameter values on the modelled infection trajectory. To date, almost all models are host specific, being developed for either domestic pigs or wild boar despite the fact that spillover events between domestic pigs and wild boar are evidenced to play an important role in ASF outbreaks. Consequently, the development of more models incorporating such transmission routes is crucial. A variety of codified and hypothetical control strategies were compared however they were all a priori defined interventions. Future models, built to identify the optimal contributions across many control methods for achieving specific outcomes should provide more useful information for policy-makers. Further, control strategies were examined in competition with each other, which is opposed to how they would actually be synergistically implemented. While comparing strategies is beneficial for identifying a rank-order efficacy of control methods, this structure does not necessarily determine the most effective combination of all available strategies. In order for ASFV models to effectively support decision-making in controlling ASFV globally, these modelling limitations need to be addressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican swine fever 3adecision making 3agenotype 3amonitoring 3aphylogeny 3apork industry 3asystematic review 3atrees 3avaccines 3aveterinary medicine 3awild boars 3aEurope 0aASF 0aASFV 0aEU 0aFMD 0aCSF 0aPBM 0aIBM 0aSEIR 0aSEI 0aDTU-DADS-ASF 0aBe-FAST 0aNAADSM 0aSI 0aCI 0aHPDI 0aCrI 0aAfrican swine fever 0aModelling 0aSystematic review 0aPhylogenetic tree1 aAndraud, Mathieu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2891-29011 aSalazar, Luis G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1968-00881 aRose, Nicolas1 aVergne, Timothée1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1146-92560 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2021 June, v. 191 p.105358-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.1053583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014400167300001600311520140900327536015801736592002801894596009201922596008502014650001102099650001902110650001902129650002202148650002302170650002102193650001302214650001102227650001502238650002502253650002702278650001102305650002502316653001902341653002302360653002902383653002502412700002102437700001302458700002402471700002102495700001402516700001202530700001702542773013102559856008502690852000902775655001202784IND60595786020221120122328.0180607e20180603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059578602DNAL7 a10.1080/17538947.2017.13378182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Shufen10aResponses of global terrestrial water use efficiency to climate change and rising atmospheric CO2 concentration in the twenty-first century  ap. 558-582.  aTerrestrial ecosystems play a significant role in global carbon and water cycles because of the substantial amount of carbon assimilated through net primary production and large amount of water loss through evapotranspiration (ET). Using a process-based ecosystem model, we investigate the potential effects of climate change and rising atmospheric CO₂ concentration on global terrestrial ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) during the twenty-first century. Future climate change would reduce global WUE by 16.3% under high-emission climate change scenario (A2) and 2.2% under low-emission climate scenario (B1) during 2010–2099. However, the combination of rising atmospheric CO₂ concentration and climate change would increase global WUE by 7.9% and 9.4% under A2 and B1 climate scenarios, respectively. This suggests that rising atmospheric CO₂ concentration could ameliorate climate change-induced WUE decline. Future WUE would increase significantly at the high-latitude regions but decrease at the low-latitude regions under combined changes in climate and atmospheric CO₂. The largest increase of WUE would occur in tundra and boreal needleleaf deciduous forest under the combined A2 climate and atmospheric CO₂ scenario. More accurate prediction of WUE requires deeper understanding on the responses of ET to rising atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and its interactions with climate.  aThis research was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) Grants (1243232, 121036), Chinese Academy of Sciences STS Program (KFJ-STS-ZDTP-010-05).  aPublisher supplied data  aKFJ-STS-ZDTP-010-05cChinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002367  a1243232, 121036cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3adeciduous forests 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic cycle 3alatitude 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprimary productivity 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atundra 3awater use efficiency 0aClimate change 0aevapotranspiration 0anet primary productivity 0awater use efficiency1 aChen, Guangsheng1 aRen, Wei1 aDangal, Shree R.

The ticks were collected by flagging during the seasonal activity peak of the ticks in the mid‐taiga zone of Karelia (62.0697°N, 33.9614°E). In total, 108 females and 92 males of I. persulcatus were marked. The marked individuals were captured 161 times before the end of the study period with their proportion in the samples reaching 50%. Females were recaptured more often than males, 105 versus 56 times. Estimates of adult tick abundance ranged from 0.4 to 2 specimens per m² depending on the calculation method. The obtained estimates of absolute abundance varied unpredictably depending on the length of the intervals between capture sessions and showed no significant correlations with the number of ticks collected by flagging. The choice of the method of tick abundance estimation mainly depends on the study aims. The Petersen method may be useful for quick estimates of local tick abundance, whereas the Jolly‐Seber method allows an estimation of the absolute abundance during the entire period of the tick activity. Individual marking of ticks may improve the accuracy of the estimates.  aPublisher supplied data  astate order № 0218‐2019‐0075cMinistry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation  a№ KA5046cKarelia cross‐border cooperation programme: “Data for Invasive and Alien Species” (DIAS) 3aIxodes persulcatus 3aadults 3acase studies 3amark-recapture studies 3amedical and veterinary entomology 3aticks1 aGorbach, Vyacheslav V.0 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2022 June, v. 36, no. 2 p.185-193dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl42323x0269-283X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mve.125653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01507naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245022000164300001600384520038500400592002800785650002200813650001200835650001500847653003000862653003000892700002100922700002600943773015000969856007701119852000901196655001201205IND60522032420221122003842.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052203242DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1995-06102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFromm, Katharina10aSynthese und Molekülstrukturen der Molybdän(II)-Komplexe MoCl2(PMe3)2 und [Mo(μ-PPh2)(PPh2)(PMe3)]2 / Synthesis and Molecular Structures of the Molybdenum(II) Complexes MoCl2(PMe3)2 and [Mo(μ-PPh2)(PPh2)(PMe3)]2  ap. 894-898.  aLi₂P(2,4,6-Me₃C₆H₂) reacts with Cp°MoCl₂(PMe₃)₂ (Cp° = C₅Me₄Et) with reductive cleavage of the Mo -Cp° bond to yield MoCl₂(PMe₃)₂ (1).

However, the optimum administration timing, dosage, type of CHO intake, and possible interaction of the ergogenic effect with athletes’ cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are not clear. Ninety-six studies (from relevant databases based on predefined eligibility criteria) were selected for meta-analysis to investigate the acute effect of ≤20% CHO solutions on prolonged exercise performance. The between-subject standardized mean difference [SMD = ([mean post-value treatment group–mean post-value control group]/pooled variance)] was assessed. Overall, SMD [95% CI] of 0.43 [0.35, 0.51] was significant (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that SMD was reduced as the subjects’ CRF level increased, with a 6–8% CHO solution composed of GL:FRU improving performance (exercise: 1–4 h); administration during the event led to a superior performance compared to administration before the exercise, with a 6–8% single-source CHO solution increasing performance in intermittent and ‘stop and start’ sports and an ~6% CHO solution appearing beneficial for 45–60 min exercises, but there were no significant differences between subjects’ gender and age groups, varied CHO concentrations, doses, or types in the effect measurement. The evidence found was sound enough to support the hypothesis that CHO solutions, when ingested during endurance exercise, have ergogenic action and a possible crossover interaction with the subject’s CRF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute effects 3aathletic performance 3acarbohydrates 3acardiorespiratory fitness 3aexercise 3agender 3ameta-analysis 3avariance1 aSouglis, Athanasios 1 aZacharakis, Emmanouil D.1 aGeladas, Nickos D.1 aTravlos, Antonios K.0 tNutrients.g2021 Nov. 24, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131242233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011800174300001400292520165100306592002801957650001901985650001702004650001002021650001302031650002002044651001202064651001202076653002302088653003002111653002202141653001702163653001702180653002202197700001802219700002102237773010502258856008702363852000902450655001202459IND60557199420221121004530.0190405e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055719942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarr, Eric Joseph10aSparing or sharing? Differing approaches to managing agricultural and environmental spaces in England and Ontario  ap. 77-91.  aThe ability to balance agricultural production and environmental conservation in the face of increasing demand for food, fuel and fibre poses a major challenge for governments around the world. This challenge is explored in two areas of comparison: Ontario, Canada and England, UK in order to understand how each has balanced agriculture and environment in its land use policies. England and Ontario share similarities that suggest lessons and instruments may be transferrable to achieve similar land use objectives. Through the use of a thematic analysis of policy documentation, from each case study area, themes are identified demonstrating differences in approaches, and underlying policy preferences, associated with balancing agriculture and the environment. Specifically, results suggest that policymakers in Ontario hold a preference for land-sparing and leanings towards the productivist paradigm, whereas the land-sharing approach coupled with evidence of post-productivism is more common in England. The structural similarities of these cases provides insights into less tangible aspects of either context, such as policymaker preferences, where different approaches have emerged from a similar foundation. Moreover, as England transitions out of the EU, it may draw on the experiences of other jurisdictions in the design of a new suite of agri-environmental policies, with Ontario's approach providing one alternative. Overall, this paper contributes to our understanding of the manifestation of land-sparing/sharing and productivism/post-productivism in real world policy contexts and the relationship between both sets of concepts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acase studies 3afuels 3aland use 3apolicy analysis 3aEngland 3aOntario 0aComparative policy 0aAgri-environmental policy 0aLand use conflict 0aLand sparing 0aLand sharing 0aPost-productivism1 aHowley, Peter1 aBurns, Charlotte0 tJournal of rural studies.g2016 Dec., v. 48 p.77-91dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01903naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245006000161300001800221520090700239592002801146650002301174650001501197650001601212650001301228653000801241653002201249653002301271653002201294653001901316700002301335773012301358856007501481852000901556655001201565IND60527747820221119190616.0160715e20140122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052774782DNAL7 a10.1021/am404847d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aM, Thripuranthaka10aTemperature Dependent Phonon Shifts in Single-Layer WS2  ap. 1158-1163.  aAtomically thin two-dimensional tungsten disulfide (WS₂) sheets have attracted much attention due to their potential for future nanoelectronic device applications. We report first experimental investigation on temperature dependent Raman spectra of single-layer WS₂ prepared using micromechanical exfoliation. Our temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy results shows that the E¹₂g and A₁g modes of single-layer WS₂ soften as temperature increases from 77 to 623 K. The calculated temperature coefficients of the frequencies of 2LA(M), E¹₂g, A₁g, and A₁g(M) + LA(M) modes of single-layer WS₂ were observed to be −0.008, −0.006, −0.006, and −0.01 cm–¹ K–¹, respectively. The results were explained in terms of a double resonance process which is active in atomically thin nanosheet. This process can also be largely applicable in other emerging single-layer materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3ananosheets 3atemperature 3atungsten 0aWS2 0alayered materials 0aRaman spectroscopy 0aphonon vibrations 0athermal effect1 aLate, Dattatray J.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Jan. 22, v. 6, no. 2 p.1158-1163dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam404847d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245011800169500001900287520152800306592002801834650002301862650002001885650002301905650002701928650002201955650001301977650002401990651001002014700002202024700002102046700001802067700003102085700002102116700003102137700002302168700001902191700002302210700002702233773012002260856007302380852000902453655001202462IND60738943520221121083450.0210524e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073894352DNAL7 a10.3390/v130509172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCandel, Francisco  Javier10aSocial Restrictions versus Testing Campaigns in the COVID-19 Crisis: A Predictive Model Based on the Spanish Case  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe global COVID-19 spread has forced countries to implement non-pharmacological interventions (NPI) (i.e., mobility restrictions and testing campaigns) to preserve health systems. Spain is one of the most severely impacted countries, both clinically and economically. In an effort to support policy decision-making, we aimed to assess the impacts of different NPI on COVID-19 epidemiology, healthcare costs and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed epidemiological model was created to simulate the pandemic evolution. Its output was used to populate an economic model to quantify healthcare costs and GDP variation through a regression model which correlates NPI and GDP change from 42 countries. Thirteen scenarios combining different NPI were consecutively simulated in the epidemiological and economic models. Both increased testing and stringency could reduce cases, hospitalizations and deaths. While policies based on increased testing rates lead to higher healthcare costs, increased stringency is correlated with greater GDP declines, with differences of up to 4.4% points. Increased test sensitivity may lead to a reduction of cases, hospitalizations and deaths and to the implementation of pooling techniques that can increase throughput testing capacity. Alternative strategies to control COVID-19 spread entail differing economic outcomes. Decision-makers may utilize this tool to identify the most suitable strategy considering epidemiological and economic outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3adecision making 3aeconometric models 3agross domestic product 3aissues and policy 3apandemic 3aregression analysis 3aSpain1 aViayna, Elisabet 1 aCallejo, Daniel 1 aRamos, Raúl,1 aSan-Roman-Montero, Jesús 1 aBarreiro, Pablo 1 aCarretero, María  del Mar1 aKolipiński, Adam 1 aCanora, Jesus 1 aZapatero, Antonio 1 aRunken, Michael  Chris0 tViruses.g2021 May 15, v. 13, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130509173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245011200166300001600278500002000294520121900314592002801533596008501561596008501646596010601731596006801837650000801905650001801913650002301931650001001954650003801964700003102002700003002033700003102063700002602094700003502120700002502155700006802180773013502248856007402383852000902457655001202466IND60776466020221120222354.0220506e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077646602DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.125672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenne, Nathália Alves10aRobust comparative performance of genomic DNA extraction methods from non‐engorged phlebotomine sandflies  ap. 203-211.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present study is a comparative analysis of DNeasy Blood & Tissue Qiagen® kit (Qiagen®, Hilden, Alemanha), salting out, HotShot and phenol–chloroform protocols to extract DNA from sandflies. In addition, a comparative test using sandflies with and without eyes evaluated the potential inhibitory effect in the cPCR. An inhibition test was performed using an exogenous DNA added to the qPCR. The genomic DNA quality of each sample was evaluated by cPCR based on the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) gene. The DNA extraction protocols showed the following percentage of amplification: HotShot (91.6% [55/60]), salting out (71.6% [43/60]), phenol–chloroform (95% [57/60]) and kit DNeasy Blood & Tissue Qiagen® (73.3% [44/60]). The phenol–chloroform method achieved a significantly higher frequency of cox1 gene amplification. The pigment present in the phlebotomine's eyes seems to inhibit cPCR reactions since the frequency of amplification of the cox1 gene increased in the sandflies without eyes (p < 0.0001). The HotShot method showed the highest inhibitory potential. These manual extraction techniques can be an inexpensive and effective alternative to study vector–pathogen interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  a310819/2018‐0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a141351/2018‐7cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aE‐26/203.294/2017cFundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aDNA 3aPhlebotominae 3agene amplification 3agenes 3amedical and veterinary entomology1 aSantos, Huarrisson Azevedo1 aAraújo, Thamires Rezende1 aPaulino, Patrícia Gonzaga1 aMendonça, Leo Paulis1 aMoreira, Haika Victória Sales1 aCamilo, Tays Araújo1 ada Costa Angelo, Isabele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3698-83400 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2022 June, v. 36, no. 2 p.203-211dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl42323x0269-283X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mve.125673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001700160245007900177300001600256500000900272520139400281592002801675650002301703650002001726650002001746650002701766650001601793650002201809650001101831650001301842650001901855650001301874650001001887650001201897650001801909700001801927773012201945852000902067856009702076655001202173IND9100553920221119035802.0191122e196811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910055392DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1968.00021962006000060035x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBovey, R.

Pentachlorophenol (PCP) and cis−2,3,5,5,5−pentachloro−4−ketopentenoic acid (AP−20) produced the most rapid desiccation at high dosages. The 6,7−dihydrodipyrido(l,2−α:2',I'−c)pyrazidünium salt (diquat) was usually as effective as PCP and AP−20 within 1 to 2 days after treatment, and it produced more extensive desiccation at lower dosages, especially on hibiscus, sorghum, and cotton. Diquat, l,l'−dimethyl− 4,4'−bipyridinium salt (paraquat), dimethylarsinic acid (cacodylic acid), and AP−20 produced complete defoliation of hibiscus within 5 days after treatment but diquat and paraquat were more effective at lower dosages than other defoliants. Diquat completely defoliated hibiscus at 19 µg regardless of placement on the leaf, but higher dosages were required for effective desiccation when applied non−uniformly over the leaf. Effective desiccation with PCP required uniform application to either upper or lower surfaces. Defoliation of leaves after treatment with PCP did not occur. Some herbicides increased the desiccation and defoliation of hibiscus synergistically when added to diquat. Hormone−type herbicides such as 2,4−dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4−D) and 4−amino−3,5, 6−trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) were antagonistic to diquat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aPsidium guajava 3aSorghum bicolor 3aHibiscus rosa-sinensis 3adefoliation 3apentachlorophenol 3adiquat 3aparaquat 3acacodylic acid 3apicloram 3a2,4-D 3a2,4,5-T 3aphytotoxicity1 aMiller, F.

The effect on product color and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission was assessed. To predict energy and exergy parameters such as energy utilization ratio, energy utilization, exergy loss, and exergy efficiency, both the artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods were employed. Drying experiments were undertaken at three temperature levels of 50, 60, and 70 °C in air speed of 1 m/s and ultrasound pretreatment time 15, 30, and 45 min, as compared to controlled samples (without pretreatment). Results demonstrated that by raising the inlet air temperature and ultrasound pretreatment time, color change rate decreased, while energy utilization and exergy efficiency increased. Energy and exergy prediction results by means of ANN and ANFIS methods showed that ANFIS method achieved a higher R ₂ and lower RMS as compared to ANN. The highest level of GHG emission (NOₓ, CO₂) was obtained at 50 °C temperature for samples without pretreatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair temperature 3ablackberries 3acarbon dioxide 3acolor 3aexergy 3afuzzy logic 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aultrasonics 0aEnergy 0aBlackberry 0acombined hot air-infrared dryer 0aGHG emissions1 aKaveh, Mohammad1 aKhalife, Esmail1 aChen, Guangnan0 tDrying technology.g2021 Sept. 30, v. 39, no. 14 p.2075-2091dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2020.17530663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007800160520195400238592002802192650001202220650002402232650001402256650001102270650001802281650002102299650001202320650002502332650001002357650002102367650001102388650001002399650002402409650001902433650002202452650001202474650003202486650001502518650001602533651001902549700001602568700002002584700001902604700002202623700002802645700002202673700001802695773012802713856007502841852000902916655001202925IND60769837020221120084443.0220310e20220224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076983702DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140511152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEhlers, Dekker 10aMapping Forest Aboveground Biomass Using Multisource Remotely Sensed Data  aThe majority of the aboveground biomass on the Earth’s land surface is stored in forests. Thus, forest biomass plays a critical role in the global carbon cycle. Yet accurate estimate of forest aboveground biomass (FAGB) remains elusive. This study proposed a new conceptual model to map FAGB using remotely sensed data from multiple sensors. The conceptual model, which provides guidance for selecting remotely sensed data, is based on the principle of estimating FAGB on the ground using allometry, which needs species, diameter at breast height (DBH), and tree height as inputs. Based on the conceptual model, we used multiseasonal Landsat images to provide information about species composition for the forests in the study area, LiDAR data for canopy height, and the image texture and image texture ratio at two spatial resolutions for tree crown size, which is related to DBH. Moreover, we added RaDAR data to provide canopy volume information to the model. All the data layers were fed to a Random Forest (RF) regression model. The study was carried out in eastern North Carolina. We used biomass from the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis plots to train and test the model performance. The best model achieved an R² of 0.625 with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 18.8 Mg/ha (47.6%) with the “out-of-bag” samples at 30 × 30 m spatial resolution. The top five most important variables include the 95th, 85th, 75th, and 50th percentile heights of the LiDAR points and their standard deviations of 85th heights. Numerous features from multiseasonal Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR, multiseasonal Landsat 8 imagery along with image texture features from very high-resolution imagery were selected. But the importance of the height metrics dwarfed all other variables. More tests of the conceptual model in places with a broader range of biomass and more diverse species composition are needed to evaluate the importance of other input variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aaboveground biomass 3aallometry 3acanopy 3acanopy height 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3aglobal carbon budget 3alidar 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aradar 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3aspecies diversity 3atexture 3atree and stand measurements 3atree crown 3atree height 3aNorth Carolina1 aWang, Chao 1 aCoulston, John 1 aZhang, Yulong 1 aPavelsky, Tamlin 1 aFrankenberg, Elizabeth 1 aWoodcock, Curtis 1 aSong, Conghe 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Feb. 24, v. 14, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140511153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03543naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011800174300001600292520190900308592002802217650001602245650001702261650001902278650002102297650001602318650001202334650002402346650001802370650001802388650001702406650001202423650001702435650001502452650001402467651001002481653002102491653001602512653002002528653001602548653001902564653001602583653002702599653001502626653001702641653001902658700002202677700002002699700002202719700002502741773011702766856008502883852000902968655001202977IND60647512020221118071452.0190807e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064751202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2019.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIacopetti, Giovanni10aForest ecological heterogeneity determines contrasting relationships between crown defoliation and tree diversity  ap. 321-329.  aTree diversity is found to enhance ecosystem functions in forests and increase the resistance and resilience of trees subjected to environmental stress, including climate change. This effect, however, can be different depending on tree species assemblages and ecological contexts. The pan-European programme for monitoring forest health (ICP Forests) considers crown defoliation as an indicator of tree vitality. Only a few studies have analysed the role of tree diversity in crown defoliation, with contrasting results. This paper analyses the relationships between defoliation and forest diversity in a country (Italy) characterised by heterogeneous bioclimatic and edaphic characteristics (from Mediterranean to Alpine) and with a wide range of forest tree species and functional groups. National-scale results show that defoliation increased in more diverse forest stands. This result can be explained by the fact that the tree mixtures reflect varying ecological conditions in heterogeneous environments. The most relevant factors that explain tree defoliation at the national level, investigated through random forest analysis, were the geographic position, tree species identity and forest stand age and structure. Cluster analysis was applied to identify homogeneous groups of plots based on their ecological and vegetation features. Four clusters were selected. Within each homogeneous cluster, the crown defoliation of the tree species showed different and contrasting patterns, changing their relationships with diversity over time. A beneficial role of diversity on defoliation (i.e. decrease of defoliation) has been observed in Quercus ilex, growing in Mediterranean conditions, and Picea abies in Alpine areas after dry periods. In the latter species, drought led to a greater increase in defoliation in monospecific than in mixed stands, suggesting the stabilising role of tree diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aQuercus ilex 3aclimate change 3acluster analysis 3adefoliation 3adrought 3aecological function 3aforest health 3aforest stands 3aforest trees 3aforests 3amixed stands 3amonitoring 3astand age 3aItaly 0aCluster analysis 0aDefoliation 0aFagus sylvatica 0aICP Forests 0aLevel I survey 0aPicea abies 0aRandom forest analysis 0aResilience 0aQuercus ilex 0aTree diversity1 aBussotti, Filippo1 aSelvi, Federico1 aMaggino, Filomena1 aPollastrini, Martina0 tForest ecology and management.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 448 p.321-329dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003600099040001800135100001700153245005300170300001300223520144500236592002801681650001901709650001601728700001901744773011601763852000901879856008201888655001201970991566714670742620221119190030.0181030e197501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7590081032DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517575045001022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawton, J.B.10aIon-Exchange Properties of Cellulosic Polyanions  ap. 4-13.  aThermodynamic parameters have been determined for the ion exchange of inorganic cations with sodium ions on cellulosic polyanions which contain carboxyl, carboxymethyl, phosphate, or sulphate groups. These polyanions show similar properties to both ion-exchange resins and biological polyelectrolytes with respect to their ion-binding character istics. Thus both cellulose sulphate (—SO₂ ⁻) and cellulose phosphate (=PO₂ ⁻) bind potassium ions in preference to sodium ions, whereas with oxycellulose (—COO⁻) and carboxymethylcellulose (—CH₂COO ⁻) the order is reversed. The order of binding for copper(II) ions when exchanged for sodium ions is carboxymethyl > carboxyl > sulphate. For binding to carboxymethyl groups, the order of binding for divalent ions is Cu²⁺ > Mn²⁺ > Ca²⁺, but at sulphate groups the order is Mn²⁺ > Ca²⁺ > Cu²⁺. This behavior is here explained on the basis of two postulates: (1) that the ions are bound in the hydrated form to -SO₂- and = PO₂- groups, and (2) that at -CH ₃COO⁻ and —COO⁻ groups the effective radii of the ions are in order of their crystal radii. The cause of this difference in behavior is held to be the effective radius of the anionic group. A theory of ion-exchange selectivity is advanced which gives quantitative expression to these ideas and allows calculation of free-energy changes that are in good agreement with the experimental values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant products 3afield crops1 aPhillips, G.O.0 tTextile research journal.g1975 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.4-13dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517575045001023Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02975naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012500162300001400287520168300301592002801984650003302012650001602045650001502061650001302076650001502089650000902104650001902113650001602132650001902148650000902167650001402176650000902190650001702199650001802216650001302234650002502247651001102272700001502283700001602298700001402314773009902328856008102427852000902508655001202517IND60477942020221117233815.0160108e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047794202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-014-0476-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, B.

Firstly, this study utilized the USLE model and soil erosion pin data to compare the soil erosion potential of the Chushui and Aiyuzi subwatersheds and concluded that soil erosion drastically increased if accumulated rainfall exceeded 200 mm; also, erosion depths were greater in the Aiyuzi subwatershed while estimated total erosion volume was higher in the Chushui subwatershed; this was attributed to the larger area of Chushui subwatershed and based on field measurements which supported the results of the USLE model. Secondly, this study utilized modified USLE model to compare the extreme event erosion resulting from typhoon Morakot which revealed that high rainfall intensity and long-duration rainfall events can generate large volume non-point sources of sediment that is estimated to far exceed 7–10 times of the annual soil erosion. Thirdly, this study related the C parameter of the USLE model to the existing land use in the Shenmu watershed using current, real data. Finally, this study established a post-typhoon Morakot soil erosion risk map composed of five categories of risk which was compared with post-event land cover to suggest high-erosion risk zones that may require further monitoring, remediation, and engineering measures to limit soil loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUniversal Soil Loss Equation 3aengineering 3aland cover 3aland use 3amonitoring 3arain 3arain intensity 3aremediation 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3asediments 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3asubwatersheds 3atyphoons 3awatershed management 3aTaiwan1 aThomas, K.1 aChen, C.

Dedicator of cytokinesis 2–engulfment and cell motility protein 1 (DOCK2{bullet}ELMO1) complex formation is required for DOCK2-mediated Rac signaling. In this study, we identified the N-terminal 177-residue fragment and the C-terminal 196-residue fragment of human DOCK2 and ELMO1, respectively, as the mutual binding regions, and solved the crystal structure of their complex at 2.1-Å resolution. The C-terminal Pro-rich tail of ELMO1 winds around the Src-homology 3 domain of DOCK2, and an intermolecular five-helix bundle is formed. Overall, the entire regions of both DOCK2 and ELMO1 assemble to create a rigid structure, which is required for the DOCK2{bullet}ELMO1 binding, as revealed by mutagenesis. Intriguingly, the DOCK2{bullet}ELMO1 interface hydrophobically buries a residue which, when mutated, reportedly relieves DOCK180 from autoinhibition. We demonstrated that the ELMO-interacting region and the DOCK-homology region 2 guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain of DOCK2 associate with each other for the autoinhibition, and that the assembly with ELMO1 weakens the interaction, relieving DOCK2 from the autoinhibition. The interactions between the N- and C-terminal regions of ELMO1 reportedly cause its autoinhibition, and binding with a DOCK protein relieves the autoinhibition for ras homolog gene family, member G binding and membrane localization. In fact, the DOCK2{bullet}ELMO1 interface also buries the ELMO1 residues required for the autoinhibition within the hydrophobic core of the helix bundle. Therefore, the present complex structure reveals the structural basis by which DOCK2 and ELMO1 mutually relieve their autoinhibition for the activation of Rac1 for lymphocyte chemotaxis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abotulinum toxin 3acell movement 3achemotaxis 3acrystal structure 3acytokinesis 3agenes 3aguanine 3ahumans 3amutagenesis1 aKukimoto-Niino, Mutsuko1 aMishima-Tsumagari, Chiemi1 aAkasaka, Ryogo1 aOhsawa, Noboru1 aSekine, Shun-ichi1 aIto, Takuhiro1 aTochio, Naoya1 aKoshiba, Seizo1 aKigawa, Takanori1 aTerada, Takaho1 aShirouzu, Mikako1 aNishikimi, Akihiko1 aUruno, Takehito1 aKatakai, Tomoya1 aKinashi, Tatsuo1 aKohda, Daisuke1 aFukui, Yoshinori1 aYokoyama, Shigeyuki0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Feb. 28, v. 109, no. 9 p.3305-3310dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11135121093Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001300161245006200174300001600236500000900252520167800261592002801939650002001967650001101987650001701998650002602015650001902041650002202060650002402082700001802106773012102124852000902245856009802254655001202352IND8904271020221120135652.0191122e198703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890427102DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1987.0011183X002700020036x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReed, R.10aParaheliotropic Leaf Movements in Mature Alfalfa Canopies  ap. 301-304.  aepub  aThe relationship between plant water potential and midday sunavoiding leaf movement was studied in mature alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) canopies. Diurnal solar tracking patterns were determined for three cultivars representing different germplasm sources: ‘African’, a nondormant type introduced from the arid regions of Africa; ‘Lahontan’, a semidormant type of Turkistan origin; and ‘Norseman’, a dormant type introduced from the Ladak province of northern India. Solar tracking was measureduring four regrowth cycles beginning in early spring and concluding in early fall. Early and late season regrowth cycles for African and Lahontan were typified by patterns in which leaflet surfaces were positioned perpendicular to incident radiation (diaheliotropism) throughout the day. Late spring and midsummer diurnal diaheliotropic patterns were interrupted by midday sun-avoiding paraheliotropic (PHT) movement in both cultivars. Conversely, diurnal tracking in Norseman was interrupted by PHT movement in all cycles. Leaflet PHT movement is generally presumed to be a stress-avoidance mechanism induced by changes in plant water status. However, regression analyses of PHT activity data for alfalfa showed no clear relationship between diurnal PHT patterns and xylem water potential (XWP) either among cultivars or with the onset of and recovery from PHT activity. Rather, in all three cultivars, cupping was consistently related to ambient vapor pressure deficit (VPD). African and Lahontan did not exhibit midday leaflet PHT movement during the late season regrowth cycle even when the daily ambient VPD and XWP profiles were similar to the midseason patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3acanopy 3aphototropism 3axylem water potential 3avapor pressure 3adiurnal variation 3aregression analysis1 aTravis, R.

The occurrence of Rickettsia in chigger mites, which are vectors of scrub typhus in the western Pacific region, has been infrequently investigated. We identified Rickettsia spp. in chiggers collected from small mammals in six counties of Taiwan. Moreover, by capitalising on parallel Rickettsia detections on small mammals and their infested ticks and fleas, we were able to identify Rickettsia spp. that suggested more intimate associations with chigger mites. Rickettsia detection rates in 318 pools of chiggers were 21.7% and 22.3% when based on the ompB and gltA gene, respectively. Overall, we identified six (based on the ompB gene) and eight (gltA gene) Rickettsia species. Approximately half of the sequenced species were most similar to Rickettsia sp. clone MB74‐1 (ompB gene) and Rickettsia sp. TwKM02 (gltA gene). Furthermore, both species were either infrequently or never identified in small mammals, ticks and fleas, which suggests that chigger mites might be the primary host of both rickettsiae. Whether both species are pathogenic to humans remains to be studied. They may also be microbial endosymbionts of chigger mites, with their potential effects on the pathogenicity of the aetiologic agent of scrub typhus deserving further investigations.  aPublisher supplied data  aDOH97‐DC‐2004cTaiwan Centers for Disease Control  aDOH98‐DC‐2012cTaiwan Centers for Disease Control  aDOH99‐DC‐2028cTaiwan Centers for Disease Control 3aRickettsia 3achiggers 3aendosymbionts 3agenes 3amedical and veterinary entomology 3apathogenicity 3ascrub typhus 3aTaiwan1 aLee, Pei‐Lung1 aWang, Hsi‐Chieh0 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2022 June, v. 36, no. 2 p.223-229dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl42323x0269-283X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mve.125603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245008800178300001800266520130500284592002801589650001401617650001501631650001201646650001501658650002001673650001101693650001101704650001301715650001701728651001101745653001401756653001301770653001801783653002001801653002701821700002801848700003601876700002901912773009901941856008502040852000902125655001202134IND60613577320221123043835.0190923e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061357732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2018.08.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva César, Aldara10aCompetitiveness analysis of “social soybeans” in biodiesel production in Brazil  ap. 1147-1157.  aBiodiesel production was stimulated in Brazil by the National Program for Production and Use of Biodiesel. The program has two objectives: ensuring both production and domestic consumption of biodiesel; and promoting diversification of feedstock sources, social inclusion, and regional development by generating employment and income for small rural farmers. However, despite the great potential for diversification of oilseed raw materials, soybeans make up the majority of the raw material that feeds the Brazilian biodiesel supply chain. Soybeans have two advantages: meeting the domestic demand for biodiesel; and having the most competitive prices, compared to other raw materials. Soybeans also support the social aspect of the federal program, although productive arrangements with small farmers are concentrated in the South region of Brazil. This paper characterizes the “social soybean” production chain for biodiesel production in Brazil and describes some of the competitive drivers that explain how soybeans from small farmers have been established as the main feedstock source. The paper also describes some bottlenecks and suggests actions that might address them in order to contribute to increased competitiveness of soybeans from small farmers in biodiesel production in Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3aemployment 3afarmers 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3aincome 3aprices 3asoybeans 3asupply chain 3aBrazil 0aBiodiesel 0aSoybeans 0aSmall farmers 0aCompetitiveness 0aSouth region of Brazil1 aConejero, Marco Antonio1 aBarros Ribeiro, Eliene Cristina1 aBatalha, Mário Otávio,0 tRenewable energy.g2019 Apr., v. 133 p.1147-1157dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2018.08.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007900168300001600247500001400263520104200277592002801319650001301347650001901360650001201379650001001391700002401401700002401425700002701449773013801476856008201614852000901696655001201705IND60607920020221119044240.0180904e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060792002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-018-1273-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalcott, Charles10aOlfactory navigation versus olfactory activation: a controversy revisited  ap. 703-706.  aEditorial  aIn the early 1970s, Floriano Papi and colleagues proposed the olfactory-navigation hypothesis, which explains the homing ability of pigeons by the existence of an odor-based map acquired through learning. This notion, although supported by some observations, has also generated considerable controversy since its inception. As an alternative, Paulo Jorge and colleagues formulated in 2009 the olfactory-activation hypothesis, which states that atmospheric odorants do not provide navigational information but, instead, activate a non-olfactory path integration system. However, this hypothesis is challenged by an investigation authored by Anna Gagliardo and colleagues and published in the current issue of the Journal of Comparative Physiology A. In this editorial, the significance of the findings of this study is assessed in the broader context of the role of olfaction in avian navigation and homing, and experiments are suggested that might help to finally resolve the olfactory-navigation versus olfactory-activation controversy.  aPublisher supplied data 3alearning 3aodor compounds 3apigeons 3asmell1 aWiltschko, Wolfgang1 aWiltschko, Roswitha1 aZupanc, Günther K.

Using sites in Great Britain as a case study, we use a novel qualitative approach combining ecological information and field survey data to establish a national list of crop pollinating bees for four economically important crops (apple, field bean, oilseed rape and strawberry). A traits data base was used to establish potential pollinators, and combined with field data to identify both dominant crop flower visiting bee species and other species that could be important crop pollinators, but which are not presently sampled in large numbers on crops flowers. Whilst we found evidence that a small number of common, generalist species make a disproportionate contribution to flower visits, many more species were identified as potential pollinators, including rare and specialist species. Furthermore, we found evidence of substantial variation in the bee communities of different crops. Establishing a national list of crop pollinators is important for practitioners and policy makers, allowing targeted management approaches for improved ecosystem services, conservation and species monitoring. Data can be used to make recommendations about how pollinator diversity could be promoted in agricultural landscapes. Our results suggest agri-environment schemes need to support a higher diversity of species than at present, notably of solitary bees. Management would also benefit from targeting specific species to enhance crop pollination services to particular crops. Whilst our study is focused upon Great Britain, our methodology can easily be applied to other countries, crops and groups of pollinating insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aagricultural management 3aagriculture 3aapples 3abeans 3acase studies 3adatabases 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3aflowers 3apollination 3aqualitative analysis 3aspecies diversity 3astrawberries 3asurveys 3aGreat Britain 0aAgri-environment Schemes 0aApple 0aBiodiversity 0aCrop pollination 0aDominant pollinators 0aEcosystem services 0aField bean 0aOilseed rape 0aRare species 0aStrawberry1 aOliver, Tom H.1 aBreeze, Tom D.1 aBailes, Emily J.1 aBrünjes, Lisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1344-14761 aCampbell, Alistair J.1 aErhardt, Andreas1 ade Groot, G.

These models are of interest because evaluations regarding the best approach to contaminated site remediation are shifting toward increased use of risk-based decision, and the ASTM RBCA methodology represents the most effective and internationally widely used standardized guide for risk assessment process. This paper identifies key physical and chemical parameters that need additional precision and accuracy consideration in order to reduce uncertainty in models prediction, thereby saving time, money and engineering effort in the data collection process. SA was performed applying a variance-based method to organic contaminants migration models with reference to soil-to-groundwater leaching ingestion exposure scenario. Results indicate that model output strongly depends on the organic-carbon partition coefficient, organic-carbon content, net infiltration, Darcy velocity, source-receptor distance, and first-order decay constant.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adietary exposure 3aexposure scenario 3ahumans 3aleaching 3amaterials testing 3amodels 3apartition coefficients 3apollutants 3aprediction 3aremediation 3arisk assessment process 3auncertainty1 aVecchio, Antonella1 aBelgiorno, V.,0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2005 Dec., v. 111, no. 1-3 p.133-148dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-005-8218-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245016100165520101900326592002801345650002201373650002701395650001201422650003201434650001601466650002501482650001201507650002001519650001101539650002101550650001901571650002101590653002101611653002901632653002201661653001801683653002101701700001501722700001601737700001901753700001601772700001401788700002001802700001501822773010601837856008701943852000902030655001202039IND60687416820221116181717.0201024e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068741682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1232542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yue10aEvaluating the performance of inorganic draw solution concentrations in an anaerobic forward osmosis membrane bioreactor for real municipal sewage treatment  aSewage can become a valuable source if its treatment is re-oriented for recovery. An anaerobic forward osmosis membrane bioreactor (AnOMBR) was developed for real municipal sewage treatment to investigate performance, biogas production, flux change and mixed liquor characteristics. The AnOMBR had a good treatment capacity with removal ratio of chemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen and total phosphorus more than 96%, 88%, 89% and almost 100%. Although high DS concentration increased the initial flux, it caused rapid decline and poor recoverability of FO membrane flux. Low DS concentration led to too long hydraulic retention time, thus resulting in a low reactor efficiency. Additionally, it was observed that salt, protein, polysaccharide and humic acid were all accumulated in the reactor, which was not conducive to stable long-term operation. Based on the characteristics of membrane fouling, salt accumulation and AnOMBR performance, the optimal DS of 1 M NaCl solution was selected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3achemical oxygen demand 3afouling 3agas production (biological) 3ahumic acids 3amembrane bioreactors 3aosmosis 3apolysaccharides 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 0aMunicipal sewage 0aForward osmosis membrane 0aAnaerobic reactor 0aDraw solution 0aMembrane fouling1 aFang, Zhou1 aChen, Cheng1 aZhu, Xianzheng1 aLiang, Peng1 aQiu, Yong1 aZhang, Xiaoyuan1 aHuang, Xia0 tBioresource technology.g2020 July, v. 307 p.123254-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1232543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012400160300002200284520091300306592002801219650001501247650002201262650001601284650002501300650002001325650002101345650001501366650001101381650002101392650001801413650000901431650001901440650001301459650001101472700001701483700001901500773012701519856007401646852000901720655001201729IND60669509620221120210631.0190920e20151216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066950962DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra22654f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hongfang13aAn ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of human immunoglobulin G based on Ag@BSA microspheres  ap. 106607-106612.  aA novel human immunoglobulin G (HIgG) electrochemical immunosensor was developed based on nanosilver-doped bovine serum albumin microspheres (Ag@BSA). The immunosensor was prepared step-wise by first modifying the electrode with β-cyclodextrin functionalized gold nanoparticles followed by the immobilization of captured antibodies and then the formation of a sandwich-type immunocomplex to introduce Ag@BSA bionanoprobes on the sensor surface. The amplification pathway using the stripping voltammetric measurement of silver ions released from Ag@BSA to monitor the immunoreaction was first adopted. The immunosensor exhibited a large dynamic range of 1 fg mL⁻¹ to 10 pg mL⁻¹ and an ultralow detection limit of 0.5 fg mL⁻¹ to HIgG. Moreover, the immunosensor also showed acceptable stability and reproducibility. This biosensor was applied to the detection of the HIgG level in real serum samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3ablood serum 3abovine serum albumin 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunosensors 3aions 3amicroparticles 3ananogold 3asilver1 aNing, Danlei1 aZheng, Jianbin0 tRSC advances.g2015 Dec. 16, v. 5, no. 129 p.106607-106612dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra22654f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012600162500001900288520148900307592002801796650001201824650001501836650001601851650001701867650001401884650001501898650000901913650001401922650001201936651001101948700002001959700002301979700001802002700002302020700002502043700001802068700002302086700002502109773012002134856007302254852000902327655001202336IND60738944020221123020504.0210524e20210516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073894402DNAL7 a10.3390/v130509222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaugrois, Jean  H.10aComparison of the Virome of Quarantined Sugarcane Varieties and the Virome of Grasses Growing near the Quarantine Station  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVisacane is a sugarcane quarantine station located in the South of France, far away from sugarcane growing areas. Visacane imports up to 100 sugarcane varieties per year, using safe control and confinement measures of plants and their wastes to prevent any risk of pathogen spread outside of the facilities. Viruses hosted by the imported material are either known or unknown to cause disease in cultivated sugarcane. Poaceae viruses occurring in plants surrounding the quarantine glasshouse are currently unknown. These viruses could be considered as a source of new sugarcane infections and potentially cause new sugarcane diseases in cases of confinement barrier failure. The aim of this study was to compare the plant virome inside and outside of the quarantine station to identify potential confinement failures and risks of cross infections. Leaves from quarantined sugarcane varieties and from wild Poaceae growing near the quarantine were collected and processed by a metagenomics approach based on virion-associated nucleic acids extraction and library preparation for Illumina sequencing. While viruses belonging to the same virus genus or family were identified in the sugarcane quarantine and its surroundings, no virus species was detected in both environments. Based on the data obtained in this study, no virus movement between quarantined sugarcane and nearby grassland has occurred so far, and the confinement procedures of Visacane appear to be properly implemented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoaceae 3agrasslands 3agreenhouses 3ametagenomics 3apathogens 3aquarantine 3arisk 3asugarcane 3aviruses 3aFrance1 aFilloux, Denis 1 aJulian, Charlotte 1 aClaude, Lisa 1 aFerdinand, Romain 1 aFernandez, Emmanuel 1 aFontes, Hugo 1 aRott, Philippe  C.1 aRoumagnac, Philippe 0 tViruses.g2021 May 16, v. 13, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130509223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010600162520161300268592002801881650001201909650002001921650001101941650000901952650002601961650001001987650001501997700002202012700002002034700001702054773011902071856007402190852000902264655001202273IND60769852120221121164305.0220310e20220226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076985212DNAL7 a10.3390/w140507482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeghi, Farzaneh 10aAssessing the Performance of LISFLOOD-FP and SWMM for a Small Watershed with Scarce Data Availability  aFlooding events are becoming more frequent and the negative impacts that they are causing globally are very significant. Current predictions have confirmed that conditions linked with future climate scenarios are worsening; therefore, there is a strong need to improve flood risk modeling and to develop innovative approaches to tackle this issue. However, the numerical tools available nowadays (commercial and freeware) need essential data for calibration and validation purposes and, regrettably, this cannot always be provided in every country for dissimilar reasons. This work aims to examine the quality and capabilities of open-source numerical flood modeling tools and their data preparation process in situations where calibration datasets may be of poor quality or not available at all. For this purpose, EPA’s Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was selected to investigate 1D modeling and LISFLOOD-FP was chosen for 2D modeling. The simulation results obtained with freeware products showed that both models are reasonably capable of detecting flood features such as critical points, flooding extent, and water depth. However, although working with them is more challenging than working with commercial products, the quality of the results relative to the reference map was acceptable. Therefore, this study demonstrated that LISFLOOD-FP and SWMM can cope with the lack of these variables as a starting point and has provided steps to undertake to generate reliable results for the need required, which is the estimation of the impacts of flooding events and the likelihood of their occurrence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adata collection 3amodels 3arisk 3astormwater management 3awater 3awatersheds1 aRubinato, Matteo 1 aGoerke, Marcel 1 aHart, James 0 tWater.g2022 Feb. 26, v. 14, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140507483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245010500169300001600274520144600290592002801736650002201764650002001786650002001806650001601826650002301842650002101865650001901886650002101905650001101926650001301937650002501950650001601975650000901991650001502000650002302015650002502038650002502063650001702088651001002105653002002115653002202135653001602157653002102173653002502194653001402219653000902233700001902242700001902261700002102280700001602301700001502317773011402332856008402446852000902530655001202539IND60535459420221116195652.0190403e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053545942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2015.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiangping13aAn assessment of irrigation practices: Sprinkler irrigation of winter wheat in the North China Plain  ap. 197-208.  aWinter wheat production in the North China Plain (NCP) relies mainly on irrigation. To assess the effect irrigation management practices on crop production, the HYDRUS-1D model was modified by incorporating the crop growth module adopted from the EPIC model. The modified HYDRUS-1D model was calibrated and validated by using data collected from 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 winter wheat growing seasons in Beijing area. The predicted values for soil water content, soil nitrate concentration, crop growth, yield, and evapotranspiration showed good agreements with the measured values. The calibrated model was then used to evaluate the yield and water use efficiency (WUE) under different hydrologic years. The WUE for different irrigation depth was considered as the criterion for investigating the appropriate irrigation management practices. Results showed that the appropriate irrigation depth per application could be determined as 62.5% of the difference between 20cmpan evaporation and precipitation for hydrologic years with 75%, 50% and 25% probability of rainfall occurrence, respectively, under the recommended nitrogen application rate in Beijing area. And the corresponding total irrigation amount was 244.7, 213.8 and 192.5mm. The results of this study provide scientific implications for water management of winter wheat under sprinkler irrigation in the NCP and those areas with similar climatic and cropping practice conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acrop production 3adata collection 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3afertilizer rates 3agrowing season 3airrigation rates 3amodels 3anitrates 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aprobability 3arain 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asprinkler irrigation 3awater use efficiency 3awinter wheat 3aChina 0aSoil water flow 0aNitrate transport 0aCrop growth 0aHydrologic years 0aWater use efficiency 0aHYDRUS-1D 0aEPIC1 aHuang, Guanhua1 aYang, Jingsong1 aHuang, Quanzhong1 aLiu, Haijun1 aYu, Lipeng0 tAgricultural water management.g2015 Sept., v. 159 p.197-208dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2015.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013300158300001800291520175000309592002802059650002302087650002102110650002502131650001002156650001502166650001102181650000702192650001702199650001302216700002402229700002002253700001302273700001702286773013402303856007502437852000902512655001202521IND60658814820221120232444.0190826e20110221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065881482DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc03734f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiao-Yu10aSelf-formation phenomenon to hierarchically structured porous materials: design, synthesis, formation mechanism and applications  ap. 2763-2786.  aIn this paper, we will thoroughly review a novel and versatile self-formation phenomenon that can be exploited to target porous hierarchies of materials without need of any external templates only on the basis of the chemistry of metal alkoxides and alkylmetals. These hierarchically porous materials have unique structures, which are made of either parallel funnel-like/straight macrochannels or 3D continuous interconnected macroporous foams with micro/mesoporous walls. The self-generated porogen mechanism has been proposed, leading to a series of techniques to tailor porous hierarchy, i.e. the use of different chemical precursors (single metal alkoxides, mixed metal alkoxides, single molecular precursors with two different alkoxide functionalities, alkylmetals, etc., …), the control of their hydrolysis and condensation rates (pH, chelating agents,…) and the addition of alkoxysilanes as co-reactant. Various chemical compositions from single or binary metal oxides, to aluminosilicates, aluminophosphates, silicoaluminophosphates, metallophosphates,… can be prepared, offering a panel of potential applications. Some perspectives have been proposed to transform the synthesized materials with a hierarchy of pore sizes to micro–meso–macroporous crystalline materials with zeolite architectures. The advantages of this self-formation preparation method have been discussed compared to traditional templating methods. The possibility to combine with other strategies, for example soft or hard templating, to target even more sophisticated hierarchically meso–macroporous materials with specific structure and function for various applications has been presented. The “hierarchical catalysis” concept has been re-visited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum silicates 3achelating agents 3achemical composition 3afoams 3ahydrolysis 3aoxides 3apH 3aporous media 3azeolites1 aLéonard, Alexandre1 aLemaire, Arnaud1 aTian, Ge1 aSu, Bao-Lian0 tChemical communications.g2011 Feb. 21, v. 47, no. 10 p.2763-2786dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc03734f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015300168500002200321520161100343592002801954653002101982653001602003653002402019653002302043653002402066653001902090653001602109653002602125653002402151653002702175700002102202700002102223700001902244700001602263773012002279856008402399852000902483655001202492IND60557200020221123021436.0161115s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055720002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.alkona.2016.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazur, Joanna10aExternal evaluation of the school and academic achievements in relation to alcohol drinking and delinquent behaviour among secondary school students  aPre-press version  aThe aim of the paper is to evaluate the association between overall state school assessment and selected problem behaviours among secondary school students.The nationwide sample included 4085 students interviewed in 2015, from 70 randomly selected schools that had undergone comprehensive external evaluation. Two standardised scales describing alcohol drinking and delinquent behaviour taken from Polish version of CHIP-AE questionnaire (Child Health and Illness Profile – Adolescent Edition) were used. Hierarchical data structure was taking into account by comparison between a standard linear model and a mixed model with random intercept. The school assessment was based on 12 evaluation requirements and three categories of schools were distinguished (worse, average and better; 20%, 60% and 20% of the sampled schools respectively). Impact of gender, age, school achievements and family affluence on problem behaviours were analysed at the individual level.Among individual determinants, males and poor school achievements were a prediction of both problem behaviours (alcohol use and delinquent behaviour). A significant relationship between the results of school evaluation and alcohol use was demonstrated in preliminary analyses, but was weakly confirmed in multilevel models. However, the association between these results of school evaluation and the variability of delinquent behaviour index was revealed in the multivariate analysis, particularly in interaction with school achievements.Better school may reduce the negative impact of factors contributing to adolescence problem behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAlcohol drinking 0aDelinquency 0aSchool determinants 0aProtective factors 0aMultilevel analysis 0apicie alkoholu 0awykroczenia 0auwarunkowania szkolne 0aczynniki chroniące 0aanaliza wielopoziomowa1 aKowalewska, Anna1 aZawadzka, Dorota1 aDzielska, Anna1 aWais, Kamil0 tAlcoholism and Drug Addiction.g2016, dElsevier Sp. z o.o.aInstitute of Psychiatry and Neurologyx0867-43617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.alkona.2016.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245014700177520173400324592002802058650002602086650001402112650002602126650001802152650001402170650001602184650001202200650001702212650002502229650002202254650001802276650001602294650001102310650000702321650002302328650001102351651001002362653001102372653002902383653002402412653002502436700002002461700001502481773013002496856009002626852000902716655001202725IND60734557320221123042032.0211218e20210602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073455732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.1091992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chengcheng10aBiochemical changes and microbial community dynamics during spontaneous fermentation of Zhacai, a traditional pickled mustard tuber from China  aZhacai is a traditional fermented vegetable that has been consumed in China for centuries. It is currently manufactured by spontaneous fermentation and therefore mostly relies on the activities of autochthonous microorganisms. Here, we characterized microbial community dynamics and associated biochemical changes in 12% salted Zhacai during a 90-day spontaneous fermentation process using high-throughput sequencing and chromatography-based approaches to identify associations between microorganisms and fermentation characteristics. Amplicon sequencing targeting bacterial 16S rRNA genes revealed that bacterial communities were dominated by halophilic bacteria (HAB, i.e., Halomonas and Idiomarina) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB, i.e., Lactobacillus-related genera and Weissella) after 30 days of fermentation. In addition, the relative abundances of the fungal genera Debaryomyces, Sterigmatomyces, and Sporidiobolus increased as fermentation progressed. Concomitantly, pH decreased while titratable acidity increased during fermentation, along with associated variation in biochemical profiles. Overall, the levels of organic acids (i.e., lactic and acetic acid), free amino acids (i.e., alanine, lysine, and glutamic acid), and volatiles (i.e., alcohols, esters, aldehydes, and ketones) increased in mature Zhacai. In addition, the abundances of Lactobacillus-related species, Halomonas spp., Idiomarina loihiensis, as well as that of the yeast Debaryomyces hansenii, were strongly correlated with increased concentrations of organic acids, amino acids, biogenic amines, and volatiles. This study provides new detailed insights into the succession of microbial communities and their potential roles in Zhacai fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDebaryomyces hansenii 3aHalomonas 3aIdiomarina loihiensis 3aSporidiobolus 3aWeissella 3aacetic acid 3aalanine 3afermentation 3afermented vegetables 3afood microbiology 3aglutamic acid 3alactic acid 3alysine 3apH 3atitratable acidity 3ayeasts 3aChina 0aZhacai 0aAutochthonous microbiota 0aBiochemical changes 0aCorrelation analysis1 aZhang, Jianming1 aLiu, Daqun0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2021 June 02, v. 347 p.109199-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.1091993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009200170520198300262592002802245650001002273650001202283650002502295650003602320650002302356650003902379650002102418650001902439650001102458650001902469650002402488650001802512650001102530650001602541650002202557650003702579650001602616653003002632653002502662653002702687653002702714653003002741700006502771700002302836773010302859856008702962852000903049655001203058IND60687388020221119141039.0200523e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068738802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1109752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Niketa10aHow does bovine serum albumin sustain in saccharomate® derived from pine tree biomass?  aNowadays, research on renewable raw materials and bioresources is a new concern towards the promotion of sustainable process and product development. The use of various plant biomasses such as starch, lignocellulosic and saccharide can be considered as an alternative for using cheaper and less polluting raw materials. In this regard, pine tree biomass, a lignocellulosic forest residue that has various value-added importance and it acts as a model of economic value to the agro-industrial fields. On the other hand, in order to meet and address the challenges of ever-increasing demands of bioresources, there has been significant research interest in deciphering the molecular interactions between proteins and biomass derived substances. No study reports the significance of saccharomate® derived from pine tree biomass on the structural and thermal stability of proteins. There is a sizable interest in the interactions between proteins and biomass derived substances, owing to their utilization and applications. Herein, we used various biophysical techniques such as absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) to study the impact of pine tree biomass derived saccharomate® (PBDS) on bovine serum albumin (BSA). Further for better understanding of morphological changes of BSA in presence of biomass, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also studied. The present study revealed that the increasing concentration of saccharomate® perturbs structural stability however; the thermal stability of BSA remained unchanged. The transition temperature of BSA remained approximately same in presence of different concentrations of PBDS. Furthermore, the size of BSA increases from 9.22 nm to 135.58 nm in presence of higher concentration of PBDS as revealed by DLS studies. To the best of our knowledge, the results represent first detailed proof of the unusual effect of PBDS on the model protein BSA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3abiomass 3abovine serum albumin 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aeconomic valuation 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3alight scattering 3alignocellulose 3amodels 3aplant residues 3aproduct development 3araw materials 3astarch 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avalue added 0aPine tree derived biomass 0aBovine serum albumin 0aTransition temperature 0aBiophysical techniques 0aBiomolecular interactions1 aUmapathi, Reddicherla1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8071-53451 aVenkatesu, Pannuru0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 July, v. 191 p.110975-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1109753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245015500173300001600328520186400344592002802208650001702236650001302253650001602266650001802282650002402300650001002324650001202334650001402346650002502360651001002385653002202395653002902417653002102446653004702467700001802514700002102532700001802553700002402571700002802595773009802623856008702721852000902808655001202817IND60625444720221119064241.0190129e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062544472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2018.11.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugito, Nobuhiko10aEvolution of Riedel-shear pop-up structures during cumulative strike-slip faulting: A case study in the Misayama-Godo area, Fujimi Town, central Japan  ap. 446-455.  aStrike-slip faulting often develops en échelon faulting resulting from Riedel shears. When faulted basement rocks are covered by thick unconsolidated deposits, this en échelon faulting leads to the subsequent evolution of a series of pop-ups along the fault during cumulative displacement. Although previous sandbox experiments and numerical simulations have examined the evolutionary processes for Riedel-shear pop-up structure formation, few field examples have been reported until now concerning (1) the time-series of evolutionary processes of pop-up structure generation and (2) time periods necessary to reach the stage of a “throughgoing fault zone”. The Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL) fault zone is among the largest and fastest-slipping active fault zones in Japan, and a series of tectonic pop-ups related to left-lateral strike-slip displacement have developed in the Fujimi area in the central to southern part of the fault zone. This area is covered by thick (~820 m) unconsolidated deposits, which have resulted in Riedel-shear pop-up structures. We conducted a geomorphic analysis, an extensive drilling survey, and pit excavation survey on a pop-up in the Misayama-Godo area of Fujimi, and concluded that (1) the pop-up structures in the Misayama-Godo area have been built up by two marginal faults between ~100 ka and ~10–20 ka, and (2) the fault displacement at depth has been concentrated on the faults that run across the pop-up structures (corresponding to the “throughgoing fault zone”) since ~10–20 ka. One of the faults that run across the pop-up structures probably slipped during the most recent earthquake in the central to southern part of the ISTL fault zone. This study is presented as a robust field example of the evolution of Riedel-shear pop-up structures during cumulative strike-slip faulting.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adrilling 3aearthquakes 3ageomorphology 3amathematical models 3arocks 3asurveys 3atectonics 3atime series analysis 3aJapan 0aTectonic landform 0aStrike-slip active fault 0aPop-up structure 0aItoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line fault zone1 aSawa, Hiroshi1 aTaniguchi, Kaoru1 aSato, Yoshiki1 aWatanabe, Mitsuhisa1 aSuzuki, Y.q(Yasuhiro),0 tGeomorphology.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 327 p.446-455dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2018.11.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010100172500002200273520162600295592002801921653001701949653002001966653001201986653001601998653002402014653001202038773012002050856008402170852000902254655001202263IND60557200120221123021511.0161115s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055720012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.alkona.2016.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŚlęzak, Izabela10aCauses and strategies of limiting psychoactive substance use by female escort agency sex workers  aPre-press version  aPurpose of the article is to analyse the motives of the decision to limit or stop using psychoactive substances (mainly alcohol) by female escort agency sex workers. Also presented are sex workers’ strategies to realise those objectives despite easy access to psychoactive substances and co-worker or client pressure to use them.The empirical basis of the article is in the form of 43 in-depth interviews with female escort agency sex workers. All interviewees declared they have attempted to limit consumption of psychoactive substances. Transcriptions and notes from the interview underwent analysis according to Grounded Theory methodology; that is open, selective, axial and theoretical coding. A constant comparative method was also employed.Indoor sex workers undertake activities intended to limit the amount of used substances, resulting from self-reflection, influence of significant others or pressure from agency managers. The researched women tried to achieve the objective through several strategies: limitation of amount and type of consumed substances, controlled alcohol/drug consumption, change of the agency to one with a less liberal approach to substance use and application of disulfiram.Escort agency sex workers use the public support system for addicted individuals to an insignificant extent. They also do not participate in the Anonymous Alcoholics meetings. The crossing stigma related to prostitution and psychoactive substance abuse encourage them to undertake independent attempts to limit consumption, especially such that do not require participation in a therapy or in self-help groups.  aPublisher supplied data 0aProstitution 0aEscort agencies 0aAlcohol 0aprostytucja 0aagencje towarzyskie 0aalkohol0 tAlcoholism and Drug Addiction.g2016, dElsevier Sp. z o.o.aInstitute of Psychiatry and Neurologyx0867-43617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.alkona.2016.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245008900207300002000296506007600316520157600392592002801968506003701996650002302033650001302056650001202069650001802081650001202099650001202111650001602123650001002139650001902149650001802168650001202186650001302198653001802211653001602229653001302245700002402258700002202282773017602304856007902480852000902559655001202568IND60173849120221207113336.0150603e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017384912DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13168521102doi7 aPMC38010342pmcid7 a240858522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Sun-Young10aCalpain-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangement exploited for anthrax toxin endocytosis  ap. E4007-E4015.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe protective antigen component of Bacillus anthracis toxins can interact with at least three distinct proteins on the host cell surface, capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (CMG2), tumor endothelial marker 8, and β ₁-integrin, and, with the assistance of other host proteins, enters targeted cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Using an antisense-based phenotypic screen, we discovered the role of calpains in this process. We show that functions of a ubiquitous Ca ²⁺-dependent cysteine protease, calpain-2, and of the calpain substrate talin-1 are exploited for association of anthrax toxin and its principal receptor, CMG2, with higher-order actin filaments and consequently for toxin entry into host cells. Down-regulated expression of calpain-2 or talin-1, or pharmacological interference with calpain action, did not affect toxin binding but reduced endocytosis and increased the survival of cells exposed to anthrax lethal toxin. Adventitious expression of wild-type talin-1 promoted toxin endocytosis and lethality, whereas expression of a talin-1 mutant (L432G) that is insensitive to calpain cleavage did not. Disruption of talin-1, which links integrin-containing focal adhesion complexes to the actin cytoskeleton, facilitated association of toxin bound to its principal cell-surface receptor, CMG2, with higher-order actin filaments undergoing dynamic disassembly and reassembly during endocytosis. Our results reveal a mechanism by which a bacterial toxin uses constitutively occurring calpain-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement for internalization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus anthracis 3aadhesion 3aanthrax 3aanthrax toxin 3acalcium 3acalpain 3aendocytosis 3agenes 3amicrofilaments 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3aproteins 0alethal factor 0acalpastatin 0aMDL281701 aMartchenko, Mikhail1 aCohen, Stanley N.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 110, no. 42 p.E4007-E4015dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13168521103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016600168300001800334500001900352520142400371592002801795650002301823650002001846650001801866650001201884700002001896700001901916700005801935700005601993700005602049773012102105856008402226852000902310655001202319IND60713729520221119135502.0201023e20200925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071372952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.0c012672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ze-Kun10aHierarchical Structures with Double Lower Disorder-to-Order Transition and Closed-Loop Phase Behaviors in Charged Block Copolymers Bearing Long Alkyl Side Groups  ap. 8714-8724.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this work, poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)-containing block copolymers (BCPs), poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(1-((2-acryloyloxy)ethyl)-3-docosylimidazolium) with different counterions (PEO-b-P(AOEDIm-X), X = Br or PF₆), were synthesized. Hierarchical structures, including the microphase-separated structure between the PEO and PIL blocks at the first level, the segregated substructure between the long alkyl side groups and the other parts of the PIL block at the second level, and the crystalline or liquid crystalline (LC) structure of the long alkyl side groups at the third level, are formed in these BCPs. The relative orientation of hierarchical structures and the interplay between hierarchical structures at different levels were investigated. In weakly segregated BCPs, the breakout crystallization of the long alkyl side groups can first disturb the second-level structure and then cause cascade disordering of the first-level structure, leading to double lower disorder-to-order transition (LDOT) phase behaviors at low temperatures. In addition, when the order-to-disorder transition (ODT) occurs for the first-level structure at high temperatures, it will force the second-level structure to switch into the disordered state, resulting in synchronous ODTs of hierarchical structures. The results of this work provide new insight into the design of hierarchical structures with special phase behaviors in BCPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acrystallization 3aionic liquids 3aliquids1 aGuo, Xiao-Shuai1 aZhang, Tian-Yu1 aWang, Rui-Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9561-32371 aDu, Bin-Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5693-03251 aXu, Jun-Ting1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7788-90260 tMacromolecules.g2020 Sept. 25, v. 53, no. 19 p.8714-8724dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c012673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245013600177300001600313520124300329592002801572650002501600650001501625650001101640650001301651650001001664650001501674650001501689650001501704650002301719650002301742650001501765650001801780650002201798650001201820650001101832650002101843651002401864651001201888700002301900700001601923700002101939773012601960856008302086852000902169655001202178IND60649731520221117235600.0190705e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064973152DNAL7 a10.1674/0003-0031-181.1.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGervin, Cæcilie Aamand10aPresence of Both Active and Inactive Colonies of Prairie Dogs Contributes to Higher Vegetation Heterogeneity at the Landscape Scale  ap. 104-116.  aBlack-tailed prairie dogs are herbivorous rodents known to have large effects on grassland landscapes in North America. They have considerable impacts on prairie plant communities as the result of repeated clipping of vegetation that can reduce preferred forage species and may indirectly result in increased abundance of disturbance-tolerant species. We investigated plant communities within three different habitat types: Active- and inactive prairie dog colonies, and adjacent suitable, but unoccupied, control areas in the Northern Great Plains of Montana, U.S.A. Plant species richness did not vary markedly between the three habitat types. However, plant composition measured as cover of plant life forms (forbs, shrubs, and graminoids), which was further divided into native status (native or introduced), and plant species indicators (plant species associated with a specific habitat) did vary distinctly between the three habitat types. Differences in plant composition between the habitat types suggests black-tailed prairie dog activities result in greater diversity of plant microhabitats at a landscape scale, and prairie dogs are an important component of the overall ecosystem in the Northern Great Plains of North America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynomys ludovicianus 3aecosystems 3aforage 3aforaging 3aforbs 3agraminoids 3agrasslands 3aherbivores 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3alandscapes 3amicrohabitats 3aplant communities 3arodents 3ashrubs 3aspecies richness 3aGreat Plains region 3aMontana1 aBruun, Hans Henrik1 aSeipel, Tim1 aBurgess, Neil D.0 tAmerican midland naturalist.g2019 Jan., v. 181, no. 1 p.104-116dUniversity of Notre DamewJournal:6277x0003-00317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031-181.1.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245008600171300001600257520148000273592002801753650001501781650001701796650002901813650002201842650002001864650002801884650002401912650001601936650002701952650002601979650002102005650000702026650001302033650000902046650001102055650002302066650001802089653000902107653001102116653002902127653002702156700003202183773011402215856008402329852000902413655001202422IND60535459620221116200018.0190403e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053545962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2015.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, José Luis10aQuality assessment of irrigation water under a combination of rain and irrigation  ap. 299-306.  aSupplementary irrigation is one of the proposed management practices to increase the area under grain production mainly in the Humid Pampas (HP). The most common source of irrigation water in the HP comes from groundwater and is characterized by its high sodium bicarbonate content. However, the effect of the combination of irrigation and rain water on the chemical and physical properties of soils, especially when irrigation water comprises water with sodium bicarbonate, is still not well documented. The objective of the present study is to establish irrigation water suitability criteria under conditions of combined rain and irrigation. The trials were carried out on six irrigated plots and another five plots were chosen for validation purposes. Hydraulic conductivity and bulk density were measured in the field. Soil chemical analysis was performed on undisturbed soil samples. Supplementary irrigation using sodium bicarbonated water raises the soil electrical conductivity (ECe), the pH, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), soil sodium adsorption ratio (SARe) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) which produces an increase in bulk density (δb), reducing the overall porosity of the soil. The effect of the soil SAR on the soil hydraulic conductivity (K) was evident when the soil SAR levels were greater than 3.5. The dilution factor proposed in this study allows the classification of water for supplementary irrigation linked to the management of irrigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abulk density 3acation exchange capacity 3achemical analysis 3acrop production 3aelectrical conductivity 3aexchangeable sodium 3agroundwater 3ahydraulic conductivity 3airrigation management 3airrigation water 3apH 3aporosity 3arain 3asodium 3asodium bicarbonate 3asoil sampling 0aSoil 0aSodium 0aSupplementary irrigation 0aHydraulic conductivity1 aAparicio, Virginia Carolina0 tAgricultural water management.g2015 Sept., v. 159 p.299-306dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2015.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01821naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245004700158500001900205520089400224592002801118650003501146650001801181650002001199650002301219650001701242650001101259700001801270700001601288773012101304856007301425852000901498655001201507IND60738944320221123020514.0210524e20210423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073894432DNAL7 a10.3390/v130507352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Tianshu 10aHIV-1 Entry and Membrane Fusion Inhibitors  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) infection begins with the attachment of the virion to a host cell by its envelope glycoprotein (Env), which subsequently induces fusion of viral and cell membranes to allow viral entry. Upon binding to primary receptor CD4 and coreceptor (e.g., chemokine receptor CCR5 or CXCR4), Env undergoes large conformational changes and unleashes its fusogenic potential to drive the membrane fusion. The structural biology of HIV-1 Env and its complexes with the cellular receptors not only has advanced our knowledge of the molecular mechanism of how HIV-1 enters the host cells but also provided a structural basis for the rational design of fusion inhibitors as potential antiviral therapeutics. In this review, we summarize our latest understanding of the HIV-1 membrane fusion process and discuss related therapeutic strategies to block viral entry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aglycoproteins 3amembrane fusion 3astructural biology 3atherapeutics 3avirion1 aCai, Yongfei 1 aChen, Bing 0 tViruses.g2021 Apr. 23, v. 13, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130507353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011000168300001600278520175500294592002802049650001902077650002002096650002002116650001202136650001002148650003202158650002202190650001102212650001702223650002202240650001602262653002802278653002202306653002902328653002602357653003102383653002002414700002002434700002002454700002802474773010302502856008302605852000902688655001202697IND60584789020221121050456.0201125e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058478902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2017.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReidsma, Pytrik10aOn the development and use of farm models for policy impact assessment in the European Union – A review  ap. 111-125.  aFarm models are potentially relevant tools for policy impact assessment. Governments and international organizations use impact assessment (IA) as an ex-ante policy process and procedure to evaluate impacts of policy options as part of the introduction of new policies. IA is increasingly used. This paper reviews both the use of farm models in such policy IAs in the European Commission, and the development and use of farm models for policy IA by the scientific community over the past decade. A systematic review was performed, based on 202 studies from the period 2007–2015 and results were discussed in a science-policy workshop. Based on the literature review and the workshop, this paper describes progress in the development of farm models, challenges in their use in policy processes and a research and cooperation agenda. We conclude that main issues for a research agenda include: 1) better understanding of farmer decision-making and effects of the social milieu, with increased focus on the interactions between farmers and other actors, the link to the value chain, and farm structural change; 2) thorough and consistent model evaluation and model comparison, with increased attention for model sensitivity and uncertainty, and 3) the organization of a network of farm modellers. In addition, the agenda for science-policy cooperation emphasizes the need for: 4) synthesizing research evidence into systematic reviews as an institutional element in the existing science-policy-interfaces for agricultural systems, 5) improved and timely data collection, allowing to assess heterogeneity in farm objectives, management and indicators, and 6) stronger science-policy interaction, moving from a research-driven to a user-driven approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3adata collection 3adecision making 3afarmers 3afarms 3ainternational organizations 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3asupply chain 3asystematic review 3auncertainty 0aBio-economic farm model 0aAgent-based model 0aMathematical programming 0aIntegrated assessment 0aScience-policy interaction 0aPolicy analysis1 aJanssen, Sander1 aJansen, Jacques1 avan Ittersum, Martin K.0 tAgricultural systems.g2018 Jan., v. 159 p.111-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2017.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002200172245006500194300001600259520176600275592002802041650002302069650002402092650001902116650002502135650002602160650002102186650001602207650001602223650002102239650002202260650002402282650001202306650001202318650002602330650002202356650002502378650001602403650002102419650001202440650002702452650002202479650001902501650002002520650001502540650003502555650003402590650002202624650002202646650002302668650005402691700001702745773008302762856008902845852000902934655001202943IND4466418620221119165011.0141110e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446641862DNAL7 a214356762pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.02.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, M. Azizur10aAquatic arsenic: Phytoremediation using floating macrophytes  ap. 633-646.  aPhytoremediation, a plant based green technology, has received increasing attention after the discovery of hyperaccumulating plants which are able to accumulate, translocate, and concentrate high amount of certain toxic elements in their above-ground/harvestable parts. Phytoremediation includes several processes namely, phytoextraction, phytodegradation, rhizofiltration, phytostabilization and phytovolatilization. Both terrestrial and aquatic plants have been tested to remediate contaminated soils and waters, respectively. A number of aquatic plant species have been investigated for the remediation of toxic contaminants such as As, Zn, Cd, Cu, Pb, Cr, Hg, etc. Arsenic, one of the deadly toxic elements, is widely distributed in the aquatic systems as a result of mineral dissolution from volcanic or sedimentary rocks as well as from the dilution of geothermal waters. In addition, the agricultural and industrial effluent discharges are also considered for arsenic contamination in natural waters. Some aquatic plants have been reported to accumulate high level of arsenic from contaminated water. Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), duckweeds (Lemna gibba, Lemna minor, Spirodela polyrhiza), water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica), water ferns (Azolla caroliniana, Azolla filiculoides, and Azolla pinnata), water cabbage (Pistia stratiotes), hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata) and watercress (Lepidium sativum) have been studied to investigate their arsenic uptake ability and mechanisms, and to evaluate their potential in phytoremediation technology. It has been suggested that the aquatic macrophytes would be potential for arsenic phytoremediation, and this paper reviews up to date knowledge on arsenic phytoremediation by common aquatic macrophytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzolla caroliniana 3aAzolla filiculoides 3aAzolla pinnata 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aHydrilla verticillata 3aIpomoea aquatica 3aLemna gibba 3aLemna minor 3aLepidium sativum 3aPistia stratiotes 3aSpirodela polyrhiza 3aarsenic 3acabbage 3aferns and fern allies 3ahyperaccumulators 3aindustrial effluents 3amacrophytes 3aphytoremediation 3aspinach 3asustainable technology 3auptake mechanisms 3avolcanic rocks 3awater pollution 3awatercress 2aArsenicxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiotransformation 2aPlant Development 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxmetabolism.1 aHasegawa, H.0 tChemosphere.g2011 Apr., v. 83, no. 5 p.633-646dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.02.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011500163300001600278520211500294592002802409650001902437650001202456650001102468650001102479650001002490650002502500650001402525650002102539650002202560650001502582650002302597650003302620650002302653650001402676650001502690650001902705650002502724650002202749651001802771700002002789700002002809773011502829856004002944852000902984655001202993IND50085920920221118231920.0140412e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008592092DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.122602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoulding, Tricia C.10aPhylogeography of a marine acanthocephalan: lack of cryptic diversity in a cosmopolitan parasite of mole crabs  ap. 965-976.  aAIM: Little is known about phylogeography and cryptic diversity of parasites in the marine environment. The acanthocephalan Profilicollis altmani parasitizes intermediate hosts that are broadly distributed around the Americas and final hosts that are highly motile. We investigated the spatial genetic structure of this acanthocephalan found in three species of Emerita crabs: (1) to test whether land masses serve as biogeographic barriers promoting ocean basin divergence among parasite lineages or species; and (2) to test whether the distribution of parasite species matches the distribution of different crab host species. LOCATION: The Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the USA, and the Pacific coast of Panama and Chile. METHODS: Sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS) were obtained from 204 acanthocephalans. Parasites were sampled from crabs in 15 sampling localities. These sequences were analysed with coalescent‐based methods and other population genetic analyses to infer phylogeographic patterns. RESULTS: Haplotype diversity for COI sequences was high (0.96) among parasites sampled, but nucleotide diversity was low (0.071) and there was no distinct geographic pattern between regions. Pairwise genetic distances were generally low, although there was a degree of population structure between oceans. Sequence comparisons showing an excess of low divergence alleles and a bimodal mismatch distribution provide evidence of either past selective events or demographic expansions. No variation was observed in the ITS sequences. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The lack of geographic patterning in haplotype diversity of this parasite indicates that gene flow is probably occurring between ocean basins. In addition, the low genetic diversity suggests that the acanthocephalan parasitizing E. analoga in Chile is conspecific to the species found parasitizing several Emerita species along the coasts of North America, and is thus a cosmopolitan parasite that is most likely dispersed long distances by marine birds that serve as definitive hosts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthocephala 3aalleles 3abasins 3acoasts 3acrabs 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agene flow 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aintermediate hosts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amarine environment 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3aphylogeography 3apopulation structure 3asequence analysis 3aUnited States1 aSarah Cohen, C.1 aBellwood, David0 tJournal of biogeography.g2014 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.965-976dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.12260  aDNAL 7aarticle02137naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245010900165300001600274520096200290592002801252650002201280650001401302650001401316650001601330650001301346650001301359650001801372650002401390650002401414650001601438650001701454700003001471700001801501700001701519773013101536856007501667852000901742655001201751IND60536823120180405000000.0160807e20120111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053682312DNAL7 a10.1021/ie20170642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeveneur, Sébastien,10aModeling of a Liquid–Liquid–Solid Heterogeneous Reaction System: Model System and Peroxyvaleric Acid  ap. 189-201.  aA mathematical model was developed to interpret a liquid–liquid–solid heterogeneous reaction system using valeric acid (pentanoic acid) perhydrolysis as model. Kinetic, thermodynamic, and mass transfer parameters were included in this model. Perhydrolysis of valeric acid (pentanoic acid) on Amberlite IR-120 catalyst experiments were carried out in the temperature range of 40–60 °C and with an initial valeric acid concentration of 50 wt %. The influence of water and the acid catalyst was taken into account to develop a suitable kinetic model. The thermodynamic parameters, such as the reaction enthalpy (ΔHR⁰) and the molar equilibrium ratio (m) were determined experimentally. The kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression analysis and they were statistically well-identified. The standard reaction enthalpy was estimated to −13.84 kJ·mol–¹ and the activation energy of the reaction was estimated to 64.5 kJ·mol–¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acatalysts 3achemistry 3aengineering 3aenthalpy 3akinetics 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3aregression analysis 3atemperature 3avaleric acid1 ade Araujo Filho, Cesar A.1 aEstel, Lionel1 aSalmi, Tapio0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2012 Jan. 11, v. 51, no. 1 p.189-201dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie20170643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245012400189300001600313520126800329592002801597650001601625650001001641650003501651650002401686650001401710650001701724650001201741650002201753650004901775650002801824650005601852650003601908650000901944650002401953650002601977650002902003700002002032700002402052700001502076700001402091700001502105700002402120773010902144856005502253852000902308655001202317IND4480443620221117014730.0120614e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448044362DNAL7 a226943332pmid7 a10.1111/j.1740-0929.2011.00978.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSAITO, Hayato10aKisspeptin‐10 stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone and testosterone in pre‐ and post‐pubertal male goats  ap. 487-492.  aThe aims of the present study were to clarify the effect of kisspeptin‐10 (Kp10) on the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (T) in pre‐pubertal and post‐pubertal male ruminants. Four male goats (Shiba goats) were given an intravenous (i.v.) injection of Kp10 (5 µg/kg body weight (b.w.)), gonadotoropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH, 1 µg/kg b.w.), or 2 mL of saline as a control at the ages of 3 (pre‐pubertal) and 6 (post‐pubertal) months. A single i.v. injection of Kp10 significantly stimulated the release of LH and T in both groups. The area under the response curve (AUC) of LH for a 60‐min period after the i.v. injection of Kp10 was significantly greater in the pre‐pubertal goats (P < 0.05). The AUC of T for a 120 min period post‐injection did not differ between the two age groups. A single i.v. injection of GnRH also significantly stimulated the release of LH and T in both groups (P < 0.05). The secretory pattern of LH and T in response to GnRH resembled that in response to Kp10. These results show that the LH‐releasing response to Kp10 is greater in pre‐pubertal than post‐pubertal male goats. They also show that Kp10, as well as GnRH, is able to stimulate the release of T in male goats.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3agoats 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aluteinizing hormone 3asecretion 3atestosterone 2aAnimals 2aGoatsxphysiology 2aGonadotropin-Releasing Hormonexpharmacology 2aInjections, Intravenous 2aKisspeptinsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aLuteinizing Hormonexsecretion. 2aMale 2aPubertyxphysiology 2aStimulation, Chemical 2aTestosteronexsecretion.1 aSAWADA, Tatsuru1 aYAEGASHI, Tomoyoshi1 aGOTO, Yuki1 aJin, Jin,1 aSAWAI, Ken1 aHashizume, Tsutomu,0 tAnimal science journal =.g2012 June, v. 83, no. 6 p.487-492dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-0929.2011.00978.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245012800200506007600328520144500404592002801849506003701877650001301914650002501927650000901952650001801961650000901979650002101988650003402009650001602043650001602059650001102075650001202086650000902098650000902107650002202116650002402138650002002162650001902182650001002201650003002211650001502241650001502256650002202271700002002293700002102313700002502334700002402359700002002383700002702403700002302430700002002453700002002473773012202493856007402615852000902689655001202698IND60650751920221207131627.0190710e20190411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065075192DNAL7 a10.3390/nu110408242doi7 aPMC65210042pmcid7 a309790522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapier, Keren 10aComparison of Major Protein-Source Foods and Other Food Groups in Meat-Eaters and Non-Meat-Eaters in the EPIC-Oxford Cohort  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDifferences in health outcomes between meat-eaters and non-meat-eaters might relate to differences in dietary intakes between these diet groups. We assessed intakes of major protein-source foods and other food groups in six groups of meat-eaters and non-meat-eaters participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Oxford study. The data were from 30,239 participants who answered questions regarding their consumption of meat, fish, dairy or eggs and completed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in 2010. Participants were categorized as regular meat-eaters, low meat-eaters, poultry-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians and vegans. FFQ foods were categorized into 45 food groups and analysis of variance was used to test for differences between age-adjusted mean intakes of each food group by diet group. Regular meat-eaters, vegetarians and vegans, respectively, consumed about a third, quarter and a fifth of their total energy intake from high protein-source foods. Compared with regular meat-eaters, low and non-meat-eaters consumed higher amounts of high-protein meat alternatives (soy, legumes, pulses, nuts, seeds) and other plant-based foods (whole grains, vegetables, fruits) and lower amounts of refined grains, fried foods, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages. These findings provide insight into potential nutritional explanations for differences in health outcomes between diet groups.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalcohols 3aanalysis of variance 3aeggs 3aenergy intake 3afish 3afish consumption 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood groups 3afried foods 3afruits 3alegumes 3ameat 3anuts 3aplant-based foods 3aprospective studies 3aprotein sources 3arefined grains 3aseeds 3asugar sweetened beverages 3avegan diet 3avegetables 3awhole grain foods1 aTong, Tammy  YN1 aAppleby, Paul  N1 aBradbury, Kathryn  E1 aFensom, Georgina  K1 aKnuppel, Anika 1 aPerez-Cornago, Aurora 1 aSchmidt, Julie A.,1 aTravis, Ruth  C1 aKey, Timothy  J0 tNutrients.g2019 Apr. 11, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110408243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009300160500001900253520180900272592002802081650005202109650002202161650001402183650001802197650001102215650001302226650002702239650001502266650002502281650001302306651001802319700001802337700003502355700002202390773012002412856007302532852000902605655001202614IND60738944920221121144652.0210524e20210517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073894492DNAL7 a10.3390/v130509302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuinonez, Elena 10aStructural Analysis of the Novel Variants of SARS-CoV-2 and Forecasting in North America  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBackground: little is known about the forecasting of new variants of SARS-COV-2 in North America and the interaction of variants with vaccine-derived neutralizing antibodies. Methods: the affinity scores of the spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) of B.1.1.7, B. 1.351, B.1.617, and P.1 variants in interaction with the neutralizing antibody (CV30 isolated from a patient), and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor were predicted using the template-based computational modeling. From the Nextstrain global database, we identified prevalent mutations of S-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 from December 2019 to April 2021. Pre- and post-vaccination time series forecasting models were developed based on the prediction of neutralizing antibody affinity scores for S-RBD of the variants. Results: the proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant in North America is growing rapidly, but the rate will reduce due to high affinity (~90%) to the neutralizing antibody once herd immunity is reached. Currently, the rates of isolation of B. 1.351, B.1.617, and P.1 variants are slowly increasing in North America. Herd immunity is able to relatively control these variants due to their low affinity (~70%) to the neutralizing antibody. The S-RBD of B.1.617 has a 110% increased affinity score to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) in comparison to the wild-type structure, making it highly infectious. Conclusion: The newly emerged B.1.351, B.1.617, and P.1 variants escape from vaccine-induced neutralizing immunity and continue circulating in North America in post- herd immunity era. Our study strongly suggests that a third dose of vaccine is urgently needed to cover novel variants with affinity scores (equal or less than 70%) to eliminate developing viral mutations and reduce transmission rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantibody affinity 3adatabases 3aherd immunity 3ahumans 3apatients 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aprediction 3atime series analysis 3avaccines 3aNorth America1 aVahed, Majid 1 aHashemi Shahraki, Abdolrazagh 1 aMirsaeidi, Mehdi 0 tViruses.g2021 May 17, v. 13, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130509303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245014300167300001400310520154400324592002801868650002101896650002701917650001001944650002801954650001601982650001701998650001802015650002102033650002102054650001302075650001602088650002502104653001902129653001002148653002102158653002602179653001502205653004302220700001402263700001802277773011102295856008402406852000902490655001202499IND60535460120221119173605.0190403e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053546012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2015.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaneshnia, F.10aSurfactant effect on forage yield and water use efficiency for berseem clover and basil in intercropping and limited irrigation treatments  ap. 57-63.  aQuantifying crop response to irrigation is important for establishing effective irrigation management strategies. The present study was conducted to evaluate the response of berseem clover and basil to limited irrigation in an additive intercropping system using a surfactant. The experimental treatments were carried out in split–split plots based on a completely randomized block design with three replications. The limited irrigation treatments comprised of replenishment of I100 full irrigation, I75=25% limited and I50=50% limited weekly evaporation and plant water requirements which were assigned to the main plots. The planting systems of sole berseem clover and sole basil culture along with additive inter cropping of berseem clover+50% basil were assigned to the subplots. Water treatments of control (water alone) and water+surfactant were assigned to the sub-subplots. Results show that severely limited irrigation (I50) dramatically reduced the forage yield of berseem clover and basil by 19.5% compared with the control (I100). The severity of the adverse effects of limited irrigation stress decreased by the surfactant application in irrigation by water+surfactant (9.5% decrement compared to full irrigation). The highest irrigation water use efficiency (2.7kgm−3) was achieved in I50 treatment with an added surfactant. The highest total dry matter yield (berseem clover+basil dry matter) (9257.9kgha−1) was obtained from additive intercropping of berseem clover 100%+basil 50% while irrigated by water+surfactant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcimum basilicum 3aTrifolium alexandrinum 3abasil 3adry matter accumulation 3aevaporation 3aforage yield 3aintercropping 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3aplanting 3asurfactants 3awater use efficiency 0aBerseem clover 0aBasil 0aMedicinal forage 0aIrrigation treatments 0aSurfactant 0aIrrigation water use efficiency (IWUE)1 aAmini, A.1 aChaichi, M.R.0 tAgricultural water management.g2015 Oct., v. 160 p.57-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2015.06.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245022000167300002000387520121600407592002801623650001701651650001401668650002301682650001701705650001501722650001801737650001801755650001801773650001401791650001101805700002101816700002101837700001901858773012401877856007402001852000902075655001202084IND60669140220221118002654.0190920e20150820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066914022DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra12747e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahadorikhalili, Saeed10aPalladium catalyst supported on PEGylated imidazolium based phosphinite ionic liquid-modified magnetic silica core–shell nanoparticles: a worthy and highly water-dispersible catalyst for organic reactions in water  ap. 71297-71305.  aA highly water-dispersible palladium nanocatalyst was fabricated by the immobilization of Pd onto the surface of PEGylated imidazolium based phosphinite ionic liquid functionalized γ-Fe₂O₃@SiO₂ core–shell nanoparticles. This nanocatalyst (denoted as [Pd@PEGylated ImIL-OPPh₂-γ-Fe₂O₃@SiO₂]) was assessed as a promising Pd catalyst in different organic reactions including Mizoroki–Heck and Sonogashira coupling reactions of aryl halides and the reduction reaction of 4-nitrophenol (4NP) to 4-aminophenol (4AP). From the application point of view, this nanocatalyst showed high thermal versatility, stability, recoverability, and compatibility in aqueous media. The catalyst recovery test revealed that its performance and catalytic activity stayed indefectible during several sequential runs. The loading level of Pd in the [Pd@PEGylated ImIL-OPPh₂-γ-Fe₂O₃@SiO₂] catalyst was 0.087 mmol g⁻¹. Pivotal properties including high robustness, efficiency and turnover frequency (TOF), mild reaction conditions, utilization of water as a green solvent, simple product work-up, and facile catalyst recovery make this catalyst favourable from the environmental and economic points of view.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaminophenols 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aferric oxide 3aimidazoles 3aionic liquids 3ananoparticles 3ap-nitrophenol 3apalladium 3asilica1 aMa’mani, Leila1 aMahdavi, Hossein1 aShafiee, Abbas0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 20, v. 5, no. 87 p.71297-71305dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra12747e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245010200167500001900269520184100288592002802129650002302157650005202180650001902232650001702251650001602268650003602284650001902320650001002339650003802349650004402387650002102431650001302452650001302465650003102478650000902509650001702518650001402535700002002549700002202569700002002591700002102611700002302632700002202655773012002677856007302797852000902870655001202879IND60738945120221121114248.0210524e20210518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073894512DNAL7 a10.3390/v130509322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaberland, Annekathrin 10aAptamer BC 007’s Affinity to Specific and Less-Specific Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCOVID-19 is a pandemic respiratory disease that is caused by the highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are essential weapons that a patient with COVID-19 has to combat the disease. When now repurposing a drug, namely an aptamer that interacts with SARS-CoV-2 proteins for COVID-19 treatment (BC 007), which is, however, a neutralizer of pathogenic autoantibodies in its original indication, the possibility of also binding and neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies must be considered. Here, the highly specific virus-neutralizing antibodies have to be distinguished from the ones that also show cross-reactivity to tissues. The last-mentioned could be the origin of the widely reported SARS-CoV-2-induced autoimmunity, which should also become a target of therapy. We, therefore, used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technology to assess the binding of well-characterized publicly accessible anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (CV07-209 and CV07-270) with BC 007. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, isothermal calorimetric titration, and circular dichroism spectroscopy were additionally used to test the binding of BC 007 to DNA-binding sequence segments of these antibodies. BC 007 did not bind to the highly specific neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody but did bind to the less specific one. This, however, was a lot less compared to an autoantibody of its original indication (14.2%, range 11.0–21.5%). It was also interesting to see that the less-specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody also showed a high background signal in the ELISA (binding on NeutrAvidin-coated or activated but noncoated plastic plate). These initial experiments suggest that the risk of binding and neutralizing highly specific anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies by BC 007 should be low.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aautoantibodies 3aautoimmunity 3acalorimetry 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3across reaction 3adrugs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoligonucleotides 3apandemic 3apatients 3arespiratory tract diseases 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3atitration1 aKrylova, Oxana 1 aNikolenko, Heike 1 aGöttel, Peter 1 aDallmann, Andre 1 aMüller, Johannes,1 aWeisshoff, Hardy 0 tViruses.g2021 May 18, v. 13, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130509323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014100169300001600310520096500326592002801291650002201319650001501341650001701356650001701373650001601390650001301406650001501419650001501434650001401449650001701463650001901480650001901499650001901518650001501537650001101552650002101563653002601584653002901610653003101639653002201670700001701692700001801709700001801727700001701745700001901762700001601781700001901797773011401816856008501930852000902015655001202024IND60606951120221121220346.0180730e20160805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060695112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.03.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xuhong12aA bamboo-inspired hierarchical nanoarchitecture of Ag/CuO/TiO2 nanotube array for highly photocatalytic degradation of 2,4-dinitrophenol  ap. 244-252.  aThe optimized geometrical configuration of muitiple active materials into hierarchical nanoarchitecture is essential for the creation of photocatalytic degradation system that can mimic natural photosynthesis. A bamboo-like architecture, CuO nanosheets and Ag nanoparticles co-decorated TiO2 nanotube arrays (Ag/CuO/TiO2), was fabricated by using simple solution-immersion and electrodeposition process. Under simulated solar light irradiation, the 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) photocatalytic degradation rate over Ag/CuO/TiO2 was about 2.0, 1.5 and 1.2 times that over TiO2 nanotubes, CuO/TiO2 and Ag/TiO2, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of ternary Ag/CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst was ascribed to improved light absorption, reduced carrier recombination and more exposed active sites. Moreover, the excellent stability and reliability of the Ag/CuO/TiO2 photocatalyst demonstrated a promising application for organic pollutant removal from water.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dinitrophenol 3aabsorption 3aactive sites 3acupric oxide 3airradiation 3alighting 3ananosheets 3ananosilver 3ananotubes 3anitrophenols 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotosynthesis 3apollutants 3asilver 3atitanium dioxide 0aTernary photocatalyst 0aBamboo-like architecture 0aPhotocatalytic degradation 0a2,4-Dinitrophenol1 aWang, Longlu1 aLiu, Chengbin1 aDing, Yangbin1 aZhang, Shuqu1 aZeng, Yunxiong1 aLiu, Yutang1 aLuo, Shenglian0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2016 Aug. 05, v. 313 p.244-252dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.03.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245006500173300001600238520101700254592002801271650000801299650001601307650001401323650001801337650002101355650001001376650002501386650001901411650001901430650001301449700001801462700005901480700007201539700002001611700005501631773012001686856008201806852000901888655001201897IND60627097520221119143553.0190128e20181108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062709752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.8b013282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLueckerath, Thorsten10aDNA–Polymer Conjugates by Photoinduced RAFT Polymerization  ap. 212-221.  aConventional grafting-to approaches to DNA–polymer conjugates are often limited by low reaction yields due to the sterically hindered coupling of a presynthesized polymer to DNA. The grafting-from strategy, in contrast, allows one to directly graft polymers from an initiator that is covalently attached to DNA. Herein, we report blue-light-mediated reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (Photo-RAFT) polymerization from two different RAFT agent-terminated DNA sequences using Eosin Y as the photocatalyst in combination with ascorbic acid. Three monomer families (methacrylates, acrylates and acrylamides) were successfully polymerized from DNA employing Photo-RAFT polymerization. We demonstrate that the length of the grown polymer chain can be varied by altering the monomer to DNA-initiator ratio, while the self-assembly features of the DNA strands were maintained. In summary, we describe a convenient, light-mediated approach toward DNA–polymer conjugates via the grafting-from approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aacrylamides 3aacrylates 3aascorbic acid 3achemical bonding 3aeosin 3anucleotide sequences 3aphotocatalysts 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aStrauch, Tina1 aKoynov, Kaloian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4062-88341 aBarner-Kowollik, Christopher1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6745-05701 aNg, David Y.

Using conceptual advances from savanna ecology, particularly the demographic bottleneck model, we present a novel view on temperate forest dynamics that integrates consumer and resource control. We used a fully factorial experiment, with varying levels of ungulate herbivory and resource (light) availability, to investigate how these factors shape recruitment of five temperate tree species. We ran simulations to project how inter‐ and intraspecific differences in height increment under the different experimental scenarios influence long‐term recruitment of tree species. Strong herbivore‐driven demographic bottlenecks occurred in our temperate forest system, and bottlenecks were as strong under resource‐rich as under resource‐poor conditions. Increased browsing by herbivores in resource‐rich patches strongly counteracted the increased escape strength of saplings in these patches. This finding is a crucial extension of the demographic bottleneck model which assumes that increased resource availability allows plants to more easily escape consumer‐driven bottlenecks.

The COD removal rate was only 71.7% after direct treatment of wastewater effluent from the primary clarifier in the open PBRs, while in-depth purification could be achieved in the secondary clarifier with COD removal rates reached to 97.8% in the open PBRs. The NH3-N and P of the two effluents were almost completely removed after 5–7 days in the open PBRs. The biomass concentration, productivity and the oil content in the open PBRs with the secondary clarifier effluent were all higher than those in the primary clarifier group. The filamentous microalgae Tribonema sp. as a post-treatment step for the A/O process can achieve deep removal of the pollutants and accumulate higher biomass concentration and oil content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTribonema 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiomass 3achemical oxygen demand 3aeffluents 3alipid content 3amicroalgae 3aphotobioreactors 3apollution control 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aPetrochemical wastewater 0aFilamentous microalgae 0aOpen photobioreactors 0aA/O process 0aAdvanced treatment1 aChen, Jing1 aChen, Xiu1 aWang, Feng1 aXu, Ling1 aZhu, Feifei1 aGuo, Danzhao1 aLi, Zhenjiang0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Dec., v. 270 p.476-481dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.09.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002900168245006000197300001600257500001500273520151100288592002801799650000901827650002501836650001401861650002801875650001401903650002501917650001101942650002401953650002401977650002402001650002502025650002202050650002002072650001402092653001002106700002302116700002202139700002102161773011002182856008302292852000902375655001202384IND60082788420221121231555.0141101e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008278842DNAL7 a221978052pmid7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2011.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristin, Pascal-Antoine10aEffect of genetic convergence on phylogenetic inference  ap. 921-927.  a2019-12-06  aPhylogenetic reconstructions are a major component of many studies in evolutionary biology, but their accuracy can be reduced under certain conditions. Recent studies showed that the convergent evolution of some phenotypes resulted from recurrent amino acid substitutions in genes belonging to distant lineages. It has been suggested that these convergent substitutions could bias phylogenetic reconstruction toward grouping convergent phenotypes together, but such an effect has never been appropriately tested. We used computer simulations to determine the effect of convergent substitutions on the accuracy of phylogenetic inference. We show that, in some realistic conditions, even a relatively small proportion of convergent codons can strongly bias phylogenetic reconstruction, especially when amino acid sequences are used as characters. The strength of this bias does not depend on the reconstruction method but varies as a function of how much divergence had occurred among the lineages prior to any episodes of convergent substitutions. While the occurrence of this bias is difficult to predict, the risk of spurious groupings is strongly decreased by considering only 3rd codon positions, which are less subject to selection, as long as saturation problems are not present. Therefore, we recommend that, whenever possible, topologies obtained with amino acid sequences and 3rd codon positions be compared to identify potential phylogenetic biases and avoid evolutionarily misleading conclusions.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3aconvergent evolution 3aphenotype 3aamino acid substitution 3aphylogeny 3aamino acid sequences 3acodons 3acomputer simulation 2aBias (Epidemiology) 2aComputer Simulation 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Variation 2aModels, Genetic 2aPhylogeny 0agenes1 aBesnard, Guillaume1 aEdwards, Erika J.1 aSalamin, Nicolas0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2012 Mar., v. 62, no. 3 p.921-927dElsevier Inc.x1055-79037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2011.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006700142245009300209300002000302520094600322592002801268650001401296650001501310650001901325650002201344650001701366650001101383650001901394650001801413700005901431700007001490700002201560700006301582700006501645700006401710773014901774856007701923852000902000655001202009IND60756083420220219000000.0211110e20211102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075608342DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c101532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarmona-García, Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5359-724010aPhotochemistry of HOSO₂ and SO₃ and Implications for the Production of Sulfuric Acid  ap. 18794-18802.  aSulfur trioxide (SO₃) and the hydroxysulfonyl radical (HOSO₂) are two key intermediates in the production of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) on Earth’s atmosphere, one of the major components of acid rain. Here, the photochemical properties of these species are determined by means of high-level quantum chemical methodologies, and the potential impact of their light-induced reactivity is assessed within the context of the conventional acid rain generation mechanism. Results reveal that the photodissociation of HOSO₂ occurs primarily in the stratosphere through the ejection of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂). This may decrease the production rate of H₂SO₄ in atmospheric regions with low O₂ concentration. In contrast, the photostability of SO₃ under stratospheric conditions suggests that its removal efficiency, still poorly understood, is key to assess the H₂SO₄ formation in the upper atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid rain 3aphotolysis 3aphotostability 3aquantum mechanics 3astratosphere 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 3asulfuric acid1 aTrabelsi, Tarek1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6258-71911 aFrancés-Monerris, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8232-49891 aCuevas, Carlos A.1 aSaiz-Lopez, Alfonso1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0060-15811 aRoca-Sanjuán, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6495-27701 aFrancisco, Joseph S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5461-14860 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Nov. 02, v. 143, no. 44 p.18794-18802dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c101533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01983naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245008100177300001600258520086200274592002801136650002201164650001301186650001201199650001801211650001201229650000901241650001601250650002401266653001601290653001801306653001701324653002601341700002101367700001701388773009901405856008401504852000901588655001201597IND60601141620221118054844.0180706e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060114162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKazemimostaghim, Mehdi10aComparison of milling and solution approach for production of silk particles  ap. 156-161.  aSilk particles were produced by regenerating from silk solution, and using a milling method.

The volume median average particle sizes (d(0.5)) of regenerated particles were much higher than what was reported previously. In contrast, milling method could produce particles with adjustable particle sizes ranging from micron to submicron level. All the milled particles had advantage of at least 15°C higher thermal decomposition temperature than regenerated particles.

In this study, liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry was used to investigate the main chemicals in the antidiarrhoeal fraction previously isolated from Rheum palmatum L. In total 10 compounds were identified in the fraction as follows: gallic acid, galloyl glucose, di-O-galloyl-glucose, glucopyranosyl-galloyl-glucose, coumaroyl-O-galloyl-glucose, trimer of catechin, catechin gallate, catechin-glucopyranoside, carboxyl-chrysophanol-O-glucose and emodin-O-glucose. The predominant components identified in the fraction were rhubarb tannins, except for two anthraquinone glycosides of low contents. The polyphenolic analysis also showed the occurrence of abundant tannins. So, the antidiarrhoeal basis of rhubarb was primarily proposed as tannin-related compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRheum palmatum 3aantidiarrheal effect 3agallic acid 3aglucose 3aglycosides 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3arhubarb 3atannins1 aQin, Yi1 aKong, Wei-jun1 aWang, Zhe-wei1 aZeng, Ling-na1 aFang, Fang1 aJin, Cheng1 aZhao, Yan-ling1 aXiao, Xiao-he0 tFood chemistry.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 129, no. 4 p.1737-1743dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.06.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008300170520139000253592002801643650003001671650001201701650001901713650001901732650003401751650002001785650001601805650000901821650001001830650002001840650001001860651001901870700002001889700002601909773012201935856008102057852000902138655001202147IND60742706820221122220213.0210624e20210523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074270682DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100606402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Nicholas 10aDetection of Tick-Borne Pathogens in Red Deer (Cervus elaphus), United Kingdom  aDeer represent a major vertebrate host for all feeding stages of the hard tick Ixodes ricinus in the United Kingdom (UK), and could play a role in the persistence of tick-borne pathogens. However, there have been few studies reporting the presence of Babesia spp. and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in deer in the UK, and those that detected Babesia were unable to confirm the species. To address this, we have investigated blood samples from red deer (Cervus elaphus) for the presence of tick-borne pathogens. Total DNA was extracted from haemolysed blood that was removed from clotted blood sampled from culled, captive red deer. Babesia spp. were detected with a pan-piroplasm PCR that amplifies a fragment of the 18S rRNA gene. Species were identified based on identity with published sequences. Anaplasma phagocytophilum was detected with a probe-based PCR targeting the msp2 gene. In addition, residual serum samples from a subset of animals were tested for the presence of anti-flavivirus antibodies. Of 105 red deer samples tested from three locations in the United Kingdom, 5 were positive for piroplasm and 5 were positive for A. phagocytophilum. Co-infection with both pathogens was detected in two samples from one location. No evidence for antibodies against West Nile virus were detected. However, 12% of sera tested were positive for tick-borne encephalitis virus antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma phagocytophilum 3aBabesia 3aCervus elaphus 3aIxodes ricinus 3aTick-borne encephalitis virus 3aWest Nile virus 3ablood serum 3adeer 3agenes 3amixed infection 3aticks 3aUnited Kingdom1 aGolding, Megan 1 aPhipps, Laurence Paul0 tPathogens.g2021 May 23, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100606403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03553naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245010100203300002000304506007600324520176900400592002802169506003702197650002702234650002202261650002602283650001802309650001202327650002102339650002002360650003602380650003102416650003202447653001402479653002102493653002502514653002302539653001702562700002302579700001902602700001802621700002402639700002502663700002002688700002102708700001902729773017502748856007902923852000903002655001203011IND60173831520221207082804.0150603e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017383152DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13123311102doi7 aPMC37916962pmcid7 a240437682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCea, Luis A.13aDe novo expression of connexin hemichannels in denervated fast skeletal muscles leads to atrophy  ap. 16229-16234.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDenervation of skeletal muscles induces atrophy, preceded by changes in sarcolemma permeability of causes not yet completely understood. Here, we show that denervation-induced Evans blue dye uptake in vivo of fast, but not slow, myofibers was acutely inhibited by connexin (Cx) hemichannel/pannexin1 (Panx1) channel and purinergic ionotropic P2X ₇ receptor (P2X ₇R) blockers. Denervated myofibers showed up-regulation of Panx1 and de novo expression of Cx39, Cx43, and Cx45 hemichannels as well as P2X ₇Rs and transient receptor potential subfamily V, member 2, channels, all of which are permeable to small molecules. The sarcolemma of freshly isolated WT myofibers from denervated muscles also showed high hemichannel-mediated permeability that was slightly reduced by blockade of Panx1 channels or the lack of Panx1 expression, but was completely inhibited by Cx hemichannel or P2X ₇R blockers, as well as by degradation of extracellular ATP. However, inhibition of transient receptor potential subfamily V, member 2, channels had no significant effect on membrane permeability. Moreover, activation of the transcription factor NFκB and higher mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) were found in denervated WT but not Cx43/Cx45-deficient muscles. The atrophy observed after 7 d of denervation was drastically reduced in Cx43/Cx45-deficient but not Panx1-deficient muscles. Therefore, expression of Cx hemichannels and P2X ₇R promotes a feed-forward mechanism activated by extracellular ATP, most likely released through hemichannels, that activates the inflammasome. Consequently, Cx hemichannels are potential targets for new therapeutic agents to prevent or reduce muscle atrophy induced by denervation of diverse etiologies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine triphosphate 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amembrane permeability 3amessenger RNA 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3askeletal muscle 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atranscriptional activation 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aconnexons 0amembrane leakage 0apurinergic receptors 0aphosphorylated p65 0ainflammation1 aCisterna, Bruno A.1 aPuebla, Carlos1 aFrank, Marina1 aFigueroa, Xavier F.1 aCardozo, Christopher1 aWillecke, Klaus1 aLatorre, Ramón,1 aSáez, Juan C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 110, no. 40 p.16229-16234dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13123311103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011600169300001800285520131300303536020101616592002801817596001501845596001501860650002301875650001301898650001401911650002501925650001701950650001801967650001401985650003001999650001402029650001202043700001602055700001702071700001602088700001402104700001602118773011902134856008602253852000902339655001202348IND60788959820221122050749.0220818e20220813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078895982DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2022.20566202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Qiuxing10aClinical Significance of Nutrition and Inflammation in Esophageal Cancer Patients with Surgery: A Meta-Analysis  ap. 3128-3139.  aMany studies have reported that the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) and C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR) may be associated with prognosis of esophageal cancer (EC); however, the results are inconsistent. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of preoperative GNRI and CAR on the prognosis of EC. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to analyze the relationship between GNRI/CAR and prognosis. Publication bias was estimated using Begg’s funnel plot asymmetry test and Egger’s test. A total of 21 studies comprising 5,018 patients were included in the meta-analysis. A decreased GNRI was significantly associated with poorer overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.808, 95% CI: 1.489-2.196, P < 0.001) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) (HR = 1.769, 95% CI: 1.193-2.624, P = 0.005), and an increased CAR was significantly associated with lower OS (HR = 2.179, 95% CI: 1.587-2.992, P < 0.001), CSS (HR = 1.733, 95% CI: 1.333-2.253, P < 0.001), and recurrence-free survival (HR = 2.178, 95% CI: 1.328-3.573, P = 0.002). Thus, preoperative GNRI and CAR may be noninvasive and powerful tools for predicting survival outcomes in patients with EC.  aThis work was supported by the Scientific Research Project of “333 Project” in Jiangsu Province under Grant [BRA2019030] and Nantong Science and Technology Foundation under Grant [MS22019008].  aPublisher supplied data  aBRA2019030  aMS22019008 3aC-reactive protein 3aalbumins 3aasymmetry 3aesophageal neoplasms 3ainflammation 3ameta-analysis 3anutrition 3anutrition risk assessment 3aprognosis 3asurgery1 aShen, Aiguo1 aChen, Xudong1 aGuo, Liyuan1 aPeng, Hui1 aGao, Mingde0 tNutrition and cancer.g2022 Aug. 13, v. 74, no. 9 p.3128-3139dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2022.20566203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245005000165300001600215520183400231592002802065650001802093650001302111650001802124650001102142650002202153650001302175650001902188650001902207650001902226650001102245650001802256650001702274650001702291650001202308650001502320650003302335650001302368650002502381650001402406653002402420653002102444653002002465653002402485653001902509653002402528700001602552773009902568856008402667852000902751655001202760IND60601141720221118054852.0180706e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060114172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapece, M.10aSolventless polymer coating of microparticles  ap. 118-132.  aSolventless coating technologies have recently emerged to improve upon the processing inefficiencies and practical limitations of solvent-based polymer film coating. The purpose of this study was to introduce a dry-coating methodology by which microparticles can be coated with polymers without the use of solvents, plasticizers, or heat treatments and is applicable to particles including those<100μm, noted as major improvements upon solvent-based and current dry-polymer coating technologies. Using a vibratory mixing device, the dry-polymer-coating method developed here first forms an ordered mixture consisting of a particulate substrate, ascorbic acid, ranging in size from 50μm to 500μm coated with a micronized polymer, polyethylene (PE) wax. Surface energy measurements accurately predicted that PE wax particles would strongly adhere to ascorbic acid through van der Waals induced attractive forces indicating a simple approach for predicting substrate–polymer compatibility. Due to vibration, subsequent particle–particle collisions between constituents of the ordered mixture deform the polymer layer into a continuous film resulting in encapsulation of the ascorbic acid. Discrete and continuous polymer coating could be discriminated based on SEM imaging, dissolution testing, or dispersive particle size measurements. Furthermore, polymer coatings were able to prolong the dissolution time of ascorbic acid from seconds to hours depending on the coating thickness. This novel dry-polymer-coating technique, operating in dry state without solvents, plasticizers, or heat treatments while also avoiding particle breakage and agglomeration, can reasonably be extended to a wide variety of applications ranging from the control release of pharmaceutical microparticles to protective coatings for metal powders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3acoatings 3aencapsulation 3aenergy 3afilms (materials) 3afinishes 3aheat treatment 3aimage analysis 3amicroparticles 3amixing 3aparticle size 3aplasticizers 3apolyethylene 3apowders 3aprediction 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3avan der Waals forces 3avibration 0aDry polymer coating 0aOrdered mixtures 0aControl release 0aWater soluble drugs 0aMicroparticles 0aSolventless coating1 aDavé, R.N.0 tPowder technology.g2014 July, v. 261 p.118-132dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01973naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001900161245004500180300001800225500000900243520101900252592002801271650001301299650001701312650001901329650002101348650001801369650002201387700002001409773012301429852000901552856009801561655001201659IND9000734420221120162820.0191122e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900073442DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1989.0011183X002900060053x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPareddy, D.

However, potential use of this technique for genetic manipulations has been limited by genotype specificity. This study was conducted to screen 15 commercially used inbreds for tassel culture response and to determine conditions satisfactory for successful tassel culture of each genotype. Immature tassel meristems were cultured on different media. Different concentrations of sucrose (0.2– 0.3 M) were required for different genotypes. However, Murashige and Skoog medium with 0.1 μM kinetin and casein hydrolysate (30 mg L⁻¹) was suitable for most of the genotypes. Tassels of Oh43 derivatives were responsive to culture, while B73 and Mo17 were more recalcitrant. The cultured tassels of the inbreds A619, A632, H99, LH38, Pa91 and U94 produced mature, trinucleate pollen. Thus, the tassel culture technique can be used across a broad range of elite maize germplasm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3ainbred lines 3atissue culture 3aflower primordia 3aculture media 3agenetic variation1 aPetolino, J.

Part 2: Molecular Representations and Molecular Dynamics Simulations  ap. 4783-4794.  aAfter successful isolation of the most interfacially active subfraction of asphaltenes (IAAs) reported in the first part of this series of publications, comprehensive chemical analyses including ES-MS, elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry were used to determine how the molecular fingerprint features of IAAs are different from those of the remaining asphaltenes (RAs). Compared with the RAs, the IAA molecules were shown to have higher molecular weight and higher contents of heteroatoms (e.g., three times higher oxygen content). The analysis on the elemental content and FTIR spectroscopy suggested that IAAs contained higher contents of high-polarity sulfoxide groups than the RAs. The results of ES-MS, NMR, FTIR, and elemental analyses were used to construct average molecular representations of IAA and RA molecules. These structures were used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to study interfacial and aggregation behaviors of the proposed molecules. The MD simulation study showed little affinity of representative RA molecules to the oil/water interface, while the representative IAA molecules had much higher interfacial activity, reflecting the extraction method. The aggregation of IAA molecules in the bulk oil phase and their adsorption at oil/water interface were not directly related to the ring system, but rather to the associations between or including sulfoxide groups. During the simulation, the IAA molecules were found to be self-assembled in solvent, forming supramolecular structures and a porous network at the oil/water interface, as suggested in our previous work. The results obtained in this study provide a better understanding of the role of asphaltenes in stabilizing petroleum emulsions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3achemical analysis 3aemulsions 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3aoxygen 3apetroleum 3asolvents1 aTchoukov, Plamen1 aDettman, Heather1 aTeklebrhan, Robel

Although the results provide no insight into why the chromium complex of 1,2 - dioxocyclobutabenzene (1e) is much more reactive at the keto groups than 1e itself, they do reveal a weak but not negligible alternation of the carbon s-character in the C - C bonds of the 6-membered rings both in the free cyclobutabenzenes and in the complexes, thus providing evidence for slight bond fixation (Mills-Nixon effect).  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achromium 3amolybdenum 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astable isotopes 0aMills-Nixon Effect 0aCyclobutabenzene 0a13C NMR Spectra1 aGabor, B.1 aMynott, R.1 aWey, H.

Objective: We assessed the effect of protein intake during dietary energy restriction on indexes of sleep in overweight and obese adults in 2 randomized, controlled feeding studies. Design: For study 1, 14 participants [3 men and 11 women; mean ± SE age: 56 ± 3 y; body mass index (BMI; in kg/m²): 30.9 ± 0.6] consumed energy-restricted diets (a 750-kcal/d deficit) with either beef and pork (BP; n = 5) or soy and legume (SL; n = 9) as the main protein sources for 3 consecutive 4-wk periods with 10% (control), 20%, or 30% of total energy from protein (random order). At baseline and the end of each period, the global sleep score (GSS) was assessed with the use of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. For study 2, 44 participants (12 men and 32 women; age: 52 ± 1 y; BMI: 31.4 ± 0.5) consumed a 3-wk baseline energy-balance diet with 0.8 g protein · kg baseline body mass⁻¹ · d⁻¹. Then, study 2 subjects consumed either a normal-protein [NP (control); n = 23] or a high-protein (HP; n = 21) (0.8 compared with 1.5 g · kg⁻¹ · d⁻¹, respectively) energy-restricted diet (a 750-kcal/d deficit) for 16 wk. The PSQI was administered during baseline week 3 and intervention weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. GSSs ranged from 0 to 21 arbitrary units (au), with a higher value representing a worse GSS during the preceding month. Results: In study 1, we showed that a higher protein quantity improved GSSs independent of the protein source. The GSS was higher (P < 0.05) when 10% (6.0 ± 0.4 au) compared with 20% (5.0 ± 0.4 au) protein was consumed, with 30% protein (5.4 ± 0.6 au) intermediate. In study 2, at baseline, the GSS was not different between NP (5.2 ± 0.5 au) and HP (5.4 ± 0.5 au) groups. Over time, the GSS was unchanged for the NP group and improved for the HP group (P-group-by-time interaction < 0.05). After intervention (week 16), GSSs for NP and HP groups were 5.9 ± 0.5 and 4.0 ± 0.6 au, respectively (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The consumption of a greater proportion of energy from protein while dieting may improve sleep in overweight and obese adults.

Herein, we describe the application of high-resolution melting (HRM), a recent enhancement to traditional DNA melting analysis, for the characterization of polymerase chain reaction products and the identification of nine gene-based SNPs for distinguishing the main Greek sweet cherry cultivars. The expected heterozygosity value of nine SNPs averaged at 0.518. The combined power of discrimination for the SNP markers was 0.999969. The ability of HRM to accurately discern nucleotide changes in a DNA sequence makes it a cost- and time-effective alternative to traditional sequencing for the detection of gene-based SNPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPrunus avium 3acultivar identification 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3amelting 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aTsaballa, Aphrodite1 aXanthopoulou, Aliki1 aMadesis, Panagiotis1 aTsaftaris, Athanasios0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2013 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.763-768dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-012-0538-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009800174300001600272520203200288592002802320650002702348650001302375650002102388650001602409650001102425650002302436650001602459650001102475650000902486650001102495650001402506650000902520650001702529650000902546653001002555653000902565653001602574653000902590653001502599700001802614700002002632700002402652700002002676773013502696856008402831852000902915655001202924IND50076272220221119121514.0150325e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007627222DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2013.7494402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Rayo, Sandra10aEfficacy of Micronutrient Chelate Treatments in Commercial Crop of Strawberry on Sand Culture  ap. 826-836.  aStrawberry production is usually carried out in Spain on sand substrate under fertigation. Micronutrient chelates are frequently applied as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) chelates; EDTA is a recalcitrant chelating agent so the concern about the environmental fate of EDTA applied in agriculture has risen. In this work, the efficacy of iron, manganese, zinc, and copper in two alternative chelating agents has been evaluated: the biodegradable N -(1,2-dicarboxyethyl)-D,L-aspartic acid (IDHA) and a combination of the regioisomers ethylenediamine- N , N ´-bis(2-hydroxyphenylacetic) acid (o,o -EDDHA) and ethylenediamine- N -(2-hydroxyphenylacetic)- N ´-(4-hydroxyphenylacetic) acid (o,p -EDDHA) (called EDDHA mix). Doses were split according to the stability of the chelates in three or six weekly applications. Experiment started 2 January 2010. Leaf samples were taken 6, 12, and 17 weeks after the first application. Foliar analysis, in comparison with chlorophyll indices based on Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) measurement, was used to evaluate chelate efficacy. No differences between treatments were found for the SPAD index, but the SPAD increment was greater for the IDHA treatment during the whole assay. However, foliar analysis was the most adequate method for evaluating differences among the three chelates. The treatment based on EDDHA mix and the IDHA chelates showed greater Fe content in leaves in the first and last periods respectively. The EDDHA mix and EDTA were better alternatives for Zn nutrition than IDHA. Manganese content in leaf was sufficient and not affected by the treatment used. Copper content in leaf showed similar results for all treatments. The Fe/Mn molar ratio showed results similar to those obtained for Fe contents in leaf. The IDHA and EDDHA mix treatments produced similar quality parameters in fruits as EDTA. As conclusion, IDHA and EDDHA mix could be good alternatives for recalcitrant EDTA to apply micronutrient chelates in strawberry plants in fertigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3achelates 3achelating agents 3achlorophyll 3acopper 3aenvironmental fate 3afertigation 3afruits 3airon 3aleaves 3amanganese 3asand 3astrawberries 3azinc 0aEDDHA 0aEDTA 0afertigation 0aIDHA 0astrawberry1 aNadal, Paloma1 aPozo, María A.1 aDomínguez, Antonio1 aLucena, Juan J.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 44, no. 1-4 p.826-836dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2013.7494403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009700165300001600262520170500278592002801983650001202011650001202023650002002035650001902055650001502074650001102089650001402100650001302114650002002127650002002147700001902167700001702186700002202203700001802225773011002243856008102353852000902434655001202443IND60550223920221118163040.0160909e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055022392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-016-0232-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrieto, D. M.10aInfluence of epipsammic biofilm on the biogeochemistry of arsenic in freshwater environments  ap. 291-306.  aThe influence of epipsammic biofilm developed on riverbed sediment on the sorption, uptake, mobility and transformation of Asⱽ was studied. Native biofilm was incubated on sediment samples at microcosm level. Once the biofilm had developed, 500 µg L⁻¹ Asⱽ was spiked in two systems designated BAS and BASP, without P and with equimolar As:P concentration ratio, respectively, and compared with identical control (sterilized) systems (CAS and CASP). The evolution and speciation of arsenic (As) concentrations in the overlying water were followed during two additional weeks. The biofilm enhanced removal of Asⱽ from the water up to 91 % of its initial concentration, while only ~70 % removal was attained in CAS. Presence of equimolar P concentration enhanced the amount of As removal up to 97 % in BASP, but had no effect in CASP. In the systems with biofilm, As was mostly (~97 %) in Asⱽ form, whilst Asᴵᴵᴵ only accounted for ~1 % of total aqueous As. The organic species, monomethylarsonic acid (MMAⱽ) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAⱽ), represented 0.6 and 0.7 % of total As, respectively. In contrast, in the systems devoid of biofilm, Asᴵᴵᴵ accounted for up to 39 % of aqueous As, whereas methylated aqueous species were negligible. The distribution of As in the biofilm showed that ~71 % of the retained As was extracellular, most (>99.5 %) in the form of Asⱽ. Volatile As forms were only detected in the systems incorporating biofilm. It is concluded that biofilm covering sediments increases As retention, inhibits reduction of Asⱽ to Asᴵᴵᴵ and methylates inorganic As, thus playing a key role in the biogeochemistry of As in river environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abiofilm 3abiogeochemistry 3acacodylic acid 3afreshwater 3arivers 3asediments 3asorption 3astream channels 3awater pollution1 aRubinos, D.

Therefore, resistance monitoring using bioassays was established in Germany for oilseed rape pest insects. RESULTS: The spread and intensity of pyrethroid resistance of Meligethes aeneus increased from 2005 onwards, with no sensitive samples left in any region of Germany in 2011. Sensitivity also declined for the newly introduced actives bifenthrin, etofenprox (both class‐I pyrethroids) and tau‐fluvalinate; all three claimed to be less affected by resistance, although there was no clear cross‐resistance to lambda‐cyhalothrin (class‐II pyrethroid). In the German region with the longest tradition and high intensity of oilseed rape production, pyrethroid resistance of Psylliodes chrysocephala and Ceutorhynchus obstrictus, with resistance factors of up to 81 and 140 respectively, was detected. CONCLUSION: The intensive use of only one mode of action for many years is risky, because even pest insects with a low intrinsic resistance risk may develop resistance. Therefore, resistance strategies need to include several control options for pest insects needing regular treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3amechanism of action 3arisk 3ainsect pests 3alambda-cyhalothrin 3aPsylliodes chrysocephala 3aBrassicogethes aeneus 3aetofenprox 3apyrethrins 3abioassays 3aCeutorhynchus obstrictus 3abifenthrin 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3apollen 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxdrug effects. 2aBrassica rapaxparasitology 2aInsect Control 2aInsecticide Resistance 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aPyrethrinsxpharmacology 3aGermany 0aGermany 0aMeligethes aeneus1 aMüller, Andreas,0 tPest management science.g2013 Feb., v. 69, no. 2 p.209-216dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.3351  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245011300155300001600268520148500284592002801769650002201797650001401819650001101833650001001844650001401854650001901868650001101887650003501898650001301933650001501946651001401961651001501975700001701990700001502007700001402022700001502036700001402051700001602065773011902081856007102200852000902271655001202280IND60645197720221119074313.0190528s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064519772DNAL7 a10.1071/MF183472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnmack, P.

We use single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to examine phylogeographic patterns in the most widespread species of Cherax, namely, C. destructor, and test the distinctiveness of one undescribed species, two C. destructor subspecies, previously proposed evolutionarily significant units, and management units. Both the phylogenetic analyses and the analysis of fixed allelic differences between populations support the current species-level taxonomy of C. setosus, C. depressus, C. dispar and C. destructor, the distinctiveness of C. destructor albidus and C. d. destructor and the existence of one undescribed species. The two populations of C. d. albidus from the Glenelg and Wimmera rivers were significantly distinct, with eight diagnostic differences (<1% fixed differences, null expectation is four fixed differences), but this low level of divergence is interpreted as within the range that might be expected of management units, that is, among allopatric populations of a single species or subspecies. A southern clade of C. d. destructor comprising the Murray River and its tributaries upstream from its confluence with the Darling River is genetically distinct from a northern clade comprising populations from the Lake Eyre Basin, the northern half of the Murray–Darling Basin (Darling River catchment) and the Lower Murray River below the Darling confluence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCherax destructor 3aallopatry 3abasins 3alakes 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3arivers 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3ataxonomy 3awatersheds 3aAustralia 3aNew Guinea1 aYoung, M.

The aims of the studies were to (1) compare the distribution of three species of Halobates oceanic skaters, H. germanus, H. micans, and H. sericeus, with respect to their temperature limits; (2) identify the lower temperature limit of H. sericeus, the species that displays the widest distribution range (40°N–35°S) latitude; and (3) test the hypothesis that H. sericeus can change their temperature tolerance to adapt to seasonal changes in sea surface temperatures. The heat coma temperature (HCT) was measured during the two cruises and the values were compared between the two populations of H. sericeus. The species collected in September 2010 were H. germanus, H. micans, and H. sericeus. H. sericeus was dominant, occupying more than 90% of the collecting sites. H. germanus and H. micans were collected in the northern and western part of the cruise track (29–34°N, 141–151°E), and not in the southern and eastern part. The population density of these two species was 9000–150,000/km2 in the first cruise, which took place in summer. On the other hand, H. sericeus was collected throughout the cruise track during that cruise. The population density of H. sericeus was relatively high, at 4000–310,000/km2, in the southern and eastern part of the cruise track (19–29°N, 152°E–165°W). In February and March 2012, only H. sericeus was collected at a density of 17,000–80,000/km2 and only in the eastern and southern part, at 25°–28°N, 169°E–178°W. No Halobates oceanic skaters were found in the western or northern part (30°N and further north, 159°E and further west) during that cruise. The lower limit for the inhabitation of sea surface temperatures appeared to be 27.8 °C or slightly lower for H. germanus and H. micans, but was 22.1 °C or slightly lower for H. sericeus. H. sericeus specimens, mostly adults, that had been collected during the two cruises were used in heat coma experiments. Summer specimens showed significantly higher heat coma temperatures (HCTs) than the winter specimens. This difference in HCTs may be the result of relatively long term temperature acclimation in the summer or winter for the adults that inhabit the temperate and subtropical areas along the cruise tracks between Tokyo and Honolulu in the Pacific Ocean. This temperature plasticity of H. sericeus may be related to the wider latitude area inhabited by this species (main range: 40°N–25°S).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHalobates sericeus 3aacclimation 3aadults 3acoma 3aheat 3alatitude 3apopulation density 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3awinter 3aPacific Ocean1 aNakajo, Mitsuru1 aFuruki, Takahiro1 aUmamoto, Noritomo1 aMoku, Masatoshi1 aSekimoto, Takero1 aKatagiri, Chihiro0 tInsects.g2018 Oct. 05, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects90401333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245019500173300001600368520096500384592002801349650002401377650001301401650001501414650001001429650001601439650001001455650001201465650001001477650001201487650001601499651001201515653001501527653001301542700003201555773014201587856008601729852000901815655001201824IND60756083820221120100100.0211110e20210902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075608382DNAL7 a10.1080/01650521.2020.17834832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCouri, Márcia S.10aOn Alluaudinella Giglio-Tos (Diptera, Muscidae) with the revision of the type specimens deposited in the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin (Berlin, Germany) and the description of a new species  ap. 176-181.  aAlluaudinella Giglio-Tos (Diptera, Muscidae) is a small genus with only six known species restricted to the Afrotropical region.

The effects of salinity on growth and yield components of wheat at different stages of growth were determined in a 2-yr field plot study at Brawley, CA. Four salinity levels were imposed on a Holtville silty clay [clayey over loamy, montmorillonitic calcareous), hyperthermic Typic Torrifluvent] by irrigating with waters salinized with NaCl and CaCl₂(1:1 w/w). Electrical conductivities of the irrigation waters were 1.4, 10.0, 20.0, and 30.0 dS m⁻¹ in 1989, and 1.4, 8.0, 16.0, and 24.0 dS m⁻¹ in 1990. The three irrigation treatments were (i) salinity imposed throughout the growing season, (ii) saline irrigation initiated after terminal spsikelet differentiation (TSD), and (iii) saline irrigation discontinuated at TSD. Growth and yield components measured were straw yield, total above ground biomass, number of spikelets per spike, number of kernels per spike, individual kernel weight, number of tillers per plant, and number of tiller spikes. Continuous salinity throughout the growing season significantly reduced all growth and yield components. Salinity imposed prior to TSD reduced the number of spikelets per spike and the number of tillers per plant, whereas salinity imposed after TSD significantly reduced only kernel number and weight. In general, the effect of salinity appears to be most pronounced on the yield components that are growing or developing at the time the salt stress is imposed. Total grain yields were maintained when moderately saline irrigation waters were substituted for good quality water during part of the growing season.

Several parameters, such as Fe concentration, soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD) index, yield, and fruit size, have been previously described to evaluate their efficacy. However, the relationships among them and the method variability are little known. The aim of this study was to examine both relative standard deviations and coefficients of correlation when several nutritional status indexes are compared. Three Fe chelates plus additional treatment without any exogenous Fe source were applied on a commercial nectarine grove during two consecutive growing cycles. Data from 12 nutritional status indexes were compared (related to Fe concentrations in leaf and flower, SPAD index, Fe / manganese (Mn) ratio, yield, and size of fruit). Relative standard deviations (RSD) (as dimensionless parameter) were statistically compared. Additionally, Pearson's correlation coefficient was analyzed by comparing mean values from all pairs of nutritional status indexes. Statistical analyses, analysis of variance, and Pearson's correlation coefficient were performed. Because several methods are used for nutritional status assessment, statistical methodology is necessary to know their dispersion and the relationships between these methodologies. In this experiment, relative standard deviations of all nutritional status indexes were less than 30%, which is associated with acceptable experimental variability. In conclusion, SPAD index in fruit-bearing branches seems to be one of the most adequate nutritional evaluation method because low RSD and no variation throughout sampling time and growing cycle were found. However, Fe content in leaves at 77 DAFB (days after full bloom) was correlated with yield and quality fruit parameters having relevant significance as prognosis parameters. In addition, Fe contents in leaves show low relative standard deviations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3acalcareous soils 3achelates 3acorrelation 3adiagnostic techniques 3aflowering 3afruit quality 3airon 3aleaves 3amanganese 3anutritional adequacy 3anutritional status 3apeaches 3atrees 0airon chlorosis 0amethodologies 0anutritional status 0aSPAD index 0aRSD1 aYunta, Felipe1 aLópez-Rayo, Sandra1 aLucena, Juan J.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 44, no. 1-4 p.850-860dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2013.7494443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012700171300001600298520131700314536020401631592002801835596001801863596002501881650001501906650001701921650001101938650001201949650001601961650001001977650001701987650001702004650001902021650001502040650002002055650001202075651001302087653002502100653002102125653002202146653002002168700002502188700002502213700002402238773014202262856008602404852000902490655001202499IND60756083920221120105354.0211110e20210902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075608392DNAL7 a10.1080/01650521.2020.17869212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuker, Anderson10aUsing aerial fruit-baited traps with different naturally fermented baits to survey scarab beetles in the Amazon rainforest  ap. 238-243.  aScarab beetles present a great diversity of life history, in which countless species can act as pollinators, decomposers of organic matter and severe agricultural pests. Different methods have been used to capture adult specimens from different scarab beetle subfamilies in natural or anthropogenic landscapes. Here, we evaluated the preference of scarab beetles for different naturally fermented baits in the Amazon rainforest. We used typical aerial traps baited with banana, banana + sugarcane juice, pineapple, pineapple + sugarcane juice, sugarcane juice, or water, every 2 weeks from July to October 2016 in five sites of the Amazon rainforest. We collected 177 individuals belonging to four subfamilies (Cetoniinae, Dynastinae, Rutelinae, and Scarabaeinae), 14 genera, and 22 species of scarab beetles. Between the different tested baits, sugarcane juice alone showed to be sufficient and efficient to capture more individuals and species of scarab beetles in the Amazon rainforest. Therefore, we encourage its use in composing baits in aerial fruit-baited traps, since it is low-cost and easier to use than when combined with fruits. Finally, our study brought a list of scarab beetle species sampled using a method that is still little used in the survey of scarab beetle diversity in Amazon rainforest.  aThis work was supported by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico [140741/2015-1]; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior [88881.134292/2016-01].  aPublisher supplied data  a140741/2015-1  a88881.134292/2016-01 3aNeotropics 3aScarabaeidae 3aadults 3abananas 3aenvironment 3afauna 3afermentation 3alife history 3aorganic matter 3apineapples 3asugarcane juice 3asurveys 3aAmazonia 0aFruit chafer beetles 0ainsect diversity 0asampling protocol 0atropical fruits1 aA.

Groundwater and surface water samples numbering 168 and 14, respectively, were collected during the dry and wet seasons. Water in the study area was weakly alkaline, falling into a hard-fresh or hard-brackish category. The groundwater chemical types were mainly SO₄·Cl–Ca·Mg (59.5%) and HCO₃–Ca·Mg (28.6%), whereas the dominant chemistry type of surface water was SO₄·Cl–Na (78.6%). Groundwater showed relatively high concentrations of NO₃⁻, with average dry and wet season concentrations of 212 mg·L⁻¹ and 223 mg·L⁻¹, respectively, whereas surface water had a low NO₃⁻ content. The major processes affecting water chemistry were determined to be rock weathering, such as silicate weathering and evaporative dissolution, as well as cation exchange. NO₃⁻ in groundwater was found to mainly originate from anthropogenic inputs such as agricultural production and domestic sewage. The entropy-weight water quality index (EWQI) assessment showed that although the quality of surface water was generally good, more than half of the groundwater samples failed drinking water standards, with NO₃⁻ identified as being the most problematic parameter affecting the water quality evaluation. Risk assessment of high groundwater nitrate concentrations indicated that long-term domestic use of groundwater in the study area can put the health of residents at great risk. Totals of 81% and 75% of the groundwater samples exceeded the acceptable limit for non-carcinogenic risk (HI = 1) to infants during the dry and wet seasons, respectively, whereas 75% and 71.3% of samples exceeded the acceptable limit for children, respectively. Future management of water in the Weibei Plain should prioritize the control groundwater nitrate pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3acation exchange 3agroundwater 3ahuman health 3ahydrochemistry 3anitrates 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asewage 3asilicates 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awet season 3aChina 0aHydrochemical characteristics 0aNitrate 0aHuman health risk 0aWeibei plain1 aPeng, Yuming1 aLi, Changsuo1 aGao, Zongjun1 aChen, Shaojie0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 268 p.115947-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1159473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01313naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010600156300001800262520024500280592002800525650002700553650002300580650000900603650002000612650001800632650000700650650001700657650002400674650001100698700001800709700001900727773013300746856007500879852000900954655001200963IND60658800920221121235400.0190826e20101101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065880092DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc03310c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Juying10aRatiometric pH sensor based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles and Förster resonance energy transfer  ap. 8445-8447.  aIncorporation of a dual-FRET dye pair into mesoporous silica nanoparticles yields sensitive and sensing-range tunable nanosensors with good reversibility that can be used for ratiometric pH measurements under a single-wavelength excitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3adyes 3aenergy transfer 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aporous media 3asensors (equipment) 3asilica1 aWang, Lingzhi1 aZhang, Jinlong0 tChemical communications.g2010 Nov. 1, v. 46, no. 44 p.8445-8447dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc03310c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245018300162300001600345520152100361592002801882650002801910650001601938650002401954650001501978650001601993650001002009650001602019650003502035650001402070650000902084650000902093650001102102650002002113650001002133650001502143650001002158650002202168650001202190650001402202650002102216650001202237650002202249650001402271650001202285650002902297650001702326653002802343653001702371653003402388700001802422700001802440700001902458700002002477773012202497856008202619852000902701655001202710IND60531976420221119181908.0180904e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053197642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2015.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Bo-Mi10aGenomic organization and transcriptional modulation in response to endocrine disrupting chemicals of three vitellogenin genes in the self-fertilizing fish Kryptolebias marmoratus  ap. 187-195.  aVitellogenin (Vtg) is the precursor of egg yolk proteins, and its expression has been used as a reliable biomarker for estrogenic contamination in the aquatic environment. To examine the biomarker potential of the self-fertilizing killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus Vtgs (Km-Vtgs), full genomic DNAs of Km-Vtgs-Aa, Km-Vtgs-Ab, and Km-Vtgs-C were cloned, sequenced, and characterized. Three Vtg genes in K. marmoratus are tandemly placed in a 550kb section of the same chromosome. In silico analysis of promoter regions revealed that both the Km-Vtgs-Aa and Km-Vtgs-Ab genes had an estrogen response element (ERE), but the Km-Vtgs-C gene did not. However, all three Km-Vtgs genes had several ERE-half sites in their promoter regions. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the three deduced amino acid residues were highly conserved with conventional Vtgs protein, forming distinctive clades within teleost Vtgs. Liver tissue showed the highest expression of Km-Vtg transcripts in all tested tissues (brain/pituitary, eye, gonad, intestine, skin, and muscle) in response to endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC)-exposed conditions. Km-Vtg transcripts were significantly increased in response to 17β-estradiol (E2), tamoxifen (TMX), 4-n-nonylphenol (NP), bisphenol A (BPA), and octylphenol (OP) over 24hr exposure. The Km-Vtg-A gene was highly expressed compared to the control in response to NP and OP. EDC-induced modulatory patterns of Km-Vtg gene expression were different depending on tissue, gender, and isoforms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKryptolebias marmoratus 3aamino acids 3aaquatic environment 3abiomarkers 3abisphenol A 3abrain 3achromosomes 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aestradiol 3aeyes 3afish 3agender 3agene expression 3agenes 3aintestines 3aliver 3amolecular cloning 3amuscles 3aphylogeny 3apromoter regions 3aselfing 3asequence analysis 3atamoxifen 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3avitellogenin 0aKryptolebias marmoratus 0aVitellogenin 0aEndocrine disrupting chemical1 aLee, Min Chul1 aKang, Hye-Min1 aRhee, Jae-Sung1 aLee, Jae-seong,0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2016 Apr., v. 42 p.187-195dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2015.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002100160245009400181300001800275500000900293500001500302520141300317592002801730650002301758650001101781650002501792650002301817650001501840650002201855650001701877650002501894651001301919653002501932700002101957773012401978852000902102856009702111655001202208IND2039445920221120215542.0191122e199311  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203944592DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1993.00021962008500060029x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScharf, Peter C.10aAccounting for Spatial Yield Variability in Field Experiments Increases Statistical Power  ap. 1254-1256.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aParametric statistical techniques evaluate treatment significance in field experiments by comparing variability attributed to treatments to variability attributed to random error. In many experiments, a considerable amount of the variability attributed to random error is actually due to large-scale soil variability that cannot be accounted for by blocking. This variability can, in part, be accounted for by a technique called nearest neighbor analysis, thus reducing the amount of variability attributed to random error; variability attributed to treatments is then larger in comparison, and the statistical significance of treatment effects is increased. Our objective was to evaluate the utility of nearest neighbor analysis in the statistical analysis of a set of field experiments. Four experiments with fall N treatments on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). According to this analysis, treatment had no significant effect on yield in any of the four experiments. After nearest neighbor analysis was used to remove spatial yield variability from the random error term, ANOVA revealed statistically significant treatment effects in two of the four experiments. Accounting for spatial variability is a practical way to increase the power of ANOVA and accompanying means-separation techniques when analyzing data from replicated field plot experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication timing 3aautumn 3aanalysis of variance 3asoil heterogeneity 3acrop yield 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aVirginia 0astatistical analysis1 aAlley, Marcus M.0 tAgronomy journal.g1993 Nov., v. 85, no. 6 p.1254-1256dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1993.00021962008500060029x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02956naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013000165300001600295520130100311592002801612596007101640650001401711650002501725650001901750650001001769650001201779650001201791650002401803650001901827650001401846650002401860650001201884651001001896653001301906653001401919653001601933653001301949653001401962653000901976700001401985700002501999700001802024700001402042700001402056700001402070700001602084700001802100700001602118700001802134700001702152773011502169856008502284852000902369655001202378IND60595771020221118003258.0180607e20180704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059577102DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2017.13471112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerri, M.10aClaviceps arundinis identification and its role in the die-back syndrome of Phragmites australis populations in central Italy  ap. 818-824.  aCommon reed Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. is one of the most widely distributed angiosperms with important ecological functions. In recent decades, it has been affected by a severe decline known as reed die-back syndrome (RDBS), the causal factors of which are still under investigation. Among the biotic factors that influence the dynamic of the reed population, the role of microorganisms is still poorly understood. During surveys carried out on P. australis populations in Central Italy, Claviceps-like sclerotia were detected: is Claviceps infection related to P. australis sexual reproduction and seed production? Could Claviceps infection be involved in the RDBS? These are the questions that we address. We characterized the sclerotia at the morphological, molecular, and chemical level and we demonstrated that they belong to Claviceps arundinis Pažoutová & M. Kolařík. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. arundinis on P. australis in Italy. Furthermore, the association of C. arundinis with RDBS was evaluated considering a set of macromorphological traits generally related to RDBS, such as P. australis clumping habit, culm height and diameter. No correlation was seen between the occurrence of C. arundinis and the declining status of reed populations.  aPublisher supplied data  aRBFR13P7PRcItalian Ministry of University and Scientific Research 3aClaviceps 3aPhragmites australis 3abiotic factors 3aculms 3adecline 3adieback 3aecological function 3amicroorganisms 3asclerotia 3asexual reproduction 3asurveys 3aItaly 0aAlkaloid 0aClaviceps 0acommon reed 0adie-back 0asclerotia 0aseed1 aReale, L.1 aMoretti, Gian Carlo,1 aBuonaurio, R.1 aCoppi, A.1 aFerri, V.1 aFoggi, B.1 aGigante, D.1 aLastrucci, L.1 aQuaglia, M.1 aVenanzoni, R.1 aFerranti, F.0 tPlant biosystems.g2018 July 4, v. 152, no. 4 p.818-824dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000133x1724-55757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2017.13471113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013400173300001600307520099800323592002801321650002401349650002001373650001401393650001201407650001501419650001601434650001501450650001301465650001301478650001501491650001001506650001101516653001201527653002401539653002201563653003201585653002701617653001401644700002801658700002301686700002101709700002501730700002901755773013301784856005101917852000901968655001201977IND50076272620221119115307.0140410e20130309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007627262DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2012.7440322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Wajahatullah10aAscophyllum nodosum Extract and Its Organic Fractions Stimulate Rhizobium Root Nodulation and Growth of Medicago sativa (Alfalfa)  ap. 900-908.  aThe effects of the seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum extracts (ANE) on nitrogen (N)–fixing nodules and growth of alfalfa plants were studied under greenhouse conditions.

Milkweed–herbivore systems have been a model for studying plant secondary chemistry defense evolution, insect adaptations to that chemistry, and coevolution between toxic plants and their herbivores for over a century. Yet, we are only beginning to unravel the multitude of adaptations required for insect specialization on milkweed plants. We review the empirical evidence for specialist insect adaptations toward milkweed toxins, coevolution between insects and milkweed plants, and canonical paradigms for sequestration and highlight the areas for further research.

Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins have been implicated in these RNA–protein interactions. In this study, we performed the cloning and functional characterization of maize Defective kernel 35 (Dek35). The dek35-ref mutant is a lethal-seed mutant with developmental deficiency. Dek35 was cloned through Mutator tag isolation and further confirmed by four additional independent mutant alleles. Dek35 encodes an P-type PPR protein that targets the mitochondria. The dek35 mutation causes significant reduction in the accumulation of DEK35 proteins and reduced splicing efficiency of mitochondrial nad4 intron 1. Analysis of mitochondrial complex in dek35 immature seeds indicated severe deficiency in the complex I assembly and NADH dehydrogenase activity. Transcriptome analysis of dek35 endosperm revealed enhanced expression of genes involved in the alternative respiratory pathway and extensive differentially expressed genes related to mitochondrial function and activity. Collectively, these results indicate that Dek35 encodes an PPR protein that affects the cis-splicing of mitochondrial nad4 intron 1 and is required for mitochondrial function and seed development.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscriptomics 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3amessenger RNA 3aalleles 3acorn 3amutation 3agene expression 3aendosperm 3amitochondria 3amutants 3anuclear-encoded proteins 3aintrons 3aNADH dehydrogenase 3aseed development 0aseeds 0asplicing 0aPPR 0aNADH 0amaize1 aFeng, Fan1 aQi, Weiwei1 aXu, Liming1 aYao, Dongsheng1 aWang, Qun1 aSong, Rentao0 tMolecular plant.g2017 Mar. 06, v. 10, no. 3 p.427-441dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2016.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002700160245007100187300001800258500000900276520194600285592002802231650002102259650001902280650001702299650001102316650001102327650002002338650002002358650002402378650001402402650002602416651001202442700002102454700002002475700002302495773012402518852000902642856009602651655001202747IND2039443020221121010156.0191122e199311  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203944302DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1993.00021962008500060022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJalali-Farahani, H.

Pers. cv. Midiron] water status. The simplest empirical model, describing canopy temperature minus air temperature (Tc — Tₐ) of well-watered turf as a linear function of air vapor pressure deficit, was inadequate for estimating CWSI, since seasonal averages of CWSI for well-watered, moderately stressed, and stressed turf had corresponding coefficients of variation of 1170, 160, and 86, respectively. The CWSI values were also highly influenced by net radiation, as indicated by coefficients of determination for regressions of calculated CWSI on net radiation of 0.68, 0.76, and 0.33 for the three levels of irrigation treatments, respectively. The second empirical model included net radiation in the regression analysis of Tc — Tₐ. The inclusion of net radiation in the equation for the unstressed baseline increased the coefficient of determination from 0.76 to 0.90 as compared with Model 1. The coefficient of determination for the upper baseline (which included net radiation) was 0.872, indicating a strong dependency of CWSI on net radiation. The theoretical CWSI model yielded the most accurate estimates of turfgrass water stress, as indicated by coefficients of variation for seasonal averages of CWSI for well-watered, moderately stressed, and stressed turf of 76, 3, and 86, respectively. Midday estimates of CWSI were related to percent available extractable water, with coefficients of determination for a regression of midday CWSI on percent available extractable water of 0.988, 0.989, and 0.991 for the empirical, modified empirical, and theoretical models, respectively. The theoretical CWSI appears to be the most promising approach for a turfgrass crop water stress index for irrigation scheduling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3alawns and turf 3awater stress 3amodels 3acanopy 3aair temperature 3asolar radiation 3aregression analysis 3aequations 3airrigation scheduling 3aArizona1 aSlack, Donald C.1 aKopec, David M.1 aMatthias, Allan D.0 tAgronomy journal.g1993 Nov., v. 85, no. 6 p.1210-1217dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1993.00021962008500060022x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03512naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012900156300001800285520229300303592002802596650002302624650002102647650001502668650000802683650002202691650002502713650001202738650002802750650002302778650002602801700001702827700001702844700001502861700001302876700001502889773012702904856007403031852000903105655001203114IND60638826720221118220543.0190430e20171207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063882672DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ay02254a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuping10aSelf-assembled activated carbon nanoparticles for reliable time-discretized quantitative surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy  ap. 6622-6628.  aQuantitative analysis is an important aspect of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). However, due to changes in the enhancing performance of SERS substrates, it is difficult to obtain reliable analysis results. In this work, a reliable quantitative method is introduced to overcome this problem by an external standard method. To achieve the external standard method, a self-assembled film of activated carbon nanoparticles is first prepared at the air/liquid (KCl aqueous solution) interface. Next, the activated carbon film transferred onto the surface of a Teflon slice (extraction film) is dipped into a high concentration of analyte to achieve reliable saturated adsorption, and the extraction film under saturated adsorption is called the reference (external standard). The uniformity is very good in one extraction film and thus the extraction film is cut into halves (used to prepare the determinand and reference) to eliminate deviation of different batches. The saturated adsorption time of the extraction film is different for different concentrations of analyte and the concentration can be therefore quantified by saturated adsorption time. Because the enhancing performance of the SERS substrate is almost unchanged in a short time and all of the SERS measurements are conducted at a similar measurement condition (saturated adsorption), the SERS intensity of the determinand and reference is almost the same under saturated adsorption. The SERS intensity of the determinand normalized by the reference is therefore very stable and uniform (approximately equal to “1” under saturated adsorption). The preparation conditions of the determinand and the reference are the same except for the concentration of the analyte, thus the interference can be eliminated by an external standard method. Any perturbations caused by the performance change of colloid substrates can be therefore effectively overcome. Moreover, the saturated adsorption time of the extraction film for different concentrations of analyte has a large time margin. This method is very simple and the cost is very low. Based on this method, a concept of time-discretized quantitative SERS (TDQ-SERS) is introduced. Thus, a reliable, simple, and economic quantitative SERS technique can be achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aair 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon nanoparticles 3aliquids 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3apotassium chloride 3aquantitative analysis1 aLü, Zhiwei,1 aHasi, Wuliji1 aZhao, Hang1 aBao, Lin1 aYang, Fang0 tAnalytical methods.g2017 Dec. 7, v. 9, no. 47 p.6622-6628dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ay02254a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03400naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008000171300001200251520174500263592002802008650001702036650001202053650001402065650002002079650002502099650002102124650002002145650002402165650001702189650002302206650001802229650001102247650001302258650001902271650001002290650001202300650001202312650001302324650002502337650001002362651001402372651001402386653002202400653001802422653002002440653000802460653001402468700002002482700002302502700002002525700002102545700002202566773011902588856008202707852000902789655001202798IND60607942720221120202334.0180830e20160203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060794272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2015.11.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaradat, Nidal Amin10aHerbal remedies use by breast cancer patients in the West Bank of Palestine  ap. 1-8.  aRecent ethnopharmacological surveys showed that herbal remedies are the most preferred modality of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). In Palestine as in many other countries, herbal remedies are widely used in the treatment of many diseases.The aim of this study was to investigate the use of herbal remedies by women living with breast cancer in the West Bank of Palestine.This study was a questionnaire based cross-sectional descriptive study on the use of herbal remedies by breast cancer patients in the West Bank. A questionnaire was distributed to 115 patients at outpatient cancer clinics in face to face interviews.The study had a response rate of 89.6%. Of all respondents, 68% were herbal remedies users. Women with breast cancer used 46 plant species belonging to 32 families. Of these, Brassicaceae and Lamiaceae were the most prevalent. Ephedra alata was the most commonly used plant species in the treatment of breast cancer. Leaves and seeds were the most commonly used parts and decoction was the most commonly used method of preparation. Herbal remedies users were more likely to use herbal remedies instead of chemotherapy. The most commonly stated reason for using herbal remedies was the belief in boosting the patient's immune system to fight cancer.The use of herbal remedies is prevalent in breast cancer patients in Palestine. The use of herbal remedies was associated with educational level, time since diagnosis, type of surgery use, and use of endocrine therapy. It was apparent that the majority of users were satisfied with herbal remedies use. Clinical trials and pharmacological tests are required to be established for the presence of side effects, toxicity and efficacy for these herbal remedies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassicaceae 3aEphedra 3aLamiaceae 3aadverse effects 3aalternative medicine 3abreast neoplasms 3aclinical trials 3adescriptive studies 3adrug therapy 3aeducational status 3aimmune system 3aleaves 3apatients 3aquestionnaires 3aseeds 3asurgery 3asurveys 3atoxicity 3atraditional medicine 3awomen 3aPalestine 3aWest Bank 0aEthnopharmacology 0aBreast cancer 0aHerbal remedies 0aCAM 0aPalestine1 aShawahna, Ramzi1 aEid, Ahmad Mustafa1 aAl-Ramahi, Rowa1 aAsma, Maes Kasem1 aZaid, Abdel Naser0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2016 Feb. 03, v. 178 p.1-8dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2015.11.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01736naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245004400158300001600202520077100218592002800989650001201017650001701029650001901046650001301065650001401078650002101092650001001113650001101123650001601134651001201150651001401162700002201176773009601198856007101294852000901365655001201374IND60518501920221120121142.0160417e196901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051850192DNAL7 a10.2307/19346752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWare, Stewart A.10aSeed Germination in Cedar Glade Talinum  ap. 137-140.  aTalinum calcaricum Ware is a succulent perennial herb endemic to the cedar glades of middle Tennessee and northern Alabama.

At constant temperatures some germination occurs at 25°C, but not at 20° or 30°C. Laboratory dry storage does not eliminate requirements for cold storage and light, but does increase germination reached after cold treatment.

PA plays a role in chronic liver disease, diabetes and Crohn’s disease, all of which are associated with impaired intestinal permeability. We investigated the effect of PA, at physiological postprandial intestinal concentrations, on gut epithelium as compared to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ethanol, using an in vitro gut model, the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 grown on transwell inserts. Cytotoxicity and oxidative stress were evaluated; epithelial barrier integrity was investigated by measuring the paracellular flux of fluorescein, and through RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence of tight junction (TJ) and adherens junction (AJ) mRNAs and proteins, respectively. In PA-exposed Caco-2 monolayers, cytotoxicity and oxidative stress were not detected. A significant increase in fluorescein flux was observed in PA-treated monolayers, after 90 min and up to 360 min, whereas with LPS and ethanol, this was only observed at later time-points. Gene expression and immunofluorescence analysis showed TJ and AJ alterations only in PA-exposed monolayers. In conclusion, PA affected intestinal permeability without inducing cytotoxicity or oxidative stress. This effect seemed to be faster and stronger than those with LPS and ethanol. Thus, we hypothesized that PA, besides having an immunomodulatory effect, might play a role in inflammatory and functional intestinal disorders in which the intestinal permeability is altered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrohn disease 3acytotoxicity 3adiabetes 3aepithelial cells 3aethanol 3afluorescein 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agastrointestinal diseases 3agene expression 3ahuman cell lines 3aimmunomodulators 3aintestinal mucosa 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver diseases 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3apalmitic acid 3apermeability 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atight junctions1 aAltomare, Annamaria 1 aCocca, Silvia 1 aSolida, Eleonora 1 aRibolsi, Mentore 1 aCarotti, Simone 1 aRainer, Alberto 1 aFrancesconi, Maria 1 aMorini, Sergio 1 aCicala, Michele 1 aPier Luca Guarino, Michele 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 May 13, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90504173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001900161245010900180300001600289500000900305520100500314592002801319650002301347650001001370650001801380650001201398650001601410650003601426700002301462700002401485700002501509773012101534852000901655856009801664655001201762IND2047913920221119144037.0191122e199501  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204791392DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183X003500010051x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTimpa, Judy D.10aRapid, Inexpensive Method for Determining Glucose Concentrations in Cotton Bolls and Other Plant Tissues  ap. 274-278.  aepub  aOur objective was to develop a rapid, specific, and inexpensive method for measuringg lucose concentrations in bolls of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). A new procedure was developed, based on a reagent strip for measuring blood glucose in diabetic patients, and compared with three other glucose methods by assaying glucose standard solutions. The strip results were significantly correlated (r = 0.948) with known concentrations of glucose and comparable to other methods in both precision and accuracy. For aqueous extracts of locules (lint and seed) from 15 days-post-anthesis (DPA) cotton bolls, glucose levels were −10 mg g⁻¹ fresh weight. The reagent strip strongly correlated to glucose hexokinase, glucose oxidase, and anthrone methods with correlation coefficients (r) of 0.983, 0.994, and 0.974, respectively. Thus, the strip technique should be useful for routine glucose determinations in cotton bolls considering the time (−2 rain/sample), cost (−$0.70/sample), and portability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abolls 3aplant tissues 3aglucose 3ameasurement 3achemical constituents of plants1 aStriegel, Andre M.1 aAbellanosa, Alan L.1 aTriplett, Barbara A.0 tCrop science.g1995 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.274-278dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183X003500010051x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02728naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245008100202500002000283520148800303592002801791596002701819650001301846650001201859650000901871650001601880650001101896650001501907650000901922650003101931650002601962650001501988650001302003650001702016650001402033651001302047700002002060700002602080773011302106856007802219852000902297655001202306IND60743142720220418000000.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074314272DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2020002262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMosisa, Balisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5691-165010aIsolation and Physico‐chemical Characterization of Triticum Decocum Starch  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEthiopian oat (Triticum decocum) starch has been isolated and examined for its chemical composition and physicochemical properties. The proximate composition of the starch on a dry weight basis is found to be 0.23% ash, 0.26% protein, 1.54% fat, and 56.31% starch. The total amylose content is 28.4% with 20.11% apparent amylose and 29.19% lipid complexed amylose. SEM showed oval, spherical shaped granules. The particle size distributions of the starch showed monomodal normal particle size distribution with the average volumetric particle diameters being about 23.03 µm, and specific surface area 0.7186 m² g⁻¹. XRD showed a pattern that is typical of A‐type with a distinctive maximum peak at around 17° 2θ. At all relative humidities, its water sorption properties resemble that of maize starch. It has unique swelling power and solubility in water at different temperatures. Viscosity curves of 10% of starch paste showed a peak viscosity of 1926cP. Its cold paste viscosity and hot paste viscosity are 4236 and 1720 cP, respectively. The breakdown and set back viscosities of Ethiopian oat starch are 206 and 2647cP, respectively. The FTIR showed the characteristic features of prominent starch peaks. Physicochemical characteristics of the oat starch have shown that it has similar properties with maize starch which could make it fit for use in food and pharmaceutical industries, especially in the area where oat is produced as endogenous crop like in Ethiopia.  aPublisher supplied data  cAddis Ababa University 3aTriticum 3aamylose 3acold 3acorn starch 3alipids 3aoat starch 3aoats 3aparticle size distribution 3aproximate composition 3asolubility 3asorption 3asurface area 3aviscosity 3aEthiopia1 aBelete Anteneh,1 aGebre‐Mariam, Tsige0 tStärke =.g2021 July, v. 73, no. 7-8 p.e2000226-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2020002263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01744naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245008600180300001600266500001900282520062800301592002800929650001700957650001100974650001400985651001000999653001201009653001101021653001601032653001501048653001301063653001001076653001901086700001601105700002001121773012301141856008501264852000901349655001201358IND60722371420221120233905.0210101e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072237142DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2019.16128122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubera Sampath Kumar, S.10aStudy on Performance of Different Wound Dressings on Surgical Non Infected Wounds  ap. 161-174.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study conducted to understand the limitations of existing wound-dressing systems.

However, it has received little attention in plant evolution. Here we model the joint evolution of mating system and inbreeding depression with reproductive compensation. • We used a dynamic model of inbreeding depression, allowing for partial purging of recessive lethal mutations by selfing. • We showed that reproductive compensation tended to increase the mean number of lethals in a population, but favored self‐fertilization by effectively decreasing early inbreeding depression. When compensation depended on the selfing rate, stable mixed mating systems can occur, with low to intermediate selfing rates. • Experimental evidence of reproductive compensation is required to confirm its potential importance in the evolution of plant mating systems. We suggest experimental methods to detect reproductive compensation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adynamic models 3aevolution 3amammals 3aselfing1 aLande, Russell0 tnew phytologist.g2005 May, v. 166, no. 2 p.673-684dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01363.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012900167300001600296500001900312520081000331592002801141650001301169650002501182650002201207650002101229650001801250650000701268650001401275650001501289650001601304653001501320653002201335653001401357653001201371700001501383700001601398700001601414700002301430773015401453856008501607852000901692655001201701IND60730589220221121051634.0210311e20210409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073058922DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2019.16695872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammani, H.10aElectrochemical evaluation of intermediate reduction of p-nitrophenol to nitroso derivative at palladium-phosphate electrode  ap. 598-608.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA novel voltammetric sensor for the determination of p-nitrophenol has been developed using carbon paste electrode (CPE) modified by metallic palladium (Pd) supported onto natural phosphate (NP).

In this research, the significance of the inter-annual variability in the potential production performance (PPP) is demonstrated, using power conversion matrices of ten pre-commercial WEC devices and an existing 31-year wave hindcast case study from the central shelf of New South Wales, Australia. The variability in the PPP over the intra- and inter-annual time scales is found to be comparable, hence indicating that making predictions merely based on annual and monthly averages could be misleading and that inter-annual fluctuations should be considered in future analysis. The results also show that inter-annual variations in WEC production performance can be significantly higher than that of the wave energy resource (WER) owing to the efficiency of different WECs relative to the local sea state conditions. We also demonstrate that optimization of WEC performance for the local sea state cannot only potentially lead to improved power yields but also a decrease in the intra- and inter-annual variability in PPP.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aeconomic sustainability 3aelectric power 3aenergy conversion 3afarms 3apower generation 3aprediction 3awater power 3aNew South Wales 0aWave power conversion 0aWave power variability 0aPower production 0aWEC performance1 aCartwright, Nick1 aHemer, Mark1 aEtemad-Shahidi, Amir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8489-75261 aStrauss, Darrell0 tEnergy.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 169 p.1224-1241dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245011500164300001800279520091300297592002801210650001401238650002101252650002201273650002201295650001801317650001701335650002201352650001301374650000901387653001801396653002101414653001601435653002401451653002501475700002301500773014001523856007701663852000901740655001201749IND60521698120221120130736.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052169812DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1983-12232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaboun, Hamed A.12aA One Step Synthesis of New 4-Aminopyrimidine Derivatives: Preparation of Tetrazolo- and s-Triazolopyrimidines  ap. 1686-1689.  a2-Mercapto-4-amino-5-cyano-6-arylpyrimidines (1a, b), 2-hydroxy derivatives 1c, d and 2-methylmercapto derivatives 4 a, b were synthesised via the reaction of either a mixture of malononitrile and aromatic aldehyde or arylidene malononitrile with thiourea, urea and S-methylisothiourea, respectively. 1c, d could also be obtained by the action of hydrogen peroxide on 1a, b or by the action of hydrochloric acid on 4a, b.

However, in most relevant studies, the condition of returned end of life (EOL) items is taken as a constant, which causes deviation in the cost of remanufacturing. Some researchers assume it as a discrete series, which also isolates the uncertainty analysis of quality from other uncertainty factors in the remanufacturing systems. This study considers the uncertainties in acquisition quantity, quality, and market demand, then establishes the relationships among production indices and remanufacture-up-to ratio to derive the optimum production strategies. Using the Lagrange multiplier method, we proved the existence of these optimum solutions and deduced the close-form expressions for minimum cost and maximum profit. Validated by numerical examples, our results indicated that the assumption of a condition distribution type had little influence on the optimal strategies or the optimum remanufacture-up-to ratio increases, as the expected supply and demand gap becomes wider. The method employed by this model provides an innovative approach in uncertainty analysis and helps remanufacturers adopt preemptive policies for acquisition and production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3amultipliers 3asupply balance 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 3awastes 0aEOL 0aRemanufacture 0aUncertainty 0aFitting 0aLagrange multiplier1 aDeng, Qianwang1 aShen, Neng0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 206 p.987-1003dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.1673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01723naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011100167300001600278520073500294592002801029650001201057650001701069650001601086650002601102650001401128650001301142650001701155700002101172773012401193856008301317852000901400655001201409IND60624137720221122013254.0181201e199410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062413772DNAL7 a10.1177/01154265940090051912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlree, Kelley10aTorsade de Pointes and Elevated Magnesium and Calcium Requirements Associated With Intravenous Pentamidine  ap. 191-195.  aWe present a report of markedly elevated calcium and magnesium requirements in an AIDS patient receiving central venous nutrition.

The main component of cellulose is glucose, whereas hemicelluloses mainly consist of pentose sugars such as D-xylose and L-arabinose. The genomes of filamentous fungi such as A. nidulans encode a multiplicity of sugar transporters with broad affinities for hexose and pentose sugars. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has a long history of use in industrial fermentation processes, is not able to efficiently transport or metabolize pentose sugars (e.g. xylose). Subsequently, the aim of this study was to identify xylose-transporters from A. nidulans, as potential candidates for introduction into S. cerevisiae in order to improve xylose utilization. RESULTS: In this study, we identified the A. nidulans xtrD (x ylose tr ansporter) gene, which encodes a Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) transporter, and which was specifically induced at the transcriptional level by xylose in a XlnR-dependent manner, while being partially repressed by glucose in a CreA-dependent manner. We evaluated the ability of xtrD to functionally complement the S. cerevisiae EBY.VW4000 strain which is unable to grow on glucose, fructose, mannose or galactose as single carbon source. In S. cerevisiae, XtrD was targeted to the plasma membrane and its expression was able to restore growth on xylose, glucose, galactose, and mannose as single carbon sources, indicating that this transporter accepts multiple sugars as a substrate. XtrD has a high affinity for xylose, and may be a high affinity xylose transporter. We were able to select a S. cerevisiae mutant strain that had increased xylose transport when expressing the xtrD gene. CONCLUSIONS: This study characterized the regulation and substrate specificity of an A. nidulans transporter that represents a good candidate for further directed mutagenesis. Investigation into the area of sugar transport in fungi presents a crucial step for improving the S. cerevisiae xylose metabolism. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the introduction of adaptive mutations beyond the introduced xylose utilization genes is able to improve S. cerevisiae xylose metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afermentation 3aAspergillus nidulans 3asubstrate specificity 3abiopolymers 3agalactose 3aglucose 3amutagenesis 3atransporters 3axylose 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acellulose 3amannose 3acarbon 3aethanol production 3agenes 3apentoses 3aplasma membrane 3afructose 3afeedstocks 3afungi 0aAspergillus nidulellus1 aRies, Laure Nicolas Annick1 aBrown, Neil Andrew1 ados Reis, Thaila Fernanda1 aSavoldi, Marcela1 aGoldman, Maria Helena S1 aMenino, João Filipe1 aRodrigues, Fernando1 aGoldman, Gustavo Henrique0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2014 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.46-46dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1754-6834-7-463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001700180245008600197300001800283506007600301520120200377592002801579506003701607650001701644650001201661650002401673650001201697650001501709650001201724650002301736650001201759650001101771700002901782700001901811700003301830773010401863856007501967852000902042655001202051IND60534074920221207072917.0160802e20130418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053407492DNAL7 a10.1021/ef301628x2doi7 aPMC36639962pmcid7 a237121242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, Luc-Sy10aExperimental and Modeling Study of Premixed Laminar Flames of Ethanol and Methane  ap. 2226-2245.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo better understand the chemistry of the combustion of ethanol, the structure of five low pressure laminar premixed flames has been investigated: a pure methane flame (φ = 1), three pure ethanol flames (φ = 0.7, 1.0, and 1.3), and an ethanol/methane mixture flame (φ = 1). The flames have been stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as a dilutant, with a gas velocity at the burner of 64.3 cm/s at 333 K. The results consist of mole fraction profiles of 20 species measured as a function of the height above the burner by probe sampling followed by online gas chromatography analyses. A mechanism for the oxidation of ethanol was proposed. The reactions of ethanol and acetaldehyde were updated and include recent theoretical calculations while that of ethenol, dimethyl ether, acetone, and propanal were added in the mechanism. This mechanism was also tested against experimental results available in the literature for laminar burning velocities and laminar premixed flame where ethenol was detected. The main reaction pathways of consumption of ethanol are analyzed. The effect of the branching ratios of reaction C₂H₅OH + OH → Products + H₂O is also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetone 3aargon (noble gases) 3aburning 3acombustion 3aethanol 3agas chromatography 3amethane 3amodels1 aGlaude, Pierre-Alexandre1 aFournet, René1 aBattin-Leclerc, Frédérique0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2013 Apr. 18, v. 27, no. 4 p.2226-2245dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef301628x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002500168245006300193300001600256500000900272520228700281592002802568650001902596650001902615700001802634773012002652852000902772856009802781655001202879991616658660742620221120025919.0191122e197205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7290749352DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1972.0011183X001200030015x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeredith, William R.10aHeterosis and Gene Action in Cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L.  ap. 304-310.  aepub  aHeterosis (F₁ — MP), useful heterosis (F₁ — ‘Deltapine 16’), and gene action estimates were obtained at four locations from the six groups of populations involving ‘Deltapine 16’ (Gossypium hirsutum L.) crossed with six cultivars (‘Q1,’ ‘Del Cerro 183,’ ‘FTA 263-20,’ ‘Acala 3080,’ ‘Mo277-396,’ and ‘Stoneville 603’). Heterosis for lint yield was detected in each cross. F₁ yields ranged from 92 to 115% of that of Deltapine 16, while F₂ yields ranged from 86 to 107%. Increases in boll size were partially responsible for the increased productivity of the hybrids. Parental lines originating from outside the Delta in general produced hybrid-by-location mean squares greater than those from Delta-derived parents. These interactions were related to the higher relative performance of Deltapine 16 at the locations with higher yield. The potential benefits from utilizing heterosis were especially evident when all traits were considered simultaneous. Four of the six F₁'s produced yields equal to or greater than Deltapine 16 while also having longer, stronger, and finer fiber. Heterosis for each of the nine traits studied was determined primarily by dominance gene action. Of the 54 possible tests additive-by-additive epistasis was significant in only four instances, and even in those four cases the mean squares for epistasis were much smaller than were those for additive or dominance effects. Additive effects predominated for lint percentage, seed index, fiber strength, fiber elongation, and fiber fineness. However, dominance was greater for boll size. Both were involved for lint yield and fiber length. In every case there were some crosses that did not fit the general trend. The interaction of additive effects with locations was usually of greater magnitude than the dotninance-bylocation interaction. There were 28, 13, and 1 instances of significant additive, dominance, and additive by additive epistatic by location interactions, respectively. Interactions with locations were the greatest practical limitation for lint yield selection and they were less important for the other traits. The interactions with locations were particularly large for the cross involving Acala 3080. Breeding implications are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant genetics 3aplant breeding1 aBridge, R.

Instead, to facilitate discovery, in silico scanning of proteins for sequences that match the motif, or binding preferences, of the restricting MHC class I allele – the largest determinant of immunodominance – can be used to predict likely candidates. The high false positive rate with this analysis ideally requires binding confirmation, which is obtained routinely by an assay using cell lines such as RMA-S that have defective transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) machinery, and consequently, few surface class I molecules. The stabilization and resultant increased life-span of peptide–MHC complexes on the cell surface by the addition of true binders validates their identity. To determine whether a similar assay could be developed for dogs, we transfected a prevalent class I allele, DLA-88*50801, into RMA-S. In the BARC3 clone, the recombinant heavy chain was associated with murine β2-microglobulin, and importantly, could differentiate motif-matched and -mismatched peptides by surface MHC stabilization. This work demonstrates the potential to use RMA-S cells transfected with canine alleles as a tool for CTL epitope discovery in this species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aalleles 3adogs 3aepitopes 3amice 3apeptides 3aproteins 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assayxmethodsxveterinary. 2aCD8-Positive T-Lymphocytesxmetabolism 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Membrane 2aDogsxmetabolism 2aEpitopes 2aGene Expression Regulationxphysiology 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class Ixchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Subunits1 aHolmes, Jennifer C.1 aGojanovich, Gregory S.1 aHess, Paul R.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2012 Dec. 15, v. 150, no. 3-4 p.206-212dElsevier B.V.x0165-24277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01795naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245014000174300001800314520073300332592002801065650003201093650001301125650001601138650002201154650001101176650001001187650001401197700001801211700002301229700001901252773009201271856008501363852000901448655001201457IND60098344620221123035853.0141104e20111116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009834462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2011.10.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, Michael14aThe structure of active opsin as a basis for identification of GPCR agonists by dynamic homology modelling and virtual screening assays  ap. 3587-3592.  aMost of the currently available G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) crystal structures represent an inactive receptor state, which has been considered to be suitable only for the discovery of antagonists and inverse agonists in structure-based computational ligand screening. Using the β₂-adrenergic receptor (B2AR) as a model system, we show that a dynamic homology model based on an “active” opsin structure without further incorporation of experimental data performs better than the crystal structure of the inactive B2AR in finding agonists over antagonists/inverse agonists. Such “active-like state” dynamic homology models can therefore be used to selectively identify GPCR agonists in in silico ligand libraries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3acrystal structure 3amodels 3aopsin 3ascreening1 aWolf, Steffen1 aSchlitter, Jürgen1 aGerwert, Klaus0 tFEBS letters.g2011 Nov. 16, v. 585, no. 22 p.3587-3592dElsevier B.V.x0014-57937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2011.10.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013400154300001600288520129000304592002801594650001601622650001501638650001401653650001301667650001101680650001701691650001501708650000901723650001601732650000901748650001501757650001801772650000701790650001801797650001101815650001601826650001101842700001401853773012201867856007501989852000902064655001202073IND60535809020221122223151.0160805e20150106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053580902DNAL7 a10.1021/es504140k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Chong10aFe(III) Hydroxide Nucleation and Growth on Quartz in the Presence of Cu(II), Pb(II), and Cr(III): Metal Hydrolysis and Adsorption  ap. 292-300.  aFe(III) hydroxide nanoparticles are an essential carrier for aqueous heavy metals. Particularly, iron hydroxide precipitation on mineral surfaces can immobilize aqueous heavy metals. Here, we used grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) to quantify nucleation and growth of iron hydroxide on quartz in 0.1 mM Fe(NO₃)₃ solution in the presence of Na⁺, Cu²⁺, Pb²⁺, or Cr³⁺ at pH = 3.7 ± 0.1. In 30 min, the average radii of gyration (Rg) of particles on quartz grew from around 2 to 6 nm in the presence of Na⁺ and Cu²⁺. Interestingly, the particle sizes remained 3.3 ± 0.3 nm in the presence of Pb²⁺, and few particles formed in the presence of Cr³⁺. Quartz crystal microbalance dissipation (QCM-D) measurements showed that only Cr³⁺ adsorbed onto quartz, while Cu²⁺ and Pb²⁺ did not. Cr³⁺ adsorption changed the surface charge of quartz from negative to positive, thus inhibiting the precipitation of positively charged iron hydroxide on quartz. Masses and compositions of the precipitates were also quantified. This study provided new insights on interactions among quartz, iron hydroxide, and metal ions. Such information is helpful not only for environmental remediation but also for the doping design of iron oxide catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3achromium 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3ahydrolysis 3airon 3airon oxides 3alead 3ametal ions 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aparticle size 3aquartz 3aremediation 3asodium1 aHu, Yandi0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Jan. 06, v. 49, no. 1 p.292-300dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes504140k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010300177300001600280500001900296520131700315536021001632592002801842596000801870650002101878650001601899650001401915650002201929650001801951650001501969650001901984650001002003650001702013650002202030653002202052653002602074653003702100653001602137700005402153700003302207700003702240773012302277856008502400852000902485655001202494IND60722371720221120222137.0210101e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072237172DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2019.16128152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerra, Gabriel Nunes10aChemical and Physicochemical Characterization of Alkali Pretreated and in Natura Sisal Solid Waste  ap. 203-212.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSolid waste from sisal fiber is a great candidate for biorefinery feedstock and material for composite production. However, sisal solid waste needs to be pre-treated before being used for such application. One of pretreatment method is chemical pretreatment process using alkaline solution. Alkaline pretreatment can improve the digestibility and physicochemical properties of this lignocellulosic material. The aim of this study was to characterize the in natura and alkali pretreated sisal solid waste in order to evaluate their potential as biorefinery feedstock and material for composite production. The chemical characterization showed that the pretreatment resulted in an increase in cellulose content, which is in agreement with the results of infrared spectra. The DRX pattern and thermal characterization showed a crystallinity degree increase and thermal stability improving, respectively, indicating a partial removal of the amorphous fraction of the lignocellulosic material. The SEM analysis showed that the pretreatment increased the sisal solid waste superficial area, due to extractives removing. These results contributed to elucidate the potential uses of the lignocellulosic material from sisal and how the dilute alkaline pretreatment affected its composition and physicochemical properties.  aThis study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brasil (CAPES) – Finance Code 001;Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior;  aPublisher supplied data  a001 3aalkali treatment 3abiorefining 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3adigestibility 3afeedstocks 3alignocellulose 3asisal 3asolid wastes 3athermal stability 0aSisal solid waste 0aalkaline pretreatment 0aphysicochemical characterization 0abiorefinery1 aCabral Albuquerque, Elaine Christine De Magalhaes1 aCampos, Leila Maria Aguilera1 aPontes, Luiz Antônio Magalhães0 tJournal of natural fibers.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 18, no. 2 p.203-212dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl946540x1544-046X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15440478.2019.16128153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245013500166520125800301592002801559650002801587650002401615650001701639650001601656650001901672650001801691650001701709650001201726650002601738650001501764650001701779650002201796700002001818700002301838700002101861700002001882700002101902773012401923856007802047852000902125655001202134IND60702318420221119194831.0200717e20200513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070231842DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90504222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasella, Patrizia 10aSmart Method for Carotenoids Characterization in Haematococcus pluvialis Red Phase and Evaluation of Astaxanthin Thermal Stability  aHaematococcus pluvialis microalgae is a promising source of astaxanthin, an excellent antioxidant carotenoid. H. pluvialis, as well as other species, could find more extensive applications as healthy food for a variegated carotenoids composition in addition to astaxanthin. Official method has not currently been used for this purpose. The objective of this work was to propose a method to characterize carotenoids in H. pluvialis after the comparison between spectrophotometric and liquid chromatography analysis. In addition, in order to improve the use of astaxanthin in the food industry, thermal stability was investigated. In this context, the effect of temperature at 40–80 °C, over a 16 h storage period was tested on astaxanthin produced by H. pluvialis. A further test was carried out at room temperature (20 °C) for seven days. A decrease in the astaxanthin concentration was observed at all tested temperatures with a decrease >50% of all-trans isomer at 80 °C after 16 h and an increase of 9-cis and 13-cis isomers. In conclusion, the obtained results showed the importance of evaluating the degradation effect of temperature on astaxanthin used as a food additive for a future greater enhancement of this bioproduct in the food field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaematococcus pluvialis 3aambient temperature 3aantioxidants 3aastaxanthin 3afood additives 3afood industry 3ahealthy diet 3aisomers 3aliquid chromatography 3amicroalgae 3astorage time 3athermal stability1 aIovine, Angela 1 aMehariya, Sanjeet 1 aMarino, Tiziana 1 aMusmarra, Dino 1 aMolino, Antonio 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 May 13, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90504223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01901naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001800168245010600186300001600292500000900308520100900317592002801326650001901354650001901373700001601392773012001408852000901528856009801537655001201635991616658480742620221120025923.0191122e197205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7290749432DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1972.0011183X001200030023x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStuber, C.

The same isozymes were also evaluated in an unselected population following 20 generations of random mating of (NC7)✕ CI21) syn 2. for the three peroxidase systems the dominant alleles became fixed in both the unselected and selected populations. Two codominant alleles (F and S) were found in the acid phosphatase system with the heterozygote exhibiting two parental bands and an intermediate hybrid band. Frequency of the F allele increased from 0.50 to 0.76 in the first six cycles of selection; however, it now appears that the population is approaching a stable intermediate frequency (0.60). Although the changes in frequencies suggest an association of this acid phosphatase locus with yield, close linkage with another "yield" locus cannot be ruled out.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant genetics 3aplant breeding1 aMoll, R.

When diagnosed, most nodules are no longer progressive. In >95% of cases, deep endometriosis is associated with very severe pain (in >95%) and is probably a cofactor in infertility. Its prevalence is estimated to be 1% –2%. Deep endometriosis is suspected clinically and can be confirmed by ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging. Contrast enema is useful to evaluate the degree of sigmoid occlusion. Surgery requires expertise to identify smaller nodules in the bowel wall, and difficulty increases with the size of the nodules. Excision is feasible in over 90% of cases often requiring suture of the bowel muscularis or full-thickness defects. Segmental bowel resections are rarely needed except for sigmoid nodules. Deep endometriosis often involves the ureter causing hydronephrosis in some 5% of cases. The latter is associated with 18% ureteral lesions. Deep endometriosis surgery is associated with late complications such as late bowel and ureteral perforations, and recto-vaginal and uretero-vaginal fistulas. Although rare, these complications require expertise in follow-up and laparoscopic management. Pain relief after surgery is excellent and some 50% of women will conceive spontaneously, despite often severe adhesions after surgery. Recurrence of deep endometriosis is rare. In conclusion, defined as adenomyosis externa, deep endometriosis is a rarely a progressive and recurrent disease. The treatment of choice is surgical excision, while bowel resection should be avoided, except for the sigmoid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesia 3aexcision 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3apain 3aresection 3aultrasonography 3aureter 3awomen1 aUssia, Anastasia1 aAdamyan, Leila1 aWattiez, Arnaud1 aDonnez, J.,0 tFertility and sterility.g2012 Sept., v. 98, no. 3 p.564-571dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.07.10613Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245009700159520143600256592002801692650001601720650002601736650001101762650001301773650002101786650001501807650001201822650002301834650001101857650002501868650001001893651002201903651002801925651001201953700002701965700002001992700002202012700002002034773011802054856007202172852000902244655001202253IND60648846320221116164357.0190701e20180523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064884632DNAL7 a10.3390/f90602862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlenici, Nicolai10aWidespread Distribution of <em>Trypodendron laeve</em> in the Carpathian Mountains (Romania)  aTrypodendron laeve Eggers, 1939 is a species of ambrosia beetle much less known than the other three Trypodendron species occurring in Europe. Its status (native or alien) in Central Europe has been a subject of debate over the past two decades. In Romania, the species was discovered in 2008 and the aim of the research presented in this paper was to investigate its distribution in the Carpathians, mainly at high altitudes (>800 m), in tree stands with Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] H. Karst). Panel intercept traps baited with synthetic pheromone for Trypodendron lineatum (Olivier, 1795) were used in the spring of 2015, at 31 locations. Adults of T. laeve were caught in 20 of them. Additional observations were made within some studies using similar baits and T. laeve specimens were caught in eight locations. T. laeve was always trapped together with T. lineatum, and at some locations also together with T. domesticum (Linnaeus, 1758) and T. signatum (Fabricius, 1787). In all traps, fewer specimens of T. laeve were caught compared to T. lineatum. The species has a widespread distribution in the mountain regions, within forests composed of native tree species and generally located far away from commercial routes. There, it occurs together with other native species of the same taxonomic genus. It seems to be more abundant at high altitudes, but overall its populations are less abundant than those of T. lineatum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aTrypodendron lineatum 3aadults 3aaltitude 3aambrosia beetles 3abait traps 3aforests 3aindigenous species 3aspring 3asynthetic pheromones 3atrees 3aCarpathian region 3aCentral European region 3aRomania1 aDuduman, Mihai-Leonard1 aIsaia, Gabriela1 aKnížek, Miloš,1 aVasian, Iuliana0 tForests.g2018 May 23, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f90602863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245009000179300001400269520113100283592002801414650001101442650002501453650002101478650001201499650001901511650001301530650001901543650003001562650002801592650001501620650001501635653002501650653001601675653004201691700002201733700002001755700002101775700001801796773010501814856008801919852000902007655001202016IND60585416120221120080927.0190401e20180110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058541612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Tullio, Giacomo R.10aSustainable use of marine resources through offshore wind and mussel farm co-location  ap. 34-41.  aMarine Spatial Planning (MSP) can offer significant benefits in terms of economic conservation strategies, optimizing spatial planning and minimizing the impact on the environment. In this paper, we focused on the application of multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) technique for co-locating offshore wind farms and open-water mussel cultivation. An index of co-location sustainability (SI) was developed based on the application of MCE technique constructed with physical and biological parameters on the basis of remote-sensing data. The relevant physical factors considered were wind velocity, depth range, concerning the site location for energy production, and sea surface temperature anomaly. The biological variables used were Chlorofill-a (as a measurement of the productivity) and Particle Organic Carbon(POC) concentration, in order to assess their influence on the probable benefits and complete the requirements of this management framework. This SI can be easily implemented to do a first order selection of the most promising areas to be more specifically studied in a second order approach based on local field data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3amarine resources 3amussels 3aorganic carbon 3aplanning 3aremote sensing 3asurface water temperature 3asustainable development 3awind farms 3awind speed 0aSustainability Index 0aAquaculture 0aMussel farm and wind farm co-location1 aMariani, Patrizio1 aBenassai, Guido1 aDi Luccio, Diana1 aGrieco, Luisa0 tEcological modelling.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 367 p.34-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002800145245015300173506002800326520164500354592002801999506003702027650002502064650001902089650001302108650001102121650001902132650001402151650001102165650001002176650001102186650001702197650001902214650001702233653001302250653001902263653002802282653001602310653001702326700002102343700002302364700002502387700002302412700002102435700002302456700002502479773009202504856008002596852000902676655001202685IND60764492420221207104548.0211121e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076449242DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2101342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKRIVOKHATSKY, VICTOR A.10aAntlions (Neuroptera, Myrmeleontidae) along the North Caspian shore; distributional analysis and zoogeographical division of Caspian coast of Russia  aResource is Open Access  aKrivokhatsky VA, Kerimova IG, Anikin VV, Astakhov DM, Astakhova AS, Ilyina EV, Plotnikov IS, Samartseva JV. 2020. Antlions (Neuroptera, Myrmeleontidae) along the North Caspian shore; distributional analysis and zoogeographical division of Caspian coast of Russia. Biodiversitas 21: 258-281. Zoogeographically regionalization of Northern Caspian territory, adjacent Eastern Caucasian and Volga-Ural regions were carried out by using the original cladistic program (CLA) based on faunistic investigations of Neuroptera, Myrmeleontidae. A total of 47 of elementary districts of physical geography or geobotanical mapping and 41 species of antlions were used for analyses in the Matrix. 46 elementary faunas were combined in the region into seven concrete faunas. The ConCaspian and Volga-Ural antlion faunas were mixed. Aspoeckiana uralensis Hölzel, 1969 was considered as superspecies with a complex of five subspecies with overlapping areas of distribution, associated in its origin with the spread of Northern antelopes (Saiga tatarica (Linnaeus, 1766), Gazella subgutturosa Guldenstaedt, 1780, Procapra gutturosa Pallas, 1777). At the North Caspian Shore Aspoeckiana uralensis uralensis Hölzel, 1969, and Aspoeckiana uralensis jakushenkoi Zakharenko, 1983, cohabited with the saiga antelope, using their paths for larval colonies. The dynamics of Macronemurus bilineatus Brauer, 1868 area over the past 100 years was described in detail. For some paleoenvironmental conditions of their origin and colonization of the Caspian region are reconstructed. The leading role of Turan in the formation of the fauna of the antlions is determined.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGazella subgutturosa 3aMyrmeleontidae 3aProcapra 3aRussia 3aSaiga tatarica 3aantelopes 3acoasts 3afauna 3alarvae 3apaleoecology 3aphytogeography 3azoogeography 0aantlions 0aclasterisation 0anorthern caspian region 0asystematics 0azoogeography1 aKerimova, Ilhama1 aANIKIN, VASILYI V.1 aASTAKHOV, DMITRYI M.1 aASTAKHOVA, ANNA S.1 aILYINA, ELENA V.1 aPLOTNIKOV, IGOR S.1 aSAMARTSEVA, JULIA V.0 tBiodiversitas.g2019 Dec., v. 21, no. 1dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2101343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245010300177300001600280500001900296500002000315520129900335592002801634650003801662650002201700650001201722650000901734650001201743650002101755650001401776650002101790650001101811650001601822650001201838650001601850650001601866650001401882650001301896650002001909700002101929773011401950856008802064852000902152655001202161IND60734370420221119080716.0210417e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073437042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01344.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatiru, Viviene N.14aThe rhizosphere signal molecule lumichrome alters seedling development in both legumes and cereals  ap. 439-444.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• The stimulatory role of lumichrome, a rhizosphere metabolite, was assessed on the growth of legume and cereal seedlings. • At a very low nanomolar concentration (5 nm), lumichrome elicited growth promotion in cowpea, soybean, sorghum, millet and maize, but not in common bean, Bambara groundnut and Sudan grass. In soybean and cowpea only, 5 nm lumichrome caused early initiation of trifoliate leaf development, expansion in unifoliate and trifoliate leaves, increased stem elongation and, as a result, an increase in shoot and plant total biomass relative to control. Lumichrome (5 nm) also increased leaf area in maize and sorghum, and thus raised shoot and total biomass but there was no effect on the leaf area of the other cereals. Root growth was also stimulated in sorghum and millet by the supply of 5 nm lumichrome. • By contrast, the application of a higher dose of lumichrome (50 nm) depressed development of unifoliate leaves in soybean, the second trifoliate leaf in cowpea, and shoot biomass in soybean. The 50 nm concentration also consistently decreased root development in cowpea and millet, but had no effect on the other species. • These data show that lumichrome is a rhizosphere signal molecule that affects seedling development in both monocots and dicots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii 3aVigna subterranea 3abiomass 3acorn 3acowpeas 3agrowth promotion 3aleaf area 3aleaf development 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3amillets 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3aseedlings 3asoybeans 3astem elongation1 aDakora, Felix D.0 tnew phytologist.g2005 May, v. 166, no. 2 p.439-444dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01344.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010700166300001600273520156800289592002801857650004401885650003301929650001601962650002201978650001302000650002302013650001202036650001102048650001402059650002202073650001102095650001702106650001602123650001102139650001402150650001102164650002102175650001902196650001402215650001002229650001302239650001202252650002002264650001302284700002002297773008802317856008102405852000902486655001202495IND60121655720221120113114.0150317e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012165572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-014-1415-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Miaohao H.10aChanges in the spectral pattern of selenium accumulation in Coleus blumei and the effects of chelation  ap. 686-699.  aChemically enhanced phytoremediation has been proposed as an effective approach to remove heavy metals from contaminated soil through the use of high biomass production plants. This study investigated changes in the spectral pattern of selenium (Se) accumulation in Coleus blumei Benth. (coleus) plants grown in hydroponics with 1.0 mg/l sodium selenite (Na₂SeO₃) and the effects of (S,S)-ethylenediamine disuccinic acid (EDDS) thereon through X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyses. When EDDS concentrations were in the range of 0–1.0 mmol/l, Se content increased significantly; however, at EDDS concentrations above this range, the symptoms of Se toxicity were alleviated in coleus leaves. Application of EDDS over 1.0 mmol/l significantly decreased total Se uptake in the leaves and roots of the plants. The powder diffraction patterns of the roots and leaves displayed sharp crystalline peaks, which were characteristic of an organic molecule with crystallinity. Our results revealed the presence of high amounts of C, O, Mg, Al, Si, K and Ca in the roots and leaves under Se-induced stress with different concentrations of EDDS. There were no changes in the chemical compositions of the roots and leaves, but the contents were influenced by Se-induced stress and EDDS treatment. This study demonstrated the importance of applying XRD, EDXS and FTIR methods toward a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of EDDS-induced Se accumulation in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPlectranthus scutellarioides 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaluminum 3abiomass production 3acalcium 3acarbon 3achelation 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3aheavy metals 3ahydroponics 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3aoxygen 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3apotassium 3aroots 3aselenium 3asilicon 3asodium selenite 3atoxicity1 aYuan, Juhong H.0 tEcotoxicology.g2015 Apr., v. 24, no. 3 p.686-699dSpringer-Verlagx0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-014-1415-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006300153245011500216300001400331520185100345592002802196650002402224650002402248650002002272650002402292650001602316650001102332650001502343650002902358650001602387650002502403653002602428653002402454653002402478653001402502653001502516773010502531856008802636852000902724655001202733IND60628430220221120203848.0190401e20190224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062843022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKennedy, Maureen C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4670-330210aExperimental design principles to choose the number of Monte Carlo replicates for stochastic ecological models  ap. 11-17.  aEcologists often rely on computer models as virtual laboratories to evaluate alternative theories, make predictions, perform scenario analysis, and to aid in decision-making. The application of ecological models can have real-world consequences that drive ecological theory development and science-based decision and policy-making, so it is imperative that the conclusions drawn from ecological models have a strong, credible quantitative basis. In particular it is important to establish whether any predicted change in a model output has ecological and statistical significance. Ecological models may include stochastic components, using probability distributions to represent some modeled processes. An individual run of a stochastic ecological model is a random draw from an infinitely large population, requiring replicate simulations to estimate the distribution of model outcomes. An important consideration is the number of Monte Carlo replicates necessary to draw useful conclusions from the model analysis. A simple framework is presented that borrows from well-understood techniques for experimental design, including confidence interval estimation and sample size power analysis. The desired precision of interval estimates for model prediction, or the minimum desired detectable effect size between scenarios, is established by the researcher in the context of the model objectives and the ecological system. The number of replicates required to achieve that level of precision or detectable effect is computed given an estimate of the variability in the model outcomes of interest. If the number of replicates is computationally prohibitive, then the expected precision or detectable effect for that sample size should be reported. An example is given for a stochastic model of fire spread integrated with an eco-hydrological model.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer simulation 3aconfidence interval 3adecision making 3aexperimental design 3afire spread 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprobability distribution 3aresearchers 3astochastic processes 0aStochastic simulation 0aConfidence interval 0aPrediction interval 0aInference 0aEstimation0 tEcological modelling.g2019 Feb. 24, v. 394 p.11-17dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002600138245007200164520184500236592002802081650003802109650005802147650001202205650001302217650001402230650001402244650001802258650001202276650001102288650001102299650001502310650002402325650002102349650001002370650001402380650001002394650001602404651001202420651001102432700002302443700002302466700002502489700001902514700002102533700001502554700002102569773011902590856007202709852000902781655001202790IND60648846420221116164503.0190701e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064884642DNAL7 a10.3390/f90603122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchepaschenko, Dmitry10aImproved Estimates of Biomass Expansion Factors for Russian Forests  aBiomass structure is an important feature of terrestrial vegetation. The parameters of forest biomass structure are important for forest monitoring, biomass modelling and the optimal utilization and management of forests. In this paper, we used the most comprehensive database of sample plots available to build a set of multi-dimensional regression models that describe the proportion of different live biomass fractions (i.e., the stem, branches, foliage, roots) of forest stands as a function of average stand age, density (relative stocking) and site quality for forests of the major tree species of northern Eurasia. Bootstrapping was used to determine the accuracy of the estimates and also provides the associated uncertainties in these estimates. The species-specific mean percentage errors were then calculated between the sample plot data and the model estimates, resulting in overall relative errors in the regression model of &minus;0.6%, &minus;1.0% and 11.6% for biomass conversion and expansion factor (BCEF), biomass expansion factor (BEF), and root-to-shoot ratio respectively. The equations were then applied to data obtained from the Russian State Forest Register (SFR) and a map of forest cover to produce spatially distributed estimators of biomass conversion and expansion factors and root-to-shoot ratios for Russian forests. The equations and the resulting maps can be used to convert growing stock volume to the components of both above-ground and below-ground live biomass. The new live biomass conversion factors can be used in different applications, in particular to substitute those that are currently used by Russia in national reporting to the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and the FAO FRA (Food and Agriculture Organization&rsquo;s Forest Resource Assessment), among others.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3abiomass 3abranches 3adatabases 3aequations 3aforest stands 3aforests 3aleaves 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aregression analysis 3aroot shoot ratio 3aroots 3astand age 3atrees 3auncertainty 3aEurasia 3aRussia1 aMoltchanova, Elena1 aShvidenko, Anatoly1 aBlyshchyk, Volodymyr1 aDmitriev, Egor1 aMartynenko, Olga1 aSee, Linda1 aKraxner, Florian0 tForests.g2018 June 01, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f90603123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02049naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245006700177300001800244520057200262592002800834596008100862596007300943650001501016650004201031650001301073650002801086650001301114650001801127650001401145650001801159650001401177650001201191651001501203700002301218700003001241700002001271700002201291700002301313700002301336700002501359773011601384856008201500852000901582655001201591IND60579524420221120040449.0211117e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057952442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-017-3433-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurmagambetova, Aizhan S.10aMonitoring of Newcastle disease virus in environmental samples  ap. 2843-2846.  aNewcastle disease virus (NDV) is an important pathogen in poultry.

Likewise, pollen from T. pratense on pistils of T. diffusum and T. pallidum germinated, and the resulting tubes grew to the vicinity of the ovules. Compatible matings within T. pratense resulted in vigorous pollen tube growth, similar to that of the interspedfic combinations. Matings of T. pratense with T. pallidum and T. hirtum produced no mature seeds. Embryos were collected at 7 days of age, but no hybrids were satisfactorily grown in embryo culture. Many hybrids were produced by mating T. pratense ✕ T. diffusum, but none were obtained from the reciprocal mating. Hybrids were generally chlorotic in the seedling stage, and chlorosis was observed on young leaves in older plants. Most floral and vegetative characteristics of hybrids were intermediate to the parents. All F₁ hybrids of T. pratense ✕ T. diffusum were 2n = 15 and meiosis was very irregular. Univalents and bivalents at MI averaged 1.6 and 1.3 per cell, respectively. The remainder of the chromosomes were associated in complex multivalents of 3 to 15 members. Most multivalents were chains, and bivalents were rods. Up to three bridges with fragments were found at AI, and bridges were also seen at All. These chromosomal abnormalities indicate the presence of translocations and paracentric inversions. It was concluded that T. pratense and T. diffusum had complex differences in chromosome structure. The F₁ of T. pratense ✕ T. diffusum was nearly sterile. However, backcrosses to T. pratense produced a few plants that may have been polyploids. The BC₁ plants flowered and were partially fertile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant genetics 3aplant breeding1 aCleveland, R.

To determine if the basic nature of the metathesis reaction afforded any new physicochemical properties to HKUST-1, three variables were monitored: a) the energy source either from i) ultrasound (US), ii) stirring at room temperature (SRT) or iii) solvothermal (ST) treatment, b) the reaction solvent and c) the reaction time. The metathesis reaction provided DMF·H₂O, EtOH·H₂O or MeOH·H₂O solvates. The compounds were thoroughly characterized by FTIR, XRD, nitrogen adsorption BET surface areas and TGA/DSC data, which indicated the formation of [Cu₃(BTC)₂] MOFs in eight out of ten synthetic entries. Low-pressure hydrogen uptake experiments revealed values as high as 2.44 wt% for the [Cu₃(BTC)₂] EtOH·H₂O solvates. The [Cu₃(BTC)₂] MeOH·H₂O and [Cu₃(BTC)₂] EtOH·H₂O solvates possess high surface areas, the latter being the metathesis prepared MOF with the least H₂O→Cu coordination according to TGA, DSC and a thermal desorption gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled technique. This resulted in a material with less chemisorbed H₂O and better H₂ adsorption capability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3acopper 3acupric nitrate 3adesorption 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenergy 3aethanol 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrogen 3amethanol 3anitrogen 3aphysicochemical properties 3asodium 3asolvents 3athermogravimetry 3aultrasonics1 aNúñez, Lourdes López1 aFlores, Jorge1 aLópez-Simeon, Roxana1 aBeltrán, Hiram I.0 tRSC advances.g2013 June 17, v. 3, no. 27 p.10962-10972dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra40726h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245012900152300001800281520158400299592002801883650000801911650002001919650000901939650001501948650001301963650001201976650001101988650001501999650002902014650002502043650001902068700001402087700001502101700001402116700002102130700001802151773010402169856007502273852000902348655001202357IND60534075320221116184106.0160802e20130418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053407532DNAL7 a10.1021/ef30175142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Kai10aModeling of Pulverized Coal Combustion in Turbulent Flow with the Consideration of Intermediate Reactions of Volatile Matter  ap. 2246-2254.  aThe eddy dissipation concept (EDC) model with the consideration of the intermediate reactions for the volatile matter (VM) combustion was applied to simulate turbulent pulverized coal/air jet combustion adjacent to a bluff-boy type model burner. The VM of the coal was assumed to consist of CO, H₂, and CH₄, and its chemistry was described by a 16-speices and 41-step skeletal mechanism for CH₄/air combustion. The model was compared with some other conventionally used ones, including the eddy dissipation (ED) model, eddy dissipation or finite rate (ED-FR) model, mixture fraction probability density function (MF-PDF) model, and the EDC model with a global reaction mechanism for gas phase combustion (EDC_G), in predicting temperature profiles, maximum flame temperature, flame shape, and ignition position and in CPU cost. The predicted temperature profiles and flame positions were further compared with reported experimental data. It was found that the EDC model with the consideration of the intermediate reactions for VM combustion improved prediction in the temperature field and thus ignition position. With the adoption of the full in situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT) method, two-third of the overall CPU time could be saved, making the EDC model more acceptable in comparison with the ED-type models and MF-PDF model. On the basis of the simulation results, it is suggested that intermediate reactions of the VM should be considered when high accuracy of flame temperature and ignition position prediction is desired in simulation of pulverized coal combustion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon monoxide 3acoal 3acombustion 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprobability distribution 3atemperature profiles 3aturbulent flow1 aLiu, Bing1 aZhang, Hai1 aWu, Yuxin1 aMatsumoto, Keigo1 aTakeno, Keiji0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2013 Apr. 18, v. 27, no. 4 p.2246-2254dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef30175143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001500168245005700183300001600240500000900256520136900265592002801634650001901662650001901681700002001700700001901720773012001739852000901859856009801868655001201966991616654740742620221123042500.0191122e197205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7290749402DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1972.0011183X001200030020x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtsuka, Y.10aComparisons of Prediction Formulas for Maize Hybrids  ap. 325-331.  aepub  aThree-way and double-cross maize (Zea mays L.) hybrid means were predicted with various formulas involving linear functions of general and specific effects estimated from single-cross diallels. When the efficiencies of these predictors were compared with the correlations of observed and predicted means as the criteria of comparison, the “optimumw eight” predictor was most efficient for hybrids from unselected lines derived from the variety ‘BSK.’ The “optimum weight” predictor did not give the highest correlation for hybrids from a highly selected set of 10 lines, indicating a substantial bias due to epistasis. Even with hybrids from the selected set of lines, the genotype by environmental interaction was a greater potential source of bias than was epistasis unless the trials were grown in a large number of environments. The prediction formula with nonparental single-cross means (Jenkins' method B) was nearly as efficient as the “optimum weight” predictor. We xecommendth at the appropriate single crosses be grown in a preliminary trial at several locations and that the three-way and double-cross performance be predicted from the nonparental singlecross means. A reduced number of selected hybrids per se should then be evaluated over enough environments to enable the breeder to select the superior hybrids for commercial release.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant genetics 3aplant breeding1 aEberhart, S.

Here we investigate the roles of root absorption, translocation and tolerance in As hyperaccumulation by comparing the hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata and the nonhyperaccumulator Pteris tremula. • The two species were grown in a pot experiment with 0–500 mg As kg⁻¹ added as arsenate, and in a short‐term (8 h) uptake experiment with 5 µM arsenate under phosphorus‐sufficient conditions. • In the pot experiment, P. vittata accumulated up to 2500 mg As kg⁻¹ frond d. wt and suffered no phytotoxicity. P. tremula accumulated < 100 mg As kg⁻¹ frond d. wt and suffered severe phytotoxicity with additions of ≥ 25 mg As kg⁻¹. In the short‐term uptake experiment, P. vittata had a 2.2‐fold higher rate of arsenate uptake than P. tremula, and distributed more As taken up to the fronds (76%) than did P. tremula (9%). • Our results show that enhanced root uptake, efficient root‐to‐shoot translocation, and a much elevated tolerance through internal detoxification all contribute to As hyperaccumulation in P. vittata.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPteris vittata 3aabsorption 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aferns and fern allies 3ahyperaccumulators 3aphytotoxicity1 aZhao, F.

Comparison of the composition, as determined by electrospray ionization combined with high-resolution linear trap quadropole (LTQ)-Orbitrap Velos Pro hybrid mass spectrometry (negative ion) of selected estrogenic and nonestrogenic fractions identified compounds that were uniquely present in the estrogenic samples, biologically treated and untreated. Of the 30 most abundant compounds, there were 14 possible nonaromatic structures and 16 possible aromatic structures. Based on the published literature, the latter are the most likely to cause estrogenicity and were O2, O3 and O4 C17 to C20 compounds with double bond equivalents between 6 and 10 and chemical formulas similar to estrone- and estradiol-like compounds. This study shows exact formulas and masses of possible estrogenic compounds in OSPW. These findings will help to focus study on the most environmentally significant components in OSPW.  aPublisher supplied data 3afractionation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3aoil sands 3aoxygen 3aozone 3ascreening 3asolid phase extraction 3ayeasts1 aRamsay, Bruce

However, studies on winter phenology of insects are rare. It is expected that winter flights of flies (Diptera) will increase as climate warms. This study aims to find the relationship between flight of flies and temperature. The survey on flies and weather (temperature and rainfall) was carried out in the Hongneung Arboretum in Seoul, Korea. Flies were collected weekly from December 2012 to February 2013 using sweeping and Malaise trap. In the survey, 106 flies belonging to 28 morphospecies and 17 families were collected. Richness and abundance of flies were positively correlated with temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiptera 3aarboreta 3abiodiversity 3acorrelation 3adiapause 3aflight 3ainsects 3amorphospecies 3aphenology 3arain 3asurveys 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3awinter 3aKorean Peninsula 0aDiptera 0aphenology 0atemperature 0awinter flight1 aLee, Cheol Min1 aJi, Ok Yeong0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific biodiversity(Online).g2015 Dec. 30, v. 8, no. 4 p.337-342dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23211x2287-884X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japb.2015.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013600155300001800291500002000309520119500329592002801524596010601552596006701658650001601725650001601741650002101757650001801778650001701796650002501813650002401838650001601862650001401878650001301892700001401905700001701919700001901936700001501955700001401970700001601984700001702000700001202017700001502029700005802044773011702102856007402219852000902293655001202302IND60758246920221122031906.0211127e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075824692DNAL7 a10.1111/pbr.129682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yaqian10aMining of quantitative trait loci and candidate genes for seed size and shape across multiple environments in soybean (Glycine max)  ap. 1058-1069.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSeed size and shape are important characteristics in soybean breeding, whereas the genetic basis are still unknown, which constrains the improvement of related traits. In view of this, one recombinant inbred line population was assessed for six related traits under four environments. In total, 10 QTLs controlling the related traits were identified, and five were detected across at least two environments, which located on chromosomes 2, 4, 6, 13, and 16 with phenotypic variation explained (PVE) 3.6% to 9.4%. Among them, qSS‐02 and qSS‐16 were identified to control four and five related traits with pleiotropic effects on chromosomes 2 and 16 across three and two environments, respectively. Meanwhile, qSS‐04 was detected to control all of the six related traits on chromosome 4 under four environments with PVEs 4.5% to 9.4%. Furthermore, the candidate genes, that is, Glyma.04G055100 (big grain protein) and Glyma.13G068500 (cytochrome P450), were screened out for their different expressions between population parents at different seed growth and developmental stages. Thus, these results could provide novel insights for the genetic basis of seed size and shape in soybean.  aPublisher supplied data  aHBCT2019190203cHebei Province Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System Innovation Team Project  a19226356DcHebei Province Key Research and Development Project 3aGlycine max 3achromosomes 3acytochrome P-450 3agrain protein 3ainbred lines 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative traits 3aseed growth 3aseed size 3asoybeans1 aTian, Rui1 aShao, Zhenqi1 aChen, Shiliang1 aZhang, Hua1 aJin, Yuan1 aLi, Wenlong1 aKong, Youbin1 aDu, Hui1 aLi, Xihuan1 aZhang, Caiying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9738-07560 tPlant breeding.g2021 Dec., v. 140, no. 6 p.1058-1069dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl40712x0179-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbr.129683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245011600158506002800274520157400302592002801876506003701904650001901941650001401960650001801974650001001992650001702002650002402019650002902043650002502072650001702097650001502114650003202129650001402161650003002175653001802205653002102223653001502244653001902259653002402278700001902302700002102321773009202342856008002434852000902514655001202523IND60764490820221215142544.0211121e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076449082DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2102022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPraptiwi10aDiversity of endophytic fungi from Vernonia amygdalina, their phenolic and flavonoid contents and bioactivities  aResource is Open Access  aPraptiwi, Fathoni A, Ilyas M. 2019. Diversity of endophytic fungi from Vernonia amygdalina, their phenolic and flavonoid contents and bioactivities. Biodiversitas 20: 436-441. There are nine endophytic fungi in total associated with stem and leaves of Vernonia amygdalina were determined for their total phenolic and flavonoids content as well as assessed for their antibacterial and antioxidant activities. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined by spectrophotometric methods. The antibacterial activity was performed using Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) - Bioautography assay against S.aureus and E.coli. The antioxidant activity was carried out using TLC- Bioautography by DPPH scavenging assay. Broth serial microdilution assay was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and the half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50). Among the identified isolates, there was one isolate of Phomopsis sp., two isolates of Phoma sp., two isolates of Lasiodiplodia sp., two isolates of Colletotrichum sp. and two isolates of Phyllosticta sp. The results showed that the phenolic contents were ranging from 0.53-116.03 mg GAE/g extract, flavonoids contents were ranging from 81.12 to 390.21 mg quercetin equivalent (QE)/g extract. MICs of endophytic fungi against S.aureus and E.coli ranged from 256 to >256 µg/mL and >256 µg/mL respectively that categorized as moderate antibacterial activity. The antioxidant activity of endophytic fungi associated with V. amygdalina was >128 µg/mL, and the antioxidant activity index (AAI) was 0.24.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aColletotrichum 3aDiaporthe 3aLasiodiplodia 3aPhoma 3aPhyllosticta 3aVernonia amygdalina 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aendophytes 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aquercetin 3athin layer chromatography 0abioactivities 0aendophytic fungi 0aflavonoids 0atotal phenolic 0avernonia amygdalina1 aFathoni, Ahmad1 aShauqī, Ilyās,0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Jan., v. 21, no. 2dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2102023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02064naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001800168245007700186300001600263500000900279520122900288592002801517650001901545650001901564773012001583852000901703856009801712655001201810991616648730742620221122185946.0191122e197205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7290749212DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1972.0011183X001200030001x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoesch, P.

The inheritance of eight stalk traits was determined by means of diallel analysis. Significant differences among the 66 F₁ hybrids were obtained in each trait. General combining ability (gca) and specific combining ability (sca) mean squares were statistically significant nearly every instance. The gca mean square was usually much larger than the sea mean square. Genotypic correlation coefficients between large stalk diameter and crushing strength, weight of stalk and crushing strength, and rind thickness and crushing strength were .72, .88, and .60, respectively. Weight of stalk section appears to be well suited for rapid screening purposes, whereas stalk density appears to be a poor trait to employ in a selection program. for the material studied, selection for high crushing strength will likely result, on the average, in strains characterized by increased size of stalk, weight of stalk, and thickness of rind. Selection procedures recommended for populations involving the lines tested were those which are effective in utilizing both the additive and nonadditive genetic variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant genetics 3aplant breeding0 tCrop science.g1972 May, v. 12, no. 3 p.261-264dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1972.0011183X001200030001x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02554naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245012400172300001600296500001900312500002000331520132000351592002801671650001901699650000801718650001501726650001801741650001501759650001101774650001701785650003901802650002201841650003701863700001401900700001301914700001701927773011501944856008802059852000902147655001202156IND60734369420221119082720.0210417e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073436942DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01290.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Huaiqing10aInhibition of RNA and protein synthesis in pollen tube development of Pinus bungeana by actinomycin D and cycloheximide  ap. 721-730.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• The effects of actinomycin D and cycloheximide on RNA and protein synthesis were investigated during pollen tube development of Pinus bungeana. • RNA and protein contents, protein expression patterns, cell wall components and ultrastructural changes of pollen tubes were studied using spectrophotometry, SDS‐PAGE electrophoresis, Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). • Pollen grains germinated in the presence of actinomycin D, but tube elongation and RNA synthesis were inhibited. By contrast, cycloheximide inhibited pollen germination and protein synthesis, induced abnormal tube morphology, and retarded the tube growth rate.

Salinity, however, is a negative factor to lessen output and quality in Italian ryegrass. The aim of this study was to elucidate the salt tolerance mechanism of two Italian ryegrass cultivars, ‘Abundant’ and ‘Angus’. Under hydroponic conditions, two cultivars of Italian ryegrass with different salt tolerance were exposed to 0 and 300 mM NaCl solution for 1 week, respectively. The results showed that salt stress decreased relative growth rate and relative water content, especially in salt‐sensitive ‘Angus’. The salt‐tolerant ‘Abundant’ cultivar alleviated reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced burst and cell damage. However, ‘Angus’ exhibited a greater activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) than ‘Abundant’. Additionally, ‘Abundant’ exhibited higher photosynthetic efficiency than ‘Angus’ under salt stress condition. Salt treatment significantly increased the Na/K, Na/Mg, and Na/Ca ratios in the leaves and roots of both cultivars, with a pronounced effect in salt‐sensitive ‘Angus’. The metabolite analysis of leaf polar extracts revealed 41 salt responsive metabolites in both cultivars, mainly consisting of amino acids, organic acids, fatty acids, and sugars. Following exposure to salt conditions, salt‐sensitive ‘Angus’ had a higher level of metabolites and more uniquely upregulated metabolites were detected. Based on these findings, we conclude that the ‘Abundant’ cultivar emerged as a favorite in saline‐alkali soil, while the ‘Angus’ cultivar is suitable for planting in normal soil. It appears that the high salt tolerance of ‘Abundant’ is partly to prevent the plant from ionic homeostasis disruption.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017389cYouth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  a31672482cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aKC1809004cChangsha Municipal Science and Technology Project  a2019JZZY010726cMajor Science and Technology Innovation Project of Shandong Province 3aLolium multiflorum 3acultivars 3ahomeostasis 3ahydroponics 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3anutritive value 3apalatability 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3areactive oxygen species 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awater content1 aSong, Shurui1 aYang, Yong1 aAmee, Maurice1 aMa, Yukun,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3113-87931 aXie, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8914-235X0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2021 July, v. 172, no. 3 p.1688-1699dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.133743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002000169245008100189300001600270520102500286592002801311650001201339650002301351650001201374650001101386650001501397650002201412650001001434650002501444650001301469650001401482650002401496650002301520650004501543650002301588650001601611650001501627650002501642650002401667650003101691700001801722700001401740700002201754700001601776700002401792700002001816773009501836856008601931852000902017655001202026IND4443540920221119003654.0141110e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444354092DNAL7 a208890612pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.05.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaito, Tomonori10aEffect of nitrogen addition on the performance of microbial fuel cell anodes  ap. 395-398.  aCarbon cloth anodes were modified with 4(N,N-dimethylamino)benzene diazonium tetrafluoroborate to increase nitrogen-containing functional groups at the anode surface in order to test whether the performance of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) could be improved by controllably modifying the anode surface chemistry. Anodes with the lowest extent of functionalization, based on a nitrogen/carbon ratio of 0.7 as measured by XPS, achieved the highest power density of 938mW/m². This power density was 24% greater than an untreated anode, and similar to that obtained with an ammonia gas treatment previously shown to increase power. Increasing the nitrogen/carbon ratio to 3.8, however, decreased the power density to 707mW/m². These results demonstrate that a small amount of nitrogen functionalization on the carbon cloth material is sufficient to enhance MFC performance, likely as a result of promoting bacterial adhesion to the surface without adversely affecting microbial viability or electron transfer to the surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abacterial adhesion 3abenzene 3acarbon 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3agases 3amicrobial fuel cells 3anitrogen 3aviability 2aAmmoniaxmetabolism 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aBioelectric Energy Sourcesxmicrobiology 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aElectricity 2aElectrodes 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhotoelectron Spectroscopy1 aMehanna, Maha1 aWang, Xin1 aCusick, Roland D.1 aFeng, Yujie1 aHickner, Michael A.1 aLogan, Bruce E.0 tBioresource technology.g2011 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.395-398dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.05.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245014100164506002800305520190900333592002802242506003702270650002202307650001502329650001602344650001402360650002002374650001502394650002102409650001302430650001302443650001902456653001402475653001702489653002202506653001902528653001402547700002102561700001502582700002102597773009202618856008002710852000902790655001202799IND60764490920221215142553.0211122e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076449092DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2103252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaratul, Happy14aThe diversity of leaves and asiaticoside content on three accessions of Centella asiatica with the addition of chicken manure fertilizer  aResource is Open Access  aMumtazah HM, Supriyono, Widyastuti Y, Yunus A. 2020. The diversity of leaves and asiaticoside content on three accessions of Centella asiatica with the addition of chicken manure fertilizer. Biodiversitas 21: 1035-1040. Centella asiatica (L.) commonly known as an essential medicinal herb. This plant has high diversity, especially in leaf morphology. The main objective of this research was to determine the morphology of leaves and the effect of chicken manure dosage on the increase of asiaticoside content. The leaves of three accessions characterized, and then C. asiatica planted. The research design used a completely randomized design (CRD) factorial, with the first factor is accession (C) with 3 levels (C1: accession 1, C2: accession 2, C3: accession 3). The second factor was chicken manure with 4 levels dosage (P1: 0 ton ha-1, P2: 10 tons ha-1, P3: 15 tons ha-1 and P4: 20 tons ha-1). Asiaticoside analysis used the TLC method with chloroform: methanol: water (65:25:4) as mobile phase. The result from this research showed that the diversity in leaf morphology of three accessions is in leaf size and petiole length. Accession 3 has the widest leaf size (7.3 cm) and the longest petiole (9.8 cm), accession 2 with a leaf width of 5.8 cm and petiole length in 8.5 cm, while the accession 1 has the least leaf width (5.3 cm) and the length of the petiole is the shortest with 7.3 cm. Observation results of asiaticoside showed that the highest content of asiaticoside produced by accession 3 (0.19%), then accession 1 with a content of 0.15%, while accession 2 showed the lowest asiaticoside content (0.13%). The treatment of chicken manure addition significantly increase asiaticoside content in accessions 1 and 3, but in accession 2 it was not significantly increased. The highest content of asiaticoside (0.34%) were in accession 3 with the addition of chicken manure 20 tons ha-1 (P4).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCentella asiatica 3achloroform 3afertilizers 3aleaf area 3aleaf morphology 3aleaf width 3amedicinal plants 3amethanol 3apetioles 3apoultry manure 0aaccession 0aasiaticoside 0acentella asiatica 0achicken manure 0adiversity1 aWIDYASTUTI, YULI1 aSupriyono,1 aYūnus, Aḥmad,0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Feb., v. 21, no. 3dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2103253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01556naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245009400157300001600251520062500267592002800892650002000920650001400940650001500954650001600969650001600985650001001001650002201011650001001033651001101043773009601054856007101150852000901221655001201230IND60518501320221120130437.0160417e196901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051850132DNAL7 a10.2307/19346712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, H.

Most stems are erect in the high elevation Pseudotsuga/Acer/Gaultheria community, whereas crown spread, bryophyte cover, height, and diameter attain a maximum in the Pseudotsuga/Acer/Polystichum community. Layering is primarily responsible for the distribution of vine maple and can only occur where the stems become arched and contact the ground. On slopes exceeding 30% most stems lean down or across the slope. In some communities upslone movement of vine maple is restricted because of repeated fires and the step slope which limits layering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer circinatum 3aBryopsida 3aGaultheria 3aPolystichum 3aPseudotsuga 3afires 3aplant communities 3astems 3aOregon0 tEcology.g1969 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.127-130dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19346713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012100156300001800277500002000295520117500315592002801490596007501518596012701593596007601720650002001796650003001816650001101846650001001857650001901867650001201886650001301898650001601911650001901927650002101946650002601967700001601993700001502009700001702024700001202041700005602053773012602109856007302235852000902308655001202317IND60743142020221119213037.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074314202DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.133302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shuang14aThe HD‐Zip I transcription factor MdHB7‐like confers tolerance to salinity in transgenic apple (Malus domestica)  ap. 1452-1464.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSalinity is a major environmental constraint that substantially limits global agricultural productivity. HD‐Zip I transcription factors are involved in plant responses to salt stress, but little is known about the HD‐Zip I genes in apple (Malus domestica). Here, we characterized the function of an apple HD‐Zip I gene (MdHB7‐like) and report that its expression is induced by salt stress. To further explore its role in salt stress, we created MdHB7‐like overexpressing and RNAi transgenic apple plants. The overexpression of MdHB7‐like improved the photosynthetic performance and reduced ROS and Na⁺ accumulation under salt stress. Plants that overexpressed MdHB7‐like also showed increased accumulation of proline and soluble sugars, which may have played an important role in their salt stress tolerance. RNAi suppression of MdHB7‐like had the opposite effects. Together, our results demonstrate that MdHB7‐like is an important regulator of salt tolerance in apple. Our results provide new insights for future research on the mechanisms by which MdHB7‐like promotes salt tolerance and provide a potential target for molecular breeding in apple.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD1000303cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aCXGC2018F03cthe Agricultural Scientific and Technological Innovation Project of Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences  aCARS‐27cthe earmarked fund for the China Agriculture Research System 3aMalus domestica 3aagricultural productivity 3aapples 3agenes 3aphotosynthesis 3aproline 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3astress tolerance 3atranscription factors1 aWang, Haibo1 aJia, Xumei1 aGao, Hanbing1 aMao, Ke1 aMa, Fengwang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0608-25210 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2021 July, v. 172, no. 3 p.1452-1464dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.133303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002200136024001900158040001800177100002400195245012700219300001900346520181800365592002802183650002002211650001402231650001602245650001102261650001802272650000902290650001302299650001502312650001902327650002402346650001602370650001402386650001602400650001002416700002102426700002402447700002302471700002402494710008502518773010002603856008802703990002302791852000902814655001202823IND60098608620221122062835.0141104e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009860862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.04.0222doi7 aPMC36794902pmcid7 a226572492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNnoaham, Kelechi E.10aDeveloping symptom-based predictive models of endometriosis as a clinical screening tool: results from a multicenter study  ap. 692-701.e5.  aOBJECTIVE: To generate and validate symptom-based models to predict endometriosis among symptomatic women prior to undergoing their first laparoscopy. DESIGN: Prospective, observational, two-phase study, in which women completed a 25-item questionnaire prior to surgery. SETTING: Nineteen hospitals in 13 countries. PATIENT(S): Symptomatic women (n = 1,396) scheduled for laparoscopy without a previous surgical diagnosis of endometriosis. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Sensitivity and specificity of endometriosis diagnosis predicted by symptoms and patient characteristics from optimal models developed using multiple logistic regression analyses in one data set (phase I), and independently validated in a second data set (phase II) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULT(S): Three hundred sixty (46.7%) women in phase I and 364 (58.2%) in phase II were diagnosed with endometriosis at laparoscopy. Menstrual dyschezia (pain on opening bowels) and a history of benign ovarian cysts most strongly predicted both any and stage III and IV endometriosis in both phases. Prediction of any-stage endometriosis, although improved by ultrasound scan evidence of cyst/nodules, was relatively poor (area under the curve [AUC] = 68.3). Stage III and IV disease was predicted with good accuracy (AUC = 84.9, sensitivity of 82.3% and specificity 75.8% at an optimal cut-off of 0.24). CONCLUSION(S): Our symptom-based models predict any-stage endometriosis relatively poorly and stage III and IV disease with good accuracy. Predictive tools based on such models could help to prioritize women for surgical investigation in clinical practice and thus contribute to reducing time to diagnosis. We invite other researchers to validate the key models in additional populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ahospitals 3alaparoscopy 3amodels 3aovarian cysts 3apain 3apatients 3aprediction 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3aresearchers 3ascreening 3aultrasonics 3awomen1 aHummelshoj, Lone1 aKennedy, Stephen H.1 aJenkinson, Crispin1 aZondervan, Krina T.2 aWorld Endometriosis Research Foundation Women's Health Symptom Survey Consortium0 tFertility and sterility.g2012 Sept., v. 98, no. 3 p.692-701.e5dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.04.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013200158300002000290520118700310592002801497650001201525650001101537650001701548650001301565650001501578650000901593650001601602650002201618650002801640650002601668650001601694700002101710700001901731700002101750773012401771856007401895852000901969655001201978IND60664471120221118090615.0190912e20130715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066447112DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra40703a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Soumitra10aDiverse photochemical behavior of dibromodifluoromethane (CF₂Br₂) monomer and cluster under gigawatt intensity laser fields  ap. 12867-12873.  aDibromodifluoromethane (CF₂Br₂) monomers and clusters were irradiated with nanosecond laser pulses of intensity ∼10⁹ W cm⁻² at 266 nm, 355 nm and 532 nm and the ionic outcome was studied using time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Based on the monomer study at different wavelengths, it was inferred that CF₂Br₂ undergoes dissociation followed by ionization and the primary dissociation leads to the formation of CF₂Br radical and atomic bromine. However, the cluster study reveals an altogether different photoionization channel. At 266 nm, CF₂Br⁺ and Br₂⁺ were observed in photoionization of CF₂Br₂ clusters and an intra-cluster photochemical reaction is responsible for the generation of these ions. Moreover, multiply charged ions of carbon, fluorine and bromine were observed at 355 nm and 532 nm. The mechanism of multiply charged ion formation due to the interaction of CF₂Br₂ clusters under a gigawatt intensity laser field has been discussed. Further, negative ions were detected in the photoionization of the CF₂Br₂ cluster at 532 nm and the effect of negative ions on the generation of multiply charged atomic ions will also be discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromine 3acarbon 3adissociation 3afluorine 3aionization 3aions 3airradiation 3amass spectrometry 3aphotochemical reactions 3aultraviolet radiation 3awavelengths1 aBadani, Purav M.1 aSharma, Pramod1 aVatsa, Rajesh K.0 tRSC advances.g2013 July 15, v. 3, no. 31 p.12867-12873dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra40703a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245015700154300001800311500002000329520131500349592002801664596005501692596006201747650002501809650002501834650002201859650001001881650001801891650002001909650002801929650001601957650003201973650002102005650001302026650001702039650001702056700001402073700001302087700001702100700005202117773011702169856007402286852000902360655001202369IND60758247120221122010030.0211127e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075824712DNAL7 a10.1111/pbr.129782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Shuya10aPlasma membrane intrinsic protein SlPIP1;7 promotes root growth and enhances drought stress tolerance in transgenic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants  ap. 1102-1114.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) play important roles in mediating water transport and regulating plant growth and development. In this study, the function of SlPIP1;7 in drought stress tolerance was characterized. Overexpression of SlPIP1;7 in tomato increased the primary root length and promoted the lateral root growth, whereas the shoot and root growth of SlPIP1;7‐silenced seedlings were severely retarded. Moreover, SlPIP1;7‐overexpressing plants exhibited obviously increased drought stress tolerance because they showed slight withering symptom, whereas the SlPIP1;7‐silenced plants were more sensitive to drought stress. Furthermore, the SlPIP1;7‐overexpressing plants showed higher root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) and less cell membrane damage and produced less reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation under drought stress compared with wild‐type, whereas these indicators were opposite in SlPIP1;7‐silenced plants. These results suggested that overexpression of SlPIP1;7 gene promoted the root growth and the water absorption, maintained the water balance and increased the antioxidant defence ability of plants under drought stress, thereby imparting the drought stress tolerance. SlPIP1;7 is thus a valuable genetic resource to enhance stress tolerance in tomato plants.  aPublisher supplied data  cShaanxi Engineering Research Center for Vegetables  a2021JM‐091cShaanxi Natural Science Foundation of China 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aantioxidant activity 3adrought tolerance 3agenes 3alateral roots 3aplasma membrane 3areactive oxygen species 3aroot growth 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3astress tolerance 3atomatoes 3awater stress 3awater uptake1 aHan, Nani1 aWu, Hong1 aJia, Jianhua1 aGuo, Jia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2943-06560 tPlant breeding.g2021 Dec., v. 140, no. 6 p.1102-1114dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl40712x0179-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbr.129783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013200158300002000290520128100310592002801591650001101619650002401630650001101654650001301665650002101678650001401699650001201713650002201725650001801747650001301765650002301778700001901801700002901820700001901849700002301868700001901891773014401910856007402054852000902128655001202137IND60671191420221118174405.0191002e20151027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067119142DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta05145b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgo, Duc Tung10aUniform GeO₂ dispersed in nitrogen-doped porous carbon core–shell architecture: an anode material for lithium ion batteries  ap. 21722-21732.  aGermanium oxide (GeO₂), which possesses great potential as a high-capacity anode material for lithium ion batteries, has suffered from its poor capacity retention and rate capability due to significant volume changes during lithiation and delithiation. In this study, we introduce a simple synthetic route for producing nanosized GeO₂ anchored on a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (GeO₂/N–C) via the sol–gel method followed by a calcination process in an inert argon atmosphere. The GeO₂/N–C showed superior electrochemical performance over pure GeO₂; almost 91.8% capacity retention of 905 mA h g⁻¹ was shown after 200 cycles at the rate of C/2. Interestingly, even at a high rate of 20C, a specific capacity of 412 mA h g⁻¹ was retained. This unique anode performance of GeO₂/N–C is derived from the effective combination of nano-size GeO₂ and its uniform distribution in a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix. Herein, the nitrogen doped-carbon matrix not only strengthens the structure but also promotes the lithium diffusion in the GeO₂/C–N material. Further, the adaptability of GeO₂/N–C as an anode in a full cell configuration in combination with the LiCoO₂ cathode was demonstrated by exhibiting high specific capacity and good cyclability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3aargon (noble gases) 3acarbon 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3agermanium 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3ananomaterials 3anitrogen 3asol-gel processing1 aLe, Hang T.

Gestational hypoxia is associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species. Increase in oxidative stress is responsible for damage to proteins, lipids and DNA with consequent impairment of normal cellular functions. The purpose of this review is to propose a summary of preclinical and clinical evidences designed to outline the correlation between fetal hypoxia and oxidative stress. The results of the studies described show that increases of oxidative stress in the placenta is responsible for changes in fetal development. Specifically, oxidative stress plays a key role in vascular, cardiac and neurological disease and reproductive function dysfunctions. Moreover, the different finding suggests that the prenatal hypoxia-induced oxidative stress is associated with pregnancy complications, responsible for changes in fetal programming. In this way, fetal hypoxia predisposes the offspring to congenital anomalies and chronic diseases in future life. Several antioxidant agents, such as melatonin, erythropoietin, vitamin C, resveratrol and hydrogen, shown potential protective effects in prenatal hypoxia. However, future investigations will be needed to allow the implementation of these antioxidants in clinical practice for the promotion of health in early intrauterine life, in fetuses and children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanimal models 3aascorbic acid 3achildren 3achronic diseases 3acongenital abnormalities 3aerythropoietin 3afetal development 3afetus 3ahealth promotion 3ahydrogen 3ahypoxia 3alipids 3amelatonin 3anervous system diseases 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3aplacenta 3apregnancy complications 3aprotective effect 3areactive oxygen species 3aresveratrol1 aCalcaterra, Valeria 1 aPelizzo, Gloria 1 aBramanti, Placido 1 aMazzon, Emanuela 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 May 12, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90504143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245015900163506002800322520157000350592002801920506003701948650001701985650001702002650001202019650001802031650002202049650001702071650002402088650002002112650001502132650001602147650001002163650001202173650001202185650001202197650000902209651001402218653001802232653002402250653002002274653001102294653001702305773009202322856008002414852000902494655001202503IND60764491220221207095034.0211122e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076449122DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2109372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 arohyani, immy10aCommunity structure analysis of soil insects and their potential role as bioindicators in various ecosystem types in Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia  aResource is Open Access  aRohyani IS. 2020. Community structure analysis of soil insects and their potential role as bioindicators in various ecosystem types in Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 21: 4221-4227. Various types of ecosystems can be found in Lombok, with the dominant ecosystems are natural forest, mangrove, mixed garden, rice field, and mining. These ecosystems have a high level of biodiversity and unique flora and fauna communities, including soil insects that partake in the process of ecosystem energy flow. This study aimed to analyze the community structure of soil insects and their potential role as bioindicators in five types of dominant and unique ecosystems in Lombok island. The data collection was done using pitfall traps, yellow pan traps, baited pitfall traps, soil sampling, and litter collection. The findings revealed that there are 60,439 individuals, 79 families, and 16 orders of insects in various types of ecosystems. Diversity ??(H') and evenness (E) index values ??for family level in all ecosystem types are low on average (H'=0.76 and E=0.10). Cerambycidae (Coleoptera), Trichogrammatidae (Hymenoptera), and Cicindelidae (Coleoptera) are a potential bioindicator in the forest, in the mangrove, and in the rice field ecosystems, respectively. However, the potential bioindicator could not be found since the distribution of the family is almost even in the garden ecosystem. The Tenebrionidae (Coleoptera) and the Acroceridae (Diptera) are soil insects with relatively high abundance and are found only in the mining ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCerambycidae 3aCicindelinae 3aDiptera 3aTenebrionidae 3aTrichogrammatidae 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aenergy flow 3aflora 3aforests 3agardens 3apaddies 3asoil 3aIndonesia 0abioindicators 0acommunity structure 0aecosystem types 0alombok 0asoil insects0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Aug., v. 21, no. 9dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2109373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01425naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007100147245009000218300001800308520032800326592002800654650002300682650002300705650001100728650001500739653002100754653001500775653001100790653000800801653000900809700006200818700002400880773008100904856008100985852000901066655001201075IND60551377920221121020307.0161018e20140624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055137792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.04.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuntreddi, Tirumaleswararao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0566-089510aDirect conversion of methylarenes into dithiocarbamates, thioamides and benzyl esters  ap. 3887-3892.  aA new strategy for the synthesis of a variety of dithiocarbamates and thioamides has been developed employing inexpensive and readily available methylarenes under metal-free and solvent-free conditions.

However, the fabrication of the M–N–C systems commonly rely on fossil resource based carbon, while the exploitation of biomass derived materials often suffer from issues such as tedious procedures, complex composition of the biomass and excessive dosage of the dopant precursor. In this study, a direct and large-scale, bottom-up method was developed for the fabrication of the sustainable iron and nitrogen cofunctionalized carbon (FeNC) in a green and sustainable way. The obtained FeNC possessed well-defined structure as well as uniformly distributed iron species. The catalytic results suggested that FeNC could serve as efficient catalyst for the selective reduction of nitroarenes. The FeNₓ species played an important role, while the N-doped carbon matrix may also involve in the reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3airon 3amineral resources 3anitroaromatic compounds 3anitrogen 3aphysical chemistry1 aWen, Guodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3531-27711 aSu, Yang1 aPan, Xiaoli1 aYan, Hua1 aDiao, Jiangyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6266-93221 aLiu, Hongyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2977-28670 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 02, v. 125, no. 9 p.5127-5135dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c006203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007100169300001800240520128600258592002801544650002301572650001101595650002501606650002201631650001401653650001301667650002401680650001901704651001001723700003101733700002201764700001801786773012901804856008601933852000902019655001202028IND60616246220221119202121.0181127e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061624622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Taekwan10aCarsharing demand estimation and fleet simulation with EV adoption  ap. 1051-1058.  aCarsharing helps mitigate transportation congestion, parking demand, as well as the environmental, and social transportation challenges in cities. Besides providing vehicle access to lower income households, it lowers emissions and reduces vehicle miles traveled (VMT) as well as the number of vehicles registered. Despite these benefits, carsharing systems have been slow to develop in China. Little is known about carsharing demand in China's context, and subsequent system design parameters. This paper explores potential carsharing demand, fleet size, and economic performance in Beijing. To determine these, carsharing mode split is estimated by a stated preference choice modeling exercise. Adequate fleet size is estimated through a Monte Carlo simulation that includes factors such as vehicle types (electric or gasoline vehicle), charger types for electric vehicles (level 2 or level 3 chargers) that influence charging time, arrival rates, travel distance, and travel time based on the time intervals (peak or non-peak hours). In addition, this study estimates the payback period to recover sunk costs. Results indicate that the carsharing mode split ranges from 9% to 32% and an electric vehicle fleet with level 2 chargers is more appropriate for carsharing in Beijing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3acities 3aeconomic performance 3aelectric vehicles 3aemissions 3agasoline 3asystems engineering 3atransportation 3aChina1 aCherry, Christopher Robin,1 aRyerson, Megan S.1 aBell, John E.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 206 p.1051-1058dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006800139245013000207300001800337500002000355520136100375592002801736596005801764596007301822650002501895650001901920650002501939650001501964650001401979650002201993650001402015650001902029650001202048650001902060700002102079700002002100700002402120700001902144700001802163773012602181856007302307852000902380655001202389IND60743142220221119214502.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074314222DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.131862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoig‐Oliver, Margalida1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8727-256410aReduced photosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana atpme17.2 and atpae11.1 mutants is associated to altered cell wall composition  ap. 1439-1451.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe cell wall is a complex and dynamic structure that determines plants' performance by constant remodeling of its compounds. Although cellulose is its major load‐bearing component, pectins are crucial to determine wall characteristics. Changes in pectin physicochemical properties, due to pectin remodeling enzymes (PRE), induce the rearrangement of cell wall compounds, thus, modifying wall architecture. In this work, we tested for the first time how cell wall dynamics affect photosynthetic properties in Arabidopsis thaliana pectin methylesterase atpme17.2 and pectin acetylesterase atpae11.1 mutants in comparison to wild‐type Col‐0. Our results showed maintained PRE activities comparing mutants with wild‐type and no significant differences in cellulose, but cell wall non‐cellulosic neutral sugars contents changed. Particularly, the amount of galacturonic acid (GalA) – which represents to some extent the pectin cell wall proportion – was reduced in the two mutants. Additionally, physiological characterization revealed that mutants presented a decreased net CO₂ assimilation (AN) because of reductions in both stomatal (gₛ) and mesophyll conductances (gₘ). Thus, our results suggest that atpme17.2 and atpae11.1 cell wall modifications due to genetic alterations could play a significant role in determining photosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data  aFPU16/01544cMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  aPGC2018‐093824‐B‐C41cMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acarbon dioxide 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3acellulose 3agalacturonic acid 3amesophyll 3apectinesterase 3apectins 3aphotosynthesis1 aRayon, Catherine1 aRoulard, Romain1 aFournet, François,1 aBota, Josefina1 aFlexas, Jaume0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2021 July, v. 172, no. 3 p.1439-1451dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.131863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100003000137245005600167300001400223520125400237592002801491650001901519650001301538650001201551650003301563650001201596650001301608650001401621650001701635650001001652650001601662651001501678651000901693773009401702856007101796852000901867655001201876IND60518501520221120121224.0160417e196901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051850152DNAL7 a10.2307/19346622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaMarche, Valmore C., Jr.10aEnvironment in Relation to Age of Bristlecone Pines  ap. 53-59.  aBristlecone pines (Pinus aristata Engelm.) locally attain ages over 4,000 years. In the White Mountains, California, old trees are widely distributed near the lower forest border, but are restricted to exposed, rocky areas at higher altitudes. Comparative aridity seems to be an important feature of the "old—age" habitat. Occurrences of older (1,5000—4,900 years) bristlecone pines in the moister mountain ranges of Nevade and Utah are analogous to those at higher altitudes in the White Mountains, suggesting that local edaphic and physiographic factors can offset the effects of a regional precipitation gradient. Attainment of an age greater that about 1,500 years apparently depends on the adoption of a strip—growth habit, which permits the aging bristlecone pine to maintain a nearly constant ratio of green to non—green tissue. Slow growth rates, wind damage, and soil erosion may be conducive to cambial area reduction. Other features of old—age stands, such as the wide spacing of the trees, the compactness of their crowns, the sparsity of litter, and the low density of the accompanying ground—cover vegetation, would also provide a measure of protection from fire and from competition, permitting the older trees to survive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus aristata 3aaltitude 3acambium 3adry environmental conditions 3aforests 3ahabitats 3amountains 3asoil erosion 3atrees 3awind damage 3aCalifornia 3aUtah0 tEcology.g1969 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.53-59dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19346623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01073naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001200138245009100150300001800241520016600259592002800425650002300453650001700476650001700493650001100510700001300521700001300534700001400547773012800561856007300689852000900762655001200771IND60658353420221117165736.0190817e20090218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065835342DNAL7 a10.1039/b816538f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Zhe10aSelf-supported helical oxide arrays templated by pore-swollen chiral mesoporous silica  ap. 1055-1057.  aSelf-supported helical architectures of Ia3̄d In₂O₃ and Fd3̄m Co₃O₄ are fabricated for the first time using the pore-swollen chiral silica as template.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acobalt oxide 3aporous media 3asilica1 aHe, Jing1 aShu, Xin1 aWu, Yixin0 tChemical communications.g2009 Feb. 18, , no. 9 p.1055-1057dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b816538f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245012100175520178100296592002802077650001402105650001402119650002102133650001802154650001002172650001902182650002202201650002102223650004402244650002102288651001102309653002402320653001402344653002702358653002002385653001502405653000802420700002102428700002002449700002302469700002402492773009202516856009002608852000902698655001202707IND60733975920221121054812.0211227e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073397592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1305182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinci, Giovanni10aMolecular properties of the Humeome of two calcareous grassland soils as revealed by GC/qTOF-MS and NMR spectroscopy  aA Humeomic fractionation revealed the humus molecular composition of two uncropped calcareous soils of Northern France and differentiated the soils Humeome by extracting humic components first unbound to the organo-mineral matrix and then liberated from their progressively stronger intermolecular and intramolecular ester and ether linkages. We separated organo- (ORG1-3) and water-soluble (AQU2 and AQU4) fractions, a final extractable fraction (RESOM) and soil residues. Organo-soluble fractions were studied by GC coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC/qTOF-MS), all fractions underwent mono- and two-dimensional liquid-state NMR (except for the iron-rich AQU4 fraction), while solid-state ¹³C-CPMAS-NMR spectroscopy analyzed soil residues. The Calcaric Leptosol (A) showed a larger mass extraction than the Calcaric Cambisol (B), and a greater cumulative C and N content in its Humeome. Both soils showed the greatest weight yield for AQU4 fraction, followed by ORG2, RESOM, ORG1, AQU2, and ORG3. ORG2 was the most differentiating fraction between the two soils for both compound concentration and diversity, showing a larger C content for soil A than for soil B and a different distribution in aromatic compounds, fatty acids, and dicarboxylic acids. No significant differences between soils were found for ORG 3, suggesting similar processes of OM stabilization for its recalcitrant components, mostly hydrophobic esters of alkanoic, hydroxy, and aromatic acids with linear alkanols. We confirmed that Humeomic fractionation coupled to advanced analytical instrumentations enabled a detailed molecular characterization of the soil Humeome and differentiated between the two calcareous grassland soils and the other soils previously subjected to Humeomics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambisols 3aLeptosols 3achalk grasslands 3afractionation 3ahumus 3ahydrophobicity 3amass spectrometry 3anitrogen content 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3awater solubility 3aFrance 0aSoil organic matter 0aHumeomics 0aChemical fractionation 0aHumic molecules 0aGC/qTOF-MS 0aNMR1 aCangemi, Silvana1 aBridoux, Maxime1 aSpaccini, Riccardo1 aPiccolo, Alessandro0 tChemosphere.g2021 Sept., v. 279 p.130518-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1305183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01750naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010500161300001800266520059500284592002800879650001500907650001900922650001100941650004200952650001600994650002401010650001201034650002201046650001201068700001501080700001601095700001201111700001101123773011601134856008201250961002301332852000901355655001201364IND60579523520221120040349.0211117e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057952352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-017-3388-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, L.-P.10aMolecular characterization of a novel luteovirus from peach identified by high-throughput sequencing  ap. 2903-2905.  aContigs with sequence homologies to cherry-associated luteovirus were identified by high-throughput sequencing analysis in two peach accessions.

In this system, a CuS inner shell allows for the co-loading of doxorubicin (DOX) and indocyanine green (ICG) and induces photothermal effects, and a biodegradable MnO₂ external shell affords on-demand tumor microenvironment (TME)-triggered release and catalase- andFenton-like activities. Moreover, the HA modification endows the system with a CD44 receptor-mediated tumor-targeting property. The formulated DOX and ICG co-loaded CuS@MnO₂/HA (DOX/ICG-CuS@MnO₂/HA) NPs were found to exhibit excellent photothermal performance both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, DOX/ICG-CuS@MnO₂/HA NPs were found to display both TME and near-infrared (NIR)-responsive controlled release properties. The NPs also have a superior reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capacity due to the combination of enhanced ICG-induced singlet oxygen and CuS@MnO₂-mediated hydroxyl radicals. The cellular uptake, fluorescence imaging property, cytotoxicity, and thermal imaging of these NPs were also evaluated. In tumor-bearing mice, the DOX/ICG-CuS@MnO₂/HA NPs displayeda superior antitumor efficacy (2.57-fold) as compared with free DOX. Therefore, the developed DOX/ICG-CuS@MnO₂/HA NPs have a great potential for use as an all-in-one nanotherapeutic agent for the efficient and precise induction of chemo/photothermal/photodynamic/chemodynamic therapy with superior antitumor efficacy and fewer side effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3afluorescence 3ahyaluronic acid 3amanganese 3amanganese dioxide 3aneoplasms 3asinglet oxygen 3asulfides 0aNanoparticles 0aDelivery system 0aStimuli-responsive 0aPhotothermal performance 0aMultimodal synergistic treatment 0aHA 0aCuS@MnO2 NPs 0aCuS@MnO2/HA NPs 0aDOX 0aICG 0aNIR 0aDOX/ICG-CuS@MnO2/HA NPs 0aDOX/ICG-CuS NPs 0aTME 0aPDT 0aPTT 0aCDT 0aGSH 0aROS 0aDCF 0aMB 0aPAH 0aPVP-K30 0aSOSG 0aH&E 0aTUNEL1 aPan, Yuanjie1 aZhou, Jia1 aYi, Ge1 aHe, Cong1 aZhao, Ziming1 aZhang, Yanzhuo0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Jan., v. 605 p.296-310dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.07.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245015600166300001400322520162300336592002801959650001301987650002502000650001002025650001902035650001302054650001902067650001902086700002702105700001602132700001402148700001902162700001702181700001702198700002202215700002402237773009002261856008402351852000902435655001202444IND4480435920221119004941.0141112e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448043592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2011.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorcini, C.D.10aPre-freezing and post-thawing quality of boar sperm for distinct portions of the ejaculate and as a function of protein bands present in seminal plasma  ap. 28-33.  aThis study evaluated pre-freezing and post-thawing boar sperm quality in distinct portions of the ejaculates and identified protein bands potentially related to boar sperm tolerance to freezing. The sperm-rich portion of the ejaculate was fractioned in: the first 10mL (P1); and its remaining volume (P2). Those portions were frozen and the bands present in both portions were evaluated by one-dimensional electrophoresis. Inter- and intra-boar ANOVA evaluated how the presence of bands related to pre-freezing and post-thawing sperm motility and membrane integrity and to post-thawing acrosome integrity. Post-thawing sperm motility, membrane integrity and acrosome integrity were greater for P1 than for P2 (P<0.05). The presence of the 19kDa band was associated with improved pre-freezing sperm motility and membrane integrity, but with reduced post-thawing acrosome integrity (P<0.05). The presence of the 44kDa band was associated with reduced post-thawing sperm motility and acrosome integrity (P<0.05). Post-thawing acrosome integrity was enhanced when the 80kDa band were present (P<0.05). Reduced pre-freezing sperm membrane integrity and post-thawing sperm motility were associated to the presence of the 100kDa band (P<0.05). The presence of the 18kDa band in P2 was associated with reduction in both post-thawing sperm motility and membrane integrity (P<0.05), but such an effect was not observed in P1 (P>0.05). Thus, sperm from P1 presented greater tolerance to freezing than sperm from P2 and the 18, 19, 44, 65, 80 and 100kDa bands may be potential markers for boar sperm tolerance to cryopreservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrosome 3aanalysis of variance 3aboars 3acold tolerance 3afreezing 3aseminal plasma 3asperm motility1 aVarela, A.S., Jr.cJr.1 aPigozzo, R.1 aRambo, G.1 aGoularte, K.L.1 aCalderam, K.1 aLeon, P.M.M.1 aBongalhardo, D.C.1 aLucia, T., Jr.cJr.0 tLivestock science.g2012 May, v. 145, no. 1-3 p.28-33dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2011.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012700163300001600290500001500306520168700321592002802008650001002036650002202046650002402068650001902092650001602111650002302127650003102150650001202181650001402193650001102207650001602218650001802234650002202252650002402274650003002298650001902328650001602347650002102363650001302384650002802397650000802425653001002433653002202443700001702465700001802482700001202500700001202512700001502524700001902539773010702558856004802665852000902713655001202722IND50062073420221120130119.0130321e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006207342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-012-0476-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ying12aA Novel Wheat Related-to-Ubiquitin Gene TaRUB1 is Responsive to Pathogen Attack as Well as to Both Osmotic and Salt Stress  ap. 151-159.  a2019-12-06  aProtein modification by ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) is among the most complex and heavily investigated mechanisms of posttranslational protein regulation in eukaryotes. Moreover, Ub plays diverse roles in the regulation of numerous biological pathways. In this study, a suppression-subtractive hybridization cDNA library has been constructed using RNA isolated from leaves of the wheat line SN6306 inoculated with Blumeria graminis as the tester and RNA from non-inoculated leaves as the driver. Eighteen expressed sequence tags (ESTs) highly homologous with known proteins involved in disease resistance and defense reactions have been identified. Among these, a 648 bp EST with a high degree of sequence similarity in both nucleic and amino acid levels to other members of the gene family of plant related-to-ubiquitin (RUB) proteins has been selected, and its genomic sequence obtained. The cDNA sequence of this EST is interrupted by two introns at 111 and 1450 bp, with an open reading frame of 462 bp that encodes 153 amino acids. The predicated protein is a fusion protein of an ubiquitin-coding region and an RUB region. The newly screened gene, designated as TaRUB1 (GenBank Accession No. JF927719) belongs to the family of wheat RUB genes. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that TaRUB1 is upregulated in leaves infected with powdery mildew during early stages of infection. Furthermore, the overexpression of TaRUB1 in transgenic Arabidopsis showed that TaRUB1 enhances plant tolerance to both osmotic and salt stresses. This finding suggests that TaRUB1 has multiple functions in plant abiotic and biotic stress tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3awheat 3aBlumeria graminis 3aopen reading frames 3apowdery mildew 3aamino acids 3adisease resistance 3agene expression regulation 3aintrons 3apathogens 3aleaves 3aArabidopsis 3abiotic stress 3acomplementary DNA 3agene overexpression 3apolymerase chain reaction 3acDNA libraries 3asalt stress 3astress tolerance 3aproteins 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aRNA 0agenes 0aErysiphe graminis1 aFeng, Deshun1 aBao, Yinguang1 aMa, Xin1 aYin, Na1 aXu, Jinqiu1 aWang, Honggang0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2013 Feb., v. 31, no. 1 p.151-159dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-012-0476-9  aDNAL 7aarticle01866naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245006200171300001600233520090900249592002801158650001701186650001301203650001401216650002401230650000901254650001301263650001401276650001201290700002201302773012401324856008301448852000901531655001201540IND60624137320221122012642.0181201e199408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062413732DNAL7 a10.1177/01154265940090041512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, J.

This case report details our experience with a patient who had had a feeding gastrostomy tube in place for 2 years. She then developed continuous leakage around the area of the gastrostomy insertion site associated with pain and inability to tolerate feedings. Her gastrointestinal series revealed compression of the third portion of the duodenum with delayed emptying of the stomach and dilatation of the proximal duodenum. After resection of the necrotic gastrostomy site, takedown of the ligament of Treitz to free the fourth portion of the duodenum, and insertion of a feeding jejunostomy, the patient was again able to gain weight and tolerate her tube feedings. We present this as an unusual complication occurring in a tube-fed patient.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aduodenum 3aligaments 3amesenteric arteries 3apain 3apatients 3aresection 3astomach1 aCooney, Robert N.0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g1994 Aug., v. 9, no. 4 p.151-153dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x0884-53367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01154265940090041513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02068naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006300169300001400232520106200246592002801308650001701336650001901353650001101372650001301383650001501396653001701411653001901428653002301447653002001470653001701490700001901507773009701526856008601623852000901709655001201718IND60628429520221122214807.0190523e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062842952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2019.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColeman, M.A.10aMicroscopic assemblages in kelp forests and urchin barrens  ap. 66-71.  aKelp forests and urchin barrens are considered alternate stable states characterised by opposing structural and biological scales. Structurally diminutive urchin barrens that support microscopic taxa are considered biologically depauperate relative to macroscopic, structurally complex kelp forests. However, the extent to which this perception stems from the scale of sampling is unclear. Here, we match the scale of sampling to the scale of habitat by examining microscopic assemblages within barrens. We find that the diversity of microscopic taxa in barrens rivals that of kelp forests but is composed of diminutive and less “desirable” taxa such as ephemeral algae. Recruitment of kelp and foliose brown algae was extremely low in both habitats highlighting the role of episodic recruitment as well as physical and biological processes in structuring differences in assemblages between habitats. We contend that barrens are not biologically depauperate and the ephemeral taxa they support play an extant and emerging role in temperate reef ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeophyceae 3aaquatic plants 3abotany 3ahabitats 3amacroalgae 0aKelp forests 0aUrchin barrens 0aMicroscopic scales 0aEphemeral algae 0aBiodiversity1 aKennelly, S.J.0 tAquatic botany.g2019 Mar., v. 154 p.66-71dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2019.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010400165500002200269520174500291592002802036650001802064650002602082650003802108650001602146650001002162650001602172650001802188650001902206650001702225650001202242650002302254650001002277650000902287650003702296650001202333650001502345650002002360650002402380650002002404650002602424650003102450653001502481653001402496653000802510653001102518653000802529653000902537653002302546700002002569700002102589700002002610700005802630773008202688856008102770852000902851655001202860IND60585415620221120065903.0171109s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058541562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2017.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Tae Woo10aHyperlipidemia-induced hepassocin in the liver contributes to insulin resistance in skeletal muscle  aPre-press version  aHepassocin (HPS) has recently been identified as a novel hepatokine that causes hepatic steatosis. However, the role of HPS in the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle under obesity remains unclear. The effect of hyperlipidemia on hepatic HPS expression was evaluated in primary hepatocytes and liver of mice. HPS-mediated signal pathways were explored using small interfering (si) RNAs of specific genes or inhibitors. We found that treatment of primary hepatocytes with palmitate could induce HPS expression through C/EBPβ-mediated transcriptional activation. Furthermore, increased HPS expression was observed in the liver of high fat diet (HFD)-fed or tunicamycin-treated mice. Pretreatment with 4-phenylbutyrate (4-BPA) (an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor) and suppression of p38 by siRNA abrogated the effect of palmitate on HPS expression in primary hepatocytes. Treatment of differentiated C2C12 cells with recombinant HPS caused c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and impairment of insulin sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. siRNA-mediated suppression of JNK reduced the effect of HPS on insulin signaling. Furthermore, the suppression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by siRNA mitigated both HPS-induced JNK phosphorylation and insulin resistance. In addition, HPS did not affect inflammation and ER stress in differentiated C2C12 cells. In conclusion, we elucidated that ER stress induced by palmitate could increase the expression of HPS in hepatocytes and further contribute to the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle via EGFR/JNK-mediated pathway. Taken together, we suggest that HPS could be a therapeutic target for obesity-linked insulin resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3adose response 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3afatty liver 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3aliver 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aobesity 3apalmitates 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3askeletal muscle 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscriptional activation 0aHepassocin 0aER stress 0aJNK 0aERK1/2 0ap38 0aEGFR 0aInsulin resistance1 aChung, Yoon Hee1 aKim, Hyoung-Chun1 aEl-Aty, A.M.Abd1 aJeong, Ji Hoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8257-403X0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2017.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03528naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005400146245011400200300001800314500001900332520199000351592002802341650002402369650001402393650001402407650003002421650004902451650001302500650001202513650001102525650002302536650001102559650002802570650001302598700005602611700002202667700006002689700006102749700006002810773013502870856008003005852000903085655001203094IND60730588920221122001142.0210311e20210225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073058892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c010422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOda, Akira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0217-420210a¹⁷O-ESR Evidence for Zeolite Matrix Isolation of a Square Planar ZnO₃ Ring Radical with C₂ᵥ Symmetry  ap. 5136-5145.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAtomic-level insights into the geometric and electronic states of the metal–ozonide sequence remain scarce. We have recently found that a zeolite catalyst has a local environment to isolate the extremely rare mononuclear Znᴵᴵ–ozonide species. In the present study, each atomic oxygen radical of the Znᴵᴵ–ozonide species was selectively labeled with ¹⁷O, and each local environment was analyzed by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy at an X-band frequency, computer simulations of ESR spectra, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The two types of ¹⁷O hyperfine structures assignable to the C₂ᵥ geometry of a square planar ZnO₃ ring radical were obtained experimentally. The DFT calculations ascertained the ground-state C₂ᵥ geometry of the Znᴵᴵ–ozonide adduct. This model provides ¹⁷O-hyperfine coupling constants that correspond well with the experimental parameters, supporting the generation of the C₂ᵥ ZnO₃ ring radical. The C₂ᵥ ZnO₃ ring radical is stable even at around room temperature, as evidenced by the similarity in the ESR spectra collected at 300 and 4 K. Such an unusual stability was supported by AIMD simulations, where C₂ᵥ geometry was preserved at least for 50 ps at 300 K. Molecular orbital analyses showed that the ozonide species is stabilized via the highly polarized Znᴵᴵ–(O₃–·) bonds. These interactions led to the polarization of two O–O bonds in the ozonide adduct, through which both side oxygens becomes anionic states, but the central oxygen becomes a cationic state. The zeolite lattice plays a pivotal role in constraining the effective charge of Zn close to (+2) and thereby stabilizing such a highly polarized Znᴵᴵ–(O₃–·) bond. These novel findings suggest that the zeolite lattice has the potential as the ligand to create reactive metal–oxygen radicals with an unprecedented shape and ionic states.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acatalysts 3acomputers 3adensity functional theory 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ageometry 3aligands 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxygen 3areactive oxygen species 3azeolites1 aKumagai, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3851-97831 aSawabe, Kyōichi,1 aOhkubo, Takahiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5907-36831 aKuroda, Yasushige1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2958-12381 aSatsuma, Atsushi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6946-76780 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Feb. 25, v. 125, no. 9 p.5136-5145dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c010423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009900167300001800266520061700284592002800901650002300929650002300952650002100975650001500996650001201011650001601023650002301039650001301062650002101075653001701096653002101113653002201134653002201156653001301178700002001191700001901211700006401230700002101294773008201315856008101397852000901478655001201487IND60551378020221121010241.0161018e20140909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055137802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.04.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKopecky, Andrew10aSynthesis of bifunctional Ru complexes with 1,2-dithiolane and carboxylate-substituted ligands  ap. 6271-6275.  aAn N3-type, Ru heteroleptic complex, AK1, having one bipyridyl ligand modified with COOH groups for tethering to TiO2 and a second bipyridyl ligand modified with two lipoic acid units for binding to platinum, was synthesized.

In terms of this, nano zerovalent iron or iron nanoparticles based technology is found very promising. It is relatively cost-effective and easily adoptable as compare to others because it comprises considerable surface area, prominent reductive nature, elevated transportation ability & suitability for in-situ applications. In spite of this, nano zerovalent iron has some adverse effects on living organisms. Surface modification of nano zerovalent iron (iron nanoparticle) is an alternative approach to optimize and secure the remediation mediated by nano zerovalent iron. Surface modified nano zerovalent iron (iron nanoparticle) has shown enhanced stability and mobility as well as weakened agglomeration and environmental toxicity. This paper has summarized and argued about the recent developments in the surface modification (surface modification approaches) of iron nanoparticles its necessities and its positive or negative influences on living organisms. The paper also discusses about the toxicity of nano zerovalent iron (iron nanoparticle), probable mechanisms responsible for their toxicity and its influences on biotic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acost effectiveness 3aecotoxicology 3airon 3aremediation 3asurface area 3asustainable development 3atoxicity 3atransportation 0aNano zerovalent iron 0aSurface modification 0aSurface coating 0aReactive oxygen species1 aSinha, Alok0 tEnvironmental nanotechnology, monitoring & management.g2020 Dec., v. 14 p.100344-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23256x2215-15327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enmm.2020.1003443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009000168300001400258520167800272592002801950650002501978650001602003650001502019650001502034650001602049650001702065650002002082650002102102650002102123650002702144650001402171650002302185650001002208653002502218653001702243653001302260700002402273700001902297700002102316700002802337773010502365856008502470852000902555655001202564IND60560470820221118030619.0190403e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056047082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.12.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacedo, Nubia10aEffect of enrofloxacin on Haemophilus parasuis infection, disease and immune response  ap. 91-99.  aHaemophilus parasuis, the causative agent of Glasser’s disease, is a pathogen that colonizes the upper respiratory tract (URT) of pigs, invades the bloodstream and causes polyserositis. Because antimicrobials are highly effective against H. parasuis, we hypothesized that they could have a detrimental effect on the establishment of an immune response if given at the time of URT colonization. In this study, we characterized clinical outcomes and antibody and IFN-γ responses to H. parasuis in pigs treated with enrofloxacin before or after low dose inoculation with a pathogenic H. parasuis strain. Pigs that were only inoculated with the agent (EXP group) and pigs that were treated with enrofloxacin and then inoculated (ABT/EXP group) developed signs of disease starting at 4days post inoculation (DPI), presented a significant increase in serum IgG and were protected against a subsequent homologous challenge. In contrast, pigs treated with antibiotic after inoculation (EXP/ABT group) neither showed signs of disease nor seroconverted (IgG) after low dose inoculation. EXP/ABT pigs as well as naïve control pigs [enrofloxacin only (ABT) and challenge only (CHA)] were susceptible to challenge. Variable levels of antibodies in bronchioalveolar fluid and IFN-γ in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were observed after H. parasuis inoculation, but were not associated with protection. In summary, only pigs treated before low dose H. parasuis inoculation seroconverted and were protected against subsequent challenge. Results from this study can help determine timing of antimicrobial use and contribute to our current understanding of judicious antibiotic use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemophilus parasuis 3aantibiotics 3aantibodies 3ablood flow 3ablood serum 3aenrofloxacin 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterferon-gamma 3amononuclear leukocytes 3apathogens 3arespiratory system 3aswine 0aHaemophilus parasuis 0aEnrofloxacin 0aImmunity1 aCheeran, Maxim C.J.1 aRovira, Albert1 aHoltcamp, Andrew1 aTorremorell, Montserrat0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2017 Feb., v. 199 p.91-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.12.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100006600188245007700254500002200331506007600353520104800429592002801477506003701505650002301542650003301565650002001598650001001618650003501628650002401663650001201687650002401699650001401723650001701737650002401754650002901778653003501807653003301842653002401875653001501899653001801914653002401932700002201956773008201978856008102060852000902141655001202150IND60585415720221207115458.0171109s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058541572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2017.10.0152doi7 aPMC58128242pmcid7 a291025642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStamatiades, George A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9407-632610aGonadotropin regulation by pulsatile GnRH: Signaling and gene expression  aPre-press version  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe precise orchestration of hormonal regulation at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is essential for normal reproductive function and fertility. The pulsatile secretion of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates the synthesis and release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by pituitary gonadotropes. GnRH acts by binding to its high affinity seven-transmembrane receptor (GnRHR) on the cell surface of anterior pituitary gonadotropes. Different signaling cascades and transcriptional mechanisms are activated, depending on the variation in GnRH pulse frequency, to stimulate the synthesis and release of FSH and LH. While changes in GnRH pulse frequency may explain some of the differential regulation of FSH and LH, other factors, such as activin, inhibin and sex steroids, also contribute to gonadotropin production. In this review, we focus on the transcriptional regulation of the gonadotropin subunit genes and the signaling pathways activated by pulsatile GnRH.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanterior pituitary 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3agene expression 3agenes 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ahormonal regulation 3ainhibin 3aluteinizing hormone 3asecretion 3asex hormones 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 0aGonadotropin-releasing hormone 0aFollicle-stimulating hormone 0aLuteinizing hormone 0aG proteins 0aGnRH receptor 0aSignal transduction1 aKaiser, Ursula B.0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2017.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245010200153300001600255520126600271592002801537650001701565650001201582650001401594650002001608650001201628650001001640650001301650650002201663650002001685650001401705700001101719700001701730700001401747700001301761700001501774773012201789856007501911852000901986655001201995IND60535808620221120112930.0160805e20150106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053580862DNAL7 a10.1021/es50405742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yunbo10aPromotion Effect of H2 on Ethanol Oxidation and NOx Reduction with Ethanol over Ag/Al2O3 Catalyst  ap. 481-488.  aThe catalytic partial oxidation of ethanol and selective catalytic reduction of NOₓ with ethanol (ethanol–SCR) over Ag/Al₂O₃ were studied using synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization mass spectrometry (PIMS). The intermediates were identified by PIMS and their photoionization efficiency (PIE) spectra. The results indicate that H₂ promotes the partial oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde over Ag/Al₂O₃, while the simultaneously occurring processes of dehydration and dehydrogenation were inhibited. H₂ addition favors the formation of ammonia during ethanol–SCR over Ag/Al₂O₃, the occurrence of which creates an effective pathway for NOₓ reduction by direct reaction with NH₃. Simultaneously, the enhancement of the formation of ammonia benefits its reaction with surface enolic species, resulting in producing −NCO species again, leading to enhancement of ethanol–SCR over Ag/Al₂O₃ by H₂. Using VUV–PIMS, the reactive vinyloxy radical was observed in the gas phase during the NOₓ reduction by ethanol for the first time, particularly in the presence of H₂. Identification of such a reaction occurring in the gas phase may be crucial for understanding the reaction pathway of HC–SCR over Ag/Al₂O₃.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3adehydrogenation 3aethanol 3agases 3ahydrogen 3amass spectrometry 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxidation1 aLi, Yi1 aZhang, Xiuli1 aDeng, Hua1 aHe, Hong1 aLi, Yuyang0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Jan. 06, v. 49, no. 1 p.481-488dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes50405743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01458naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245021500165300001800380520029700398592002800695650002100723650002200744650001600766650001200782650001400794653004500808653003200853700002000885773015300905856007701058852000901135655001201144IND60521697920221120130724.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052169792DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1983-12212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoßmehl, Gerhard10aFlüssig-kristalline Verbindungen aus der Thiophenreihe 1.

With respect to chemical composition, a decrease in the concentration of anthocyanins, flavonols, vitisin-type pyranoanthocyanins, coutaric and caftaric acids and flavan-3-ols was observed. On the other hand, there was an increase in hydroxyphenyl-type pyranoanthocyanins and caffeic and p-coumaric acids. Aging affected to the color intensity following a similar pattern in all wines: a slight decrease during the first 12months followed by a greater decrease in color intensity to month 24. Sensory descriptive analysis showed that all the wines maintained their initial characteristics until the year of storage. Significant differences regarding the initial organoleptic characteristics of the wines were found after 24months of storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastilla 3aanthocyanins 3acaftaric acid 3achemical composition 3acolor 3acultivars 3aextinction 3aflavanols 3aflavonols 3agrapes 3ap-coumaric acid 3apolyphenols 3ared wines 3asensory properties 3atemperature 0aMinority grape varieties 0aEvolution 0aWine analysis 0aPhenolic content 0aColor 0aSensory analysis1 aGómez García-Carpintero, E.1 aSánchez-Palomo, E.1 aGonzález Viñas, M.A.1 aHermosín-Gutiérrez, I.0 tFood research international.g2013 May, v. 51, no. 2 p.554-563dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2013.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245013200212520169700344592002802041650001202069650001402081650002002095650001802115650001502133650001702148650001302165650001302178650001902191651001302210651001402223653002902237653002102266653003202287653003102319700005802350700001902408700005502427700001802482700002102500700002302521700002002544700002102564700002902585773009702614856008402711852000902795655001202804IND60676815620221119022716.0200318e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067681562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cliser.2019.1001372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBouroncle, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5912-516112aA systematic approach to assess climate information products applied to agriculture and food security in Guatemala and Colombia  aIncreased interannual climate variability affects agricultural livelihoods throughout the world. In many regions, climate services support decision-makers in their adaptation efforts. The range of these services and the number of associated information products have increased dramatically in recent years. However, the relationships between these products and their use and usability for targeted decision-making have rarely been systematically evaluated. Here, we report on the development of a systematic and user-centered approach to assess climate information products and networks of products; and apply it to products covering the nexus of climate, agriculture, and food security in Guatemala and Colombia. Across both countries, we assessed 28 products used for agricultural decision making, outreach, planning research, and design of emergency responses. While climate-only information products play a central role in each network, information products intended to support agriculture and food security need to integrate information from different themes or disciplines and sources at different scales. We find that major improvements in the credibility, legitimacy, scale, cognition, procedures, recommendations, and content of most existing products are required. Brevity and clarity of language are highlighted as desirable in both countries, as well as use of trusted and publicly-available data, and non-paper-based delivery formats. The approach and methodology are valuable for facilitating the prioritization of actions for improvement and/or the development of new products, thereby helping climate services for agriculture and food security to realize their true potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acognition 3adecision making 3afood security 3alivelihood 3anew products 3aoutreach 3aplanning 3aprioritization 3aColombia 3aGuatemala 0aUser-centered assessment 0aNetwork analysis 0aClimate services assessment 0aClimate services usability1 aMüller, Anna,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3120-85601 aGiraldo, Diana1 aRios, Dave,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2349-22851 aImbach, Pablo1 aGirón, Estuardo1 aPortillo, Fernando1 aBoni, Alejandra1 avan Etten, Jacob1 aRamirez-Villegas, Julian0 tClimate services.g2019 Dec., v. 16 p.100137-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23241x2405-88077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cliser.2019.1001373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01655naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245007200168300001600240520065200256592002800908650002500936650002200961650001900983650001301002650001301015650001201028700001901040700002501059700001801084700002101102773010401123856008101227852000901308655001201317IND4468975320221119005133.0141111e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446897532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2011.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPathare, Pankaj B.10aProduction of granola breakfast cereal by fluidised bed granulation  ap. 549-554.  aIn the fluidised bed granulation process the effect of nozzle air pressure and binder spray rate on key aggregate quality attributes were studied.

The nine combinations of leaf shape and color were obtained by crossing Okra Leaf ‘Stoneville 7A’ BC₄ with Red Leaf Stoneville 7A BC₄ and then selecting the various leaf shapes and color combinations within the F₂ population. Okra Leaf (L° L°) was associated with low incidence of boll rot, number of vegetative branches, node number of first-fruiting branch, dry weight of vegetative parts, leaf area, and with a shorter plant compared with normal leaf type. Okra Leaf also resulted in earlier maturity, higher harvest index, and higher seed cotton yield compared with normal leaf cotton. Okra Leaf had no effect on fiber length or fiber length uniformity, but caused a slight reduction in fineness and a slight increase in fiber strength. The homozygous red color resulted in a significant reduction in seed cotton yield in an experiment with 45-cm spacing within the row. There were no significant interactions between leaf shape and leaf color. All measurements for intermediate (heterozygous) leaf shape were between the values found for Okra Leaf and normal leaf cotton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 3afield crops1 aWeaver, Judith B.,0 tCrop science.g1972 May, v. 12, no. 3 p.317-320dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1972.0011183X001200030018x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03204naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245014000168300002000308520184600328592002802174650001502202650002102217650002102238650001502259650001502274650002202289650003302311650001302344650001502357650001602372650002402388650001702412650001502429650002302444650001602467700002102483700001902504700002002523773014402543856007402687852000902761655001202770IND60671191820221118174347.0191002e20150811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067119182DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta05162b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarce Thomann, Fernando10aHygrothermal simulation-informed design of mesoporous desiccants for optimised energy efficiency of mixed mode air conditioning systems  ap. 17290-17303.  aThis paper describes an optimization technique using hygrothermal numerical modelling to determine an ideal and unknown isotherm in order to inform the design of optimised mesoporous desiccants. Their suitability for passive humidity buffering as well as their impact on energy efficiency was assessed when assisting a mixed mode air-conditioning (AC) system. Three clear stages of water vapour adsorption were found that strongly correspond to the Δw gradient when assessing the kinetics of adsorption and exchange rates for periodic moisture loads. Consistent agreement was found between the latent heat of dehumidification used by the AC system and the desiccant decay time after successive sorption loop cycles. This confirmed the material's suitability for specific applications and was found to be highly sensitive to the portion of the isotherm between φᵢ,L − φᵢ,U (Δw gradient), compared with full adsorption capacity (total w) when assessing total energy consumption. The experimental results of sorption kinetics appeared to be slightly underestimated between the Δw gradient and the response time to reach equilibrium moisture content (EMC). The major underestimations were found to be consistent with the kinetics of adsorption/desorption when analysing their significance based on w differences. These were largely attributed to a combination of adsorption kinetics (time-response) and adsorption/desorption hysteresis. However, this was not evident when comparing long-term experimental data and numerical estimations for water vapour sorption isotherms, since numerical model accurately predicted them. This suggests that both adsorption kinetics and the scanning curve prediction, within a hysteresis loop, are not accurately represented by current hygrothermal models and are hence a priority for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair conditioning 3adehumidification 3adesiccants 3adesorption 3aenergy efficiency 3aequilibrium moisture content 3ahumidity 3ahysteresis 3alatent heat 3amathematical models 3aporous media 3aprediction 3asorption isotherms 3awater vapor1 aHall, Matthew R.1 aMokaya, Robert1 aStevens, Lee A.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Aug. 11, v. 3, no. 33 p.17290-17303dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta05162b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245018700165300001600352520145800368592002801826650001601854650001201870650001501882650001701897650001501914650002201929650001701951650002101968650002301989650001702012650001302029653002002042653002402062653001502086653001602101653000702117700001302124700001602137700001702153700001802170773012202188856008302310852000902393655001202402IND60745959920221119202847.0211129e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074595992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.07.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYing, Qingji12aA comparative study of the dichloromethane catalytic combustion over ruthenium-based catalysts: Unveiling the roles of acid types in dissociative adsorption and by-products formation  ap. 537-546.  aHerein, a comparative investigation of the Ru-based catalysts with different kinds of supports (TiO₂, Al₂O₃, HZSM-5 SiO₂/Al₂O₃ = 27 and 130, respectively) for catalytic combustion of dichloromethane (DCM) has been performed. The characterization results showed that the C–Cl bond of DCM was cleaved on both the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites of the catalysts. However, the Lewis acid sites were more active than the Brønsted acid sites. The relatively strong Lewis acidity of Ru/TiO₂ improved the dissociative adsorption of DCM, accounting for its superior activity. The yield of toxic by-products was strongly associated with the acid types of the catalysts. The Cl species deposited on TiO₂ and Al₂O₃ supports interacted strongly with the Lewis acid sites, thereby promoting the electrophilic chlorination reactions and yielding more polychlorinated by-products, especially highly toxic dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). However, the Cl deposits on Ru/HZSM-5 (SiO₂/Al₂O₃ = 27) with abundant Brønsted acid sites, mainly existed as hydrogen-bonded Cl species, with good mobility and less propensity for chlorinating carbonaceous matter. Moreover, Ru/HZSM-5 (SiO₂/Al₂O₃ = 130) yielded the highest polychlorinated by-products and PCDD/Fs because of its poor redox ability and high surface area. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the CVOCs catalytic combustion catalysts development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aacidity 3aadsorption 3achlorination 3acombustion 3acomparative study 3adibenzofuran 3ahydrogen bonding 3amethylene chloride 3asurface area 3atoxicity 0aDichloromethane 0aCatalytic oxidation 0aAcid sites 0aBy-products 0aRu1 aLiu, Yue1 aLi, Haoyang1 aZhang, Yaoyu1 aWu, Zhongbiao0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Jan., v. 605 p.537-546dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.07.0953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245010800162520142700270592002801697650002401725650001401749650001601763650003501779650001201814650001601826650002201842650001901864650002301883650001701906650001001923650002401933650001401957650001701971650002101988650001902009650002202028650001302050650002402063650001302087700001902100700002402119700002202143700002902165773012402194856007802318852000902396655001202405IND60702316620221119194740.0200717e20200510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070231662DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox90504052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeli, Rosaria 10aOxidative Stress and BPA Toxicity: An Antioxidant Approach for Male and Female Reproductive Dysfunction  aBisphenol A (BPA) is a non-persistent anthropic and environmentally ubiquitous compound widely employed and detected in many consumer products and food items; thus, human exposure is prolonged. Over the last ten years, many studies have examined the underlying molecular mechanisms of BPA toxicity and revealed links among BPA-induced oxidative stress, male and female reproductive defects, and human disease. Because of its hormone-like feature, BPA shows tissue effects on specific hormone receptors in target cells, triggering noxious cellular responses associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. As a metabolic and endocrine disruptor, BPA impairs redox homeostasis via the increase of oxidative mediators and the reduction of antioxidant enzymes, causing mitochondrial dysfunction, alteration in cell signaling pathways, and induction of apoptosis. This review aims to examine the scenery of the current BPA literature on understanding how the induction of oxidative stress can be considered the “fil rouge” of BPA’s toxic mechanisms of action with pleiotropic outcomes on reproduction. Here, we focus on the protective effects of five classes of antioxidants—vitamins and co-factors, natural products (herbals and phytochemicals), melatonin, selenium, and methyl donors (used alone or in combination)—that have been found useful to counteract BPA toxicity in male and female reproductive functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aapoptosis 3abisphenol A 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3afemales 3ahomeostasis 3ahormone receptors 3ahuman diseases 3ahuman reproduction 3ainflammation 3amales 3amechanism of action 3amelatonin 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3aphytochemicals 3aprotective effect 3aselenium 3asignal transduction 3atoxicity1 aMonnolo, Anna 1 aAnnunziata, Chiara 1 aPirozzi, Claudio 1 aFerrante, Maria  Carmela0 tAntioxidants.g2020 May 10, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90504053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009300176300001600269500001900285520155800304536006801862592002801930596001301958650001901971650002801990650002202018650001102040650001402051650002102065650001602086650001702102650002002119653003102139653001602170653002002186700002402206773013002230856008502360852000902445655001202454IND60722369820221122154211.0210101e20210126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072236982DNAL7 a10.1080/15435075.2020.18315102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhanmohammadi, Saber10aTheoretical assessment of a solar still system equipped with Nano-phase change materials  ap. 111-127.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRegarding water scarcity in recent decades, solar stills due to their environmental compatibility and economic viability received more attention. Through the current study, the performance of weir-type cascade solar still equipped with different phase change materials (PCMs) especially Nano-PCMs is evaluated. The utilized phase change materials are Stearic acid, Paraffin, and some kinds of PCMs that are enhanced with Nanoparticles of different materials. The Nano-enhanced PCMs are consisted of nePCM I (Paraffin+, nePCM II (Paraffin+CuO), and nePCM III (Paraffin+GO). The novelty of the present work can be attributed to the exegetic and energetic analysis of cascade solar still equipped with Nano-enhanced PCM as well as investigating the effects of climatic parameters on the performance of the system. Regarding the results, in brackish water mass flow rate of 0.07 and 0.4 kg/(m².min), the system equipped with nePCM II has the energy and exergy efficiencies of 63.55, 6.4181, 56.79%, and 5.387, respectively. Moreover, for the mass flow rate of 0.2 and 0.3 kg/(m².min) the nePCM I show higher energy efficiency compared to others. The maximum distilled water production belongs to nePCM II in the mass flow rate of 0.07 kg/(m².min), which is 9.28 kg/(m².hr). Besides, the results showed that at the ambient temperatures lower than 29°C, the system equipped with Stearic acid has better performance from an energetic and exergetic point of view. Finally, the best Azimuth angles for the system in the presence of different PCMs presented.  aThis work was supported by the University of Kashan [168772/3].  aPublisher supplied data  a168772/3 3abrackish water 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy efficiency 3aexergy 3amass flow 3aphase transition 3asolar still 3astearic acid 3awater shortages 0aNano phase change material 0afresh water 0aexergy analysis1 aSabzpooshani, Majid0 tInternational journal of green energy.g2021 Jan. 26, v. 18, no. 2 p.111-127dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2181x1543-50837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2020.18315103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245011000154520127400264592002801538650003001566650002501596650002401621650001401645650001201659650001101671650001701682650001701699650001001716650001401726650001401740650002201754650001201776650002801788650001501816650001701831650003201848651001001880700002401890700001901914700002001933773011801953856007202071852000902143655001202152IND60648844420221120055819.0190701e20180525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064884442DNAL7 a10.3390/f90602952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInoue, Akio10aAllometric Equations for Predicting Culm Surface Area of Three Bamboo Species (<i>Phyllostachys</i> spp.)  aIt is strongly debated whether bamboo forest ecosystems are a carbon sink or a carbon source because of insufficient knowledge regarding carbon loss via CO<inf>2</inf> emissions from these forests. The surface area (S) of bamboo culms (stems) is important for estimating culm respiration, a major component of carbon cycling in bamboo forests. However, few studies have attempted to formulate predictive equations for S. In this study, we developed allometric equations for predicting S in three bamboo species grown in Kyushu Island, western Japan: Phyllostachys pubescens Mazel ex Houz., P. bambusoides Sieb. et Zucc. and P. nigra var. henonis. We used a power equation between S and diameter at breast height (D) and a linear equation between S and D &times; total culm length (H). The results indicated that P. bambusoides and P. nigra shared common site-independent equations. In contrast, P. pubescens required species-specific equations due to interspecific variation in culm slenderness and tapering. We also found that D was a better predictive variable than DH when quantifying S because of its satisfactory predictive performance and simplicity. These findings will be beneficial for evaluating the contribution of bamboo forest ecosystems to carbon cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyllostachys bambusoides 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3aPhyllostachys nigra 3aallometry 3abamboos 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon sinks 3aculms 3aemissions 3aequations 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3ainterspecific variation 3aprediction 3asurface area 3atree and stand measurements 3aJapan1 aMiyazawa, Yoshiyuki1 aSato, Motohiro1 aShima, Hiroyuki0 tForests.g2018 May 25, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f90602953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245012900163300001600292520184900308592002802157650001802185650001502203650001102218650001002229650001002239650001002249650001902259700001702278700001702295773009102312856004802403852000902451655001202460IND4479046720221120130204.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447904672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-011-0175-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshizawa, J.10aDecision-making conditions for intra- or inter-nest mating of winged males in the male-dimorphic ant Cardiocondyla minutior   ap. 531-538.  aOnly winged male and female ants generally mate through nuptial flight during the reproductive season. In the ants of Cardiocondyla, the males show wing dimorphism and their reproductive strategies differ depending on the differences in wing morphology. It has been suggested that wingless “ergatoid” males bearing very similar external morphologies to workers mate within natal nests, whereas winged males bearing typical ant male morphology disperse from their nests to mate. However, some behavioral observations suggest that the winged males of some Cardiocondyla ants such as C. obscurior and C. minutior may mate within natal nests before dispersion. We evaluated the factors affecting the mating behaviors of the winged males of C. minutior under laboratory conditions. We found that (1) the winged males remained and mated with virgin females in natal nests when either virgin winged females or the relatively mature pupae of winged females (i.e., at least 10 days) were present in the nest, (2) the winged males dispersed to adjacent nests with virgin winged females when only mated queens and the relatively young pupae of winged females (i.e., <9 days) were present in the nest, and (3) all winged males were accepted by the workers of non-natal nests irrespective of the distance from the natal nests in the field. Although most ergatoid males were accepted by the workers of close non-natal nests, they were all attacked and killed by the workers of distant non-natal nests. These results suggest that intra-nest mating and the dispersion of the winged males of C. minutior are facultatively determined by the condition of winged females (virginity and relative pupal age) in natal nests. Furthermore, our results suggest that winged males are likely to seek mating partners chemically and to mate with virgin winged females.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCardiocondyla 3adimorphism 3aflight 3amales 3anests 3apupae 3avirgin females1 aYamauchi, K.1 aTsuchida, K.0 tInsectes sociaux.g2011 Nov., v. 58, no. 4 p.531-538dSpringer-Verlagx0020-18127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00040-011-0175-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011400172300001600286520158100302592002801883650001101911650001001922650001301932650001701945650001901962650002501981650001502006650002002021650001102041650001302052650001502065650002002080650001402100650001002114650001502124651001202139651001102151651001102162651001602173651001102189653001702200653001802217653001902235653002202254653002402276653002002300700002102320700001902341700002602360773011602386856008502502852000902587655001202596IND60560469720221118030557.0190403e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056046972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2016.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuuluvainen, Timo10aNorth Fennoscandian mountain forests: History, composition, disturbance dynamics and the unpredictable future  ap. 140-149.  aNorth Fennoscandian mountain forests are distributed along the Scandes Mountains between Sweden and Norway, and the low-mountain regions of northern Norway, Sweden and Finland, and the adjacent northwestern Russia. Regionally, these forests are differentiated into spruce, pine or birch dominance due to climatic differences. Variation in tree species dominance within these regions is generally caused by a combination of historical and prevailing disturbance regimes, including both chronic and episodic disturbances, their magnitude and frequency, as well as differences in edaphic conditions and topography. Because of their remoteness, slow growth and restrictions of use, these mountain forests are generally less affected by human utilization than more productive and easily utilizable forests at lower elevations and/or latitudes. As a consequence, these northern forests of Europe are often referred to as “Europe’s last wilderness”, even if human influence of varying intensity has been ubiquitous through historical time. Because of their naturalness, the North Fennoscandian mountain forests are of paramount importance for biodiversity conservation, monitoring of ecosystem change and for their sociocultural values. As such, they also provide unique reference areas for basic and applied research, and for developing methods of forest conservation, restoration and ecosystem-based management for the entire Fennoscandia. However, the current rapid change in climate is predicted to profoundly affect the ecology and dynamics of these forests in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aPicea 3aaltitude 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aecosystem management 3aecosystems 3aedaphic factors 3ahumans 3alatitude 3amonitoring 3amontane forests 3amountains 3atrees 3awilderness 3aFinland 3aNorway 3aRussia 3aScandinavia 3aSweden 0aBiodiversity 0aBoreal forest 0aClimate change 0aCultural heritage 0aNatural disturbance 0aNorthern Europe1 aHofgaard, Annika1 aAakala, Tuomas1 aGunnar Jonsson, Bengt0 tForest ecology and management.g2017 Feb. 01, v. 385 p.140-149dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2016.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01187naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245006000171300001400231520035700245592002800602650002300630650002000653650001200673650002300685773012200708856008200830852000900912655001200921IND60624136420221122032230.0181201e199404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062413642DNAL7 a10.1177/0115426594009002582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatarese, Laura E.10aRationale and Efficacy of Specialized Enteral Nutrition  ap. 58-64.  aEnteral nutrition, whenever feasible, is the preferred route of nutrition support.

Oxysterols are also known to be ligands for the RAR-related orphan receptors, involved in normal T cell differentiation. However, increasing evidence supports a role for oxysterols in the progression of several diseases. Here, we review recent developments in oxysterol research, highlighting the biological functions that oxysterols exert through their target nuclear receptors: the liver X receptors, estrogen receptors, RAR-related orphan receptors and the glucocorticoid receptor. We also bring the regulation of the immune system into the context of interaction between oxysterols and nuclear receptors, discussing the effect of such interaction on the pro-inflammatory function of macrophages and the development of T cells. Finally, we examine the impact that oxysterols have on various disease models, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis, stressing the role of nuclear receptors if previously identified. This review underscores the need to consider the multifaceted roles of oxysterols in terms of multiple receptor engagements and selective modulation of these receptors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aT-lymphocytes 3aatherosclerosis 3acell differentiation 3acholesterol metabolism 3adisease models 3aestrogen receptors 3aglucocorticoid receptors 3aligands 3aliver 3amacrophages 3aneoplasms 3aoxysterols 0aCholesterol 0aOxysterol 0a27-Hydroxycholesterol 0aEstrogen receptor 0aLiver x receptor 0aBreast cancer 0aSelective estrogen receptor modulator 0aSelective nuclear receptor modulator1 aNelson, Erik R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8887-19050 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 484 p.42-51dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2019.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006900165300001800234520145200252592002801704650004301732650002101775650002601796650002101822650002101843650001501864650005201879650001301931650003801944650001301982650001301995650000802008650001402016650002002030700002502050700002102075700001702096700001902113700002402132700001702156700002102173700002002194700001902214700001802233700002002251700002202271700002602293700002302319773011602342856008202458852000902540655001202549IND60579522420221120040353.0211117e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057952242DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-017-3395-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCattoir, Lien10aHepatitis E virus serology and PCR: does the methodology matter?  ap. 2625-2632.  aHepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 is an emerging pathogen in the developed world. As the clinical manifestations and routine laboratory parameters are often nonspecific, accurate diagnostic tests are crucial. In the current study, the performance of six serological assays and three PCR assays for the detection of HEV was evaluated. In the setting of the Ghent University Hospital, patients with clinically suspected HEV infection were tested for the presence of HEV IgM and IgG as well as HEV RNA. Serology was performed using six commercial HEV ELISA assays: Biorex, Wantai and Mikrogen IgM and IgG. HEV RNA was detected using one commercial assay (Altona RealStar®), and two optimized in-house real-time RT-PCR assays (according to Jothikumar et al., 2006 and Gyarmati et al., 2007). In addition, all three PCR assays were performed on 16 external quality control (EQC) samples. In a period of 39 months (January 2011-April 2014), 70 patients were enrolled. Using different ELISA assays, the prevalence of antibodies varied from 5.7% to 14.3% for HEV IgM and from 15.7% to 20.0% for IgG. All but two of the results of the PCR assays performed on clinical samples agreed. However, 10 out of 16 EQC samples results showed major discrepancies. We observed important differences in the performance of various serological and PCR assays. For this reason, results of both serological and molecular tests for HEV should be interpreted with caution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aOrthohepevirus A 3adiagnostic techniques 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aantibodies 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aserology 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenotype 3apatients 3aRNA 3apathogens 3aquality control1 aVan Hoecke, Frederik1 aVan Maerken, Tom1 aNys, Eveline1 aRyckaert, Inge1 aDe Boulle, Matthias1 aGeerts, Anja1 aVerhelst, Xavier1 aColle, Isabelle1 aHutse, Veronik1 aSuin, Vanessa1 aWautier, Magali1 aVan Gucht, Steven1 aVan Vlierberghe, Hans1 aPadalko, Elizaveta0 tArchives of virology.g2017 Sept., v. 162, no. 9 p.2625-2632dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-017-3395-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245010900181300001400290520182300304592002802127650001602155650001402171650001702185650001202202650002002214650001802234650001802252650002802270650001802298650001802316650001802334650001602352650002302368650002202391653001702413653001902430653002102449653003102470653005102501700002102552700002302573700002302596773011502619856008602734852000902820655001202829IND60112555520221122103029.0190410e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011255552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2012.11.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRincón-Cardona, Jaime A.10aPolymorphic behavior during isothermal crystallization of high stearic high oleic sunflower oil stearins  ap. 86-97.  aThe polymorphic phases of two high stearic high oleic (HSHO) sunflower oil stearins obtained by dry and solvent fractionation of the oil with the aim of use them as trans fat replacers or cocoa butter equivalent were studied by performing in situ isothermal crystallization studies following the appearance of polymorphic forms by X-ray using synchrotron radiation. Thermal behavior, equilibrium and actual isothermal solid fat content and morphology of phases were also analyzed. Three polymorphic forms were observed when samples were crystallized at 10°C/min to different crystallization temperatures (Tc): α, β'2, and β'1. The α form was the first polymorph obtained at all temperatures used and in the opposite way expected, at most crystallization temperatures it did not disappear when β'2 or β'1 forms appeared. β'2 form crystallized below 16 or 23°C for soft and hard stearins, respectively. Above those temperatures, the obtained polymorph was the β'1 form. The β polymorphs were not obtained during the times selected for isothermal crystallization. However, β2 form appeared at least after 6h at Tc while after 48h of storage at 25°C the β1 polymorph was the main form. The β2 polymorphic form, which is required for chocolate manufacture, has a very short life and was isolated from β1 by applying cooling/reheating cycles. The β1 form was the most frequently observed. Therefore, processing conditions must be carefully controlled to obtain the desired polymorphic form during product manufacturing. This study provides full characterization and quantification of polymorphic phases of HSHO stearins in real time. Results from this study will help optimize processing conditions for the use of HSHO stearins in industrial applications as trans fat replacers and cocoa butter equivalents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3achocolate 3acocoa butter 3acooling 3acrystallization 3afat replacers 3afractionation 3aindustrial applications 3alipid content 3amanufacturing 3asunflower oil 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3atrans fatty acids 0aPolymorphism 0aMicrostructure 0aThermal behavior 0aIsothermal crystallization 0aHigh stearic high oleic sunflower oil stearins1 aMartini, Silvana1 aCandal, Roberto J.1 aHerrera, María L.0 tFood research international.g2013 Apr., v. 51, no. 1 p.86-97dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2012.11.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245008600174520121100260592002801471650001701499650001501516650001501531650001601546650003101562650001301593650002001606650002201626650001901648650001101667650002301678653001901701653001601720653001501736700001201751700001501763700001501778700005301793700002101846700001601867700001701883773009201900856009001992852000902082655001202091IND60733975120221120082614.0211227e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073397512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1305042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaohong10aEffective removal of heavy metals from water using porous lignin-based adsorbents  aMultifunctional composite materials are the key to improving removal capacity and environmental utility. Here, the adsorbent (SLCA) was obtained by free-radical polymerization of acrylic acid with sodium lignosulfonate and citric acid. FTIR, SEM, TGA and XPS characterization methods were used to prove the structure and properties of SLCA adsorbents. The maximum uptake capacities of the optimized SLCA adsorbent is 276 mg g⁻¹ of Cu²⁺ and 323 mg g⁻¹ of Pb²⁺, respectively. The Langmuir isotherm and the second-order kinetic model were established to illustrate that the capture of Cu²⁺ and Pb²⁺ by the adsorbent belongs to chemisorption on the monolayer. XPS analysis confirmed that complexation and electrostatic attraction are the mechanism of pollutant removal. Not only that, as-resulting adsorbent revealed no significant adsorption cycle efficiency reduction even after 5 runs of sorption-desorption cycle, manifesting that it is of great stability and could be regarded as a promising candidate adsorbent. The purpose of this research was to develop a green lignin-based adsorbent with strong environmental protection and regeneration ability based on cheap polyacrylic resin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acitric acid 3aelectrostatic interactions 3akinetics 3alignosulfonates 3apollution control 3apolymerization 3asodium 3asorption isotherms 0aLignosulfonate 0aCitric acid 0aAdsorption1 aLi, Xin1 aPeng, Lili1 aHan, Shiqi1 aHao, Chen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9849-24181 aJiang, Chenglong1 aWang, Huili1 aFan, Xiangbo0 tChemosphere.g2021 Sept., v. 279 p.130504-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1305043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01414naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003100143245013800174300001800312520035700330592002800687650001100715650001100726650002300737650002000760653002700780653002200807700002200829700002300851773014000874856007701014852000901091655001201100IND60521696720221120233744.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052169672DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1983-12092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEisenmann, B.q(Brigitte),10aBa4Ga4S10, eine neue Verbindung mit einem Ga4S108- -Adamantankäfig / Ba4Ga4S10, a New Compound with an Adamantane Like Ga4S108- Cage  ap. 1581-1584.  aThe new compound Ba₄Ga₄S₁₀ crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group C2/c with the lattice constants: a = 1529.4(7) pm, b = 1479.3(7) pm, c = 858.0(5) pm, β = 106.04(5)°.

The Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii) density in a logging concession of Hulu Belantikan, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 878-883. The Bornean orangutan is currently categorized as a critically endangered species. It is found in natural forests in Borneo, where about 78% of the total population is found outside protected areas, of which 29% is in logging concessions. This study aimed to analyze the density of the orangutan population and the abundance of fruiting plants in a logging concession and Protection Forest (Hutan Lindung) in the Hulu Belantikan forests in Lamandau District, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Research and data collection was conducted between December 2013 to October 2014. Orangutan population density was calculated using line transect methodology based on nest counts. Abundance of fruit plants was calculated using the fruit trail method. The highest orangutan density, 4.8 individuals/km2, was found in Protection Forest; and the lowest density, 0.4 individuals/km2, was in [Sopanan] the 2013 logging block. Observations in the logging area indicated that selective logging could alter the structure and gap of the canopy and reduce the proportion of large trees. Changes in forest structure resulted in negative effects on the density of the orangutan population. The remaining degraded forests can still be a valuable resource for the orangutan. As long as the disturbance is not intensive, orangutans will retain access to the less disturbed forest nearby and to forests that are still connected to primary forests. The existence of Protection Forest and old logged-over forests around logging blocks are very important for conservation, providing refugia for orangutans and other species when logging occurs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorneo 3aPongo pygmaeus 3acanopy 3adata collection 3aendangered species 3aforest damage 3afruits 3anests 3apopulation density 3aprotection forests 3arefuge habitats 3aIndonesia1 aPERWITASARI-FARAJALLAH, DYAH1 aATMOKO, SRI SUCI UTAMI0 tBiodiversitas.g2019 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.878-883dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2003363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001200138245011500150520171400265592002801979650002502007650002502032650001302057650003002070650001102100650001902111650002302130650002302153650003002176650001102206650001302217650002102230650001502251650002202266650002002288650001602308650002502324651001002349700001702359700001702376700001602393700001402409700001202423700002002435700001702455773011802472856007202590852000902662655001202671IND60648844620221120070731.0190701e20180525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064884462DNAL7 a10.3390/f90602972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Fei10aSpatial Variation in Leaf Stable Carbon Isotope Composition of Three <i>Caragana</i> Species in Northern China  aLeaf stable carbon isotope (&delta;13C) composition provides comprehensive insight into plant carbon cycles and water use efficiency and has also been widely used to evaluate the response of plants to environmental change. In the present study, leaf &delta;13C was analyzed in samples of Caragana microphylla Lam., C. liouana Zhao, and C. korshinskii Kom. from 38 populations. These species provide great environmental benefits and economic value and are distributed east to west continuously across northern China. We studied the relationship of &delta;13C to altitude, mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual relative humidity (RH), leaf nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) concentrations to examine the patterns and controls of leaf &delta;13C variation in each species. Results indicated that, across the three species, leaf &delta;13C significantly decreased with MAP, RH, and leaf N and P concentrations, while it increased with altitude and MAT. However, patterns and environmental controls of leaf &delta;13C varied proportionally with species. C. korshinskii was mainly controlled by MAP and leaf N concentration, C. liouana was controlled by both MAT and MAP, and C. microphylla was mainly controlled by MAT. Further analysis indicated significant differences in leaf &delta;13C between species, which tended to increase from C. microphylla to C. korshinskii. Overall, these results suggest that the three Caragana species may respond differently to future climate change due to different controlling factors on leaf &delta;13C variation, as well as differentiation in water use efficiency, which likely contributes to the geographical distribution of these species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaragana korshinskii 3aCaragana microphylla 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystem services 3ageographical distribution 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3arelative humidity 3astable isotopes 3atemperature 3awater use efficiency 3aChina1 aLiang, Wenyu1 aZhou, Zhaona1 aXiao, Guoju1 aLiu, Jili1 aHe, Jun1 aJiao, Bingzhong1 aXu, Tingting0 tForests.g2018 May 25, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f90602973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01470naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010000167300001600267520030800283592002800591650001800619650001700637650001400654650001100668650001000679651002100689653001800710653001800728653001700746653002000763653001000783700001800793700002600811700002100837773013400858856008300992852000901075655001201084IND60544641320221118011710.0190417e20151230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054464132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japb.2015.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jinyoung10aDescription of immature stages of the genus Plagiosterna (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) from Korea  ap. 309-313.  aImmature stages of the genus Plagiosterna Motschulsky are described in detail for the first time in Korea.

In this work we analyzed whether these plasma biomarkers could reflect specific brain oxidation in AD. In this work lipid peroxidation compounds were determined in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from AD and non-AD (including other neurological pathologies) participants, by means of an analytical method based on liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis evaluated correlations between biological matrices. The results did not show satisfactory correlations between plasma and CSF samples for any of the studied lipid peroxidation biomarkers (isoprostanes, neuroprostanes, prostaglandines, dihomo-isoprostanes). However, some of the analytes showed correlations with specific CSF biomarkers for AD and with neuropsychological tests (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS)). In conclusion, lipid peroxidation biomarkers in CSF samples do not reflect their levels in plasma samples, and no significant differences were observed between participant groups. However, some of the analytes could be useful as cognitive decline biomarkers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3abiomarkers 3ablood plasma 3abrain 3acerebrospinal fluid 3acognitive disorders 3alipid peroxidation 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aneuropsychological tests 3aoxidation 3astatistical analysis1 aBaquero, Miguel 1 aLópez-Nogueroles, Marina 1 aVento, Máximo 1 aHervás, David 1 aCháfer-Pericás, Consuelo 0 tAntioxidants.g2020 May 10, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox90504073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011000170300001400280520174400294592002802038650002002066650001102086650003502097650002402132650001902156650000902175650001502184650001102199651001002210653001002220653003602230653002702266653001302293653001402306700001902320700001502339773009102354856008202445852000902527655001202536IND60547609820221122064536.0161027e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054760982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wace.2014.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaxak, Arun Kumar10aLong term spatial and temporal rainfall trends and homogeneity analysis in Wainganga basin, Central India  ap. 50-61.  aGridded rainfall data of 0.5×0.5° resolution (CRU TS 3.21) was analysed to study long term spatial and temporal trends on annual and seasonal scales in Wainganga river basin located in Central India during 1901–2012. After testing the presence of autocorrelation, Mann–Kendall (Modified Mann–Kendall) test was applied to non-auto correlated (auto correlated) series to detect the trends in rainfall data. Theil and Sen׳s slope estimator test was used for finding the magnitude of change over a time period. For detecting the most probable change year, Pettitt–Mann–Whitney test was applied. The Rainfall series was then divided into two partial duration series for finding changes in trends before and after the change year. Arc GIS was used to explore spatial patterns of the trends over the entire basin. Though most of the grid points shows a decreasing trend in annual rainfall, only seven grids has a significant decreasing trend during 1901–2012. On the basis of seasonal trend analysis, non-significant increasing trend is observed only in post monsoon season while seven grid points show significant decreasing trend in monsoon rainfall and non-significant in pre-monsoon and winter rainfall over the last 112 years. During the study period, overall a 8.45% decrease in annual rainfall is estimated. The most probable year of change was found to be 1948 in annual and monsoonal rainfall. There is an increasing rainfall trend in the basin during the period 1901–1948, which is reversed during the period 1949–2012 resulting in decreasing rainfall trend in the basin. Homogeneous trends in annual and seasonal rainfall over a grid points is exhibited in the basin by van Belle and Hughes׳ homogeneity trend test.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3abasins 3ageographic information systems 3ameteorological data 3amonsoon season 3arain 3awatersheds 3awinter 3aIndia 0aTrend 0aHomogeneity Mann–Kendall test 0aSen׳s slope estimator 0aRainfall 0aWainganga1 aMurumkar, A.R.1 aArya, D.S.0 tWeather and Climate Extremes.g2014 Aug., v. 4 p.50-61dElsevier B.V.x2212-09477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wace.2014.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001700161245010600178300001400284500000900298520184200307592002802149650001302177650003502190650002202225650002402247650002302271650001702294650002602311650001502337650003702352650001102389650002302400650001502423700001702438700002002455700001702475773011902492852000902611856009802620655001202718IND2047895720221119144115.0191122e199501  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204789572DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183X003500010011x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByrne, P. F.10aGains from Selection under Drought versus Multilocation Testing in Related Tropical Maize Populations  ap. 63-69.  aepub  aIdeal maize (Zea mays L.) cuitivars for tropical areas should yield well both in the presence and absence of drought, but optimal selection strategies for accomplishing this goal are not dear. This study evaluated progress from selection of two related tropical populations across a broad range of environmental conditions. ‘Tuxpeflo Sequia’ (TS) had undergone fuli-sib recurrent selection for eight cycles at one location under managed levels of drought stress, while ‘Tuxpefio 1’ (T1) was selected for six cycles in a modified full-sib selection scheme that relied heavily on muitilocation yield trial data. Combined over 12 environments (with mean yields ranging from 0.30−7.93 Mg ha⁻¹), regression analysis revealed significantly different rates of change per cycle for TS and T1, respectively, for grain yield (1.68 and 1.06%, P < 0.10), anthesis-siiking interval (ASI) (−8.59 and 0%, P < 0.10), ears per plant (1.26 and 0%, P < 0.05), and plant height (−0.83 and 1.29%, P < 0.01). Days to anthesis decreased in both TS and T1 (−0.36 and −0.15% per cycle, respectively), but the difference between populations was not significant at P < 0.10. The interaction of environments with the linear rate of gain in grain yield was not significant in either population, indicating similar progress across the range of environmental conditions sampled. Stability analysis indicated that TS Cycles 6 and 8 and the check variety ‘La Posta Sequia Best’ were the most stable and high yielding entries in the trial. Better yield gain in TS is likely related to its selection for reduced ASI under controlled stress at a single site. Selection under managed levels of drought stress at one location together with muitiiocation testing may be desirable components of maize breeding programs for drought-prone tropical areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3atropical and subtropical crops 3adrought tolerance 3agenetic improvement 3aselection criteria 3awater stress 3aenvironmental factors 3acrop yield 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrains 3aselection response 3apopulation1 aBolaños, J.1 aEdmeades, G.

In this study, we hypothesized that the biomass of cyanobacteria will be higher during the dry period and assessed toxic cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in the Argemiro de Figueiredo Reservoir (Paraíba, Brazil). We conducted 22 samplings between August 2007 and July 2009 at three sites (PC, confluence of tributaries; PNC, net cages; and PD, dam site). Significant seasonal and spatial differences were not observed for abiotic variables; however, reduction in pH, electrical conductivity, alkalinity, and dissolved oxygen occurred only during overflow events in the reservoir. Filamentous cyanobacteria were dominant mainly in the dry period, accounting for 90 % of the total biomass; six of eight dominant or co-dominant species of cyanobacteria were observed to be potential producers of toxins. Planktothrix agardhii (Gomont) Anagnostidis & Komárek was dominant at PC, PNC, and PD and formed perennial blooms, and microcystin-LR was identified in 14 of 16 blooming events. Thus, we suggest that stable conditions, availability of nutrients, and a reduced light regime during the dry period favors blooms of cyanobacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlanktothrix agardhii 3aalkalinity 3abiomass 3aclimatic factors 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectrical conductivity 3aeutrophication 3amicrocystin-LR 3anutrients 3apH 3aphotoperiod 3asemiarid zones 3atoxicity 3aBrazil1 aBarbosa, Luciana G.1 aMinillo, Alessandro1 aDe Ceballos, Beatriz S.

We proposed a vertical graphene nanosheets/p-Si photodetector by introducing edge quantum wells (QWs) as the electron trapping centers. A high responsivity has been achieved both in experiments and in time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Our research reveals that (i) the high density of edges makes the band gap of three-size complexes increase from 0.665 and 0.806 eV to 1.016 eV; (ii) empty edge states locate above lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs), providing unoccupied states for photoelectron transitions; (iii) exciton absorption peaks, corresponding to the transitions from Si p orbitals to the edge states of graphene nanosheets, exhibit a blue shift from 1581 to 790 nm with the increase in the density of edges from 31.25 to 58.33%; (iv) as the density of the edges increases, the experimental photoresponsivity increases from 3.66 A/W to 61.52 A/W, and the calculated relative oscillation resonance increases from 1 to 28%. The high density of edges that trap photoexcited electrons enhances the photoresponsivity. The principle clarified here lays the foundation for the edge quantum modulation of two-dimensional (2D) material applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adensity functional theory 3agraphene 3ananosheets1 aLiu, Liang1 aLin, Zezhou1 aZhang, Xi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2910-47731 aDiao, Dongfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7892-16410 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Feb. 24, v. 125, no. 9 p.5392-5398dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c001373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
