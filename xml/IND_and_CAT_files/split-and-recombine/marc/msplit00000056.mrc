Moreover, PKCα is considered one of the biomarkers for the diagnosis of cancers. In several human cancers, the claudin tight junction molecules are abnormally regulated and are thus promising molecular targets for diagnosis and therapy with Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE). In order to investigate the changes of tight junction functions of claudins via PKCα activation in pancreatic cancer cells, the well-differentiated human pancreatic cancer cell line HPAC, with its highly expressed tight junction molecules and well-developed barrier function, was treated with the PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). Treatment with TPA modified the activity of phosphoPKCα and caused an increase of the Snail family members Snail, Slug and Smad-interacting protein 1 and a decrease of E-cadherin. In HPAC cells treated with TPA, downregulation of claudin-1 and mislocalization of claudin-4 and occludin around the nuclei were observed, together with a decrease in the numbers of tight junction strands and an increase in phosphorylation of claudin-4. The barrier function and the cytotoxicity of CPE were significantly decreased on TPA treatment. All such changes after TPA treatment were prevented by inhibitors of panPKC and PKCα. These findings suggest that, in human pancreatic cancer cells, PKCα activation downregulates tight junction functions as a barrier and as a receptor of CPE via the modification of claudin-1 and −4 during epithelial to mesenchymal transition-like changes. PKCα inhibitors might represent potential therapeutic agents against human pancreatic cancer cells by use of CPE cytotoxicity via claudin-4.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium perfringens 3abiomarkers 3acytotoxicity 3ahumans 3aoccludins 3apancreatic neoplasms 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein kinase C 3asnails 3atherapeutics 3atight junctions 2aAnimals 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aClaudin-1 2aClaudin-4 2aClaudinsxmetabolism 2aClostridium perfringensxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDown-Regulation 2aEnterotoxinsxpharmacology 2aEnzyme Activation 2aHumans 2aMembrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aOccludin 2aPancreatic Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxenzymologyxgeneticsxpathology. 2aProtein Kinase C-alphaxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aTetradecanoylphorbol Acetatexpharmacology 2aTight Junctionsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aKojima, Takashi1 aIto, Tatsuya1 aYamaguchi, Hiroshi1 aTsujiwaki, Mitsuhiro1 aTakasawa, Akira1 aMurata, Masaki1 aTanaka, Satoshi1 aHirata, Koichi1 aSawada, Norimasa0 tCell and tissue research.g2011 Dec., v. 346, no. 3 p.369-381dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-011-1287-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03695naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002700155245016000182520197500342592002802317650001902345650002302364650002202387650001202409650001702421650002302438650003502461650001802496650000902514650001702523650001602540650001902556651001802575651001102593653003102604653002502635653001902660653002402679653002502703700002702728700002702755700004202782700002902824700002802853700003302881700006702914773009702981856009003078852000903168655001203177IND60786084020221120235850.0220824e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078608402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1066182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChico-Avelino, Mónica10aSynanthropic triatomines in Hidalgo state, Mexico: Spatial-temporal distribution, domestic transmission cycle, and natural infection with Trypanosoma cruzi  aTriatomine vectors are responsible for the main route of transmission of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. This illness is potentially life-threatening and highly disabling and represents a major public health concern in the endemic countries in Latin America. The analysis of the spatial and temporal occurrence of triatomine insects is critical, since control strategies strongly depend on the vector species found within each area. Such knowledge is non-existent in Hidalgo state, an endemic region of Chagas disease in Mexico. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to analyze broad-scale spatial and temporal patterns of synanthropic triatomines collected in Hidalgo. Data was taken from the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE) of Mexico and the state program of Vector Control of the Secretary of Health, covering the period of 1997–2019. Our analyses demonstrate a differential distribution of Triatoma dimidiata, T. mexicana, T. gerstaeckeri and T. barberi, which are the four predominant species, and that climate, temperature, and precipitation are some of the drivers of their distribution pattern. Notably, we report the presence of T. nitida, T. pallidipennis and T. phyllosoma for the first time in the state. In addition, we found seasonal variations of the populations of T. mexicana and T. gerstaeckeri, but not for T. dimidiata, whose population remains constant throughout the year. The insects were found mainly intradomicile (81.79%), followed by peridomicile (17.56%) and non-domestic areas (0.65%), with an average T. cruzi infection of 16.4%. Based on this evidence, priority sites for vector control intervention were identified. Our findings are very valuable for understanding the epidemiology of Chagas disease, the generation of future potential risk maps and for the development and implementation of effective and targeted vector control programs in Hidalgo state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aTriatoma dimidiata 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aclimate 3aepidemiology 3aetiological agents 3ageographic information systems 3apublic health 3arisk 3asynanthropes 3atemperature 3avector control 3aLatin America 3aMexico 0aEntomological surveillance 0aSpatial distribution 0aVector mapping 0aPopulation dynamics 0aVector-borne disease1 aLópez-Mejía, Adriana1 aRamos-Frías, Josefina1 aVillafuentes-Téllez, Héctor Alberto1 aMenchaca-Armenta, Imelda1 aMontoya-Ayala, Raymundo1 aMartínez-Calvillo, Santiago1 aManning-Cela, Rebeca G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5162-88130 tActa tropica.g2022 Oct., v. 234 p.106618-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1066183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245010800174300001600282520140500298592002801703650001801731650002201749650001601771650002001787651001201807651001601819653002601835653003301861653002001894653002801914653003501942700002001977700002301997700001802020773009802038856008902136852000902225655001202234IND60525730220221120042630.0190319e20161130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052573022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.05.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaufmann, Maria12aA game of give and take: The introduction of multi-layer (water) safety in the Netherlands and Flanders  ap. 277-286.  aAt the beginning of the 21st century, the Netherlands and Flanders introduced a risk-based approach to flood risk management (FRM), labelled as multi-layer (water) safety. In contrast to a flood defence approach, risk-based management stresses the need to manage both the consequences and probability of a flood. The concept has developed differently in the two countries, as we conclude from a discursive-institutionalist research perspective. The Netherlands is characterised by a high institutionalization of the traditional flood defence discourse and a more closed policy arrangement, whereas in Flanders, the flood defence discourse is less institutionalized and the arrangement is more open. In both countries we see an opening of the arrangement preceding the establishment of multi-layer (water) safety, but at the same time, actors stress different aspects of the concept in order to increase its compatibility with the existing policy arrangement. In the Netherlands, the focus is on probability management, in Flanders on consequence management. In the Netherlands, multi-layer (water) safety as a concept could be established because it stabilises the system in the short-term by reinforcing the importance of flood defence, whereas in Flanders, policymakers were receptive to the concept because it supports a shift of responsibility towards actors outside traditional water management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflood control 3aissues and policy 3aprobability 3arisk management 3aBelgium 3aNetherlands 0aFlood risk management 0aMulti-layered (water) safety 0aPolicy analysis 0aDiscourse structuration 0aDiscourse institutionalisation1 aMees, Hannelore1 aLiefferink, Duncan1 aCrabbé, Ann,0 tLand use policy.g2016 Nov. 30, v. 57 p.277-286dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.05.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02065naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011200165500002200277520086000299592002801159653002301187653003101210653001801241653002201259653002301281653003401304653001701338653002401355700002601379700002101405700001701426700002001443700003201463773010501495856008201600852000901682655001201691IND60566714020221118045550.0170627s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056671402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eimc.2017.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoure, Zaira10aEvaluation of the novel DiaSorin LIAISON®Campylobacter assay for the rapid detection of Campylobacter spp.  aPre-press version  aCampylobacter spp. infection is one of the leading causes of foodborne diarrhoeal illness in humans worldwide.

However, cohesins have a spectrum of cellular roles including sister chromatid cohesion, transcription, replication, and repair. Which of these roles are central to cancer biology and which roles can be exploited for therapeutic intervention? Genetic interaction networks in yeast have identified synthetic lethal interactions between mutations in cohesin and replication fork mediators. These interactions are conserved in worms and in human cells suggesting that inhibition of replication fork stability mediators such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) could result in the specific killing of tumors with cohesin mutations. These findings also highlight the utility of genetic interaction networks in model organisms for the identification of clinically relevant interactions. Here, we review this type of approach, emphasizing the power of synthetic lethal interactions to reveal new avenues for developing cancer therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD ADP-ribosyltransferase 3achromatids 3acohesion 3adrug therapy 3ahumans 3amutation 3aneoplasms 3ayeasts1 avan Pel, Derek M.1 aHieter, Philip0 tTrends in genetics.g2013 May, v. 29, no. 5 p.290-297dElsevier Ltdx0168-95257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2012.12.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245013200175300001800307520153200325592002801857650002601885650001301911650001701924650002601941650001701967650001901984650002602003650000902029650001102038650002902049650001802078650001402096650003102110650003702141700002002178700001702198700001802215700002002233700001602253700002102269700001902290700001702309773008702326856009002413852000902503655001202512IND60090351920221121003303.0141102e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009035192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Hyun-Jong10aSelf-assembled nanoparticles based on hyaluronic acid-ceramide (HA-CE) and Pluronic® for tumor-targeted delivery of docetaxel  ap. 7181-7190.  aHyaluronic acid-ceramide (HA-CE)-based self-assembled nanoparticles were developed for intravenous docetaxel (DCT) delivery. In this study, physicochemical properties, cellular uptake efficiency, and in vivo targeting capability of the nanoparticles developed were investigated. DCT-loaded nanoparticles composed of HA-CE and Pluronic 85 (P85) with a mean diameter of 110–140nm were prepared and their morphological shapes were assessed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). DCT release from nanoparticle was enhanced with increasing P85 concentrations in our in vitro model. Blank nanoparticles exhibited low cytotoxicity in U87-MG, MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cell lines. From cellular uptake studies, the nanoparticles developed enhanced the intracellular DCT uptake in the CD44-overexpressing cell line (MCF-7). The nanoparticles were shown to be taken up by the HA–CD44 interaction according to DCT and coumarin 6 (C6) cellular uptake studies. The multidrug resistance (MDR)-overcoming effects of DCT-loaded HA-CE/P85-based nanoparticles were also observed in cytotoxicity tests in MCF-7/ADR cells. Following the intravenous injection of DCT-loaded cyanine 5.5 (Cy5.5)-conjugated nanoparticles in MCF-7/ADR tumor-bearing mice, its in vivo targeting for CD44-overexpressing tumors was identified by non-invasive near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging. These results indicate that the HA-CE-based nanoparticles prepared may be a promising anti-cancer drug delivery system through passive and active tumor targeting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3acoumarin 3acytotoxicity 3adrug delivery systems 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3aintravenous injection 3amice 3amodels 3amultiple drug resistance 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3aphysicochemical properties 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aYoon, Hong Yeol1 aKoo, Heebeom1 aKo, Seung-Hak1 aShim, Jae-Seong1 aLee, Ju-Hee1 aKim, Kwangmeyung1 aChan Kwon, Ick1 aKim, Dae-Duk0 tBiomaterials.g2011 Oct., v. 32, no. 29 p.7181-7190dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245009300213520145700306592002801763650001801791650001201809650001601821650002901837650001901866650001701885650002101902650001701923650001101940650001501951650001601966651000901982653003201991653001602023653001002039653001402049653001202063700001702075700002002092773011902112856008802231852000902319655001202328IND60661527220221119075733.0211017e20200110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066152722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1340032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHipsher, Carissa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7902-532010aImpact of bloom events on dissolved organic matter fluorophore signatures in Ohio waters  aDue to the increase in severe cyanobacterial blooms in drinking water sources and recreational waters across the globe, inexpensive and reliable methods of detecting oncoming blooms are needed. Cyanobacterial blooms can contribute substantially to the bulk chromophoric dissolved organic matter pool. Thus, the fluorescence signature of organic matter derived from these blooms may be an indicator of upcoming blooms. Water samples from five sites around Ohio were collected regularly between February and October 2017. A PARAFAC model was developed to determine if these protein-like fluorophores could be linked to bloom biomass and whether they were absent in dissolved organic matter from oligotrophic waters. One reference site at an oligotrophic reservoir was included to confirm the lack of protein-like fluorophores in the absence of a bloom event. We found that an increase in tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like fluorophores occurs before the increase in chlorophyll a levels, associated with bloom biomass, in some Ohio waters affected by cyanobacterial blooms; however, protein-like fluorophores are not correlated with levels of the cyanotoxin, microcystin. The excitation and emission wavelengths of these fluorophores (tryptophan-like: 239/341 nm, tyrosine-like: 248/306 nm) may be used to monitor impending blooms in waters heavily impacted by cyanobacteria but may not be applicable to waters receiving treated wastewater discharges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3adissolved organic matter 3adrinking water 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3amicrocystins 3amodels 3awastewater 3awavelengths 3aOhio 0aOrganic matter fluorescence 0aMicrocystin 0aAlgae 0aLake Erie 0aProtein1 aBarker, Joel1 aMacKay, Allison0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Jan. 10, v. 699 p.134003-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1340033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010900167520176300276592002802039650001602067650002002083650001602103650000902119650000902128650001102137650002702148653002202175653003202197653003002229653001702259653001802276700001702294700001902311773012502330856008502455852000902540655001202549IND60718223420221122233036.0210124e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071822342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2020.1058782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiaoling10aTransfer learning and SE-ResNet152 networks-based for small-scale unbalanced fish species identification  aScientific studies on species identification in fish have considerable significance in aquatic ecosystems and quality evaluation. The morphological differences between different fish species are obvious. Machine learning methods use artificial prior knowledge to extract fish features, which is time-consuming, laborious, and subjective. Recently, deep learning-based identification of fish species has been widely used. However, fish species identification still faces many challenges due to the small scale of fish samples and the imbalance of the number of categories. For example, the model is prone to being overfitted, and the performance of the classifier is biased to the fish species of most samples. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a fish species identification approach based on SE-ResNet152 and class-balanced focal loss. First, visualization analysis and image preprocessing of fish datasets are carried out. Second, the SE-ResNet152 model is constructed as a generalized feature extractor and is migrated to the target dataset. Finally, we apply the class-balanced focal loss function to train the SE-ResNet152 model, and realize fish species identification on three fish image views (body, head, and scale). The proposed method was tested on the Fish-Pak public dataset and achieved 98.80%, 96.67%, and 91.25% accuracy on the three fish image views, respectively. To ensure the superior performance of the proposed method, we performed an experimental comparison with other methods involving SENet154, DenseNet121, ResNet18, ResNet152, VGG16, cross-entropy, and focal loss. Comprehensive empirical analyses reveal that the proposed method achieves good performance on the three fish image views and outperforms common methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3adata collection 3aelectronics 3afish 3ahead 3amodels 3aspecies identification 0aTransfer learning 0aFish species identification 0aClass-balanced focal loss 0aSE-ResNet152 0aDeep learning1 aLi, Wensheng1 aDuan, Qingling0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2021 Jan., v. 180 p.105878-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2020.1058783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006600166300001400232520150100246592002801747650001101775650001501786650001901801650002501820650002401845650000901869650001001878650002101888650002401909650001501933650001501948650002501963653001701988653002202005653002102027653001102048700001802059700001802077773011602095856008202211852000902293655001202302IND60654526520221120104832.0191118e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065452652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jvc.2019.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTreseder, J.R.10aInotropic and chronotropic effects of sotalol in healthy dogs  ap. 14-24.  aSotalol is an anti-arrhythmic drug commonly used for the treatment of pathologic tachyarrhythmias in dogs. The β-adrenergic blockade associated with sotalol administration may result in reduced myocardial contractility, which is clinically relevant for treating dogs with arrhythmias and concurrent myocardial dysfunction. The inotropic properties of sotalol are not well characterized in dogs.Ten healthy, adult, large breed dogs were prospectively enrolled. All dogs underwent physical examination, blood pressure measurement, electrocardiography, 24-h Holter monitoring, and echocardiography including three-dimensional left ventricular volume measurements. Dogs were subsequently administered sotalol (1–2 mg/kg) orally twice daily for 12–16 days, and the same diagnostic tests were performed. Paired statistical analysis was used to compare parameters at baseline and after treatment with sotalol.Standard echocardiographic parameters of systolic function were reduced on sotalol compared to baseline, including ejection fraction via Simpson's method of disks which was 5.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.77–8.83%, p = 0.002) lower post-treatment. Maximum heart rate on Holter monitor was 17 bpm (95% CI: 9–37 bpm, p = 0.002) lower post-treatment than at baseline.Sotalol has a mild negative inotropic effect in healthy dogs based on standard echocardiographic measurements. There is also a negative chronotropic effect at higher heart rates based on 24-h Holter monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aarrhythmia 3ablood pressure 3aclinical examination 3aconfidence interval 3adogs 3adrugs 3aechocardiography 3aelectrocardiography 3aheart rate 3amonitoring 3astatistical analysis 0aBeta-blocker 0aSystolic function 0aEchocardiography 0aCanine1 aLeBlanc, N.L.1 aScollan, K.F.0 tJournal of veterinary cardiology.g2019 Oct., v. 25 p.14-24dElsevier B.V.wJournal:J000000118x1760-27347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvc.2019.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245016400169520169100333592002802024650001602052650001402068650002702082650000902109650001402118650001602132650001702148650001902165650001802184650002102202650001402223650002102237650001502258653001302273653002202286653002102308700001802329700001702347700001802364700001802382700001702400700001802417700001702435700001702452773010302469856008602572852000902658655001202667IND60756453620221117022754.0220118e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075645362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.1060192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiulin10aSelenomethionine alleviated fluoride-induced toxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos by restoring oxidative balance and rebuilding inflammation homeostasis  aFish are target organisms that are extremely susceptible to fluoride pollution, and an increase in fluoride load will damage multiple systems of fish. Selenomethionine (Se-Met) at low levels has been reported to alleviate oxidative damage and inflammation caused by toxic substances, but whether it can alleviate fluoride-induced toxicity in zebrafish embryos has not been elucidated. In this study, the intervention effects of Se-Met on developmental toxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation in zebrafish embryos exposed to fluoride were determined. Our results showed that fluoride accumulated in larvae and induced developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos, caused oxidative damage and apoptosis, increased significantly the MPO and LZM activities and the levels of the inflammation-related genes IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10 and TGF-β. Moreover, fluoride significantly increased the levels of ERK2, JNK, p38 and p65 in MAPKs and NF-κB pathways. Se-Met-treatment alleviated the adverse effects induced by fluoride, and all of the above indicators induced by fluoride returned to near control levels with increasing concentrations and time. However, treatment with Se-Met-alone also markedly increased the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, TGF-β, ERK2 and JNK. In short, these data demonstrated that Se-Met-could alleviate fluoride-induced toxicity in zebrafish embryos by restoring oxidative balance and rebuilding inflammation homeostasis, although low levels of Se-Met-alone had certain toxic effects on zebrafish embryos. Taken together, Se-Met-plays an important role in preventing toxic damage induced by fluoride in zebrafish embryos, although it has certain toxic effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aapoptosis 3adevelopmental toxicity 3afish 3afluorides 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aselenomethionine 3atoxicology 0aFluoride 0aZebrafish embryos 0aOxidative damage1 aWang, Guodong1 aWang, Tianyu1 aChen, Jianjie1 aFeng, Cuiping1 aYun, Shaojun1 aCheng, Yanfen1 aCheng, Feier1 aCao, Jinling0 tAquatic toxicology.g2022 Jan., v. 242 p.106019-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.1060193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245011300170520127200283592002801555650001901583650003001602650000901632650002701641650001601668650002901684650002101713650001601734650002101750650002401771650002901795650002001824650000901844650002501853650001801878650001001896653001701906653002001923653002401943653002001967653002501987653001002012700001802022700001602040700001302056700001502069700001202084773011902096856008802215852000902303655001202312IND60661527320221119075836.0191214e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066152732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1340102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChi, Yanbing10aEffects of fertilizer types and water quality on carbon dioxide emissions from soil in wheat-maize rotations  aThe use of fertilizers as addition inputs in agricultural systems can increase the yield of wheat and maize, while also stimulating the emission of carbon dioxide from soil that the main man-made greenhouse gas. Our objectives focused on the impact of different types of synthetic fertilizers and water quality. The purposes were to determine the feasibility of using wasted water for irrigation and to relate CO2 fluxes to the yield of maize and wheat, as well as to select the best fertilizer type with low CO2 emission and high yield. The experiment consisted of a double factors test focusing on four forms of fertilizer (urea, amine and slow release fertilizer) and the quality of water (reclaimed water and underground water). The results showed that the reclaimed water was not significant on the CO2 discharge rate, the maize-wheat yield or the soil properties in 2014 or 2015; however, the CO2 emission increased slightly in 2015. Focusing on fertilizer treatments, the reclaimed water & amine fertilizer treatment (CAF) that had higher cumulative CO2 emissions was 32.75 t·ha−1 in 2014 and 33.86 t·ha−1 in 2015. According to the ratio CO2/Y, the slow released fertilizer that reduces CO2 emissions and keeps the yield high is the preferred choice.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3acorn 3afertilizer application 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3agroundwater 3airrigation water 3amineral fertilizers 3aslow-release fertilizers 3asoil properties 3aurea 3awastewater treatment 3awater quality 3awheat 0aCO2 emission 0aReclaimed water 0aForms of fertilizer 0aSoil properties 0aWheat-maize rotation 0aYield1 aYang, Peiling1 aRen, Shumei1 aMa, Ning1 aYang, Jing1 aXu, Yao0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 698 p.134010-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1340103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02047naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245006500173300001600238520101000254592002801264650002901292650001701321650001401338650002401352650001301376650001301389650001101402650002501413650002201438650001201460650001101472773008901483856008101572990002301653852000901676655001201685IND60113494320221119141143.0141111e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011349432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tig.2013.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHittinger, Chris Todd10aSaccharomyces diversity and evolution: a budding model genus  ap. 309-317.  aSaccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the best-understood and most powerful genetic model systems. Several disciplines are now converging to turn Saccharomyces into an exciting model genus for evolutionary genetics and genomics. Yeast taxonomists and ecologists have dramatically expanded and clarified Saccharomyces diversity, more than doubling the number of bona fide species since 2000. High-quality genome sequences are available (or soon will be) for all seven known species. Haploid laboratory strains are enabling a deep integration of classic genetic approaches with modern genomic tools. Population genomic surveys and quantitative trait mapping of variation within species are underway across the genus. Finally, several case studies have illuminated general and novel genetic mechanisms of evolution. Expanding strain collections, low-cost genome sequencing, and tools for precise genetic manipulation promise to usher in a golden era for this surprisingly diverse genus as an evolutionary model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acase studies 3aevolution 3agenetic engineering 3agenomics 3ahaploidy 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence analysis 3asurveys 3ayeasts0 tTrends in genetics.g2013 May, v. 29, no. 5 p.309-317dElsevier Ltdx0168-95257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2013.01.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010600165506011700271506007600388520105200464592002801516506003701544650001701581650001701598650001601615650001901631650001101650650001801661650002001679650001601699650001901715650001201734653001201746653003201758653001801790653004101808653002001849700001701869700001801886700001301904700001801917700001801935773011101953856008602064852000902150655001202159IND60778578420221207100803.0220719e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077857842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2022.1113922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Yuxi10aInhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis promotes the production of 1-octen-3-ol through mevalonic acid  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a1-Octen-3-ol makes an important contribution to meat flavor. The goal of this study was to identify the metabolic pathways of 1-octen-3-ol formation in meat. We found 218 metabolites associated with 1-octen-3-ol content in 20 samples of chicken meat, including mevalonic acid (positive correlation), corticosterone (negative correlation), and other lipids and lipid-like molecules. Among these 218 metabolites, 17 metabolites were differentially expressed in different 1-octen-3-ol content groups. Similarly, 37 genes were not only differentially expressed, but were significantly correlated with 1-octen-3-ol. The regulation of HSP90AA1, PTPN9, and other genes converted more mevalonic acid to 1-octen-3-ol. Meanwhile, mevalonic acid, a key material in the synthesis of cholesterol, caused a decrease in corticosterone content, affecting ZNF414 and KLF15 gene expression. These findings reveal the effect of cholesterol on 1-octen-3-ol content, as well as a positive regulation of mevalonic acid on the production of 1-octen-3-ol in chicken meat.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiosynthesis 3achicken meat 3acholesterol 3acorticosterone 3aflavor 3afood research 3agene expression 3ametabolites 3amevalonic acid 3aoctenol 0aChicken 0aVolatile organic components 0aMushroom odor 0aSteroid hormone biosynthesis pathway 0aRegulated genes1 aYuan, Xiaoya1 aLiu, Jianfeng1 aWen, Jie1 aCui, Huanxian1 aZhao, Guiping0 tFood research international.g2022 Aug., v. 158 p.111392-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2022.1113923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04736naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024001700138024002300155024004100178024002300219024004000242024002500282040001800307100006200325245013700387500001500524506002800539506003600567506007600603506003100679520208300710592002802793596006402821596008302885506003702968650002003005650001503025650001603040650001703056650001903073650003003092650001703122650002003139650002903159650001803188650002703206650002203233650002403255650002703279650001303306700001703319700005603336700002203392700005803414700001503472700005803487700006003545700006303605773013803668856008803806856011403894903002404008961000904032852000904041655001204050IND60718223620221214225552.0210428e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071822362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.1082162chorus7 a3737762aris7 a10113/71822362hdl7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.1082162doi7 a3737762seq_no_1157 a5062-12000-010-00D2aris_project_no7 a4318602aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeventer, M Julian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9775-162210aBiases in open-path carbon dioxide flux measurements: Roles of instrument surface heat exchange and analyzer temperature sensitivity  agolden set  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aEddy covariance (EC) measurements of ecosystem-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO₂) exchange provide the most direct assessment of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Measurement biases for open-path (OP) CO₂ concentration and flux measurements have been reported for over 30 years, but their origin and appropriate correction approach remain unresolved. Here, we quantify the impacts of OP biases on carbon and radiative forcing budgets for a sub-boreal wetland. Comparison with a reference closed-path (CP) system indicates that a systematic OP flux bias (0.54μmolm−2s−1) persists for all seasons leading to a 110% overestimate of the ecosystem CO₂ sink (cumulative error of 78 gC m⁻²). Two potential OP bias sources are considered: Sensor-path heat exchange (SPHE) and analyzer temperature sensitivity. We examined potential OP correction approaches including: i) Fast temperature measurements within the measurement path and sensor surfaces; ii) Previously published parameterizations; and iii) Optimization algorithms. The measurements revealed year-round average temperature and heat flux gradients of 2.9 °C and 16 W m⁻² between the bottom sensor surfaces and atmosphere, indicating SPHE-induced OP bias. However, measured SPHE correlated poorly with the observed differences between OP and CP CO₂ fluxes. While previously proposed nominally universal corrections for SPHE reduced the cumulative OP bias, they led to either systematic under-correction (by 38.1 gC m⁻²) or to systematic over-correction (by 17-37 gC m⁻²). The resulting budget errors exceeded CP random uncertainty and change the sign of the overall carbon and radiative forcing budgets. Analysis of OP calibration residuals as a function of temperature revealed a sensitivity of 5μmolm−3K−1. This temperature sensitivity causes CO₂ calibration errors proportional to sample air fluctuations that can offset the observed growing season flux bias by 50%. Consequently, we call for a new OP correction framework that characterizes SPHE- and temperature-induced CO₂ measurement errors.  aPublisher supplied data  cEarth Sciences Divisiondhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100014573  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair temperature 3aalgorithms 3acalibration 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3acarbon sinks 3aeddy covariance 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat transfer 3anet ecosystem exchange 3aradiative forcing 3asensors (equipment) 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awetlands1 aRoman, Tyler1 aBogoev, Ivan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4642-84941 aKolka, Randall K.1 aErickson, Matt1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2465-30601 aLee, Xuhui1 aBaker, John M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7937-98391 aMillet, Dylan B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3076-125X1 aGriffis, Timothy J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2111-51440 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 296 p.108216-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.1082163Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/71822363Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aAccepted Manuscript  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03806naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010800162300001300270520200000283592002802283650003202311650001902343650001902362650001202381650001602393650002202409650001102431650002302442650001902465650004602484650001202530650001502542650001202557650001302569650001302582650001002595650002902605650001102634650001202645650000702657650001802664650001902682650001402701650001102715650001302726650001602739653003602755653002702791653003602818653002702854653002702881700001502908700001502923700001402938700002202952773010402974856008103078852000903159655001203168IND60654526720221120104817.0190725e20180925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065452672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2018.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndler, R.10aCleavage of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) rubber as solid substrate by cultures of Gordonia polyisoprenivorans  ap. 6-12.  aPotential biotechnological recycling processes for rubber products include the bacterial degradation of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) (IR) in order to achieve its total biodegradation or its biotransformation into useful products. The actinomycete Gordonia polyisoprenivorans strain VH2 catalyzes the degradation of IR and enables its use as a sole carbon source via β-oxidation. The initial cleavage reaction is catalyzed by the extracellular latex clearing protein (Lcp). This dioxygenase is the key enzyme for the formation of oligo(cis-1,4-isoprene) molecules with different lengths, i.e., numbers of isoprene units. For the first time, IR was used as a solid substrate in 2-l fermenters. Two different particle size fractions (63–500 and 500–1000 μm) and three stirring rates (300, 400 and 500 rpm) were evaluated in the process. An increase of the cell concentration was achieved by using smaller particles and by using lower stirring rates, reaching a final biomass concentration of 0.52 g l−1 at 300 rpm after 12 days of cultivation. In order to enhance the formation of oligo(cis-1,4-isoprene) molecules, a transposon insertion mutant (TH5) of G. polyisoprenivorans strain VH2 that has lost the ability to transport the partial degradation products into the cells was used, thereby allowing the accumulation of the degradation products in the culture supernatants. Propionate, glucose and glycerol were evaluated as additional carbon sources besides IR, and the highest yields were observed on propionate. In 2-l bioreactors with pH control, different feeding regimes were performed during cultivation by the addition of propionate every 24 or 48 h for 16 days. After liquid-liquid extraction and a derivatization with Girard’s T reagent, the oligo(cis-1,4-isoprene) molecules were detected by ESI-MS. The mass distribution of the degradation products was affected by the selection of the extraction solvent, but no influence of longer cultivation periods was detected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGordonia polyisoprenivorans 3abeta oxidation 3abiodegradation 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3aderivatization 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenzymes 3afermenters 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3aisoprene 3alatex 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amixing 3amutants 3apH 3aparticle size 3apropionic acid 3arecycling 3arubber 3asolvents 3atransposons 0aGordonia polyisoprenivorans VH2 0aLatex clearing protein 0aRubber particles biodegradation 0aPoly(cis-1,4-isoprene) 0aSubmerged fermentation1 aHiessl, S.1 aYücel, O.1 aTesch, M.1 aSteinbüchel, A.,0 tNew biotechnology.g2018 Sept. 25, v. 44 p.6-12dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4392691x1871-67847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2018.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03477naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011600164300001600280520181900296592002802115650002102143650002802164650003202192650002002224650001202244650001302256650001602269650001402285650002002299650001602319650001602335650000902351650001102360650001402371650001702385650001802402650002602420650002302446650001502469650002102484650001202505650001502517650001002532650001402542650001102556650001002567650002502577650000902602700001802611700001702629700001802646700001502664773010602679856008102785852000902866655001202875IND60548315720221118010032.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054831572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-016-9578-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yiling13aAn Exogenous Source of Nitric Oxide Modulates Iron Nutritional Status in Peanut Seedlings (Arachis hypogaea L.)  ap. 730-743.  aIron (Fe) deficiency chlorosis is a common and severe nutritional deficiency in plants, and nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule in regulating Fe homeostasis in plants. We studied the effect of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, an NO donor) on Fe uptake, translocation, storage, and activation in a greenhouse. The concentrations of active Fe, total Fe, and the ratio of active Fe to total Fe, the activities of key enzymes, and chlorophyll concentration were determined, and resistance to oxidative stress and mineral element distribution in peanut plants grown in Fe sufficiency and Fe deficiency (an absence of Fe and low level of Fe concentration) conditions were also investigated. The results showed that NO significantly increased the concentration of active Fe and the ratio of active Fe to total Fe in Fe-deficient plants, and increased active Fe concentration in leaves and stems of Fe-sufficient plants. NO application also increased Fe translocation from roots to the shoots and the accumulation of Fe in cell organelles and the soluble fraction in leaves, especially in the low-level Fe concentration condition, thus increased available Fe and chlorophyll concentration in leaves of Fe-deficient plants. The activities of key enzymes were regulated by NO, which effectively mitigated oxidative damages by enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, CAT), increasing H⁺-ATPase and Ca²⁺-ATPase activities to balance the ion (Fe, Ca, Mg and Zn) uptake and distribution in Fe-deficient plants. However, NO application had no obvious effect on these variables in Fe-sufficient plants. These results indicated that NO application can improve Fe uptake, translocation, and activation of related enzymes in Fe-deficient plants, thus mitigating the adverse effect of Fe deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3aCa2-transporting ATPase 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aadverse effects 3acalcium 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3achlorosis 3aenzyme activity 3agreenhouses 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3anitric oxide 3anitroprusside 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutritional status 3aorganelles 3aoxidative stress 3apeanuts 3aperoxidase 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3astems 3asuperoxide dismutase 3azinc1 aDong, Yuanjie1 aTian, Xianyi1 aBai, Xiaoying1 aHe, Zhenli0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2016 Sept., v. 35, no. 3 p.730-743dSpringer USx0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-016-9578-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02117naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245008700170300001600257520093800273592002801211650002301239650001901262650001301281650001401294650001401308650001101322650003301333650002901366650001801395650000901413650001601422650002201438700001801460700001601478700001901494773011501513852000901628856008201637655001201719IND4407542920221122030618.0190314e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440754292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-007-0924-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Modabber Ahmed10aUtilization of waste paper for an environmentally friendly slow-release fertilizer  ap. 158-161.  aTo help address the physical, chemical, and biological degradation of agricultural soils resulting from indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers, we developed a slow-release fertilizer from waste paper and urea. This approach has the advantage of a slow-release fertilizer in that it avoids surface runoff or leaching of nutrients, while providing an excellent medium for the recycling of waste paper. The successful impregnation of urea into waste paper was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. This study also evaluated the release patterns of N from impregnated waste paper using a simulated soil solution and distilled water as leaching solutions. The release patterns of N were examined in both static and continuous-flow conditions for 720 h. Release of N from impregnated waste paper was found to be slow and steady, although the release rate of N was lower in distilled water than soil solution under both conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3abiodegradation 3aleaching 3anutrients 3arecycling 3arunoff 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aslow-release fertilizers 3asoil solution 3aurea 3awaste paper 3awaste utilization1 aMingzhi, Wang1 aLim, Bu-Kug1 aLee, Jong-Yoon0 tJournal of wood science.g2008 Apr., v. 54, no. 2 p.158-161dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-007-0924-63Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01692naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011500153300002000268520066700288592002800955650001300983650001300996650002201009650001901031650001901050650001501069650002101084700001301105700001501118700001301133773012501146856007401271852000901345655001201354IND60666987620221121083621.0190919e20141031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066698762DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra11453a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Wei10aPorous micro-spherical LiFePO₄/graphene nanocomposites for high-performance Li ion battery cathode materials  ap. 56701-56706.  aIn this work, we designed a novel cathode material, porous micro-spherical LiFePO₄/graphene nanocomposites with low graphene content, via a hydrothermal route followed by a lithiation process.

We aimed to assess a degree of workplace contamination with dust, bacteria, fungi, endotoxins, and (1 → 3)-β-D-glucans released into the air during wood processing in pellet production facilities and to check against this background the usefulness of nasal lavage (NAL) as analytical tool for assessment of combined workers' exposure to airborne dust and microbiological contaminants. In 10 pellet plants, the particulate (wood dust) aerosol concentrations were determined by using Grimm aerosol spectrometer and CIS filter sampler. The collected CIS samples were subsequently used to evaluate endotoxin and (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan concentrations. Simultaneously with particulate aerosol, bioaerosol samples were collected by using 6-stage Andersen and single-stage MAS impactors. Bacterial and fungal aerosol concentrations were calculated and all isolated microorganisms were taxonomically identified. NAL fluid samples were collected from workers exposed to studied aerosols and the concentrations of proinflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα) and cytological image of nasal mucosa (expressed as cell counts) were established. The dynamics of production activities resulted in wide range of observed wood dust, microorganism, endotoxin and (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan concentrations reaching periodically extremely high values up to 65 mg m⁻³, 19,320 CFU m⁻³, 215 ng m⁻³ and 1525 ng m⁻³, respectively. Environmental stress caused by exposure to particulate and microbial aerosols stimulated immune response among workers of pellet production facilities. Correlation analysis revealed that interleukin levels and the number of cells in NAL were significantly affected by both wood dust and bioaerosol concentrations. As nasal mucosa serves as the primary barrier against inhaled pollutants, NAL seems a reliable analytical material to assess work-related adverse respiratory health outcomes derived from such exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abacteria 3abioaerosols 3adust 3aendotoxins 3afungi 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3anasal mucosa 3aoccupational exposure 3apollutants 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aspectrometers 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3awood dust 3awood processing 3awood products 3aworking conditions 0aPellet 0aWood dust 0aBioaerosol 0aNasal lavage 0aProinflammatory mediators 0aCytological analysis1 aGołofit-Szymczak, Małgorzata1 aCyprowski, Marcin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6704-45671 aStobnicka-Kupiec, Agata1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1212-06510 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Dec. 20, v. 697 p.134018-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1340183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008800172300001400260520072000274592002800994650001201022650001701034650001701051650002101068650001801089650001101107650002001118650001601138650001601154650002501170653000801195653001101203653002601214653002401240653002901264700006001293700002001353700006201373700002201435773010501457856008101562852000901643655001201652IND60654527020221120210927.0190725e20180925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065452702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2018.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilkerson, Joshua W.10aNanoreactors: Strategies to encapsulate enzyme biocatalysts in virus-like particles  ap. 59-63.  aEnzyme-mediated biocatalysis is generally more selective and environmentally friendly and requires less energy than chemocatalysis. However, factors such as temperature, acidity and the presence of proteases can negate enzyme activity. Encapsulation in virus-like particles is one promising method to mitigate these difficulties. Encapsulation also can be used to create multi-reaction nanoreactors that increase process efficiency by isolating reaction intermediates. To successfully encapsulate enzymes, a variety of methods involving both non-covalent and covalent interactions have been developed. Here we review promising virus-like particle encapsulation strategies, their advantages and remaining challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3abiocatalysis 3abiocatalysts 3achemical bonding 3aencapsulation 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3aproteinases 3atemperature 3avirus-like particles 0aVLP 0aCapsid 0aEnzyme immobilization 0aVirus-like particle 0aVirus-based nanoparticle1 aYang, Seung Ook,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1562-20671 aFunk, Parker J.1 aStanley, Steven K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9872-31911 aBundy, Bradley C.0 tNew biotechnology.g2018 Sept. 25, v. 44 p.59-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4392691x1871-67847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2018.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245018400167300001400351520095600365592002801321650001101349650001501360650002501375650001201400650001001412650001901422650001301441650001101454653003601465653001801501653002001519653002001539653001901559700001701578773012201595852000901717856008201726655001201808IND4400523020221120111313.0200513e20080201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440052302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-007-0042-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshida, Tomohiro10aEfficiency of extracting microarthropods from the canopy litter in a Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica D.

Oribatida and Collembola were consistently the numerically dominant taxa of microarthropods, but the relative abundance differed between the two extraction methods. Oribatida accounted for more than 70% of all the microarthropods collected by the washing method but less than 30% by the Tullgren method. Collembola accounted for less than 10% collected by the washing method but about 60% by the Tullgren method. The density of Oribatida was higher when collected by the washing method than by the Tullgren method, and vice versa for the density of Collembola. Our results suggest that the washing method is appropriate for collecting Oribatida and other microarthropods, whereas the Tullgren method is better for collecting Collembola from the canopy litter of C. japonica trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aCollembola 3aCryptomeria japonica 3awashing 3atrees 3aSarcoptiformes 3abranches 3aleaves 0aCryptomeria japonica plantation 0aForest canopy 0aMicroarthropods 0aTullgren method 0aWashing method1 aHijii, Naoki0 tJournal of forest research.g2008 Feb. 1, v. 13, no. 1 p.68-72dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-007-0042-83Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03770naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245010900214520178700323592002802110650001902138650001802157650001402175650001802189650001502207650001602222650001402238650000802252650001302260650002802273650002902301650002602330650001702356650001102373650000902384650001002393650001102403650001802414650003002432650001602462650001702478650001402495650001402509650001802523650001102541650001102552651002502563653003302588653001702621653003002638653002302668653002502691653003302716700002002749700002102769700002002790700002402810700005802834773011902892856008803011852000903099655001203108IND60661527720221119075839.0211114e20191220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066152772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1340202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomano, Salvatore1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5103-253710aAirborne bacteria in the Central Mediterranean: Structure and role of meteorology and air mass transport  aThe 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding approach has been used to characterize the structure of the airborne bacterial community of PM10 samples, and investigate the dependence on meteorology, seasons, and long-range transported air masses. The PM10 samples were collected at a Central Mediterranean coastal site, away from large sources of local pollution. Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes, which were found in all samples, were the most abundant phyla. Calothrix, Pseudomonas, and Bacillus were the most abundant genera. The within-sample relative abundance (RA) of each phylum/genus varied from sample to sample. Calothrix was the most abundant genus during the advection of desert dust and Atlantic air masses, Pseudomonas was the most abundant genus when the advected air flows spent several hours over lands or close to lands affected by anthropogenic activities, before reaching the study site.The bacterial community richness and biodiversity of the PM10 samples on average increased from winter to spring, while the sample dissimilarity on average decreased from winter to spring. The spring meteorological conditions over the Mediterranean, which have likely contributed to maintain for longer time the bacterial community in the atmosphere, could have been responsible for the above results.The analysis of the presumptive species-level characterization of the airborne bacterial community has revealed that the abundance of human (opportunistic) pathogens was highly inhomogeneous among samples, without any significant change from winter to spring. We also found that the PM10 samples collected during the advection of desert dust and Atlantic air masses were on average the less enriched in human (opportunistic) pathogenic species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aCalothrix 3aDNA barcoding 3aFirmicutes 3aPseudomonas 3aadvection 3aair 3aair flow 3aairborne microorganisms 3aanthropogenic activities 3abacterial communities 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3adust 3agenes 3ahumans 3amass transfer 3ameteorological parameters 3ameteorology 3aparticulates 3apathogens 3apollution 3aribosomal RNA 3aspring 3awinter 3aMediterranean region 0aAirborne bacterial community 0aPM10 samples 0aMeteorological parameters 0aAdvection patterns 0aBiodiversity indices 0aPrincipal Component Analysis1 aDi Salvo, Marco1 aRispoli, Gennaro1 aAlifano, Pietro1 aPerrone, Maria Rita1 aTalà, Adelfia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3275-86600 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Dec. 20, v. 697 p.134020-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1340203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245010200208300001400310520103300324592002801357650002501385650002401410650002201434650002701456650001701483650001101500650001501511650001301526650002901539650001201568650001501580650002301595650002601618653001901644700003001663700002001693700005501713700006101768700002301829773010501852856008101957852000902038655001202047IND60654527120221120210916.0190725e20180925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065452712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2018.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aḤasan, Ḥanan,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1966-438710aOverexpression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in Aspergillus terreus to increase lovastatin production  ap. 64-71.  aThe present work describes the application of homologous recombination techniques in a wild-type Aspergillus terreus (ATCC 20542) strain to increase the flow of precursors towards the lovastatin biosynthesis pathway. A new strain was generated to overexpress acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) by replacing the native ACCase promoter with a strong constitutive PadhA promoter from Aspergillus nidulans. Glycerol and a mixture of lactose and glycerol were used independently as the carbon feedstock to determine the degree of response by the A. terreus strains towards the production of acetyl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA. The new strain increased the levels of malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA by 240% and 14%, respectively, compared to the wild-type strain. As a result, lovastatin production was increased by 40% and (+)-geodin was decreased by 31% using the new strain. This study shows for the first time that the metabolism of Aspergillus terreus can be manipulated to attain higher levels of precursors and valuable secondary metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus nidulans 3aAspergillus terreus 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3afeedstocks 3aglycerol 3ahomologous recombination 3alactose 3alovastatin 3amalonyl coenzyme A 3asecondary metabolites 0aOverexpression1 aAbd Rahim, Muhammad Hafiz1 aCampbell, Leona1 aCarter, Dee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4638-00591 aʻAbbās, ʻAlī,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8768-97221 aMontoya, Alejandro0 tNew biotechnology.g2018 Sept. 25, v. 44 p.64-71dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4392691x1871-67847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2018.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011900171520188400290592002802174650001602202650002202218650001402240650002202254650001202276650000902288650001402297650002002311650001402331650001602345650002302361650002402384650001502408650001502423650001702438653001202455653001802467653002502485653002302510653000802533653000702541653000902548653000802557653000702565653000902572653000802581653000802589653000802597700001702605700001202622700002002634700001602654700002602670700001802696773010302714856008602817852000902903655001202912IND60756454120221117022708.0220118e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075645412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.1060252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKernen, Larissa10aEstrogens as immunotoxicants: 17α-ethinylestradiol exposure retards thymus development in zebrafish (Danio rerio)  aEstrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds (EEDCs) can cause alterations in sexual development and reproductive function of fish. Growing evidence suggests that EEDCs can also interfere with development and function of innate immunity of fish. The present study examined a potential disruptive effect of EEDCs at field-relevant concentrations on the development of adaptive immunity, more specifically the thymus. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed from fertilization until 64 days post-fertilization (dpf) to environmentally relevant (3 and 10 ng/L) concentrations of the synthetic estrogen 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2). The exposure duration covered the period of initial thymus differentiation to maximum growth. Thymus development was assessed by histological and morphometric (thymus area) analysis, thymocyte number, and transcript levels of thymocyte marker genes. Additionally, transcript levels of the estrogen receptors (esr1 and esr2a) were determined. The EE2 exposure altered sexual development (gonad differentiation, transcript levels of hepatic vitellogenin and estrogen receptors) of zebrafish, as expected. At the same time, the EE2 treatment reduced the thymus growth (thymus area, thymocyte number) and transcript levels of thymus marker genes. The expression of the thymic estrogen receptors responded to the EE2 exposure but in a different pattern than the hepatic estrogen receptors. After the 64-day-exposure period, the juvenile fish were transferred into clean water for another 95 days to assess the reversibility of EE2-induced effects. The thymic alterations were found to be reversible in female zebrafish but persisted in males. The present study provides the first evidence that the development of the fish adaptive immune system is sensitive to EEDCs, and that this takes place at concentrations similar to those that disrupt sexual development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadaptive immunity 3aestrogens 3aexposure duration 3afemales 3afish 3ahistology 3ainnate immunity 3ajuveniles 3amorphometry 3asexual development 3asynthetic estrogens 3athymocytes 3atoxicology 3avitellogenin 0aTeleost 0aImmune system 0aEndocrine disruptors 0aEstrogen receptors 0aDPF 0aE2 0aEEDC 0aEDC 0aER 0aFSDT 0aH&E 0aVTG 0aWPF1 aPhan, Audrey1 aBo, Jun1 aHerzog, Elio L.1 aHuynh, John1 aSegner, H.q(Helmut),1 aBaumann, Lisa0 tAquatic toxicology.g2022 Jan., v. 242 p.106025-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.1060253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245012200177300001800299520125800317592002801575650002001603650002001623650001501643650001601658650001901674650001601693650001101709650002001720650002201740650000901762650002101771650004401792650005801836650002001894700002501914700001901939700002501958700002401983700002302007700002202030700002402052773009702076856008502173852000902258655001202267IND60087928820221122105244.0141102e20120516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008792882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.02.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠmejkalová, Daniela10aStructural characterization and biological properties of degradation byproducts from hyaluronan after acid hydrolysis  ap. 1425-1434.  aThe generation of degradation byproducts from hyaluronan during its acid hydrolysis was studied. The degradation byproducts were removed from reaction mixture by ultrafiltration, followed by ionex separation and purification on a reversed-phase HPLC column. Isolated fractions were structurally analyzed by NMR and mass spectrometry. Results indicated that when acid hydrolysis is performed at 100°C for 24h, about 0.7% of high molar mass hyaluronan (1.2×10⁶gmol⁻¹) was converted into furan-like derivatives. Other major degradation byproducts present in 0.2wt% amounts were identified as derivatives of cyclopentanone. Cell viability tests indicated that most of the degradation byproducts have negative effect on cell growth. These tests were performed using mouse fibroblast cell line 3T3 and human keranocytes cell line HaCaT. For this reason, it is important to evaluate the amount of degradation byproducts in low molar mass hyaluronan produced by acid hydrolysis, mainly when these products are used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. During this study it was found out that the unwanted degradation byproducts can be completely removed when an ultrafiltration step is introduced after acid hydrolysis prior hyaluronan isolation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid hydrolysis 3aadverse effects 3abyproducts 3acell growth 3acell viability 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3ahyaluronic acid 3amass spectrometry 3amice 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aultrafiltration1 aHermannová, Martina1 aBuffa, Radovan1 aČožíková, Dagmar1 aVištejnová, Lucie1 aMatulková, Zuzana1 aHrabica, Jaroslav1 aVelebný, Vladimír0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2012 May 16, v. 88, no. 4 p.1425-1434dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.02.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01751naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245010700177300001200284520070000296592002800996650001601024650001601040650001201056650001201068650000901080650001901089653001601108653000801124653000801132653002101140653002001161700001901181773009801200856008201298852000901380655001201389IND60525128420221121024858.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052512842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcz.2016.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Asutosh Kumar10aUltrastructure of egg chorion of castor butterfly Ariadne merione (Crammer) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae)  ap. 1-5.  aThe egg chorion of the castor butterfly Ariadne merione exhibits well organized regional and radial complexity.

However, the overall rate and the variability in runoff and soil loss of different regions and land uses in China have not been reported in the literature. In this study, an extensive database of runoff plots in China was compiled. Runoff and soil loss rates of sheet and rill erosion under natural conditions based on plot studies, are reviewed. The history of plot studies in China is briefly introduced, and basic information, such as the geographic distribution of soil erosion monitoring sites, the distribution of slope length and the slope gradient of runoff plots, is described. The runoff and soil loss rates of five water erosion regions in China were analyzed in terms of the main land use types. The soil loss rate was 30.87–107.44tha−1 a−1 on fallow land and 7.65–49.38tha−1 a−1 on farmland under conventional tillage. The land use types with permanent cover experienced the lowest soil loss rates, which were 0–1.89, 0.28–8.06 and 3.98–1.57tha−1 a−1 for forest, shrub and grassland, respectively. In China, the regional differences in the soil loss rate were mainly observed on fallow land and farmland, whereas almost no differences were observed on forest, shrub and grasslands. The soil loss rates of forest, shrub and grasslands showed no significant differences worldwide. However, the soil loss rates of farmland with conventional tillage in northwest and southwest China were much higher than in most other countries. This indicated that farmlands in China are still suffering from a very serious erosion problem that requires additional future attention. This study provided a broad assessment of sheet and rill erosion for prioritizing problems and selecting the appropriate erosion control practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acontrol methods 3aconventional tillage 3adatabases 3aerosion control 3aforests 3ageographical distribution 3agrasslands 3aland use 3amonitoring 3arill erosion 3arunoff 3ashrubs 3asoil 3aChina 0aRunoff plots 0aSoil loss rates 0aLand use 0aRunoff 0aChina1 aHao, Yanfang1 aLiu, Baoyuan0 tCatena.g2015 Jan., v. 124 p.68-76dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2014.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245020700169300001800376500001900394500002000413520126700433592002801700596003501728596002501763650002901788650002301817650001601840650001401856650001801870650001901888650002801907650001701935650001101952650001101963700006201974700003202036700002402068700006202092773015302154856007402307852000902381655001202390IND60730935820221119103503.0210313e20210330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073093582DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.108182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakhaee Moghadam, Maryam10aSaccharomyces cerevisiae as a delivery system of Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil as a natural preservative for food applications: Encapsulation of Iranian Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil  ap. 2006-2013.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The following study is an evaluation of the encapsulation, stability and release profile of Iranian Zateria multiflora boiss essential oil (ZEO) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells. Encapsulation was performed with different essential oil / yeast weight ratios at different temperatures. The encapsulation efficiency and stability of the loaded yeasts and the release profiles of carvacrol and thymol (as the main active ingredients of ZEO) were also investigated. RESULT: The encapsulation efficiencies of carvacrol and thymol at a ZEO / yeast weight ratio of 1.25 were 30.9% ± 0.01% and 44.5% ± 0.02%, respectively. Loaded yeast cells were stable during the 4‐week storage period. Both carvacrol and thymol showed substantial releases of around 60% during the first hour and around 70% during the second hour at two different water temperatures, followed by steady release. CONCLUSION: Zateria multiflora boiss essential oil can be encapsulated effectively in S. cerevisiae yeast cells, refrigerated without degradation, and released efficiently. Zateria multiflora boiss essential oil encapsulated into S. cerevisiae yeast may be used as a potential preservative for the food and drug industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  cFerdowsi University of Mashhad  cthe Research Council 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aZataria multiflora 3aagriculture 3acarvacrol 3aencapsulation 3aessential oils 3apharmaceutical industry 3astorage time 3athymol 3ayeasts1 aJamshidi, Abdollah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9935-46661 aFazly Bazzaz, BiBi Sedigheh1 aAzizzadeh, Mohammad1 aMovaffagh, Jebrail1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6281-16720 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 Mar. 30, v. 101, no. 5 p.2006-2013dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.108183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03671naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001200180245011600192300001600308500002000324506007600344520145300420592002801873596005801901596007001959596005902029596007502088506003702163650001202200650001302212650002202225650000902247650003502256650001102291650003002302650001502332650001202347650001302359650002202372650001302394650001302407650001902420650001002439650001402449650001002463650002602473650002102499700001902520700001402539700001402553700001302567700001602580700001702596700001502613700001502628700001402643700001602657700002202673700001702695700005302712773011402765856007302879852000902952655001202961IND60691548520221207130326.0200430e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069154852DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.146282doi7 aPMC72171962pmcid7 a317931002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Min14aThe NIN‐like protein 5 (ZmNLP5) transcription factor is involved in modulating the nitrogen response in maize  ap. 353-368.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMaize exhibits marked growth and yield response to supplemental nitrogen (N). Here, we report the functional characterization of a maize NIN‐like protein ZmNLP5 as a central hub in a molecular network associated with N metabolism. Predominantly expressed and accumulated in roots and vascular tissues, ZmNLP5 was shown to rapidly respond to nitrate treatment. Under limited N supply, compared with that of wild‐type (WT) seedlings, the zmnlp5 mutant seedlings accumulated less nitrate and nitrite in the root tissues and ammonium in the shoot tissues. The zmnlp5 mutant plants accumulated less nitrogen than the WT plants in the ear leaves and seed kernels. Furthermore, the mutants carrying the transgenic ZmNLP5 cDNA fragment significantly increased the nitrate content in the root tissues compared with that of the zmnlp5 mutants. In the zmnlp5 mutant plants, loss of the ZmNLP5 function led to changes in expression for a significant number of genes involved in N signalling and metabolism. We further show that ZmNLP5 directly regulates the expression of nitrite reductase 1.1 (ZmNIR1.1) by binding to the nitrate‐responsive cis‐element at the 5′ UTR of the gene. Interestingly, a natural loss‐of‐function allele of ZmNLP5 in Mo17 conferred less N accumulation in the ear leaves and seed kernels resembling that of the zmnlp5 mutant plants. Our findings show that ZmNLP5 is involved in mediating the plant response to N in maize.  aPublisher supplied data  a6111686cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aBK20160582cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China  a31271728cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFD0101002cNational Key Research and Development Program of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3aammonium 3acomplementary DNA 3acorn 3agenetically modified organisms 3aleaves 3aloss-of-function mutation 3ametabolism 3amutants 3anitrates 3anitrite reductase 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3aplant response 3aroots 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3atranscription factors 3avascular tissues1 aWang, Yuancong1 aLiu, Yuhe1 aJiang, Lu1 aHe, Bing1 aNing, Lihua1 aDu, Hongyang1 aLv, Yuanda1 aZhou, Ling1 aLin, Feng1 aZhang, Tifu1 aLiang, Shuaiqiang1 aLü, Haiyan,1 aZhao, Han1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6877-000X0 tplant journal.g2020 Apr., v. 102, no. 2 p.353-368dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.146283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01416naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006700164520039000231592002800621653002600649653001800675653002100693653002500714653002300739700001600762700001800778700001800796700001500814700001800829700001400847700001800861773009600879856008200975852000901057655001201066IND60783704720221120025519.0220830e20220910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078370472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2022.1329332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jinjie12aA concise first total synthesis of luteoride A and luteoride B  aSimple and efficient syntheses of luteoride A and luteoride B were accomplished in just two or three simple steps implementing a protecting-group-free (PGF) and redox-neutral strategy.

A two-stage sampling procedure was adopted in the study. In the first stage, a total of 408 samples were collected along twelve toposequences, while in the second stage, 64 representative soil samples were collected on typical upper, middle and lower slope positions. Particle size fractions, bulk density, hydraulic conductivity, organic carbon, field capacity water content (FWC), permanent wilting point (PWP), and available water content (AWC) were determined. Elevation, slope, aspect, curvatures, flow direction and hill shade, compound topographic index (CTI) and stream power index (SPI) were derived from a digital elevation model. The data were analyzed using correlation, principal component and stepwise multiple regression. There was significant correlation (p<0.01) between FWC and hill shade and CTI. Permanent wilting point and AWC significantly correlated (p<0.01) with aspect, tangent curvature and CTI. Principal components classified were permeability, retention, solute distribution, soil water stress, soil water loss, and solute transport and water storage factors. Soil water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity were modeled and root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 0.01 to 2.31%, indicating high predictability. Rainfall intensity was estimated at 0.82cmh−1, while the saturated hydraulic conductivity was 0.23cmh−1 indicating that 256.5% of the rainfall results in overland flow and redistribution of material. The role of terrain attributes involves the development of pedogenic structural and textural features and movement of clay downslope more laterally than vertically within the landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3acarbon 3aclay 3acoastal plain soils 3adigital elevation models 3afield capacity 3ahills 3alandscapes 3aoverland flow 3aparticle size 3apedotransfer functions 3apermeability 3arain 3arain intensity 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil formation 3asoil sampling 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asolutes 3astreams 3atexture 3atopography 3atoposequences 3awater content 3awater stress 3awilting point 0aGeomorphology 0aTerrain attributes 0aSoil water 0aPedoturbation 0aPedotransfer functions1 aOgban, P.I.1 aItuen, U.J.1 aUdoh, B.T.0 tCatena.g2014 Dec., v. 123 p.252-262dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2014.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003000142245014600172500001400318520118700332592002801519650002801547650001301575650001501588650001401603650002501617650002701642650001001669650001601679650001501695650001501710650001201725650001801737650001601755700003101771700003601802700002801838700001701866700001901883700002401902773011901926856007602045852000902121655001202130IND60711669620221120220353.0200928e20200907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071166962DNAL7 a10.3390/foods90912522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaravanakumar, Kandasamy 10aLactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Biochemical Agents Enrich the Shelf Life of Fresh-Cut Bell Pepper (Capsicum annuum L. var. grossum (L.)

The results revealed that the combined application of biochemical additives and L. rhamnosus GG inhibited the colonization of total bacterial counts (25.10%), total Salmonella counts (38.32%), total Listeria counts (23.75%), and total fungal counts (61.90%) in FCBP. Total bacterial colonization was found to be higher in R-FCBP (1188.09 ± 9.25 CFU g⁻¹) than Y-FCBP (863.96 ± 7.21 CFU g⁻¹). The storage at 4 °C was prevented 35.38% of microbial colonization in FCBP. Importantly, the L. rhamnosus GG count remained for up to 12 days. Moreover, the combined inoculation of the biochemical additives and L. rhamnosus GG treatments (T3) maintained the quality of R- and Y-FCBP for up to 12 days at 4 °C without any loss of antioxidant properties.

However, in breastfeeding there are still many maternal understandings that are lacking about foremilk and hindmilk. Foremilk and hindmilk are related to the duration of the baby breastfeeding, if the baby has not been obtained in a balanced manner can cause problems in the pattern of defecation of infants especially those aged 1-6 months. The purpose of study was to determine the effect of foremilk and hindmilk balance with defecation patterns of infants who received exclusive. The study design was cross sectional, with total sample 30 mothers who had infants aged 1-6 months and exclusively. The results showed the majority (96.7%) frequency of defecation of infants 1-8 times, consistency of soft stool (96.7%) and yellow stool (93.3%). Out of 30 respondents 53.33% of mothers had a balance of foremilk and hindmilk while breastfeeding and 86.66% of infants had normal defecation patterns. Chi-square test results did not influence the balance of foremilk and hindmilk with the pattern of defecation with 30 respondents surveyed. This shows that the balance of foremilk and hindmilk has not affected the pattern of infant defecation including frequency, consistency and color of feces.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast feeding 3achi-square distribution 3acolor 3adefecation 3aexperimental design 3afeces 0aforemilk and hindmilk 0adefecation pattern 0aexclusive breastfeeding1 aNurhayati, Latifah0 tBioLink.g2019 Dec., v. 6, no. 2 p.146-152dUniversitas Medan AreawJournal:27899x2597-52697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.31289/biolink.v6i2.27643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006500139245013500204300001600339500002000355520169900375592002802074596002502102650001102127650001502138650001702153650001802170650001802188650002502206650001702231650001002248650001902258650001402277700005902291773011402350856007302464852000902537655001202546IND60691548720221120223141.0200430e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069154872DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.146232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon der Heyde, Eva L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7107-623810aBabo1, formerly Vop1 and Cop1/2, is no eyespot photoreceptor but a basal body protein illuminating cell division in Volvox carteri  ap. 276-298.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn photosynthetic organisms many processes are light dependent and sensing of light requires light‐sensitive proteins. The supposed eyespot photoreceptor protein Babo1 (formerly Vop1) has previously been classified as an opsin due to the capacity for binding retinal. Here, we analyze Babo1 and provide evidence that it is no opsin. Due to the localization at the basal bodies, the former Vop1 and Cop1/2 proteins were renamed V.c. Babo1 and C.r. Babo1. We reveal a large family of more than 60 Babo1‐related proteins from a wide range of species. The detailed subcellular localization of fluorescence‐tagged Babo1 shows that it accumulates at the basal apparatus. More precisely, it is located predominantly at the basal bodies and to a lesser extent at the four strands of rootlet microtubules. We trace Babo1 during basal body separation and cell division. Dynamic structural rearrangements of Babo1 particularly occur right before the first cell division. In four‐celled embryos Babo1 was exclusively found at the oldest basal bodies of the embryo and on the corresponding d‐roots. The unequal distribution of Babo1 in four‐celled embryos could be an integral part of a geometrical system in early embryogenesis, which establishes the anterior–posterior polarity and influences the spatial arrangement of all embryonic structures and characteristics. Due to its retinal‐binding capacity, Babo1 could also be responsible for the unequal distribution of retinoids, knowing that such concentration gradients of retinoids can be essential for the correct patterning during embryogenesis of more complex organisms. Thus, our findings push the Babo1 research in another direction.  aPublisher supplied data  cBielefeld University 3aVolvox 3aautotrophs 3abody protein 3acell division 3aembryogenesis 3aembryonic structures 3amicrotubules 3aopsin 3aphotoreceptors 3aretinoids1 aHallmann, Armin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5977-61430 tplant journal.g2020 Apr., v. 102, no. 2 p.276-298dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.146233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245009500153520133000248592002801578650001301606650002101619650001501640650001901655650001501674650001601689650001601705651001001721700002101731700001401752700001601766773012801782856007401910852000901984655001201993IND60652662320221123003148.0190713e20181021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065266232DNAL7 a10.3390/su101038042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Yuhe14aThe Effect of Climate Change on Spring Maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) Suitability across China  aSpring maize (Zea mays L.) is a thermophilic C<inf>4</inf> crop which is sensitive to climate change. This paper provides a detailed assessment of the effect of climate change on the crop from a new perspective, by predicting the probability of the potential distribution of spring maize across China. The affected area of spring maize suitability was identified, and then the affected area was subdivided into the improved area and the deteriorated area. Our results confirmed that there was a detrimental consequence for spring maize suitability under observed climate change from 1961&ndash;1990 to 1981&ndash;2010. However, our results revealed that warming scenarios of 1.5 &deg;C and 2 &deg;C were helpful for the suitable area expansion of spring maize. The affected area was smaller under warming scenarios than under historical climate change, revealing that temperature rise alone was not enough to trigger a &ldquo;tipping point&rdquo; (a threshold value after which abrupt shifts occur) for spring maize, even if warming is 2 &deg;C above the level of 1961&ndash;1990. Our results not only benefit China in the design of mitigation and adaptation strategies, but also provide a theoretical judgement that the impact of global warming on the crop ecosystem is not serious if other climate factors remain unchanged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystems 3aglobal warming 3aprediction 3aprobability 3atemperature 3aChina1 aZhou, Guangsheng1 aHe, Qijin1 aWang, Lixia0 tSustainability.g2018 Oct. 21, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101038043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245011500178520136400293592002801657650002401685650001601709650001801725650001901743650001701762650001501779650001501794650001101809650001301820650001401833650001601847650001301863650001401876773012801890856008702018852000902105655001202114IND60781023220221122043854.0220623e20220618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078102322DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100612482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Toshiyuki 10aMethod for Stress Assessment of Endosymbiotic Algae in Paramecium bursaria as a Model System for Endosymbiosis  aEndosymbiosis between heterotrophic host and microalga often breaks down because of environmental conditions, such as temperature change and exposure to toxic substances. By the time of the apparent breakdown of endosymbiosis, it is often too late for the endosymbiotic system to recover. In this study, I developed a technique for the stress assessment of endosymbiotic algae using Paramecium bursaria as an endosymbiosis model, after treatment with the herbicide paraquat, an endosymbiotic collapse inducer. Microcapillary flow cytometry was employed to evaluate a large number of cells in an approach that is more rapid than microscopy evaluation. In the assay, red fluorescence of the chlorophyll reflected the number of endosymbionts within the host cell, while yellow fluorescence fluctuated in response to the deteriorating viability of the endosymbiont under stress. Hence, the yellow/red fluorescence intensity ratio can be used as an algal stress index independent of the algal number. An optical evaluation revealed that the viability of the endosymbiotic algae within the host cell decreased after treatment with paraquat and that the remaining endosymbionts were exposed to high stress. The devised assay is a potential environmental monitoring method, applicable not only to P. bursaria but also to multicellular symbiotic units, such as corals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParamecium bursaria 3achlorophyll 3aendosymbionts 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3amicroalgae 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3aparaquat 3asymbiosis 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3aviability0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 June 18, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100612483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04704naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001600188245013300204300001200337506007600349520229100425592002802716596006202744596006302806506003702869650002402906650002502930650002502955650002502980650001803005650002803023650001703051650002703068650001603095650001303111650002303124650001903147650002003166650003603186650005303222650001303275650001403288650001903302650002203321650001803343650001803361650002303379650001003402650001903412650001003431650001303441650001503454650001403469650000903483650002503492700002203517700006403539700002903603700002103632700002103653700001903674700001803693700002503711773013103736856008203867852000903949655001203958IND60579588920221207132857.0210514e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057958892DNAL7 a288304152pmid7 aPMC55674682pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-017-1926-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Fazal10aAnti-cancer effects of Ajwa dates (Phoenix dactylifera L.) in diethylnitrosamine induced hepatocellular carcinoma in Wistar rats  ap. 418.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for major cancer-related deaths despite current advanced therapies. Treatment and prognosis of HCC is better in patients with preserved liver function. Many natural products including ajwa dates (Phoenix dactylifera L.), are claimed to have hepatoprotective and HCC inhibitory effects, but most lack scientific validation. To prove our hypothesis, we attempted to evaluate the HCC inhibitory effects, and other beneficial properties of the aqueous extract of ajwa dates (ADE) in a rat model of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) induced liver cancer. METHODS: Thirty-two male rats were divided into four groups of eight each as follows, Group A: untreated control; Group B: DEN control (180 mg/kg bw), Group C: DEN + ADE 0.5 g/kg bw; and Group D: DEN +1.0 g/kg bw. Rats from all groups were assessed for liver cancer progression or inhibition by evaluating histological, biochemical, antioxidant enzyme status, cytokines and gene expression profiles. RESULTS: DEN treatment Groups (B, C, D) showed histological features of HCC and in rats treated with ADE (Groups C, D) partial to complete reversal of normal liver architecture was observed. Antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), glutatione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) were increased, while the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and lipid peroxidation were significantly decreased in Group C and Group D compared to Group B. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β,, GM-CSF) were increased in the serum of rats in Group B while the anti-tumor cytokines (IL-2, IL-12) were increased in ADE treated Groups (C, D). In addition, Alpha-Feto Protein (AFP) and IL-6 gene expression levels were upregulated in Group B, while they were significantly downregulated in ADE treated Groups (C, D). CONCLUSIONS: ADE helped in the reversal of DEN damaged liver towards normal. Restoration of anti-oxidant enzymes, liver enzymes, cytokines balance and gene expression to normal levels following ADE treatment indicates that ADE improves liver function and inhibits HCC. ADE can, therefore, be used together with conventional therapeutics for HCC.  aPublisher supplied data  aAT-34-237cKing Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology  aAT34-330cKing Abdulaziz City for Science and Technonology0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aalternative medicine 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidants 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3adiethylnitrosamine 3adisease course 3agene expression 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3agranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3ahepatoma 3ahistology 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-6 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3aliver function 3amales 3apatients 3aperoxidase 3aprognosis 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aKhan, Tariq Jamal1 aKalamegam, Gauthaman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5208-45981 aPushparaj, Peter Natesan1 aChaudhary, Adeel1 aAbuzenadah, Adel1 aKumosani, Taha1 aBarbour, Elie1 aAl-Qahtani, Mohammed0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.418-418dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-1926-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002100167245007600188300001600264520119600280592002801476653002001504653001501524653001701539653003701556653002101593653001101614653001901625653001201644653001601656653001501672653001401687700002601701773011801727856010101845852000901946655001201955IND60130881120221118160359.0151127e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013088112DNAL7 a10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[104:ANMFCA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNOLFO, LAUREN E.12aA Novel Method for Capturing and Implanting Radiotransmitters in Nutria  ap. 104-110.  aAs part of a multi-phase study aimed at examining the impact, habitat use, and movement patterns of the invasive rodent the nutria (Myocastor coypus), we developed a methodology to most effectively capture and implant these animals with radiotransmitters. Using a hand-held fishing net, we captured 20 adult nutrias from an airboat and implanted them with intraperitoneal radiotransmitters. We used the anesthetic tiletamine-zolazepam (Telazol®®, Ft Dodge Animal Health, Ft. Dodge, Iowa) to immobilize the animals during surgery. We released all individuals back into a fresh water floating marsh habitat within 24 hours of implantation. There was increased survivorship when we placed animals in a predator-free enclosure for a minimum of 3 days. We found that the combination of airboat capture, Telazol®® anesthesia, and 24-hr post-surgery release was successful only if animals could be kept in a predator-free environment for at least 72 hours. Therefore, if holding facilities and sufficient temporal, monetary, and human resources are available, these methods may result in sufficient survivorship to allow for the monitoring of these and other medium-sized, semi-aquatic mammals.  aPublisher supplied data 0aairboat capture 0aanesthesia 0aimplantation 0aintraperitoneal radiotransmitter 0aMyocastor coypus 0anutria 0aradiotelemetry 0asurgery 0aTelazol®® 0atiletamine 0azolazepam1 aHAMMOND, ELIZABETH E.0 tWildlife Society bulletin.g2006 Mar., v. 34, no. 1 p.104-110dWildlife SocietywJournal:jnl9749x0091-76487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[104:ANMFCA]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010600167300001400273520112900287592002801416650001001444650001601454651001001470653001401480653001601494653001601510653001601526653000901542700002201551773010001573856008201673852000901755655001201764IND60525128920221121032629.0190318e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052512892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcz.2016.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez, Nuria10aTwo new Pycnophyidae species (Kinorhyncha: Allomalorhagida) from Japan lacking ventral tubes in males  ap. 80-89.  aTwo new species of Pycnophyidae are described from Japanese waters.

The aim of this work was to study the composition of the microbiota (bacteria and fungi) in decaying wood from a northwest Spanish forest as a source of industrially relevant microorganisms. The analyzed forest is situated in a well-defined biogeographic area combining Mediterranean and temperate macrobioclimates. Bacterial diversity, determined by metagenome analyses, was higher than fungal heterogeneity. However, a total of 194 different cultivable bacterial isolates (mainly Bacillaceae, Streptomycetaceae, Paenibacillaceae, and Microbacteriaceae) were obtained, in contrast to 343 fungal strains (mainly Aspergillaceae, Hypocreaceae, and Coniochaetaceae). Isolates traditionally known as secondary metabolite producers, such as Actinobacteria and members of the Penicillium genus, were screened for their antimicrobial activity by the detection of antibiotic biosynthetic clusters and competitive bioassays against fungi involved in wood decay. In addition, the ability of Penicillium isolates to degrade cellulose and release ferulic acid from wood was also examined. These results present decaying wood as an ecologically rich niche and a promising source of biotechnologically interesting microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillaceae 3aConiochaetaceae 3aHypocreaceae 3aMicrobacteriaceae 3aPaenibacillaceae 3aPenicillium 3aStreptomycetaceae 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiosynthesis 3acellulose 3adecayed wood 3aferulic acid 3aforests 3afungi 3ageographical distribution 3ametagenomics 3asecondary metabolites1 aFil, Mariana 1 aHeggeset, Tonje M.

Among these checkpoints are tytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, checkpoints programmed death-1 and programmed death-ligand 1; their blockades have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for therapy of melanoma and other types of cancers. Immunogenomics, which combines the latest nucleic acid sequencing strategy with immunotherapy, provides precise information about genomic alterations (e.g. mutations) and enables a paradigm shift of immune checkpoint therapy from tumor types to molecular signatures. Studying these critical checkpoints in relation to genomic mutations and neoantigens has produced groundbreaking results. This article examines these studies and delves into the relationships between immune checkpoint blockade and tumors harboring certain genomic mutations.

Nowhere is this change more dramatic than in China. Understanding the variations and driving forces of nitrogen loss from planting is critical to the sustainable development of Chinese agriculture. Here we found total nitrogen (TN) loss of China showed an overall downward trend from 2007 to 2016, as a result of abatement strategies for China on “Soil Testing and Formula Fertilization” and “Reducing Fertilizer Application while Increase the Efficiency”, based on the data of National Agricultural Pollution Survey. The results of structural equation model showed that the path coefficient of anthropogenic drivers and natural conditions on TN loss were 0.934 and −0.137 respectively, suggesting that anthropogenic drivers had greater effects on TN loss than natural conditions. In terms of anthropogenic drivers, fertilizer usage and consumption of chemical pesticides were the two major factors affecting TN loss with path coefficients of 0.958 and 0.946, respectively, which was mainly related to their over-application. For natural conditions, relative humidity, water supply situation, and annual precipitation were found to be the dominant factors affecting TN loss, revealing that moist soils increased TN loss by enhancing ammonia volatilization, denitrification and nitrogen leaching. Forecasts for 2050, under two scenarios especially for the high TN loss scenario, the indication sifts that China will face a high risk of increasing TN loss from planting, suggesting that China’s abatement strategies cannot be slackened. Here, the current status and future trends of China’s nitrogen loss provide direction and pertinence to Chinese abatement strategies for nitrogen, effectively preventing and controlling agricultural non-point source pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural pollution 3aammonia 3aatmospheric precipitation 3adenitrification 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3aglobal change 3anitrogen 3anonpoint source pollution 3arelative humidity 3arisk 3asoil 3astructural equation modeling 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3atotal nitrogen 3avolatilization 3awater supply 3aChina 0aPlanting 0aAgricultural non-point source1 aXiangqun, Zheng1 aChengfeng, Peng1 aJunyi, Li1 aYan, Xu0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Dec., v. 267 p.115660-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1156603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245016600160300001800326500002000344520162100364592002801985650002902013650002302042650001702065650002302082650001702105650002002122650001502142650001302157650002602170650000702196650001502203650002002218700002602238700001802264700001802282700001402300700002202314773015002336856007302486852000902559655001202568IND60594346020221120142306.0180511e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059434602DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.55312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Sheng‐Jie10aEnhanced trans‐2,3‐dihydro‐3‐hydroxyanthranilic acid production by pH control and glycerol feeding strategies in engineered Pseudomonas chlororaphis GP72  ap. 1618-1626.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Trans‐2, 3‐dihydro‐3‐hydroxyanthranilic acid (DHHA) is a valuable metabolic intermediate for the biosynthesis of wide‐ranging benzoic acid derivatives with enormous biological or pharmaceutical activities. Pseudomonas chlororaphis GP72 is a non‐pathogenic biocontrol strain that displays unique capability to produce phenazines. Nevertheless, DHHA production is quite low by the wild type strains, which necessitates yield improvement by constructing engineered strains for large‐scale biotechnological applications. RESULTS: In this study, two negative regulatory genes namely rsmE and lon were successively deactivated in the DA4 strain. The resulting engineered DA6 strain produced a significantly high titer of DHHA (20.6% higher than that of DA4). The influence of varying pH from 6.2 to 8.2 on DHHA production was studied in a 6‐L benchtop fermenter. A controlled broth pH of 7.2 stimulated maximum DHHA production by the engineered DA6 strain. A DO‐stat based fed‐batch system maintaining a constant DO level (about 20%) accompanied by a glycerol feeding strategy was applied. Highest DHHA production using this approach was recorded to be 10.06 g L‐¹, which was 31% higher than with traditional batch cultivation. CONCLUSION: The production of DHHA in metabolically engineered GP72 was considerably improved by inactivating two negative regulatory genes in a fed‐batch mode. It is concluded that fed‐batch fermentation with intermittent glycerol feeding and pH‐control was an effective approach to improve DHHA production yield. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas chlororaphis 3abatch fermentation 3abenzoic acid 3abiological control 3abiosynthesis 3afeeding methods 3afermenters 3aglycerol 3ametabolic engineering 3apH 3aphenazines 3aregulator genes1 aVēlāyutan̲, T.

Our current knowledge of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) social behaviors may not be adequate for application to management. Using captive white-tailed deer, we investigated the long-held assumption that relatively few dominant males sire most offspring and, thus, prevent subordinates from breeding. Although this assumption influences population predictions and management strategies, empirical studies of the relationship between dominance and male breeding success in deer are lacking. We determined male dominance rank and genetic paternity through 6 breeding trials. Although dominant males sired most offspring, subordinates sired offspring in 5 of 6 trials and multiple paternity (siring of offspring by 2 males) occurred in ˜˜24%% of compound litters. Further, male dominance ranks were not necessarily predictable or stable during the breeding season. This study indicates that the relationship between social dominance and male breeding success may be more complex than previously thought. Our findings also are consistent with recent studies of parentage in wild deer, providing additional evidence that social dominance does not necessarily equate to breeding success. Conceptual models of deer breeding behaviors should account for considerable individual heterogeneity among males in their ability to sire offspring.  aPublisher supplied data 0abehavior 0abreeding success 0aOdocoileus virginianus 0aparentage 0apaternity 0asocial behavior 0awhite-tailed deer1 aDemarais, Stephen,1 aHoneycutt, Rodney L.,1 aGee, Kenneth L.,1 aGonzales, Robert A.,0 tWildlife Society bulletin.g2006 Mar., v. 34, no. 1 p.131-136dWildlife SocietywJournal:jnl9749x0091-76487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[131:SDAMBS]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006100169520119700230592002801427650001901455650001901474650001001493650001101503650001801514650001301532650002201545650001301567650001801580653001001598653002201608653002701630653001901657653003401676700001201710700001901722700001901741700001701760700005701777773010001834856008501934852000902019655001202028IND60778851120221118035710.0220816e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077885112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mtnano.2022.1002292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Honglin10aExploring phage engineering to advance nanobiotechnology  aPhage is a human-safe bacteria-infecting virus assembled from proteins and nucleic acids, enabling it to be genetically engineered to display functional peptides or proteins. It is also a biological nanomaterial that can be assembled into ordered nanostructured materials, laying the foundation for advancing nanobiotechnology. Phage, alone or in combination with non-biological nanomaterials, has been employed to develop new nanobiotechnologies for applications such as biosensing, drug and gene delivery, cancer therapy, vaccinations, tissue regeneration, antibacterial treatment, energy storage and generation, and higher-ordered materials assembly. This review summarizes the structure and biology of phage both as a biomacromolecule and as a nano-biomaterial. It also critically discusses the nanobiotechnological applications of phage and the challenges in this field. The current advancements of phage-based nanobiotechnology, as represented by those applications, demonstrate that phage can find unexplored applications in materials science, nanotechnology, energy, and medicine due to its unique properties such as genetic display of peptides or proteins and uniform size and shape.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteriophages 3acancer therapy 3adrugs 3aenergy 3agene transfer 3amedicine 3ananobiotechnology 3apeptides 3atissue repair 0aPhage 0aNanobiotechnology 0aDrug and gene delivery 0aCancer therapy 0aEnergy storage and generation1 aLi, Yan1 aCosnier, Serge1 aYang, Mingying1 aSun, Weilian1 aMao, Chuanbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8142-36590 tMaterials today nano.g2022 Aug., v. 19 p.100229-dElsevier LtdwJournal:27231x2588-84207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mtnano.2022.1002293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245013900161500001400300520120900314592002801523650001001551650001601561650001401577650001001591650001601601650002301617650001101640650001201651650002301663700002101686700002401707700002101731700002101752700002401773773011901797856007601916852000901992655001202001IND60711670220221121190930.0200928e20200908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071167022DNAL7 a10.3390/foods90912572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaguna, Laura 10aDo Consumers Change Their Perception of Liking, Expected Satiety, and Healthiness of a Product If They Know It Is a Ready-to Eat Meal?  aNAL-light  aA ready-to-eat meal is a prepared meal within a container or package that requires little preparation or heating before consumption. Despite ready-to-eat meals being widely consumed, to date, little information is available on the consumers’ perceptions of such products in comparison to a homemade meal. Thus, three groups of eighty participants took part in the present study; each group evaluated five ready-to-eat meals (Pasta, Meatballs, Salad, Beans, and a Sandwich) using one of the following conditions: (i) observation of the packaging, (ii) observation of the meal on a plate (photographs), and (iii) tasting the ready-to-eat product with the packaging being presented alongside the meal. Consumers were asked about their liking, satiety, and healthiness perception. The results showed that both the ready-to-eat pack and sensory quality of the product highly impact liking and healthiness perceptions. Being a ready-to-eat meal in a pack has a negative impact on liking expectations of the meal; however, the sensory quality can either counteract these effects or increase them. Expected satiety of meals depends on the type of meal and varies slightly according to the evaluation condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeans 3ainformation 3apackaging 3apasta 3aphotographs 3aready-to-eat foods 3asalads 3asatiety 3asensory properties1 aGómez, Beatriz,1 aGarrido, María  D.1 aFiszman, Susana 1 aTarrega, Amparo 1 aLinares, María  B.0 tFoods.g2020 Sept. 08, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods90912573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245010900164520187800273592002802151650001802179650000802197650000802205650001302213650002502226650002402251650002302275650001102298650002602309650001902335650001902354650001702373650001602390650002602406700001902432700001902451773012802470856008702598852000902685655001202694IND60781023620221122043957.0220623e20220619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078102362DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100612522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qi 10aResponses of Cyanobacterial Crusts and Microbial Communities to Extreme Environments of the Stratosphere  aHow microbial communities respond to extreme conditions in the stratosphere remains unclear. To test this effect, cyanobacterial crusts collected from Tengger Desert were mounted to high balloons and briefly exposed (140 min) to high UV irradiation and low temperature in the stratosphere at an altitude of 32 km. Freezing and thawing treatments were simulated in the laboratory in terms of the temperature fluctuations during flight. Microbial community composition was characterized by sequencing at the level of DNA and RNA. After exposure to the stratosphere, the RNA relative abundances of Kallotenue and Longimicrobium increased by about 2-fold, while those of several dominant cyanobacteria genera changed slightly. The RNA relative abundances of various taxa declined after freezing, but increased after thawing, whereas cyanobacteria exhibited an opposite change trend. The DNA and RNA relative abundances of Nitrososphaeraceae were increased by 1.4~2.3-fold after exposure to the stratosphere or freezing. Exposure to stratospheric environmental conditions had little impact on the total antioxidant capacity, photosynthetic pigment content, and photosynthetic rate, but significantly increased the content of exopolysaccharides by 16%. The three treatments (stratospheric exposure, freezing, and thawing) increased significantly the activities of N-acetyl-β-D-glucosidase (26~30%) and β-glucosidase (14~126%). Our results indicated cyanobacterial crust communities can tolerate exposure to the stratosphere. In the defense process, extracellular organic carbon degradation and transformation play an important role. This study makes the first attempt to explore the response of microbial communities of cyanobacterial crusts to a Mars-like stratospheric extreme environment, which provides a new perspective for studying the space biology of earth communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aaltitude 3aantioxidant activity 3acommunity structure 3aexopolysaccharides 3aflight 3amicrobial communities 3aorganic carbon 3aphotosynthesis 3astratosphere 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation1 aHu, Chunxiang 1 aYang, Haijian 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 June 19, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100612523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245011800203300001600321500001900337500002000356520197000376592002802346596008102374650001502455650000902470650001902479650001802498650001802516700002102534700002302555773011902578856007302697852000902770655001202779IND60691549320221121223941.0200430e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069154932DNAL7 a10.1111/faf.124482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatte, Jean‐Michel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4588-868310aDensity‐dependent growth and survival in salmonids: Quantifying biological mechanisms and methodological biases  ap. 588-600.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnderstanding the complex variation in patterns of density‐dependent individual growth and survival across populations is critical to adaptive fisheries management, but the extent to which this variation is caused by biological or methodological differences is unclear. Consequently, we conducted a correlational meta‐analysis of published literature to investigate the relative importance of methodological and biological predictors on the shape and strength of density‐dependent individual growth and survival in salmonids. We obtained 160 effect sizes from 75 studies of 12 species conducted between 1977 and 2019 that differed in experimental approach (sensu Ecological Monographs, 54, 187–211; 65 laboratory experiments, 60 observational field studies, and 35 field experiments). The experimental approach was the strongest factor influencing the strength of density dependence across studies: density‐dependent survival was stronger than growth in field observational studies, whereas laboratory experiments detected stronger density‐dependent growth than survival. The difference between density‐dependent growth and survival was minimal in field experiments, and between lotic and lentic habitats. The shape of density dependence (logarithmic, linear, exponential or density‐independent) could be predicted with 66.7% accuracy based solely on the experimental approach and the density gradient (highest/lowest*100) of the study. Overall, the strength and shape of density dependence were primarily influenced by methodological predictors, while biological factors (predator presence, food abundance, and species) had predictable but modest effects. For both empirical studies and adaptive fisheries management, we recommend using field experiments with a density gradient of at least 470% to detect the proper shape of the density‐dependent response, or accounting for potential biases if observational or laboratory studies are conducted.  aPublisher supplied data  aDiscovery GrantcNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aSalmonidae 3afish 3alentic systems 3alotic systems 3ameta-analysis1 aFraser, Dylan J.1 aGrant, James W.

Laser scanning is a survey method that allows determining the three-dimensional position of a large number of points (point cloud) through the measurement of angles (azimuth and zenith) and distances. For this paper five scans were made of some rills, which formed during particularly erosive rain in the plots of the Masse station. The point cloud was first interpolated by the natural neighbor method to create a discrete 0.02m×0.02m square cell grid Digital Elevation Model (DEM) used for mapping the flow network. The same cloud was also used to generate a continuous modeling of the surface (by the Triangulated Irregular Network model, TIN) to quantify the total eroded volume and the morphological characteristics of the rill formations. Three methods were applied to the DEM for detecting the channel network: the slope method (Horn, 1981; Wood, 1996), the constant drop method, described by Broscoe (1959) and the method of landform curvature (Tarolli et al., 2012). The comparison has shown a good agreement between the three methods, but Broscoe's method seems to be more accurate for rill recognition. The morphological characteristics of the rill formations derived by the TIN model (i.e. length, width, depth and volume) were compared with the corresponding characteristics obtained manually using a profilometer. The analysis showed a good agreement between the width at the top measured by the two methods, a general overestimation of the maximum depth and of the cross section areas and an underestimation of the rill length when the manual method is used. Lastly, the comparison between the volumes obtained by the TLS survey and by the manual method showed that the total volume calculated by the manual measurements overestimates that evaluated by the TLS, with a good agreement between these variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigital elevation models 3alandforms 3arain 3arill erosion 3asoil 3asurveys 3awood 3aItaly 0aSoil erosion 0aRill 0aDEM 0aTIN 0aHigh-resolution topography 0aErosion measurements1 aBrigante, R.1 aTodisco, F.1 aMannocchi, F.1 aRadicioni, F.0 tCatena.g2015 Jan., v. 124 p.97-108dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2014.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001100143245009000154300001800244520183400262592002802096650002602124650002102150650001702171650001602188650001902204650001202223650001202235650001602247650001502263650002002278650002902298650002102327650001202348650001702360650001402377650002002391650001502411650002902426650002202455650000902477650001802486653001802504653001402522653001402536653001202550653002202562700001702584700001702601700001302618773015302631856007802784852000902862655001202871IND60539497420221117171324.0190318e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053949742DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2013-71542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Y.10aPotential risk indicators of retained placenta and other diseases in multiparous cows  ap. 4151-4165.  aRetained placenta (RP), defined as fetal membranes not being expelled within 24 h after calving, is a costly disease in multiparous dairy cows that has been linked to immune suppression, infections, elevated lipid mobilization, and depleted status of antioxidants including α-tocopherol, and that increases the risk of other diseases (OD) in early lactation. Early detection of cows at increased risk of developing RP, OD, or both in early lactation could improve treatment success and result in improved milk production and reproductive performance. To identify risk indicators of RP, OD, or both, we used a nested case-control design and compared multiparous dairy cows that developed RP (n=32) with cows that remained healthy (H; n=32) or cows that developed OD (n=32) in early lactation. We compared peripartal body condition score (BCS) as well as serum concentrations of α-tocopherol, metabolites [β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), cholesterol, glucose, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), and urea N], haptoglobin, and macrominerals (i.e., calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus) on d −21, −14, −7, −3, −1, 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49 postpartum. In addition, average serum concentrations were calculated for each cow for the last 3wk prepartum, for 3 and 2wk prepartum combined, for the last week prepartum, and for the morning after calving and compared between groups. The RP cows had lower BCS than the H or OD cows until 2wk postpartum. During the prepartal periods, RP and OD cows had lower α-tocopherol concentrations (corrected or not for cholesterol concentration) and higher NEFA and BHBA concentrations than H cows. Thus, lower prepartal BCS could be an early predictor for RP risk, and lower α-tocopherol concentrations and higher NEFA and BHBA concentrations could be early predictors for disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3abody condition 3acalcium 3acalving 3acholesterol 3adairy cows 3aearly lactation 3aextraembryonic membranes 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3ahaptoglobins 3amagnesium 3amilk production 3aphosphorus 3areproductive performance 3aretained placenta 3arisk 3aurea nitrogen 0aα-tocopherol 0abiomarker 0adairy cow 0adisease 0aretained placenta1 aFadden, A.N.1 aTraber, M.G.1 aBobe, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 July, v. 97, no. 7 p.4151-4165dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-71543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01580naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012100167520045100288592002800739650001200767650001400779650001700793650002100810653002500831653001300856653002400869653002200893653003000915700001700945700005500962700001601017773010301033856008501136852000901221655001201230IND60783705720221121235604.0220809e20220817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078370572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2022.1540292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Leilei10aCopper-catalyzed remote trifluoromethylthiolation-peroxidation of unactivated alkenes via 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer  aTrifluoromethylthiolation-peroxidation of unactivated alkenes using readily-available AgSCF₃ and tert-butyl hydroperoxide has been realized in the presence of the copper catalyst.

Total heavy metal concentrations were in the range 0.20–65.67 μg L⁻¹ (mean value of 12.95 μg L⁻¹) for DP, 1.37–601.77 μg L⁻¹ (mean value of 105.39 μg L⁻¹) for SPM and 14.62–157.33 mg kg⁻¹ (mean value of 55.24 mg kg⁻¹) for sediments. The total heavy metals input are evaluated in about 620.39 kg year⁻¹, suggesting that the river could be an important source of heavy metals in the Tyrrhenian Sea. The ecological risk characterisation was assessed based on the National Water Quality Criteria, by comparison with criterion concentration for chronic and acute toxicity (CCC and CMC), and sediment quality guidelines. Hg and Cd showed higher values than CMC and CCC for most water samples. The Index of Geoaccumulation (I gₑₒ), Contamination Factor, Contamination degree, Pollution Load Index (PLI) and Potential Ecological Risk Index were evaluated. According to I gₑₒ and PLI, the Volturno River was uncontaminated or moderately polluted by heavy metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute toxicity 3achemistry 3aecology 3aheavy metals 3aparticulates 3apollution load 3arisk 3arisk characterization 3arivers 3asediments 3awater quality 3aItaly 3aMediterranean Sea 3aTyrrhenian Sea 0aVolturno River 0acontaminant loads 0arisk assessment 0awater pollution1 aMontuori, Paolo1 aSarnacchiaro, Pasquale1 aDi Duca, Fabiana1 aCristina Giovinetti, Maria1 aPaola Provvisiero, Donatella1 aCavicchia, Carlo1 aTriassi, Maria0 tChemistry and ecology.g2022 Apr. 21, v. 38, no. 4 p.327-355dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12214x1029-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2022.20479503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245013600162300001400298520146400312592002801776596007901804596008201883650002601965650001401991650001002005650001302015650001302028650001502041650001902056650002202075653002602097653001902123653002202142653002202164653002802186700001902214700002002233773013102253856007502384852000902459655001202468IND60672696520221118012423.0191017e20181012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067269652DNAL7 a10.1093/bfgp/ely0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlyousfi, Dareen10aGene-specific metrics to facilitate identification of disease genes for molecular diagnosis in patient genomes: a systematic review  ap. 23-29.  aThe evolution of next-generation sequencing technologies has facilitated the detection of causal genetic variants in diseases previously undiagnosed at a molecular level. However, in genome sequencing studies, the identification of disease genes among a candidate gene list is often difficult because of the large number of apparently damaging (but usually neutral) variants. A number of variant prioritization tools have been developed to help detect disease-causal sites. However, the results may be misleading as many variants scored as damaging by these tools are often tolerated, and there are inconsistencies in prediction results among the different variant-level prediction tools. Recently, studies have indicated that understanding gene properties might improve detection of genes liable to have associated disease variation and that this information improves molecular diagnostics. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate how understanding gene-specific properties might improve filtering strategies in clinical sequence data to prioritize potential disease variants. Improved understanding of the ‘disease genome’, which includes coding, noncoding and regulatory variation, might help resolve difficult cases. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of existing gene-level approaches, the relationships between measures of gene-pathogenicity and how use of these prediction tools can be developed for molecular diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data  cSaudi Arabia Cultural Bureau in Londondhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100012363  cNational Institute for Health Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000272 3adiagnostic techniques 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenomics 3apatients 3aprediction 3aprioritization 3asystematic review 0agene-specific metrics 0adisease genome 0agene-level scores 0agene essentiality 0agene-specific filtering1 aBaralle, Diana1 aCollins, Andrew0 tBriefings in functional genomics.g2018 Oct. 12, v. 18, no. 1 p.23-29dOxford University PresswJournal:27071x2041-26577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bfgp/ely0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015400170300001400324520140600338592002801744650001801772650001701790650001501807650001201822650001001834650001601844650001401860650001701874650001901891650001701910650001201927650001401939650001001953651001301963653001401976653002901990653001602019653001502035653001702050653001202067653001702079700001902096700002002115700002802135773010002163856008202263852000902345655001202354IND60525129520221121060658.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052512952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcz.2016.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarria-S, Fabio A.10aWing mechanics, vibrational and acoustic communication in a new bush-cricket species of the genus Copiphora (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) from Colombia  ap. 55-65.  aMale bush-crickets produce acoustic signals by wing stridulation to call females.

Different from other Copiphora species in which the acoustic signals have been properly documented as pure tones, C. vigorosa males produce a complex modulated broadband call peaking at ca. 30kHz. Since males of this species do rarely sing, we also report that substratum vibrations have been adopted in this species as a persistent communication channel. Wing resonances and substratum vibrations were measured using a μ-scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometry. We found that the stridulatory areas of both wings exhibit a relatively broad-frequency response and the combined vibration outputs fits with the calling song spectrum breadth. The broadband calling song spectrum results from several wing resonances activated simultaneously during stridulation. Under laboratory conditions the calling song duty cycle is very low and males spend more time tremulating than singing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTettigoniidae 3abioacoustics 3abiophysics 3afemales 3amales 3anew species 3apredators 3arain forests 3arisk reduction 3astridulation 3atropics 3avibration 3awings 3aColombia 0aResonance 0aLaser Doppler Vibrometer 0aTremulation 0aUltrasound 0aBioacoustics 0aKatydid 0aBiotremology1 aBuxton, Kallum1 aJonsson, Thorin1 aMontealegre-Z, Fernando0 tZoologischer Anzeiger.g2016 July, v. 263 p.55-65dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6280x0044-52317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcz.2016.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013300168300001500301520161300316592002801929650001201957650001301969650001101982650002101993650001702014650001002031650000902041650001102050650001702061650003102078650003302109650001402142650001902156650001502175650000902190651001002199700001802209700001502227700001302242700001402255773009202269856008402361852000902445655001202454IND60085995620221118064308.0141101e20130212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008599562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2012.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Shasha10aDistribution of metals in water and suspended particulate matter during the resuspension processes in Taihu Lake sediment, China  ap. 94-102.  aIn this study, surface sediment from Zhushan Bay in Taihu Lake was subjected to resuspension under 6 different wind forces using a pneumatic annular flume. Water samples were taken at specific intervals, and the physicochemical parameters of the water column were monitored throughout the experiment. Concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn) in the sediment, water, and suspended particulate matter (SPM) were determined following standard methods. Total metal concentrations in overlying water increase with wind speed and the duration of the experiment. According to the principal component analysis (PCA), physicochemical factors, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and SPM all showed a close relationship with total metal content. Dissolved metal concentrations did not show significant variation. In contrast, a remarkable increase in the concentrations of metals was noted in the SPM in response to increases in wind speed and duration time of the study. Distribution coefficients (Kdₛ) of metals between particulate and dissolved fractions generally appeared in the following order: Pb > Cr > Zn > Cu > Cd > Ni under six different disturbance conditions. However, the enrichment factors (EFs) of particulate metals generally appeared in the following pattern with respect to concentration: Zn > Pb > Cr > Cd > Cu > Ni. In general, the values of both indicators were directly proportional with as water turbulence. The results of this study may serve as a reference for distribution rules of heavy metals in water columns and SPM during sediment resuspension processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3adissolved oxygen 3aheavy metals 3alakes 3alead 3anickel 3aparticulates 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprincipal component analysis 3asediments 3aturbulent flow 3awind speed 3azinc 3aChina1 aWang, Peifang1 aWang, Chao1 aHou, Jun1 aQian, Jin0 tQuaternary international.g2013 Feb. 12, v. 286 p.94-102dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2012.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002300167245008900190300001600279520108900295592002801384653002501412653000901437653001901446653001201465653001501477700002101492700002101513700002201534700001701556700002101573773011801594856010101712852000901813655001201822IND60130882120221118160439.0151127e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013088212DNAL7 a10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[167:BFIDRI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunt, W.

Deer offal piles are present and available to scavengers in autumn, and the degree of exposure depends upon incidence, abundance, and distribution of fragments per offal pile and carcass lost to wounding. In radiographs of selected portions of the remains of 38 deer supplied by cooperating, licensed hunters in 2002––2004, we found metal fragments broadly distributed along wound channels. Ninety-four percent of samples of deer killed with lead-based bullets contained fragments, and 90%% of 20 offal piles showed fragments: 5 with 0––9 fragments, 5 with 10––100, 5 with 100––199, and 5 showing >200 fragments. In contrast, we counted a total of only 6 fragments in 4 whole deer killed with copper expanding bullets. These findings suggest a high potential for scavenger exposure to lead.  aPublisher supplied data 0abullet fragmentation 0alead 0alead poisoning 0araptors 0ascavengers1 aBURNHAM, WILLIAM1 aPARISH, CHRIS N.1 aBurnham, Kurt K.,1 aMutch, BRIAN1 aOAKS, J.

However, the exact structures of CT-binding GM1 lipoforms of primary human colon epithelial cells (pHCoEpiCs) have not yet been described in detail. The same holds true for generating further GM1 receptor molecules from higher sialylated gangliosides with a GM1 core through the neuraminidase of V. cholerae. To avoid the artificial incorporation of exogenous gangliosides from animal serum harboring GM1 and higher sialylated ganglio-series gangliosides, pHCoEpiCs were cultured in serum-free medium. Thin-layer chromatography overlay binding assays using a choleragenoid combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed GM1 lipoforms with sphingosine (d18:1) as the sole sphingoid base linked to C14:0, C16:0, C18:0 or C20:0 fatty acyl chains forming the ceramide (Cer) moieties of the main choleragenoid-binding GM1 species. Desialylation of GD1a (IV³Neu5Ac,II³Neu5Ac-Gg4Cer) and GT1b (IV³Neu5Ac,II³(Neu5Ac)₂-Gg4Cer) of pHCoEpiCs by V. cholerae neuraminidase was observed. GD1a-derived GM1 species with stable sphingosine (d18:1) and saturated fatty acyl chains varying in chain length from C16:0 up to C22:0 could be identified, indicating the ingenious interplay between CT and the neuraminidase of V. cholerae recruiting additional GM1 receptors of pHCoEpiCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio cholerae 3ablood serum 3aceramides 3acholera toxin 3acolon 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aepithelium 3agangliosides 3ahumans 3asialidase 3asphingosine 3athin layer chromatography1 aPüttmann, Charlotte 1 aPohlentz, Gottfried 1 aMüthing, Johannes 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 June 20, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100612553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008200171520079800253592002801051650001301079650001701092650001701109650002901126650001901155650002101174650001601195653001801211653002101229653002101250653001901271653002701290700002701317700002701344700002601371700002701397773010301424856008501527852000901612655001201621IND60783705920221120045400.0220809e20220817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078370592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2022.1540402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBautista, Elihú10aJatrophenediol, a pseudoguaiane sesquiterpenoid from Jatropha dioica rhizomes  aJatrophenediol (1), a new pseudoguaiane sesquiterpenoid was isolated from the roots of Jatropha dioica, together with the known diterpenoids citlalitrione (2) and jatropolones A and B (3 and 4).

Interestingly, the mixture of compounds 3/4 in three different ratios at 25 μg/mL increased the sensitivity to vinblastine by 7–10-fold.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha 3acytotoxicity 3aditerpenoids 3amultiple drug resistance 3aneoplasm cells 3asesquiterpenoids 3avinblastine 0aEuphorbiaceae 0aJatropha species 0aSesquiterpenoids 0aMDR modulation 0aStructural elucidation1 aLozano-Gamboa, Sarahí1 aFragoso-Serrano, Mabel1 aRivera-Chávez, José1 aSalazar-Olivo, Luis A.0 tTetrahedron letters.g2022 Aug. 17, v. 104 p.154040-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2022.1540403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013000167300001600297520127900313536015601592592002801748596007201776650001801848650003501866650001201901650001401913650001201927650001801939650001901957650002901976650002302005650001402028650001102042650000902053653001002062653001402072653001602086653002702102700003602129700002202165773011502187856008602302852000902388655001202397IND60778241820221119204309.0220524e20220421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077824182DNAL7 a10.1080/02757540.2022.20488242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFojt, Pavel10aPossible use of terrestrial gastropod (Helix aspersa aspersa) and its life stages as a tool for environmental risk assessment  ap. 389-399.  aThis paper presents a laboratory study using terrestrial gastropods. Two different life stages of a cosmopolitan terrestrial gastropod Helix aspersa aspersa (syn. Cantareus aspersus or Cornu aspersum) were used. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of cadmium on a target organism (H. aspersa aspersa) and the possible transfer of cadmium to the snail tissues. The sensitivity of different snails’ life stages exposed to different levels of cadmium was evaluated. The ecotoxicity tests for juvenile snails were performed according to ISO 15952:2018 standard and lasted for 28 days. During that period, the growth inhibition (both in mass and shell diameter) was observed. The embryotoxicity experiments lasted for 14 days and the hatching success was evaluated. The IC₅₀ (inhibition concentration) values for juveniles and eggs were calculated as 68.2 and 7.6 mg/L of Cd²⁺, respectively. All individuals were frozen for the determination of cadmium content by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The results proved the increased levels of cadmium in the tissues while the mass of the snails decreased. Our results confirm that snail H. aspersa aspersa (and its life stages) is a very suitable laboratory organism for soil ecotoxicity assessment.  aThis work was supported by the institution research numb er FCH-S-22-8001 from the Ministry of Education and by Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinistry of Education and by Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic 3aHelix aspersa 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3achemistry 3aecology 3aecotoxicology 3aembryotoxicity 3aenvironmental assessment 3agrowth retardation 3ajuveniles 3asnails 3asoil 0asnail 0agastropod 0aterrestrial 0aheavy metals pollution1 aZlámalová-Gargošová, Helena1 aJežek, Stanislav0 tChemistry and ecology.g2022 Apr. 21, v. 38, no. 4 p.389-399dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12214x1029-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2022.20488243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014100156300001800297500002000315520113200335592002801467650001501495650001501510650001501525650001601540650004301556650001401599650001101613650001601624650001701640650002601657650001101683650002301694650001901717700001801736700002001754700001801774700001601792773015201808856007401960852000902034655001202043IND60594346520221120152301.0180511e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059434652DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.137292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Caixia10aPurification of polyphenols from kiwi fruit peel extracts using macroporous resins and high‐performance liquid chromatography analysis  ap. 1486-1493.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn efficient strategy for the purification of polyphenols from kiwi fruit peel extracts was developed in this study. Six different macroporous resins were evaluated in static adsorption and desorption tests, and NKA‐II resin was used for further test because of its high adsorption capacity (21.28 mg g⁻¹ dry resin) and desorption ratio (84.92%). The adsorption mechanism of the NKA‐II resin indicated that pseudo‐second‐order kinetics and the Freundlich isotherm model could adequately explain the adsorption process, and the thermodynamic tests showed that the process was endothermic, spontaneous and feasible. Furthermore, by optimising the dynamic adsorption and desorption parameters, the purity of the final polyphenols improved dramatically from 33.2% to 55.26%. In addition, the qualitative and quantitative determinations of the polyphenols before and after purification were conducted by a high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The results of this study showed that the developed method provided a promising basis for the large‐scale purification of polyphenols from kiwi fruit peel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3aendothermy 3afruit peels 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3akiwifruit 3amodels 3apolyphenols 3aporous media 3aquantitative analysis 3aresins 3asorption isotherms 3athermodynamics1 aQiao, Jinping1 aZhang, Shengwan1 aRen, Xiaoting1 aLi, Meiping0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2018 June, v. 53, no. 6 p.1486-1493dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.137293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01285naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008900165520033600254592002800590653002000618653002300638653001400661653001800675700001200693700002100705700001600726700001700742700001500759773010300774856008500877852000900962655001200971IND60783706020221120022650.0220809e20220817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078370602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2022.1540412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jianji10aHypervalent iodine-induced disulfenylation of thiophene derivatives with thiophenols  aA hypervalent iodine-induced disulfenylation of thiophene derivatives with thiophenols via a thiyl radical reaction pathway has been achieved.

Different technologies include base load units, such as thermal and water units, and peak load units such as gas turbine. In this model, subsidies are considered as a means to encourage investment in wind turbines. In order that the uncertainties related to demand and the wind turbine can be taken into consideration, these effects are modelled using a variety of scenarios. In addition, the load demand is characterized by a certain number of demand blocks. The first-level relates to the issue of investment in different load ranges of power plants with a view to maximizing the investment profit whilst the second level is related to the market-clearing where the priority is to maximize the social welfare benefits. The bi-level optimization problem is then converted to a dynamic stochastic mathematical algorithm with equilibrium constraint (MPEC) and represented as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) after linearization. The proposed framework is examined on a real transmission network. Simulation results confirm that the proposed framework can be a useful tool for analyzing the investments different load ranges of power plants on long-term strategic decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adecision making 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3alinear programming 3amarkets 3amodels 3aplanning 3apower plants 3asocial welfare 3asubsidies 3auncertainty 3awind 3awind power 3awind turbines1 aMarzband, Mousa1 aFunsho Akorede, Mudathir1 aD Elliott, Ian1 aGodina, Radu1 aMatias, João Carlos O.,1 aPouresmaeil, Edris0 tSustainability.g2018 Oct. 22, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101038113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04197naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003200129024002200161024001900183040001800202100002000220245009100240506007600331506003100407520181700438592002802255596006902283596003502352506003702387650002502424650002102449650001002470650001502480650001302495650002102508650002002529650000902549650002202558650001802580650002702598650002602625650001602651650002202667650002302689650001002712650001002722650001202732650001502744650000902759650001602768650001402784650003002798650002202828650002502850650001902875650001502894650001602909650001602925653003302941653002502974653002102999653001303020653002203033653002003055653002203075700001503097700002303112700001903135700001903154700001903173773012303192856007903315852000903394655001203403IND60672696820221215142355.0191017e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067269682DNAL7 a10.3945/cdn.117.0018262chorus7 a10.3945/cdn.117.0018262doi7 aPMC61112372pmcid7 a301675702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShankar, Kartik10aEnvironmental Forces that Shape Early Development: What We Know and Still Need to Know  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aUnderstanding health requires more than knowledge of the genome. Environmental factors regulate gene function through epigenetics. Collectively, environmental exposures have been called the “exposome.” Caregivers are instrumental in shaping exposures in a child's initial years. Maternal dietary patterns, physical activity, degree of weight gain, and body composition while pregnant will influence not only fetal growth, but also the infant's metabolic response to nutrients and energy. Maternal over- or underweight, excess caloric intake, nutrient imbalances, glucose dysregulation, and presence of chronic inflammatory states have been shown to establish risk for many later chronic diseases. During the period from birth to age 3 y, when the infant's metabolic rate is high and synaptogenesis and myelination of the brain are occurring extremely rapidly, the infant is especially prone to damaging effects from nutrient imbalances. During this period, the infant changes from a purely milk-based diet to one including a wide variety of foods. The process, timing, quality, and ultimate dietary pattern acquired are a direct outcome of the caregiver-infant feeding relationship, with potentially lifelong consequences. More research on how meal time interactions shape food acceptance is needed to avoid eating patterns that augment existing disease risk. Traditional clinical trials in nutrition, meant to isolate single factors for study, are inadequate to study the highly interconnected realm of environment-gene interactions in early life. Novel technologies are being used to gather broad exposure data on disparate populations, employing pioneering statistical approaches and correlations applied specifically to the individual, based on their genetic make-up and unique environmental experiences.  aPublisher supplied data  a6026-51000-010-05ScUSDA-ARSdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cThe Cardinal Health Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochemical pathways 3abody composition 3abrain 3acaregivers 3achildren 3achronic diseases 3aclinical trials 3adiet 3aearly development 3aenergy intake 3aenvironmental exposure 3aenvironmental factors 3aepigenetics 3afetal development 3afood acceptability 3afoods 3agenes 3aglucose 3ametabolism 3amilk 3amyelination 3anutrients 3anutrition risk assessment 3aphysical activity 3astatistical analysis 3asynaptogenesis 3atechnology 3aunderweight 3aweight gain 0aenvironment-gene interaction 0amaternal weight gain 0amaternal obesity 0aplacenta 0abrain development 0aearly childhood 0achildhood obesity1 aPivik, R T1 aJohnson, Susan L.,1 avan Ommen, Ben1 aDemmer, Elieke1 aMurray, Robert0 tCurrent developments in nutrition.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 2, no. 8dOxford University PresswJournal:27055x2475-29917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3945/cdn.117.0018263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011300157300001800270500002000288520123200308592002801540650001401568650002101582650002101603650003301624650001101657650000701668650001701675650001201692650003301704650001401737650002001751650001901771650002801790650001801818700002701836700002001863700001901883773015201902856007402054852000902128655001202137IND60594346720221120142303.0180511e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059434672DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.137202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Rafiq10aEffect of amino acid, pH and mineral salts on glass transition and flow behaviour of soy protein concentrate  ap. 1425-1433.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this study was to assess the effect of proline, mineral salts (NaCl and Na₂SO₄) and pH combined with moisture content on the glass transition temperature (Tg) and flow‐starting temperature (Tf) of soy protein concentrate (SPC). Initial screening of the variables based on fractional factorial design showed insignificant effect of NaCl on Tg and Tf. The design was extended to a face‐centred central composite design (CCD) excluding NaCl and data evaluated by use of response surface methodology. The established model for Tg (R² = 0.824) shows significant negative first‐order effects of moisture, proline and Na₂SO₄, and a positive interaction effect of moisture and Na₂SO₄. The Tf model (R² = 0.937) shows significant negative first‐order effects of moisture and proline, a positive first‐order and negative square effect of pH, and a negative interaction effect of moisture and proline. The main effect on Tg and Tf was 2.2 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, for moisture compared to proline. The study confirms that proline (or other free amino acids) can replace moisture as protein plasticiser in the extrusion process. Minor effects can also be obtained by reduction in pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aextrusion 3afree amino acids 3aglass transition 3aglass transition temperature 3amodels 3apH 3aplasticizers 3aproline 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascreening 3asodium chloride 3asodium sulfate 3asoy protein concentrate 3awater content1 aSamuelsen, Tor Andreas1 aGarvik, Anne B.1 aOterhals, Åge0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2018 June, v. 53, no. 6 p.1425-1433dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.137203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014000168300001600308520108000324536031801404592002801722596001301750596001701763650001901780650001701799650001401816650000901830653003101839653001601870653002101886653003001907653002301937700001601960700001801976700001601994700001302010700001702023700001602040773014502056856008602201852000902287655001202296IND60778242120220524000000.0220524e20220607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077824212DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2020.18584792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Tinghong10aEffects of potassium fertilization on crops yield, potassium uptake, and soil potassium fertility in rice-oilseed rape cropping systems  ap. 873-885.  aTo determine the impact of K fertilization on crop yields and soil K supplying capacity in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) rotation, four field experiments were conducted with five K fertilizer rates: 0 (K0), 90–147 (K1), 180–210 (K2), 270–300 (K3) and 336–390 (K4) kg K₂O ha⁻¹ per rotation. Compared with K0, adding K increased the yield of rice and oilseed rape by 4.2–8.9% and 7.5–32.6%, respectively. Potassium fertilization increased K uptake at four sites, whereas yields remained stagnant in K2, K3, and K4 treatments despite increasing K uptake. Continuous K removal decreased soil K supplying capacity. For the 0 to 20 cm and 20 to 40 cm soil depths, the NH₄OAc-K and boiling HNO₃-K at the harvest were decreased in K0 and K1 treatments, whereas it maintained or increased in K2, K3, and K4 treatments, although negative K balances were recorded at all sites. It suggests that application 180–210 kg K₂O ha–¹ in rice-oilseed rape cropping systems improved crop yield and maintained soil potassium fertility.  aThis research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571284], International Potash Institute Co-operation Program and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2662017JC010].

Under this frame, a large contiguous surface involving numerous owners is subject to a single management plan, providing an opportunity for cooperation. Since 2005, 161 zones have been created but only half of them have had their management plan approved and very few are nearing its implementation.Cooperation amongst private forest owners has usually been explained at the owner level. In an approach at the local level we examine local constraints and key-factors for cooperative landscape management. Building on the theory of collective action, a typology of FIZ/territories is established by Cluster Analysis using a group of ecological and socioeconomic variables expressing the characteristics of natural resources, owners⿿ group, institutional arrangements, and external environment of FIZs.Three clusters are identified. Where FIZs are smaller and biophysical resources impose greater wildfire susceptibility, the transaction costs for collective management are highest due to more numerous, aged, and dispersed owners and the absence of a land registry. Conversely, larger FIZs have fewer owners, more powerful management bodies, and higher public financial incentives, leading to greater performance rate. Nonetheless, since their resources are less fire-prone, and private profitability is higher, public support for collective action has a lower social return.Addressing the heterogeneity of local systems of ecological and socioeconomic constraints is therefore a challenge faced by public policy makers seeking to mitigate wildfire risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3acollective action 3aeconomic incentives 3aforest management 3aforests 3alandscape management 3aprivate forestry 3aprofitability 3apublic policy 3arisk 3asocioeconomic factors 3awildfires 3aPortugal 0aCollective action 0aForest management 0aWildfire risk 0aPrivate forest owners 0aTerritorial context 0aFire management policies1 aNovais, Ana1 aMarques, Marco0 tLand use policy.g2016 Nov., v. 56 p.179-188dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.04.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245013400208500001900342520138300361592002801744650001801772650001501790650002001805650003101825650001301856650002001869650001701889650001601906650001501922650001101937650001401948650005001962650002202012650001002034650002002044650003302064650001202097653000802109653000802117653000902125653000802134653000902142653000802151653000702159653001002166653000902176653000802185653001302193653001002206653000802216653000802224653001402232653001402246653001502260653003602275653006402311653001202375700002002387700001902407700001802426773012602444856008502570852000902655655001202664IND60718220920221121220600.0201230e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071822092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2020.1101472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, In-Byung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8646-870910aTranscriptome analysis of pig macrophages expressing porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus non-structural protein 1  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a causative pathogen of PRRS, one of the most economically disastrous swine diseases. Non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) of PRRSV consists of NSP1α and NSP1β which exhibit papain like cysteine protease activity. Recent evidence demonstrates that PRRSV NSP1 may be participated in modulating host immunity, but very few host proteins were discovered as targets for NSP1. In this study, we used RNA-seq to investigate the functional role of PRRSV NSP1 in porcine alveolar macrophages, 3D4/31 cells. Compared to empty vector (mock) transfectant, NSP1, NSP1α, and NSP1β expressing 3D4/31 cells displayed a total of 60 genes, 63 genes, and 80 genes as differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. Most of DEGs are involved in early inflammatory responses including interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α signaling pathway, and cell adhesion molecules. Interestingly, PRRSV NSP1 expression in 3D4/31 cells decreased mRNA transcripts of Fosb and Gdf15 known to be involved in host cell signaling or host cell protection during inflammation. Therefore, PRRSV NSP1 might block the signaling involved in host immune surveillance. Further study is required to define the mechanism on how PRRSV NSP1 protein represses mRNA transcripts of specific host genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell adhesion 3achemokines 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression regulation 3aimmunity 3aimmunopathology 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amonitoring 3apapain 3apathogens 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3asequence analysis 3aswine 3atranscriptomics 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3aviruses 0aDEG 0aFDR 0aFPKM 0aGEO 0amock 0aIFN 0aIL 0aISGF3 0aNCBI 0aNSP 0apoly I:C 0aPRRSV 0aSRA 0aTNF 0aHost cell 0aInfection 0aMacrophage 0aNon-structural protein 1 (NSP1) 0aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) 0aRNA-seq1 aChoi, Yong-Chan1 aLee, Kyung-Tai1 aChun, Taehoon0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2021 Jan., v. 231 p.110147-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2020.1101473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013400166500001400300520130100314592002801615650001501643650003001658650002001688650001101708650000901719650001001728650002101738650001301759650001001772650001301782653002001795653003101815653001601846653001801862653002601880653003001906700001601936773011601952856008702068852000902155655001202164IND60707477820221117032731.0201104e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070747782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1132422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNondy, J.10aComparative performance analysis of four different combined power and cooling systems integrated with a topping gas turbine plant  aNAL-light  aIn this paper, the performances of four combined power and cooling systems are compared in which the exhaust heat of a topping gas turbine plant is utilized for further power and cooling generation. Steam turbines (STs) and organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) are used for power generation by integrating those in a completely different arrangement in the first two systems while the third and fourth systems use ST based power cycles. The first and the fourth configuration uses two absorption cooling systems (ACSs) driven respectively by steam and exhaust heat. In the second and third systems, however, only one ACS is used. Energy and exergy based parametric analyses are done, showing the performance variations with HRSG steam pressure from 89 to 94 bar for comparing the CPC systems. The fourth system was found to be the most appropriate from the energetic and exergetic performance viewpoint with the first system to follow. Despite an additional ACS, the total irreversibility of the first and the fourth systems was found almost equivalent to that of the second system. Only in the third system, the total plant irreversibility was relatively less compared to the first and the fourth. It was found that the GT plant alone contributes more than 95% irreversibility in all the four systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadministrative management 3acooling systems 3aexergy 3aheat 3apaper 3apower generation 3apressure 3asteam 3aturbines 0aExergy analysis 0aCombined power and cooling 0aGas turbine 0aSteam turbine 0aOrganic Rankine cycle 0aAbsorption cooling system1 aGogoi, T.K.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 223 p.113242-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1132423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02003naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245011400177300001400291520101700305592002801322650002401350650002101374650001501395650001401410650001201424650001101436650001701447773010701464856008601571990002301657852000901680655001201689IND60113263820221120184403.0141111e20130915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011326382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2013.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBieniasz, Lesław K.10aAutomatic solution of integral equations describing electrochemical transients at dropping mercury electrodes  ap. 44-51.  aPolarographic experiments at dropping mercury electrodes belong to the classics of electroanalytical techniques. Theoretical modelling and computer simulation of such experiments is often based on the expanding plane model, which in the absence of homogeneous reactions is represented by one-dimensional convection–diffusion partial differential equations. The latter equations can be converted to integral equations involving a specific kernel function. In the present study, the adaptive Huber method, recently elaborated by the present author, has been extended to handle such a kernel function. The resulting simulation technique has been tested on examples of integral equations representing simple models of D.C. and A.C. polarography. The method is shown to provide automatic solutions, with a user-selected target accuracy. Errors corresponding to the range from about 10⁻² of the maximum solution value, down to about 10⁻⁷ or even smaller, can be easily achieved at a modest computational cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer simulation 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aequations 3amercury 3amodels 3apolarography0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 705 p.44-51dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2013.07.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245013500204300001800339500001500357506007600372520185100448592002802299506003702327650001602364650001802380650001302398650004202411650002002453650002202473650001302495650001002508650001302518650001502531650002502546650002202571650002502593650001702618653001002635700001902645700001502664700001402679700001602693700001302709700002202722700001302744700001502757773012202772856008102894852000902975655001202984IND60548313120221207124927.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054831312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-016-2736-92doi7 aPMC49832942pmcid7 a273164372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Ning12aA highly robust and optimized sequence-based approach for genetic polymorphism discovery and genotyping in large plant populations  ap. 1739-1757.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aKEY MESSAGE : This optimized approach provides both a computational tool and a library construction protocol, which can maximize the number of genomic sequence reads that uniformly cover a plant genome and minimize the number of sequence reads representing chloroplast DNA and rRNA genes. One can implement the developed computational tool to feasibly design their own RAD-seq experiment to achieve expected coverage of sequence variant markers for large plant populations using information of the genome sequence and ideally, though not necessarily, information of the sequence polymorphism distribution in the genome. Advent of the next generation sequencing techniques motivates recent interest in developing sequence-based identification and genotyping of genome-wide genetic variants in large populations, with RAD-seq being a typical example. Without taking proper account for the fact that chloroplast and rRNA genes may occupy up to 60 % of the resulting sequence reads, the current RAD-seq design could be very inefficient for plant and crop species. We presented here a generic computational tool to optimize RAD-seq design in any plant species and experimentally tested the optimized design by implementing it to screen for and genotype sequence variants in four plant populations of diploid and autotetraploid Arabidopsis and potato Solanum tuberosum. Sequence data from the optimized RAD-seq experiments shows that the undesirable chloroplast and rRNA contributed sequence reads can be controlled at 3–10 %. Additionally, the optimized RAD-seq method enables pre-design of the required uniformity and density in coverage of the high quality sequence polymorphic markers over the genome of interest and genotyping of large plant or crop populations at a competitive cost in comparison to other mainstream rivals in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aribosomal RNA 3adiploidy 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3achloroplast DNA 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apotatoes 3agenes 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 3agenetic polymorphism 3achloroplasts 0acrops1 aZhang, Fengjun1 aWu, Jinhua1 aChen, Yue1 aHu, Xiaohua1 aFang, Ou1 aLeach, Lindsey J.1 aWang, Di1 aLuo, Zewei0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2016 Sept., v. 129, no. 9 p.1739-1757dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-016-2736-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003500150245015800185520187000343592002802213650001802241650001602259650001902275650001102294650002202305650002602327650001402353650002202367650003002389650001102419650003002430651001802460653001302478653004002491653003002531653002802561700003602589700002902625773010302654856008502757852000902842655001202851IND60654523620221121103615.0190807e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065452362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2019.1009852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrera Montiel, Sobeyda Arely10aPredicted changes in the potential distribution of seerfish (Scomberomorus sierra) under multiple climate change scenarios in the Colombian Pacific Ocean  aSome projections predict that fishery resources in tropical areas will be negatively affected by climate change, resulting in the displacement of species and reducing their availability for fishing. In this study, the potential geographic distribution of Scomberomorus sierra under current conditions in the Colombian Pacific Ocean was simulated using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling software, based on species presence data and satellite-derived environmental variables (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Chlorophyll-a and bathymetry). The future distributions of S. sierra in 2020s (short term) and 2080s (long term) were projected under the RCP 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios for four ensembled global circulation models (GCM) obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The current and future geographical distributions were modeled for the species' fishing months (November to April), and pixel-wise change distribution and core shift were determined. The results indicated good performance for the distribution models in the present and future scenarios (AUC > 0.9). The RCP 8.5 scenario, in both, the short and long term, indicated the highest adverse changes in the species distribution. The distribution core shift indicates that under RCP 2.6 in the 2020s for November and December, the shift is towards the central zone of the Colombian Pacific. In the 2080s (long term), the distribution centroid tends to move towards the central zone, further from the coastline. Results also showed the same change tendency for RCP 8.5 in both the 2020s and 2080s. This is one of the first studies that elucidate the effects of climate change on a commercial species in the Colombian Pacific. The results give an insight into future management strategies for seerfish fisheries, which can also be used as a reference for studying other species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScomberomorus 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental factors 3afisheries 3afishery resources 3ageographical distribution 3amodels 3asurface water temperature 3aPacific Ocean 0aSeerfish 0aPotential geographical distribution 0aGlobal circulation models 0aColombian Pacific Ocean1 aCoronado-Franco, Karold Viviana1 aSelvaraj, John Josephraj0 tEcological informatics.g2019 Sept., v. 53 p.100985-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2019.1009853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245019500167520104300362592002801405650001301433650001201446650002701458650002001485650002101505650003101526650002101557650002501578650001801603650001501621650001101636650001901647650002101666650002501687653002501712653003201737653002601769653002101795700001601816700001801832700001601850700001601866700001801882773010601900856008702006852000902093655001202102IND60778575720221120121048.0220621e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077857572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1273732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chao10aAchieving simultaneous nitrification, denitrification, and phosphorus removal in pilot-scale flow-through biofilm reactor with low dissolved oxygen concentrations: Performance and mechanisms  aIn this pilot-scale study, a flow-through biofilm reactor (FTBR) was investigated for municipal wastewater treatment. The removal efficiencies for ammonium, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chemical oxygen demand were 87.2 ± 17.9%, 61.1 ± 13.9%, 83.5 ± 11.9%, and 92.6 ± 1.7%, respectively, at low dissolved oxygen concentrations (averaged at 0.59 mg/L), indicating the feasibility and robustness of the FTBR for a simultaneous nitrification, denitrification, and phosphorous removal (SNDPR) process. The co-occurrence network of bacteria in the dynamic biofilm was complex, with equivalent bacterial cooperation and competition. Nevertheless, the bacterial interactions in the suspended sludge were mainly cooperative. The presence of dynamic biofilms increased bacterial diversity by creating niche differentiation, which enriched keystone species closely related to nutrient removal. Overall, this study provides a novel FTBR-based SNDPR process and reveals the ecological mechanisms responsible for nutrient removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3abiofilm 3achemical oxygen demand 3adenitrification 3adissolved oxygen 3aecological differentiation 3akeystone species 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrification 3aphosphorus 3asludge 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awastewater treatment 0aMunicipal wastewater 0aBiological nutrient removal 0aCo-occurrence network 0aKeystone species1 aLin, Qining1 aYao, Yuanyuan1 aXu, Ronghua1 aWu, Xueshen1 aMeng, Fangang0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Aug., v. 358 p.127373-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1273733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02064naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245006600167500001900233520104100252592002801293650001901321650001101340650001301351650002401364650001501388650001201403650001101415653002501426653003201451653001401483700001501497773010801512856008501620852000901705655001201714IND60714995120221119054101.0201209e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071499512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1066242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernardo, P.10aMembrane engineering for a sustainable production of ethylene  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe existing processes producing light olefins are highly energy intensive, requiring innovative approaches. Membrane engineering, as already demonstrated in different fields, can have an interesting share in the shift towards sustainable productions. The current abundant availability of ‘shale gas’ requires sustainable choices and a delocalized approach that avoids underutilization or waste of methane. This scenario is highly favourable for new technologies such as the Membrane Reactors that are advanced reactors in the Process Intensification logic. Membrane Reactors can accomplish the methane conversion to ethylene, valorizing these resources. In addition, being modular and automated, they are particularly suited for dislocated/remote locations. At the same time, Membrane Reactors can exploit the potential of CO₂ as feedstock through a recycle strategy. Different conversion options and the most promising membrane-based alternatives are described, proposing their integration for a sustainable ethylene production.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3afeedstocks 3amethane 3awastes 0aMembrane engineering 0aIntegrated membrane systems 0aShale gas1 aDrioli, E.0 tFuel processing technology.g2021 Feb., v. 212 p.106624-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1066243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01740naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245003300211300001400244500001100258520077600269592002801045650001801073650001401091650001001105650001301115650002201128650001501150700002401165773008801189856008101277990002301358852000901381655001201390IND60113491920221119141054.0141111e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011349192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tig.2012.10.0102doi7 aPMC35585402pmcid7 a231409892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaaby, Annalise B.14aThe many faces of pleiotropy  ap. 66-73.  aREVIEW  aPleiotropy is the well-established phenomenon of a single gene affecting multiple traits. It has long played a central role in theoretical, experimental, and clinical research in genetics, development, molecular biology, evolution, and medicine. In recent years, genomic techniques have brought data to bear on fundamental questions about the nature and extent of pleiotropy. However, these efforts are plagued by conceptual difficulties derived from disparate meanings and interpretations of pleiotropy. Here, we describe distinct uses of the pleiotropy concept and explain the pitfalls associated with applying empirical data to them.

Despite the numerous advantages of this technology as compared to others, it is necessary to optimize the process to produce high-quality graphene at industrial scale. In this research, the influence of the ethanol flows in the 2.00 to 4.00 g h⁻¹ range on the production rate and the quality of graphene has been thoroughly assessed, through a deep characterization of the synthetized material by various techniques. The graphene production rate steadily increased for ethanol flows increasing from 2.00 to 3.40 g h⁻¹, presenting a maximum rate of 1.45 and 1.55 mg min⁻¹ for 2.90 and 3.40 g h⁻¹, respectively. Higher ethanol flows lead to a decrease in the production rate, favouring the formation of other carbon-based by-products such as methane and ethylene. High-quality graphene is formed in all plasma conditions, with the lowest number of defects being obtained for an ethanol flow of 2.90 g h⁻¹ together with hydrogen and carbon monoxide as main gaseous by-products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3abiofuels 3acarbon monoxide 3aethanol 3aethylene 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3amethane 0aPlasma 0aMicrowave 0aProduction rate1 aRincón, R.1 aMuñoz, J.,1 aAnia, C.O.1 aCalzada, M.D.0 tFuel processing technology.g2021 Feb., v. 212 p.106630-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1066303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245015200155300001800307520202800325592002802353650001202381650001302393650001402406650002602420650001602446650001302462650001802475650001302493650001102506650001702517650002102534700002202555700001302577700002702590773009902617856007502716852000902791655001202800IND60577046920221118223146.0170806e20140603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057704692DNAL7 a10.1021/la501233w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shuo10aAdjusting the Surface Areal Density of Click-Reactive Azide Groups by Kinetic Control of the Azide Substitution Reaction on Bromine-Functional SAMs  ap. 6071-6078.  aAzide–alkyne click chemistry has emerged as an important and versatile means for tethering a wide variety of guest molecules to virtually any substrate. In many of these applications, it is important to exercise control over the areal density of surface functional groups to achieve a desired areal density of the tethered guest molecule of interest. We demonstrate herein that the areal density of surface azide groups on flat germanium surfaces and nanoparticle substrates (silica and iron oxide) can be controlled kinetically by appropriately timed quenching of the SN2 substitution reaction of bromo-alkane-silane monolayers induced by the addition of sodium azide. The kinetics of the azide substitution reaction on monolayers formed on flat Ge substrates, determined by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), are found to be identical to those for monolayers formed on both silica and iron oxide nanoparticles, the latter determined by transmission infrared spectroscopy. To validate the method, the percentages of surface bromine groups converted to azide groups after various reaction times were measured by quenching the SN2 reaction followed by analysis with ATR-IR (for Ge) and thermogravimetric analysis (after a subsequent click reaction with an alkyne-terminal polymer) for the nanoparticle substrates. The conversions found after quenching agree well with those expected from the standard kinetic curves. The latter result suggests that the kinetic method for the control of azide group areal density is a versatile means for functionalizing substrates with a prescribed areal density of azide groups for subsequent click reactions, and that the method is universal for any substrate, flat or nanoparticle, that can be modified with bromo-alkane-silane monolayers. Regardless of the surface geometry, we find that the azide substitution reaction is complete within 2–3 h, in sharp contrast to previous reports that indicate times of 48–60 h required for completion of the reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromine 3ageometry 3agermanium 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3airon oxides 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3apolymers 3asilica 3asodium azide 3athermogravimetry1 aMaidenberg, Yanir1 aLuo, Kai1 aKoberstein, Jeffrey T.0 tLangmuir.g2014 June 03, v. 30, no. 21 p.6071-6078dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla501233w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04402naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005800152245015600210500001400366520248800380592002802868650001302896650003002909650002802939650001202967650001202979650001902991650001903010650001803029650002903047650002003076650002503096650001403121650002203135650001503157650001203172650002903184650001403213650001703227650002603244650001903270650001803289650001103307650001503318650001403333650001603347650001103363650001603374650001103390653003203401653003203433653002203465653004103487700001603528700002003544773011603564856008703680852000903767655001203776IND60707478120221117032453.0201104e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070747812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1132582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Fangwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6589-274910aSlow pyrolysis as a platform for negative emissions technology: An integration of machine learning models, life cycle assessment, and economic analysis  aNAL-light  aBiochar sequestration has gained increasing attention as a negative emissions technology to mitigate climate change. Although pyrolysis is a commercial technology, comprehensive environmental and economic assessments have been difficult to perform since biochar can be produced from a wide range of feedstocks and pyrolysis conditions. Many researchers have evaluated the environmental and economic impacts of biochar-based CO₂ sequestration systems. However, most studies either worked on a single type of biomass under varying pyrolysis conditions or multiple feedstocks under the same pyrolysis conditions. To address this knowledge gap, we evaluated the energy, climate change, and economic performance of slow pyrolysis of multiple feedstocks under various processing conditions via the integration of machine learning approaches, life cycle assessment (LCA), and economic analysis. Machine learning models (i.e., random forest) were developed by fitting existing laboratory data. The models were then used to predict the yields and characteristics of biochar produced from slow pyrolysis of different feedstocks under designed processing conditions. The results were further integrated with LCA and economic analysis to compute three important metrics: energy return on investment (EROI), net global warming potential (GWP), and minimum product selling price (MPSP). The results indicate that random forest models offer good prediction accuracy for laboratory-scale (R² = 0.78–0.87) and pilot-scale pyrolysis data (R² = 0.45–0.65). LCA and economic analyses reveal that feedstock characteristics and pyrolysis temperature affect energy, climate change, and financial performance. Our results demonstrate slow pyrolysis of crop residues and woody wastes holds promise as an energy-producing negative emissions technology, with EROI values from 1.9 to 3.6 (without substitution) and 2.4 to 4.3 (with substitution), and GWP values from −470 kg CO₂ eq/t to −200 kg CO₂ eq/t (without substitution) and −1050 kg CO₂ eq/t to −770 kg CO₂ eq/t (with substitution). The MSPS values evaluated in this study range from $774–1256/t, depending on temperature and feedstocks. A tradeoff between environmental and economic performance is observed. The best overall energy and climate change performances are achieved via pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass at high temperature, while the best MPSP is achieved with the pyrolysis of sludge at low temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3aadministrative management 3aartificial intelligence 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acrop residues 3adecision support systems 3aeconomic impact 3aeconomic performance 3aemissions 3aenergy conversion 3afeedstocks 3afinance 3aglobal warming potential 3aknowledge 3alaboratories 3alife cycle assessment 3alignocellulose 3amarket prices 3amodels 3aprediction 3apyrolysis 3aresearchers 3asludge 3atemperature 3ayields 0aBiochar, Random forest (RF) 0aLife cycle assessment (LCA) 0aEconomic analysis 0aNegative emission technologies (NET)1 aLuo, Hongxi1 aColosi, Lisa M.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 223 p.113258-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1132583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245009800176300001800274500001500292520135600307592002801663650001201691650001901703650001501722650002101737650003101758650001401789650001101803650001701814653001501831700001401846700002001860700001901880700001701899700001801916700001701934700001701951773008701968856009002055852000902145655001202154IND60090349820221116235202.0141102e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009034982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHung, Chia-Nung12aA comparison between adipose tissue and dental pulp as sources of MSCs for tooth regeneration  ap. 6995-7005.  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, several in vivo and in vitro comparisons were performed to test the possibility of using adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), a more convenient cell source than dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), in tooth regeneration. Using an efficient, non-engineering implantation method, we first demonstrated that both implants of ADSCs and DPSCs were able to grow self-assembled new teeth in adult rabbit extraction sockets with high success rate. The stem cells were necessary because the implants grew no tooth without them. A stepwise comparison showed that the regenerated teeth from these two types of adult stem cells were living with nerves and vascular system and remarkably similar to a normal tooth in many details. Further strictly controlled, side-by-side comparisons between the two types of stem cells also showed that the expression patterns of gene markers and the broad differentiation potentials induced by specific methods in vitro were very similar. Although a few differences were found, they did not affect the tested tooth regeneration in vivo or differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, rabbit ADSCs had a higher growth rate and a better senescence resistance in culture. All these findings suggest that ADSCs, one of the richest adult stem cells in mammals, are very similar and useful as DPSCs for regenerative dentistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3arabbits 3aadipose tissue 3atooth pulp 3aadult stem cells 3agene expression regulation 3adentistry 3aadults 3anerve tissue 0asenescence1 aMar, Kwei1 aChang, Hao-Chen1 aChiang, Yi-Lun1 aHu, Huai-Yun1 aLai, Chia-Chi1 aChu, Rei-Min1 aMa, Chang M.0 tBiomaterials.g2011 Oct., v. 32, no. 29 p.6995-7005dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013100168500001400299520153800313592002801851650003001879650000901909650001101918650001101929650001701940650002701957650000901984650002001993650002602013650001602039650001002055650002102065650001602086653002602102653002702128653002502155653002902180700001702209700001602226700001202242700001302254773011602267856008702383852000902470655001202479IND60707478220221117032710.0201104e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070747822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1132632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Zhixin10aThermodynamic improvements of LNG cold exergy power generation system by using supercritical ORC with unconventional condenser  aNAL-light  aOrganic Rankine cycle (ORC) is the most commonly used power generation cycle that is adopted in this paper to make full use of the cold exergy of liquefied natural gas (LNG). As the heat exchangers are mainly responsible for the exergy destruction of the system, two improvement techniques: supercritical system and unconventional condenser, are proposed to decrease the exergy destructions in steam generator and condenser. The performances of ten preselected working fluids are tested by optimizing five key parameters at three heat source temperatures. The results show that using the supercritical system can improve the system efficiency for fluids with low critical temperatures by reducing the exergy destructions in steam generators. Using the unconventional condenser can greatly improve the system efficiency by decreasing the exergy destruction during the LNG regasification process of most fluids, barring a few wet expansion fluids. The improvements offered by both techniques become more obvious as the heat source temperature increases. However, combining the two techniques only improves the performance for fluids with low critical temperatures, and does not work for most fluids. The highest efficiency is always achieved by the subcritical system with an unconventional condenser at each heat source temperature. When the heat source temperatures are 100 °C and 150 °C, R290 obtains the highest efficiency values of 17.89% and 21.26%, respectively. At 200 °C, R600a achieves the highest efficiency of 25.35%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acold 3aexergy 3afluids 3agasification 3agenerators (equipment) 3aheat 3aheat exchangers 3aliquefied natural gas 3amethodology 3apaper 3apower generation 3atemperature 0aOrganic Rankine cycle 0aParameter optimization 0aSupercritical system 0aUnconventional condenser1 aWu, Zhenquan1 aZhao, Qiang1 aLiu, Xi1 aLin, Kui0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 223 p.113263-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1132633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100001900183245014000202300001800342506007600360520126500436592002801701506003701729650001501766650001901781650002801800650001101828650001101839650001501850650001201865650001301877650001201890650001901902650002501921650002401946650002701970650002301997650002402020650001602044700002302060700002502083773009202108856004502200852000902245655001202254IND4487124820221207133447.0120502e20120522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448712482DNAL7 a222177182pmid7 aPMC33118972pmcid7 a10.1098/rspb.2011.23672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrban, Mark C.10aOn a collision course: competition and dispersal differences create no-analogue communities and cause extinctions during climate change  ap. 2072-2080.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMost climate change predictions omit species interactions and interspecific variation in dispersal. Here, we develop a model of multiple competing species along a warming climatic gradient that includes temperature-dependent competition, differences in niche breadth and interspecific differences in dispersal ability. Competition and dispersal differences decreased diversity and produced so-called ‘no-analogue’ communities, defined as a novel combination of species that does not currently co-occur. Climate change altered community richness the most when species had narrow niches, when mean community-wide dispersal rates were low and when species differed in dispersal abilities. With high interspecific dispersal variance, the best dispersers tracked climate change, out-competed slower dispersers and caused their extinction. Overall, competition slowed the advance of colonists into newly suitable habitats, creating lags in climate tracking. We predict that climate change will most threaten communities of species that have narrow niches (e.g. tropics), vary in dispersal (most communities) and compete strongly. Current forecasts probably underestimate climate change impacts on biodiversity by neglecting competition and dispersal differences.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aextinction 3aglobal warming 3ainterspecific variation 3amodels 3aniches 3aprediction 3atropics 3avariance 2aAnimals 2aClimate Change 2aCompetitive Behavior 2aComputer Simulation 2aExtinction, Biological 2aModels, Biological 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aTemperature1 aTewksbury, Josh J.1 aSheldon, Kimberly S.0 tProceedings.g2012 May 22, v. 279, no. 1735 p.2072-2080dRoyal Societyx0962-84527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2011.2367  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009500171300001800266520114500284592002801429596013501457596008801592650001901680650001701699650001401716700005901730700001801789773011401807856008501921852000902006655001202015IND60786082220221122044445.0220802e20220721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078608222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c013472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenfeld, E.

In equilibrium, stochastic fluxes of positive and negative particles toward the surface have equal average current density j₀, and we suppose that the surface absorbs all falling charges. All over the surface, this results in the emergence of oppositely charged spots of various sizes D fluctuating and interacting with each other. Fourier expansion reduces this collection of interacting spots to the ensemble of independently fluctuating charge density waves. An exact solution of the Poisson equation for a single wave on a flat surface was obtained and provided strict proof that a fluctuating electric field is quite strong just above each charge spot but diminishes exponentially with the distance from the plane. The lifetime τ of a charge spot is inversely proportional to the density j₀ of the stochastic current while proportional to j0τ fluctuation’s amplitudes independent of j₀. The fluctuation’s parameter dependence on the charge spot’s size D can vary according to the conducting medium properties.  aPublisher supplied data  aAAAA-A18-118020190098-5cMinistry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100012190  aNAcSpace Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aelectric field 3aelectrolytes 3aequations1 aZakharov, A.

Nitrogen fertilizer application before panicle initiation is known to increase spikelet number, which is one of the most important traits in rice productivity determination. However, the basic proteomic mechanism remains poorly understood. The present study shows that nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased spikelet number and grain yield in rice. Proteomic variations were further analyzed in young panicles at the secondary panicle branch initiation and spikelet meristem initiation under nitrogen fertilizer treatment. Proteomic analysis identified 63 proteins with significant differential accumulation in young panicles under nitrogen fertilizer treatment. Proteolysis represents the largest functional category, which suggests that protein degradation is an important pathway in the response to nitrogen fertilizer. Importantly, nitrogen fertilizer significantly reduced 14-3-3 proteins, which interact with key enzymes associated with carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and the rice FT homologue Hd3a. Real-time PCR revealed that Hd3a signaling is also repressed by nitrogen fertilizer in leaves. This study contributes to a better understanding of the regulation of nitrogen fertilizers in the flowering pathway leading to panicle development. The identification of novel genes provides new insight into the profound impacts of nitrogen fertilizer on panicle development in rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aenzymes 3afertilizer application 3aflowering 3agenes 3agrain yield 3ainflorescences 3aleaves 3ameristems 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrogen metabolism 3aprotein degradation 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3aproteomics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arice1 aWang, Yan1 aChang, Zhongyuan1 aYou, Siliang1 aLiu, Zhenghui1 aWang, Shaohua1 aDing, Yanfeng0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2016 Sept., v. 35, no. 3 p.744-754dSpringer USx0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-016-9579-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010400155300002000259520128100279592002801560650002301588650002101611650002401632650002101656650004401677650001301721650002401734650002201758700001701780700001801797700001801815773012501833856007501958852000902033655001202042IND60666984920221121000301.0220325e20141110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066698492DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra11404c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Fangyu10aLiving cationic ring-opening polymerization of 2-oxazolines initiated by rare-earth metal triflates  ap. 59917-59926.  aThe cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) of substituted 2-oxazolines using rare-earth metal triflates (RE(OTf)₃) as initiator was investigated for the first time. In this work, we examined the polymerization characteristics of 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline (EtOx) initiated by Sc(OTf)₃ under conventional thermal heating and microwave irradiation, and compared the respective outcomes with those obtained with the most frequently used initiator methyl tosylate (MeOTs). The results indicated that Sc(OTf)₃ exhibits a higher catalytic efficiency to the EtOx polymerization than MeOTs under identical conditions. The controlled/living nature of the Sc(OTf)₃-catalyzed CROP was confirmed by its linear first-order kinetics and the narrow molecular weight distribution of the resultant polymers as well as the block copolymerization of EtOx and 2-phenyl-2-oxazoline (PhOx). Based on in situ NMR spectroscopic studies and SEC analysis of PEtOx samples obtained from the control termination experiments, a possible initiating/propagating mechanism has been proposed for the living cationic ring-opening polymerization. Morever, this rare-earth catalytic system can also be applied to the ring-opening polymerization of some sterically hindered or aryl-substituted 2-oxazolines.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acopolymerization 3amicrowave radiation 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3arare earth elements 3aspectral analysis1 aXie, Shoulei1 aJiang, Liming1 aShen, Zhiquan0 tRSC advances.g2014 Nov. 10, v. 4, no. 104 p.59917-59926dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra11404c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245011200204300002000316520108900336592002801425650001301453650001501466650002601481650002301507650001101530700002001541700001401561700001401575700002001589700001901609700002301628773013801651856008001789852000901869655001201878IND60746868620221120204637.0210806e20210727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074686862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c038022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Xingchen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6734-756810aHyperspectral Fingerprints for Atomic Layer Mapping of Two-Dimensional Materials with Single-Layer Accuracy  ap. 16583-16590.  aHyperspectral imaging microscopy with multivariate analysis is an efficient technique for rapid and accurate atomic layer mapping of two-dimensional materials, of which the thickness distributes randomly over a large area. In this work, the identification accuracy of a dual-illumination hyperspectral imaging microscope was systematically studied for mapping mono-, bi-, tri-, and few-layer MoS₂ flakes fabricated by the chemical vapor deposition method. Hyperspectral fingerprints of MoS₂ flakes were extracted and implemented to identify distinct flakes of new samples for cross-validation and generalizability analysis with single-layer accuracy. Mechanically exfoliated WSe₂ flakes on the SiO₂/Si substrate with small sizes were identified by multiline laser illumination. To reduce the computational consumption when processing hyperspectral data sets with high dimensions, the influence of the number of hyperspectral channels on the identification performance was investigated using hyperspectral fingerprints of mono- and bilayer flakes with high spectral similarity.  aPublisher supplied data 3alighting 3amicroscopy 3amultivariate analysis 3aphysical chemistry 3avapors1 aYetisen, Ali K.1 aDong, Jie1 aWang, Kun1 aKienle, Patrick1 aJakobi, Martin1 aKoch, Alexander W.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 July 27, v. 125, no. 30 p.16583-16590dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c038023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245018600168520103300354592002801387650003301415650001201448650002001460650001101480650001301491650002501504650001301529650001501542650001501557650001901572653003901591653001201630653003301642653001201675653004301687700001901730700001401749700001901763700001301782700001201795773010601807856008701913852000902000655001202009IND60778576220221120123531.0220621e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077857622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1273782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Wenkang10aSynergistic simultaneous endogenous partial denitrification/anammox (EPDA) and denitrifying dephosphatation for advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal in a complete biofilm system  aTo achieve simultaneous biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal from municipal wastewater, the endogenous partial denitrification/anammox (EPDA) was combined with denitrifying dephosphatation in a complete biofilm reactor. Advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal were achieved with effluent total nitrogen (TN) and PO₄³⁻-P concentrations of 7.77 ± 0.33 mg/L and 0.35 ± 0.10 mg/L, respectively. Anammox took a major role in the system, accounting for 76 ± 7% of nitrogen removal. 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing results showed that the anammox bacteria co-existed with the denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms (DGAOs) and the denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms (DPAOs). Anammox bacteria were mainly distributed in the inner layer, while DGAOs and DPAOs existed in the outer layer of EPDA biofilms. Furthermore, based on the EPDA biofilm system, a promising advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal process was suggested to achieve lower requirements for energy and reagent consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abiofilm 3adenitrification 3aenergy 3aglycogen 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3atechnology 3atotal nitrogen 0aEndogenous partial denitrification 0aAnammox 0aDenitrifying dephosphatation 0aBiofilm 0aMicrobial distribution characteristics1 aZhang, Xiangyu1 aZhang, Yu1 aWang, Qingqing1 aWei, Yan1 aMa, Bin0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Aug., v. 358 p.127378-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1273783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245018000178500002200358520161300380592002801993650003202021650001202053650001902065650002302084650002402107650001602131650002602147650001302173650001502186650004102201650001602242653001302258653003602271653003302307653002502340700001602365700002302381700002202404700002002426700009602446700002002542700002102562700002102583700009902604700009602703773007802799856009002877852000902967655001202976IND60661525220221119075414.0190830e20190825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066152522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1246822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshizawa, Hidehiro10aEnhanced biomass production and nutrient removal capacity of duckweed via two-step cultivation process with a plant growth-promoting bacterium, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus P23  aPre-press version  aPlant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) are considered a promising tool to improve biomass production and water remediation by the aquatic plant, duckweed; however, no effective methodology is available to utilize PGPB in large hydroponic systems. In this study, we proposed a two-step cultivation process, which comprised of a “colonization step” and a “mass cultivation step,” and examined its efficacy in both bucket-scale and flask-scale cultivation experiments. We showed that in the outdoor bucket-scale experiments using three kinds of environmental water, plants cultured through the two-step cultivation method with the PGPB strain, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus P23, yielded 1.9 to 2.3 times more biomass than the control (without PGPB inoculation). The greater nitrogen and phosphorus removals compared to control were also attained, indicating that this strategy is useful for accelerating nutrient removal by duckweed. Flask-scale experiments using non-sterile pond water revealed that inoculation of strain P23 altered duckweed surface microbial community structures, and the beneficial effects of the inoculated strain P23 could last for 5–10 d. The loss of the duckweed growth-promoting effect was noticeable when the colonization of strain P23 decreased in the plant. These observations suggest that the stable colonization of the plant with PGPB is the key for maintaining the accelerated duckweed growth and nutrient removal in this cultivation method. Overall, our results suggest the possibility of an improved duckweed production using a two-step cultivation process with PGPB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter calcoaceticus 3aAraceae 3aaquatic plants 3abiomass production 3acommunity structure 3ahydroponics 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aremediation 0aDuckweed 0aPlant growth-promoting bacteria 0aTwo-step cultivation process 0aWastewater treatment1 aOgata, Yuka1 aHachiya, Yoshiyuki1 aTokura, Ko-ichiro1 aKuroda, Masashi1 aInoue, Daisuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9216-8198 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9216-81981 aToyama, Tadashi1 aTanaka, Yasuhiro1 aMori, Kazu-hiro,1 aMorikawa, Masaaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1547-8069 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1547-80691 aIke, Michihiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6237-8103 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6237-81030 tChemosphere.g2019 Aug. 25, dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1246823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013200167520114600299592002801445650001301473650001201486650002101498650001301519650001101532650001501543653003201558653002101590653001201611653002101623653001501644700001501659700001601674700001201690700001501702700001601717700001501733773010601748856008701854852000901941655001201950IND60778576320221120121036.0220606e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077857632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1273792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hong10aRevealing the effect of biofilm formation in partial nitritation-anammox systems: Start-up, performance stability, and recovery  aSuccessful application of partial nitritation-anammox (PNA) processes is currently and primarily associated with biofilm systems. Biofilm characteristics significantly influence start-up, performance stability, and recovery. Here, two PNA systems with and without carriers were implemented simultaneously for treating wastewater containing 50 mg-NH₄/L. The performance characteristics of these two PNA systems were compared. Stable nitrogen removal efficiencies of 76.3 ± 2.8% and 72.9 ± 1.6% were obtained for suspended sludge and biofilm systems, respectively. The slow process of biofilm colonization resulted in a long start-up time in the biofilm system. Biofilm enrichment and protection conferred stable performance when exposed to aeration shock. The suspended sludge system displayed good elasticity during performance recovery after shock compared to the slow recovery in the biofilm system. Moreover, suitable control of dissolved oxygen could improve the activity and abundance of the functional microbes. This study provides new insights into the operation and control of PNA systems for treating mainstream wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3abiofilm 3adissolved oxygen 3anitrogen 3asludge 3awastewater 0aPartial nitritation-anammox 0aSuspended sludge 0aBiofilm 0aNitrogen removal 0aMainstream1 aChen, Chen1 aYang, Enzhe1 aTu, Zhi1 aLiang, Jie1 aDai, Xiaohu1 aChen, Hong0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Aug., v. 357 p.127379-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1273793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245013300164300002000297520121500317592002801532650001501560650002301575650002101598650001701619650001101636650001001647650002401657650001701681650001501698650001701713650001401730650002201744700001401766700001701780700001901797700005701816773013801873856008002011852000902091655001202100IND60746868720221120194454.0210806e20210721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074686872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c038242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Hai-Jing10aIn Situ Synthesis of NiO/CuO Nanosheet Heterostructures Rich in Defects for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction  ap. 16516-16523.  aDeveloping efficient electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance for improving the efficiency of hydrogen production by electrolysis of water. The transition metal-based heterostructure shows superior catalytic performance toward OER due to abundant defects and a modified electronic structure of the active sites. Herein, we synthesized a NiO and CuO heterostructured nanosheet rich in defects on the Ni foam via an in situ electrochemical oxidation. The electrocatalyst showed high OER activity with an overpotential of 234 mV at 10 mA cm–² and a small Tafel slope of 22 mV dec–¹. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the NiO and CuO heterostructure, which was obtained by a very simple preparation method, has been used in OER. The excellent catalytic performance can be attributed to electron interactions between NiO and CuO, thus modifying the adsorption energy of nickel oxide to intermediate species. Moreover, we found that the heterostructured nanosheet was composed of many very small NiO and CuO nanocrystals with abundant defects and more exposed active sites, thus improving the catalytic activity and accelerating the kinetic processes of OER.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy 3afoams 3ahydrogen production 3ananocrystals 3ananosheets 3anickel oxide 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production1 aYuan, Kun1 aZheng, Ya-Li1 aSun, Xiao-Chen1 aZhang, Ya-Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1871-75070 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 July 21, v. 125, no. 30 p.16516-16523dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c038243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245008000154300001800234520113500252592002801387650001301415650001301428650001001441650003101451650001601482650001901498650001101517650000701528650001301535650002101548650001601569700001701585700001601602700001401618700001301632700001401645700001701659700001701676773009901693856007501792852000901867655001201876IND60577047220221118223230.0170806e20140603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057704722DNAL7 a10.1021/la501296r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Cuicui10aLiposomes Physically Coated with Peptides: Preparation and Characterization  ap. 6219-6227.  aPhysically coating liposomes with peptides of desirable functions is an economic, versatile, and less time-consuming approach to prepare drug delivery vehicles. In this work, we designed three peptidesAc-WWKKKGGNNN-NH2 (W2K3), Ac-WWRRRGGNNN-NH2(W2R3), Ac-WWGGGGGNNN-NH2(W2G3)and studied their coating ability on negatively charged liposomes. It was found that the coating was mainly driven by the electrostatic interaction between the peptides’ cationic side groups and the acidic lipids, which also mediated the “anchoring ” of Trp residuals in the interfacial region of lipid bilayers. At the same conditions, the amount of the coated W2R3 was more than that of W2K3, but the stability of the liposome coated with W2R3 was deteriorated. This was caused by the delocalized charge of the guanidinium group of arginine. The coating of the peptide rendered the liposome pH-responsive behavior but did not prominently change the phase transition temperature. The liposome coated with peptides displayed appropriate pH/temperature dual responsive characteristics and was able to release the content in a controlled manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3acoatings 3adrugs 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aguanidinium 3alipid bilayers 3alipids 3apH 3apeptides 3aphase transition 3atemperature1 aXia, Yuqiong1 aSun, Jianbo1 aWang, Nan1 aZhu, Lin1 aChen, Tao1 aHuang, Yanyi1 aLiang, Dehai0 tLangmuir.g2014 June 03, v. 30, no. 21 p.6219-6227dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla501296r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009900166500001900265520117200284592002801456650001501484650001201499650001301511650002201524653001901546653002001565653000801585700001901593700001701612700001601629700001501645773010801660856008501768852000901853655001201862IND60714995920221119054058.0201209e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071499592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1066412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Wenting14aThe redistribution of arsenic during the interaction between high-temperature flue gas and ash  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTransformation of As in the post-combustion zone has a significant effect on its emission characteristics. In this study, redistribution of As that occurs during the interaction between flue gas and ash has been elucidated using a double-layer fixed-bed reactor at 800–1000 °C. Herein, flue gas and ash samples with different As contents and inorganic components were produced by two varieties of coals. The As content in the ash with high Ca and Al contents increased after interacting with the flue gas with a high As content, indicating gaseous As adsorption. However, the As content in the ash decreased by up to 67% for other cases. The blank experiments showed that the As occurrences in ash were thermally stable, suggesting that the decrease was caused by the action of flue gas. Accordingly, the effect of flue gas components on the release of As from the ash was investigated. It was found that a significant amount of As release was primarily caused by the reaction of gaseous Na in the flue gas with the residual As in ash. A bi-directional interaction was observed between the high-temperature flue gas and ash, which led to the redistribution of As.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3aflue gas 3athermal stability 0aTransformation 0aCoal combustion 0aAsh1 aSong, Guochang1 aHu, Ko-hsin,1 aSong, Qiang1 aYao, Qiang0 tFuel processing technology.g2021 Feb., v. 212 p.106641-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1066413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011100167300001600278520139100294592002801685650001501713650001501728650001701743650002001760650001101780650002001791650001401811650001501825650001501840651001001855653003601865653002701901653005501928653000801983653001001991653000702001653000802008653000702016653000702023653000902030653000802039653001002047653000802057653000702065653000902072653000802081653000902089653000802098653000802106653001002114653000802124653000802132653000802140653000702148653000802155700001502163700001402178773010102192856008602293852000902379655001202388IND60566712020221118045509.0170710e20170701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056671202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2017.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Liye10aMulti-step wind speed forecasting based on a hybrid forecasting architecture and an improved bat algorithm  ap. 410-430.  aAs one of the most promising sustainable energy sources, wind energy plays an important role in energy development because of its cleanliness without causing pollution. Generally, wind speed forecasting, which has an essential influence on wind power systems, is regarded as a challenging task. Analyses based on single-step wind speed forecasting have been widely used, but their results are insufficient in ensuring the reliability and controllability of wind power systems. In this paper, a new forecasting architecture based on decomposing algorithms and modified neural networks is successfully developed for multi-step wind speed forecasting. Four different hybrid models are contained in this architecture, and to further improve the forecasting performance, a modified bat algorithm (BA) with the conjugate gradient (CG) method is developed to optimize the initial weights between layers and thresholds of the hidden layer of neural networks. To investigate the forecasting abilities of the four models, the wind speed data collected from four different wind power stations in Penglai, China, were used as a case study.

Although for the most part, the epidemiological factors involved in the spread of MDR-TB are understood, insights into the bacterial drivers of MDR-TB have been gained only recently, largely owing to novel technologies and research in other organisms. Herein, we review recent findings on how bacterial factors, such as persistence, hypermutation, the complex interrelation between drug resistance and fitness, compensatory evolution, and epistasis affect the evolution of multidrug resistance in M. tuberculosis. Improved knowledge of these factors will help better predict the future trajectory of MDR-TB, and contribute to the development of new tools and strategies to combat this growing public health threat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aepistasis 3aevolution 3amultiple drug resistance 3atuberculosis1 aBorrell, Sonia1 aRose, Graham1 aGagneux, Sebastien0 tTrends in genetics.g2013 Mar., v. 29, no. 3 p.160-169dElsevier Ltdx0168-95257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2012.11.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245013600174520189700310592002802207650001902235650001302254650002102267650002102288650002102309650001202330650001802342650001402360650001402374650001202388650001102400653000702411653000802418653000702426653000802433653000802441653000702449653000802456653000802464653000702472653000902479653000802488653000702496653002302503653001702526653002202543653001802565653001002583700002502593700001702618700002302635773012402658856008302782852000902865655001202874IND60756451620221117022830.0211213e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075645162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1053742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEschenbacher, Andreas10aFast pyrolysis of polyurethanes and polyisocyanurate with and without flame retardant: Compounds of interest for chemical recycling  aTo date, the recycling of polyurethane (PU) and polyisocyanurate (PIR) waste still poses a significant problem. Within this contribution, the thermal degradation of high-resilient ether PU, semirigid PU, rigid PU, and (PIR) with and without TCPP flame retardant was studied at different temperatures to identify and quantify the main products. For this, a tandem micropyrolyzer coupled to GC × GC with FID and ToF-MS detectors was used, and the yield volatiles, light gases, and residue was quantified. The volatile pyrolysis vapours obtained from pyrolyzing high-resilient ether PU and semirigid PU at 600 °C were very similar, and the main products obtained were ethylene and propylene (combined yield of ~13 wt%), ~16 wt% of various oxygenates, and 4–6 wt% organic nitrogen compounds. The oxygenates included mostly poly-ether type compounds with varying molecular weight, and these are attributed to the decomposition of the polyol chains forming the soft segments of the polymer. The main semi-volatile nitrogen compound was 4,4′-methylenedianiline, attributed to the decomposition of the hard segments in the PU structure synthesized from MDI. The pyrolysis vapours from rigid PU contained several ether-type compounds and high yields of heteroatom-free monoaromatics—in particular styrene. The PIRs were more difficult to decompose and volatilize than the PUs, resulting in ~20 wt% higher residue yields. The charring propensity was even higher in the absence of a flame retardant in the formulation. Pyrolysis of TCPP-containing PIR produced Cl-containing pyrolysis vapours such as allyl chlorides. While the yield of H₂O was comparable for the different PUs and PIR, pyrolysis of PIR produced higher yields of CO₂ and less CO compared to the different PUs. The use of catalysts can help to convert PU waste pyrolysis vapours more efficiently to desirable chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aethylene 3aflame retardants 3amolecular weight 3aorganic nitrogen 3apolyols 3apolyurethanes 3apropylene 3apyrolysis 3astyrene 3awastes 0aEO 0aTGA 0aGC 0aMDI 0aTDI 0aMS 0aFID 0aTCD 0aPO 0apphp 0aPIR 0aPU 0aThermal processing 0aPyrolysis-GC 0aPolyurethane foam 0aDecomposition 0aWaste1 aVarghese, Robin John1 aWeng, Junjie1 aVan Geem, Kevin M.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2021 Nov., v. 160 p.105374-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1053743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100005500154245010100209300001600310520108100326592002801407650001101435650001401446650002201460650001201482651001001494653001801504653001401522653002401536653002201560700001601582773009501598856008901693852000901782655001201791IND60525728920221120170620.0190319e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052572892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6197-122010aDoes liquidity affect housing market performance? An empirical study with spatial panel approach  ap. 189-196.  aThis paper investigates the spatial effects of liquidity factors on housing market performance. We adopt the spatial panel approach to address spatial dependency and the spillover effect among neighboring housing estates. Using a special transaction database from the Economic Property Research Centre (EPRC), the results show that a higher housing liquidity level leads to a lower subsequent housing return, while the contemporary return increases with unexpected liquidity shock. Specifically, a 1% rise in the housing liquidity level leads to a 1.85% fall in the expected housing return in the following year, and a 1% unexpected liquidity shock would raise the contemporary housing return by 3.33%. Moreover, the results reveal strong spatial spillover effects of liquidity shocks in the Hong Kong housing market. This paper delivers useful implications for both policy makers and practitioners regarding spatial dependency and contagion among housing markets. The research framework and spatial approaches can be easily replicated and applied to other cities and regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adatabases 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3aChina 0aHousing price 0aLiquidity 0aSpatial panel model 0aSpatial spillover1 aHui, E.C.M.0 tLand use policy.g2016 Nov., v. 56 p.189-196dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245014100207300002000348506007600368520102500444592002801469506003701497650002301534650001501557650001701572650002701589650002901616700002001645700002601665700002001691700002101711700002001732700001901752773017601771856008301947852000902030655001202039IND4487025220221207121331.0120502e20110816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448702522DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11075531082doi7 aPMC31582042pmcid7 a217991132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWurm, Christian A.10aNanoscale distribution of mitochondrial import receptor Tom20 is adjusted to cellular conditions and exhibits an inner-cellular gradient  ap. 13546-13551.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane (TOM) complex is the main import pore for nuclear-encoded proteins into mitochondria, yet little is known about its spatial distribution within the outer membrane. Super-resolution stimulated emission depletion microscopy was used to determine quantitatively the nanoscale distribution of Tom20, a subunit of the TOM complex, in more than 1,000 cells. We demonstrate that Tom20 is located in clusters whose nanoscale distribution is finely adjusted to the cellular growth conditions as well as to the specific position of a cell within a microcolony. The density of the clusters correlates to the mitochondrial membrane potential. The distributions of clusters of Tom20 and of Tom22 follow an inner-cellular gradient from the perinuclear to the peripheral mitochondria. We conclude that the nanoscale distribution of the TOM complex is finely adjusted to the cellular conditions, resulting in distribution gradients both within single cells and between adjacent cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amembrane potential 3amicroscopy 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3anuclear-encoded proteins1 aNeumann, Daniel1 aLauterbach, Marcel A.1 aHarke, Benjamin1 aEgner, Alexander1 aHell, Stefan W.1 aJakobs, Stefan0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Aug. 16, v. 108, no. 33 p.13546-13551dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11075531083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245009700160520119000257592002801447650004401475650001901519650002301538650000901561650001401570650001601584653002201600653002401622653002301646653001801669700001401687700001601701700001901717700001201736773012401748856008301872852000901955655001201964IND60756451720221117022528.0211213e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075645172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1053762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Guo10aOnline characterization of pyrolysis products and kinetics study for the pyrolysis of a coal  aThe compositional distribution of pyrolysis products is related to the molecular structure of coal and pyrolysis parameters. In this study, gaseous products generated from the pyrolysis of two low-rank coals were analyzed by an online home-built infrared detection system. The effect of heating rate and temperature on compositional distribution was considered and evaluated. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and Orbitrap-MS were employed to analyze other pyrolysis products such as raw coals, chars, and tars. In the pyrolysis process, oxygen-containing compounds in coal were the first species to participate in pyrolysis reactions. With the enhancement of temperature, the content of aromatic hydrocarbons showed an increasing trend, and the contents of aliphatic hydrocarbons and oxygenates decreased. In the four major pyrolysis gases, the yield of H₂ was the highest and the lowest for CO₂. In addition, dynamic curves of the main pyrolysis gas were obtained, and the activation energies of pyrolysis gases were calculated by Ozawa-Flynn-Wall’s (OFW) method. The possible generation pathways of gaseous products were proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical structure 3acoal 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 0aMass spectrometry 0aOnline gas analysis 0aPyrolysis kinetics 0aLow-rank coal1 aFan, Xing1 aLiang, Peng1 aZhao, Guo-Ming1 aHu, Xun0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2021 Nov., v. 160 p.105376-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1053763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03840naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100001800181245012400199300001800323500002400341500001500365506007600380520149400456506003701950650002101987650001002008650002602018650001302044650001102057650002602068650001502094650001802109650000902127650001102136650001002147650002002157650002402177650001402201650002102215650001302236650001202249650003802261650003802299650001102337650002402348650000902372650002402381650002902405650006602434650004202500650005602542650002502598650004502623653005402668700002102722700002702743700002302770700002202793700002002815700002402835700001902859700002202878773011702900852000903017856008003026655001203106IND4458127220221207073020.0110520s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445812722DNAL7 a214027632pmid7 aPMC31258472pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01265-102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanis, Carole10aIn Vivo Regulation of the Vi Antigen in Salmonella and Induction of Immune Responses with an In Vivo-Inducible Promoter  ap. 2481-2488.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSalmonella enterica serovar Typhi, the agent of typhoid fever in humans, expresses the surface Vi polysaccharide antigen that contributes to virulence. However, Vi expression can also be detrimental to some key steps of S. Typhi infectivity, for example, invasion, and Vi is the target of protective immune responses. We used a strain of S. Typhimurium carrying the whole Salmonella pathogenicity island 7 (SPI-7) to monitor in vivo Vi expression within phagocytic cells of mice at different times after systemic infection. We also tested whether it is possible to modulate Vi expression via the use of in vivo-inducible promoters and whether this would trigger anti-Vi antibodies through the use of Vi-expressing live bacteria. Our results show that Vi expression in the liver and spleen is downregulated with the progression of infection and that the Vi-negative population of bacteria becomes prevalent by day 4 postinfection. Furthermore, we showed that replacing the natural tviA promoter with the promoter of the SPI-2 gene ssaG resulted in sustained Vi expression in the tissues. Intravenous or oral infection of mice with a strain of S. Typhimurium expressing Vi under the control of the ssaG promoter triggered detectable levels of all IgG subclasses specific for Vi. Our work highlights that Vi is downregulated in vivo and provides proof of principle that it is possible to generate a live attenuated vaccine that induces Vi-specific antibodies after single oral administration.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aliver 3apathogenicity islands 3aantigens 3ahumans 3aintravenous injection 3aantibodies 3atyphoid fever 3amice 3aspleen 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aoral administration 3avirulence 3aSalmonella Typhi 3abacteria 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialximmunology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFemale 2aLiverxmicrobiology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aPolysaccharides, Bacterialxgeneticsximmunologyxphysiology. 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticximmunology 2aSalmonella typhixgeneticsximmunologyxphysiology. 2aSpleenxmicrobiology 2aTyphoid Feverximmunologyxmicrobiology. 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi1 aGrant, Andrew J.1 aMcKinley, Trevelyan J.1 aMorgan, Fiona J.E.1 aJohn, Victoria F.1 aHoughton, Jenny1 aKingsley, Robert A.1 aDougan, Gordon1 aMastroeni, Pietro0 tInfection and immunity.g2011 June, v. 79, no. 6 p.2481-2488dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01265-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02199naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009800163300001600261500002300277500001500300520103200315650001801347650001401365650001901379650002201398650001001420650002701430650001201457650001401469653001401483653001601497653001301513653001801526773009401544852000901638856008501647930003301732945001301765946001101778655001201789IND2208228320221122232758.0001208e200009  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220822832DNAL7 a10.1080/070606600095004752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStatler, G.D.10aInheritance of virulence of Puccinia triticina culture X47, the F1 of the cross 71-112 x 70-1  ap. 276-279.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aCultures 71-112 (SBD) and 70-1 (BBG) of Puccinia triticina were purified, crossed, and the resulting F1 culture X47 (LBB) was selfed to study the inheritance of virulence on several near-isogenic lines of Triticum aestivum. The phenotype of the parents, the F1, and ratios of F2 progeny were used to explain the inheritance of pathogenicity. Results of the F2 segregation from the reciprocal cross (70-1 x 71-112), labeled X59 (CBB), were compared to results of the current study. The F2 cultures in this study segregated as if single dominant genes conditioned avirulence on near-isogenic lines with Lr2a, Lr2c, Lr10, Lr17, Lr28, Lr29, and Lr33. The avirulence genes were independently inherited. Linkage was detected between pathogen genes p2a and p2c with p29. Two genes appeared to control virulence on near-isogenic lines with Lr3, Lr3c, Lr11, Lr16, Lr21, Lr26, and Lr30. The F2 ratios could be explained by classical gene-for-gene interactions except for the digenic ratios, which may indicate a more complex interaction. 3arust diseases 3aphenotype 3acultured cells 3aTriticum aestivum 3agenes 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aselfing 3avirulence 0adominance 0asegregation 0acrossing 0apathogenicity0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2000 Sept., v. 22, no. 3 p.276-279x0706-06617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/070606600095004753Available from publisher's Web site  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02469naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010900126300001800235520134500253650001801598650002201616650002901638650001801667650002501685650003801710650002101748650003501769650002701804653001401831653002701845653003301872700002001905700001801925700001501943773007001958852000902028939003302037946001302070655001202083IND9201210820221122232958.0920305e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920121082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMogen, B.D.10aUpstream sequences other than AAUAAA are required for efficient messenger RNA 3'-end formation in plants  ap. 1241-1272.  aWe have characterized the upstream nucleotide sequences involved in mRNA 3'-end formation in the 3' regions of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 19S/35S transcription unit and a pea gene encoding ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit (rbcS). Sequences between 57 bases and 181 bases upstream from the CaMV polyadenylation site were required for efficient polyadenylation it this site. In addition, an AAUAAA sequence located 13 bases to 18 bases upstream from this site was also important for efficient mRNA 3'-end formation. An element located between 60 bases and 137 bases upstream from the poly(A) addition sites in a pea rbcS gene was needed for functioning of these sites. The CaMV -181/-57 and rbcS -137/-60 elements were different in location and sequence composition from upstream sequences needed for polyadenylation in mammalian genes, but resembled the signals that direct mRNA 3'-end formation in yeast. However, the role of the AAUAAA motif in 3'-end formation in the CaMV 3' region was reminiscent of mRNA polyadenylation in animals. We suggest that multiple elements are involved in mRNA 3'-end formation in plants, and that interactions of different components of the plant polyadenylation apparatus with their respective sequence elements and with each other are needed for efficient mRNA 3'-end formation. 3aPisum sativum 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3amultigene family 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenetic transformation 0arbcs gene 0amessenger rna terminus 0apolyadenylated messenger rna1 aMacDonald, M.H.1 aGraybosch, R.1 aHunt, A.G.0 tPlant cell.g1990 Dec., v. 2, no. 12 p.1241-1272x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02510naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245017700126300001600303520136200319650002201681650000901703650002701712650001101739650001501750650001801765650001201783650001201795650003201807650002101839700002301860700001401883700001301897700001701910700001801927773009901945852000902044930003302053945001302086946001302099655001202112IND2202585120221122223316.0000215e199906  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220258512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoudant, P.10aComparison of the lipid class and fatty acid composition between a reproductive cycle in nature and a standard hatchery conditioning of the Pacific Oyster Crassostrea gigas  ap. 209-222.  aThe lipid composition of Crassostrea gigas was analyzed during the reproductive phase in natural as well as under artificial conditions. The lipid content increased and accumulated in the gonads, but to a higher extend in the naturally conditioned animals. The percentage of neutral lipid in total lipid of the gonad plus mantle was stable, high (> 70%) and equal under both conditions, underscoring that the lipid reserves were preferentially located in that organ. The composition of the polar lipid classes was stable with little variations. The fatty acid (FA) composition of the neutral lipids in all organs is influenced by diet. However, there is a different response according to organs. A high dietary impact occured in the digestive gland whereas the muscle was less affected. The polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) level of the neutral and polar lipids in the gonads changed little despite the dietary conditions but the respective proportions of (n-3) and (n-6) PUFA differed drastically as a result of diet composition. There was clear evidence in all organs for a specific accumulation of 22:6(n-3) and 20:5(n-3) in the polar lipids under both conditioning diets. The proportions of 22:6(n-3) and 20:5(n-3) from neutral and polar lipids of oysters conditioned artificially were significantly lower than of those that were naturally conditioned. 3aCrassostrea gigas 3adiet 3afatty acid composition 3agonads 3ahatcheries 3alipid content 3amuscles 3aoysters 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3atriacylglycerols1 aRyckeghem, K. van.1 aMarty, Y.1 aMoal, J.1 aSamain, J.F.1 aSorgeloos, P.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1999 June, v. 123B, no. 2 p.209-222x1096-49597nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle03520naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012500164300001200289500002300301500001500324520190000339650001202239650002002251650002002271650001502291650002402306650003302330650002502363650002102388650002402409650002302433650001202456650002802468650002402496650001802520650002002538650001702558650001502575650002302590653001902613653002302632653001302655653001102668653002802679653001902707773008902726852000902815856008502824930003302909945001302942946001102955655001202966IND2290676820221122223221.0010427e200103  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229067682DNAL7 a10.1080/070606601095069012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazarovits, G.10aManagement of soil-borne plant pathogens with organic soil amendments: a disease control strategy salvaged from the past  ap. 1-7.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThe utilization of organic amendments for control of soil-borne plant pathogens has often been considered at best variable, but more often as a snake-oil remedy. Understanding the mode of action of these products, however, provides insight as to where and how to exploit these underutilized energy sources for the benefit of plant and soil health. Organic amendments containing high nitrogen, such as poultry manure, meat and bone meal, and soymeal, significantly reduced populations of a wide spectrum of soil-borne plant pathogens. Pathogen control was shown to arise from the ammonia and (or) nitrous acid generated, the concentrations of which are controlled by pH, organic matter content, soil buffering capacity, and nitrification rate. Swine manure can reduce pathogen populations by both these mechanisms as well as by an additional process involving volatile fatty acids. Volatile fatty acids are active only at pH conditions below 6.0 and were present in most, but not all liquid manures tested. Disease control with organic amendment occurs when soil and biological factors are conducive to activating the processes that reduce pathogen survival. Understanding the mechanisms allows prediction of efficacy based on analysis of the soil and the organic amendment. For some products, such as ammonium lignosulfonate, a by-product of the pulp and paper industry, disease control was demonstrated but the mode of action is as yet unclear. Although organic amendments reduce populations of plant pathogens, overall they lead to an increase in soil microorganisms populations by up to 1000-fold following application. Thus, the displacement of pathogens is selective and can persist in fields for several years after single application. As we unravel the potential benefits of organic treatments, there is indication that they may return as a valuable tool in disease management strategies. 3aammonia 3aplant pathogens 3asoil amendments 3apig manure 3amechanism of action 3aplant diseases and disorders 3avolatile fatty acids 3anitrogen content 3asoil microorganisms 3ameat and bone meal 3asoil pH 3aammonium lignosulfonate 3asoil organic matter 3anitrification 3adisease control 3asoybean meal 3aprediction 3abuffering capacity 0aorganic matter 0aliterature reviews 0aefficacy 0aplants 0aorganic acids and salts 0amicroorganisms0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2001 Mar., v. 23, no. 1 p.1-7x0706-06617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/070606601095069013Available from publisher's Web site  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03244naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245016200166300001600328500002400344520202700368650002402395650001502419650002802434650001902462650000902481650002402490650002302514650001602537650001802553650002302571650002402594650001002618650001302628650001102641650001602652773011402668852000902782856005502791655001202846IND4429551920100101000000.0091207e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442955192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0426.2009.01284.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, I.10aDietary total aromatic amino acid requirement and tyrosine replacement value for phenylalanine in Indian major carp: Cirrhinus mrigala (Hamilton) fingerlings  ap. 719-727.  aIncludes references  aTwo 8-week growth trials were conducted to determine total aromatic amino acid requirement and tyrosine replacement value for phenylalanine in Cirrhinus mrigala fingerlings. To determine the phenylalanine requirement, 20 fish were randomly stocked in triplicate groups in 55-L indoor polyvinyl flow-through circular tanks and fed six experimental diets containing graded levels of phenylalanine (5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, 15.0 and 17.5 g kg⁻¹, dry diet) with 10 g kg⁻¹ tyrosine. Maximum weight gain (287%), best FCR (1.44) and PER (1.74) occurred at 12.5 g kg⁻¹ dietary phenylalanine. Quadratic regression analysis of weight gain, FCR and PER data indicated phenylalanine requirement at 13.5, 12.9 and 12.7 g kg⁻¹ of dry diet, respectively. Protein deposition was significantly (P < 0.05) higher at 12.5 g kg⁻¹ dietary phenylalanine. Based on the above results, phenylalanine requirement of C. mrigala is recommended at 13.0 g kg⁻¹ of dry diet, corresponding to 32.5 g kg⁻¹ of protein. On the basis of the above requirement, a second experiment with a similar design was conducted using six diets containing graded levels of tyrosine (2.1, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 and 12.0 g kg⁻¹) with 13.0 g kg⁻¹ phenylalanine fixed in all diets to determine the phenylalanine replacement value with that of tyrosine. Maximum weight gain (315%), best FCR (1.47) and PER (1.69) was at 8.0 g kg⁻¹ dietary tyrosine. Quadratic regression analysis of weight gain, FCR and PER data indicated tyrosine requirement at 9.0, 8.4 and 8.2 g kg⁻¹ of dry diet, respectively. Protein deposition was significantly (P < 0.05) higher at 8.0 g kg⁻¹ dietary tyrosine. On the basis of the above results, 8.5 g kg⁻¹ tyrosine, corresponding to 21.3 g kg⁻¹ of protein, is taken as the optimum requirement and the replacement value is 39.53% on a weight and 36% on a molar basis. Thus, the total aromatic amino acid requirement is 21.5 g kg⁻¹ of diet, corresponding to 53.8 g kg⁻¹ of protein for optimum C. mrigala growth. 3aCirrhinus cirrhosus 3aG-proteins 3aamino acid requirements 3aaromatic acids 3acarp 3aexperimental design 3aexperimental diets 3afingerlings 3aphenylalanine 3aprotein deposition 3aregression analysis 3atanks 3atyrosine 3aweight 3aweight gain0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2009 Dec., v. 25, no. 6 p.719-727dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0175-86597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2009.01284.x 7aarticle03352naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184100002400193245010400217300001600321500002400337500001500361520148000376650002101856650003701877650001701914650002201931650002101953650002201974650002101996650002202017650002002039650002902059650001202088650001502100650001402115650001002129650001002139650001802149653001502167653001402182653002502196653003102221653002402252700001902276700001902295700002202314700001902336700002402355700003002379700001902409773009602428852000902524856008802533930003302621945002502654946001102679655001202690IND4439680620221122203512.0100709e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443968062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2010.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aF500 0aF600 0aJ100 0aJ5001 aRillig, Matthias C.10aMaterial derived from hydrothermal carbonization: Effects on plant growth and arbuscular mycorrhiza  ap. 238-242.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGreenhouse gas mitigation options include the production of carbonized materials and their addition to soils for longer term storage. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a novel way to produce carbonized materials. The goal here was to test if HTC material, in our case derived from beet root chips, has adverse effects on plant growth or that of root associated symbionts such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We carried out several studies, and found that increasing concentrations of HTC material could be deleterious for plant growth of Taraxacum, starting at 10vol% additions. Conversely, root colonization of the fungal symbiont was stimulated at an addition of 20vol%. Soil pH changes occurring during the study could be traced to microbial reduction reactions, and these led to a pH increase of the medium despite the quite acidic nature of the HTC material itself. In separate assays, we showed that spore germination of the AM fungus Glomus intraradices was stimulated by the HTC material, suggesting that direct effects on the fungi are likely in addition to those mediated by the host plant. A third experiment with a different plant species (Trifolium repens) confirmed the major conclusions, and showed also neutral to stimulatory effect on nodulation. Our results suggest that HTC materials should be carefully tested and optimized to reduce negative effects on plant growth before applications in the field are undertaken, particularly at high addition rates. 3agreenhouse gases 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aplant growth 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aTrifolium repens 3apollution control 3aapplication rate 3aspore germination 3asoil amendments 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3asoil pH 3anodulation 3aTaraxacum 3aroots 3abeets 3aBeta vulgaris 0asoil fungi 0asymbiosis 0acarbonized materials 0ahydrothermal carbonization 0aGlomus intraradices1 aWagner, Marcel1 aSalem, Mohamed1 aAntunes, Pedro M.1 aGeorge, Carmen1 aRamke, Hans-Günter1 aTitirici, Maria-Magdalena1 aAntonietti, M.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2010 July, v. 45, no. 3 p.238-242dElsevier Sciencex0929-13937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2010.04.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/11/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02183naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245017600132300001600308520094800324650001801272650001001290650001001300650001401310650002701324650001001351650001701361650001801378650001801396650003201414650000901446650001701455650001001472653001601482653002301498700002201521700001801543700002101561773009901582852000901681930003301690945001301723946001301736655001201749IND2205424020221122131525.0000626e199910  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220542402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZabelinskii, S.A.10aPhospholipids and their fatty acids in mitochondria, synaptomsomes and myelin from the liver and brain of trout and rat: a new view on the role of fatty acids in membranes  ap. 187-193.  aThe content of different phospholipids (PL) and their fatty acid (FA) composition in subcellular fractions from the liver and brain of rat (Rattus rattus) and trout (Salmo irideus) were estimated. It was shown that despite higher content of unsaturated fatty acids in myelin compared to synaptosomes, the unsaturation index of the latter is equal or higher than that of myelin. The total content of PL polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was shown to be higher in membrane structures with more active ion transport (mitochondria). This feature seemed to be characteristic of membranes from both representatives of homoiotherms and poikilotherms studied. A possible role for PUFA in formation within the lipid monolayer of areas with different capacity to accept electrons and transport them along a sort of intermolecular 'tunnel' is discussed. The double bonds of PUFA in this area seem to be able to produce bonds similar to conjugated bonds. 3aRattus rattus 3aSalmo 3abrain 3aelectrons 3afatty acid composition 3aliver 3amitochondria 3amyelin sheath 3aphospholipids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3arats 3asynaptosomes 3atrout 0acomposition 0aphosphatidic acids1 aChebotareva, M.A.1 aKostkin, V.B.1 aKrivchenko, A.I.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1999 Oct., v. 124B, no. 2 p.187-193x1096-49597nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle01875naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010700128300001600235520066400251650002700915650001900942650001200961650002100973650002500994650001101019650001301030650001601043650001001059650002301069650001501092650001901107650002101126650000701147650001601154650001101170650001601181650001601197700001601213700002101229773009901250852000901349930003301358945001301391946001301404655001201417IND2205414820221122133041.0000623e199907  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220541482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSivakumar, P.10aCollagenolytic metalloprotease (gelatinase) from the hepatopancreas of the marine crab, Scylla serrata  ap. 273-279.  aA collagenolytic metalloprotease with gelatinase activity was purified from acetone powdered hepatopancreatic digestive tissue of the marine crab, Scylla serrata by ammonium sulphate precipitation and gel-filtration chromatography.

Paddy soil was treated with a Pb gradient with and without thiosulfate addition and then planted with rice. The increasing addition of Pb resulted in plant yield reduction and high, phytotoxic concentrations of Pb in roots with relatively low concentration of Pb in shoots. Under the impact of thiosulfate, Pb uptake in plants and NH₄OAc extractable Pb did not increase dramatically. PCR-DGGE experiment suggested that S action led to new bands. Specific clones (T3 and T6) found in S addition soils had high similarity to Thiobacillus, which indicated relatively high rates of potential S oxidation. S addition did not affect the availability Pb and the composition of soil microbial community. S addition is not a suitable amendatory tool of phytoremediation for Pb polluted soil. 3arice 3alead 3aOryza sativa 3acrop yield 3asoil respiration 3aapplication rate 3aroots 3ashoots 3asulfur 3arhizosphere 3asoil pollution 3anutrient uptake 3athiosulfates 3aclones 3aphytoremediation 3apaddy soils 3aplant growth 3asoil bacteria 3acommunity structure 3aflooded conditions 3amicrobial activity 3aphytotoxicity 3aThiobacillus 0apollution control1 aChen, Xincai1 aHu, Shaoping1 aShen, Chaofeng1 aChen, Guangcun1 aShi, Jiyan1 aChen, Yingxu0 tApplied soil ecology.g2010 July, v. 45, no. 3 p.232-237dElsevier Sciencex0929-13937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2010.04.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/11/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02940naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245011700164300001400281500002300295500001500318520159000333650001301923650002201936650001401958650002301972650001701995650002002012650002502032650001402057650001102071651002102082653001502103653002502118653002602143653001202169700001802181700001302199700001602212773009102228852000902319856008502328930003302413945001302446946001102459655001202470IND2290678520221122073338.0010427e200103  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229067852DNAL7 a10.1080/070606601095069102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSholberg, P.L.10aSurvey of Erwinia amylovora isolates from British Columbia for resistance to bactericides and virulence on apple  ap. 60-67.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aA total of 80 Erwinia amylovora (Burrill) Winslow et al. isolates, primarily from fire blighted apple shoots were collected from more than 40 different orchard locations in British Columbia between 1993 and 1998. Thirty-seven of the isolates representing 46% of the total number were not inhibited by 1000 microgram/mL streptomycin and were considered streptomycin resistant. Streptomycin-resistant isolates were found in orchards from Winfield (Vernon area, B.C.) to Oliver, B.C., with the greatest concentration of resistance isolates found in the central Okanagan Valley at Summerland. Disease severity produced by 16 representative E. amylovora isolates on 'McIntosh' seedlings ranged from zero to nine leaves blighted per seedling, with 12 isolates showing a high level of virulence because they blighted five or more leaves per plant. Of these 12, 8 were streptomycin sensitive and 4 were streptomycin resistant, indicating that virulence and streptomycin resistance are independent factors. Eighteen of 42 E. amylovora isolates tested for copper tolerance grew on casitone yeast extract medium containing copper sulphate 0.16 mM; 2 of the 18 isolates grew in the presence of copper sulphate 0.32 mM, indicating that tolerance to copper may be increasing in British Columbia orchards. None of the isolates would be expected to cause problems in copper sprayed orchards because they were not able to grow in the presence of copper sulphate 1.10 mM. The ramifications of streptomycin resistance and copper tolerance for the control of fire blight in British Columbia are discussed. 3aorchards 3aErwinia amylovora 3aseedlings 3astrain differences 3astreptomycin 3aMalus domestica 3apesticide resistance 3avirulence 3ashoots 3aBritish Columbia 0ainhibition 0aantimicrobial agents 0aanti-infective agents 0astrains1 aBedford, K.E.1 aHaag, P.1 aRandall, P.0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2001 Mar., v. 23, no. 1 p.60-67x0706-06617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/070606601095069103Available from publisher's Web site  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03479naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003400152245014200186300001600328500002400344520236200368650001702730650001202747650002302759650003102782650002302813650002702836650001802863651001902881651001302900700002402913700001802937773011002955852000903065856005503074655001203129IND4439323220221122073312.0100702e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443932322DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01838.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClements, W.

Evaluating the effectiveness of stream restoration is often challenging because of the lack of pre-treatment data, narrow focus on physicochemical measures and insufficient post-restoration monitoring. Even when these fundamental elements are present, quantifying restoration success is difficult because of the challenges associated with distinguishing treatment effects from seasonal variation, episodic events and long-term climatic changes. 2. We report results of one of the most comprehensive and continuous records of physical, chemical and biological data available to assess restoration success for a stream ecosystem in North America. Over a 17 year period we measured seasonal and annual changes in metal concentrations, physicochemical characteristics, macroinvertebrate communities, and brown trout Salmo trutta populations in the Arkansas River, a metal-contaminated stream in Colorado, USA. 3. Although we observed significant improvements in water quality after treatment, the effectiveness of restoration varied temporally, spatially and among biological response variables. The fastest recovery was observed at stations where restoration eliminated point sources of metal contamination. Recovery of macroinvertebrates was significantly delayed at some stations because of residual sediment contamination and because extreme seasonal and episodic variation in metal concentrations prevented recolonization by sensitive species. 4. Synthesis and applications. Because recovery trajectories after the removal of a stressor are often complex or nonlinear, long-term studies are necessary to assess restoration success within the context of episodic events and changes in regional climate. The observed variation in recovery among chemical and biological endpoints highlights the importance of developing objective criteria to assess restoration success. Although the rapid response of macroinvertebrates to reduced metal concentrations is encouraging, we have previously demonstrated that benthic communities from the Arkansas River remained susceptible to other novel anthropogenic stressors. We suggest that the resistance or resilience of benthic macroinvertebrate communities to novel stressors may be effective indicators of restoration success that can account for the non-additive (e.g. synergistic) nature of compound perturbations. 3aSalmo trutta 3aclimate 3amacroinvertebrates 3aphysicochemical properties 3aseasonal variation 3asediment contamination 3awater quality 3aArkansas River 3aColorado1 aVieira, Nicole K.M.1 aChurch, S.

The absence of data on avian mycoplasmosis in Algeria and the importance of the poultry breeding in Batna encouraged us to undertake the prevalence of the most pathogenic mycoplasmas in broiler and layer chickens in this area, Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG). 143 Mycoplasmas were isolate from 237 samples, at a rate of 60.33%. MG was isolate at a rate of 21.67% (2.09% in layer hens and 19.58% in broiler chickens). The serological screening using of breedings showed a sensitivity of 83.10%.

A third lipoxygenase cDNA, loxP1, was isolated from pea. The deduced amino acid sequences of loxA and loxB show 61-74% identity with those of soybean seed LOXs. loxA and loxB mRNAs are abundant in roots and non-growing regions of seedling hypocotyls. Lower levels of these mRNAs are found in hypocotyl growing regions. Exposure of soybean seedlings to water deficit causes a rapid increase in loxA and loxB mRNAs in the elongating hypocotyl region. Similarly, loxP1 mRNA levels increase rapidly when pea plants are wilted. loxA and loxB mRNA levels also increase in wounded soybean leaves, and these mRNAs accumulate in soybean suspension cultures treated with 20 micromole methyl jasmonate. These results demonstrate that LOX gene expression is modulated in response to water deficit and wounding and suggest a role for lipoxygenase in plant responses to these stresses. 3amessenger RNA 3aGlycine max 3ahypocotyls 3ajasmonic acid 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3awater stress 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aleaves 2aAcetatesxpharmacology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCyclopentanesxpharmacology 2aFabaceaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aLipoxygenasexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxylipins 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSoybeansxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aWaterxmetabolism 0agenetic regulation 0aloxb gene 0aloxa gene 0alipoxygenase 0amolecular sequence data 0aabiotic stress1 aMullet, J.E.0 tMGG.g1991 Dec. 1, v. 230, no. 3 p.456-462x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02439naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245009200175300001600267500002400283520132900307650001501636650001401651650000901665650002501674650001201699650002501711650001401736650002301750650001501773650001601788700003001804700002201834700002101856773012401877852000902001856005502010655001202065IND4431283920221122074425.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443128392DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.2009.00948.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertoli, Carlos I.10aDirect and correlated responses to chill-coma recovery selection in Drosophila buzzatii  ap. 154-159.  aIncludes references  aChill-coma recovery (CCR) is an important trait for thermal adaptation in insects. Multiple phenotypes could be affected by selection on CCR if the trait is genetically correlated with other adaptive traits. To test for heritable (co-)variation in CCR, we examined direct and correlated responses to bi-directional selection on CCR. Drosophila buzzatii Patterson & Wheeler (Diptera: Drosophilidae) was artificially selected for decreased and increased recovery time following exposure to 0 °C. After 18 selected generations, the selection response in CCR was significant but qualitatively asymmetric, with replicated lines for slow CCR showing the highest response. Knockdown resistance to high temperature was not affected by CCR selection. Starvation resistance in the adult fly showed no clear pattern of correlated responses to CCR selection. Selection on CCR had no impact on developmental time and body size. Chill-coma recovery shows no apparent genetic trade-offs with any of the multiple traits included in this study. These results are largely consistent with recent studies on clines in D. buzzatii, which showed that CCR is not across-population correlated with other clinally varying traits of thermal adaptation. Cold adaptation may evolve toward increased cold resistance independent of upper thermal limits. 3aDrosophila 3abody size 3acold 3acorrelated responses 3ainsects 3apesticide resistance 3aphenotype 3aselection response 3astarvation 3atemperature1 aScannapieco, Alejandra C.1 aSambucetti, Pablo1 aNorry, Fabian M.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2010 Feb., v. 134, no. 2 p.154-159dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2009.00948.x 7aarticle04021naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184072000900193100002400202245010800226300001600334500002400350500001500374520222400389650001702613650002202630650002302652650002702675650001002702650001602712650002102728650001902749650001702768650001702785650001502802650001302817650001102830650001402841650002302855650002002878650001902898650002702917650002602944651001202970653002602982653001503008700002303023700001503046700002103061700002703082773009603109852000903205856008803214930003303302945002503335946001103360655001203371IND4439679720221122074509.0100709e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443967972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2010.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aK001 0aJ100 0aF500 0aL831 0aL0011 aOddsdottir, Edda S.10aEarly reduction of Otiorhynchus spp. larval root herbivory on Betula pubescens by beneficial soil fungi  ap. 168-174.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe present novel findings highlighting the early effects of inoculation of downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) seedlings with factorial combinations of beneficial soil fungi, namely, ectomycorrhizal and insect pathogenic fungi, on Otiorhynchus spp. larval root herbivory under Icelandic field conditions. Birch seedlings were pre-treated with (1) a mixture of four ectomycorrhizal fungal species: Paxillus involutus (Batsch: Fr.) Fr., Telephora terrestris Ehrh.: Fr., Phialophora finlandia Wang & Wilcox. and Hebeloma sp., (2) the insect pathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin or (3) a combined inoculum that included the four ectomycorrhizal fungal species and M. anisopliae. Non-inoculated seedlings served as untreated controls. Inoculated and control seedlings were transplanted into soils at three different sites representing eroded land, birch woodland and heathland. Assessment following the first growing season indicated that the effects on Otiorhynchus spp. larval root herbivory and seedling productivity of pre-inoculation with the ectomycorrhizal fungal species mixture and the insect pathogenic fungus, M. anisopliae, were highly dependent on site and treatment. Inoculation with ectomycorrhizal fungi and M. anisopliae significantly reduced root herbivory in both the birch woodland and, in particular, the eroded land sites. In the heathland site, no or even negative effects on root herbivory were observed. However, potential synergistic effects of combined inoculation with both ectomycorrhizal fungi and M. anisopliae were not identified under these experimental conditions. Accumulated seedling mortality ascribed to root herbivory after three growing seasons showed a significant site dependent response, but no significant treatment effect was detected. The effects of ectomycorrhizal and insect pathogenic fungi on root herbivory are discussed and we conclude that significant, although mostly unidentified, interactions between the inoculated fungi and the naturally occurring soil microorganisms may explain these findings. Such interactions require further detailed investigation in order to develop an efficient strategy for soil inoculation with beneficial fungi. 3aOtiorhynchus 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aPaxillus involutus 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3aroots 3aPhialophora 3aBetula pubescens 3ainsect control 3ainsect pests 3aforest trees 3aherbivores 3aHebeloma 3alarvae 3amortality 3abiological control 3aectomycorrhizae 3awoodland soils 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3aThelephora terrestris 3aIceland 0aPhialophora finlandia 0asoil fungi1 aEilenberg, Jørgen1 aSen, Robin1 aHarding, Susanne1 aHalldorsson, Gudmundur0 tApplied soil ecology.g2010 July, v. 45, no. 3 p.168-174dElsevier Sciencex0929-13937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2010.03.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20101123b20101204c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/11/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02137naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245013200142300001600274500001500290520070300305650002701008650001001035650001201045650001301057650002601070650001501096650001201111650002001123650002301143650002301166650002001189650002601209650001801235650002001253650002901273650001201302650003301314650001301347650001301360650002801373653001201401653000801413653001301421653003601434700002001470773006401490852000901554939003301563946001101596655001201607IND9201209320221122053827.0920303e19911201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920120932DNAL7 a17664402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnaya, N.10aTransformation of a methionine auxotrophic mutant of Mucor circinelloides by direct cloning of the corresponding wild type gene  ap. 449-455.  a2019-12-04  aA transformation system has been developed for Mucor circinelloides, by direct cloning of a wild-type methionine gene that complements the auxotrophic mutation. The marker gene isolated was associated with an autonomous replication sequence (ARS) functional in this zygomycete. Southern hybridisation analyses of transformants showed sequence homology both with vector DNA and with Mucor wild-type DNA. The transformation frequency (up to 6000 per microgram DNA) and the mitotic instability of the transformed cells were studied. The hybridisation pattern of undigested DNA from the transformants suggests that the inserts contain a novel autonomous replication element for this filamentous fungus. 3agenetic transformation 3aMucor 3amitosis 3aplasmids 3anutrient requirements 3amethionine 3amutants 3agenetic markers 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Replication 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenomic Library 2aMethioninexbiosynthesis 2aMitosis 2aMucorxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutation 2aPlasmids 2aTransformation, Genetic 0acloning 0aDNA 0amet gene 0aautonomous replication sequence1 aRoncero, M.I.G.0 tMGG.g1991 Dec. 1, v. 230, no. 3 p.449-455x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03804naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245014500146300001500291520185300306650001802159650001602177650003602193650001902229650001002248650001202258650002002270650002302290650003202313650001302345650001002358650002102368650000702389650003402396650000902430650003902439650001602478650001102494650001202505650001902517650002402536650003302560650002702593650009302620650003902713650002302752650006002775650002502835650001302860650003402873650003402907650001502941650002602956700001702982773009902999852000903098930003303107945001303140946001303153655001203166IND2205409220221122053835.0000623e199909  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220540922DNAL7 a105823242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeunaber, R.12aA novel, endogenous inhibitor of 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity isolated from liver cytosolic fractions of bream (Abramis brama L.)  ap. 89-100.  aThe cytosolic supernatant of bream (Abramis brama L.) liver homogenates inhibits the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity of pike (Esox lucius) microsomal fractions. The inhibitor shows no activity against 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase and benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase indicating a high isoenzyme specificity. The inhibiting component is a heat-sensitive substance (56 degrees C for 5') which is not self regenerating after subsequent cooling. It can be isolated from the cytosolic fraction using two combined steps of ion exchange chromatography. The purification factor is 500-fold with a recovery rate of 70%. SDS-PAGE of the purified fractions indicate that electrophoretic purity was not achieved. However, a prominent band at about 97 kDa was present in all fractions in a close intensity-activity relationship. The molecular weight of the native form of the purified protein was determined to be 175 +/- 35 kDa using gel filtration on a Sephacryl S 300 HR column. So far the inhibitor can be characterized as a protein. It shows strong tendencies to aggregate due to lipophilic interactions. These interactions can be repressed by the addition of 1% sodium cholate. The inhibitor has an optimum activity at 25 degrees C and pH 8.0. The inhibitor does not correspond to any of the known cytosolic, endogenous inhibitors of EROD activities in fish, including proteases, cytosolic phosphatases, kinases and resorufin reductase (e.g. DT-diaphorase), although a non-dicoumarol (10 micromolar)-inhibited menadione oxidoreductase activity of up to 46.7 +/- 0.4 nmol/min per mg inhibitory protein was measured. Kinetic studies using Michaelis-Menten kinetics with purified inhibitor fractions prove a non-competitive mode of inhibition. As this kind of inhibitor is not described yet it is named CERODIP (cytosolic, EROD-inhibiting protein). 3aAbramis brama 3aEsox lucius 3aNAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3abream 3acooling 3aenzyme kinetics 3agel chromatography 3aion exchange chromatography 3aisozymes 3aliver 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3apike 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteinases 3asodium 2aAnimals 2aCentrifugation 2aChromatography, Gel 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aCyprinidaexmetabolism 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP1A1xantagonists & inhibitorsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors 2aCytosolxchemistry 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aEsocidaexmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aLiverxchemistryxenzymology. 2aMicrosomes, Liverxenzymology 2aSolubility 2aSubstrate Specificity1 aAchazi, R.K.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1999 Sept., v. 124B, no. 1 p.89-100x1096-49597nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02679naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008100166300001600247500002300263500001500286520121100301650002201512650002001534650001201554650001801566650001101584650001801595650003001613650002201643650001901665650002601684650001601710650001401726650001801740650001401758650001001772650001101782651001201793653002701805653001601832700001801848700002301866700001601889773009301905852000901998856008502007930003302092945001302125946001102138655001202149IND2206163720221122053848.0000801e200006  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220616372DNAL7 a10.1080/070606600095004892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurkington, T.K.10aResidue decomposition and blackleg of canola: influence of tillage practices  ap. 150-154.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThe influence of tillage regime on the decomposition of shoot and root residues of canola (Brassica napus, Brassica rapa) infested with the virulent strain of Leptosphaeria maculans and disease levels was evaluated from 1993 to 1997, near Beaverlodge, Alberta. Fall mold-board ploughing in October 1993 was most effective at reducing the amount of canola residue, especially for the first 2 years. Residue retention was also greater for zero tillage than for conventional tillage. After 3 years, residue amounts were low for all tillage treatments. Initially shoot residues were more abundant than root residues, but the rate of decomposition for shoot residues was higher than for root residues. Soil disturbance as a result of tillage and seeding operations appeared to bring some residue, especially root residues, to the soil surface, resulting in a nonlinear relationship between residue weight and time. Low levels of blackleg were found in the canola grown in 1997 and were not significantly different among tillage treatments. A rotation including barley, field peas, and wheat for 3 years following canola helped to eliminate potential disease sources under all tillage systems used in this study. 3aPlenodomus lingam 3aHordeum vulgare 3atillage 3acrop residues 3asowing 3aPisum sativum 3afungal diseases of plants 3aTriticum aestivum 3aBrassica napus 3afield experimentation 3adegradation 3aincidence 3acrop rotation 3avirulence 3aroots 3ashoots 3aAlberta 0aLeptosphaeria maculans 0ainfestation1 aClayton, G.W.1 aKlein-Gebbinck, H.1 aWoods, D.L.0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2000 June, v. 22, no. 2 p.150-154x0706-06617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/070606600095004893Available from publisher's Web site  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02692naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100001300189245011100202300001600313500002400329500001500353520101900368650001301387650001501400650002601415650001301441650001401454650002801468650001501496650004201511650002001553650002401573650002001597650002201617650002301639653002501662653001701687700001801704700001701722700002101739700001701760700002101777700002101798700002201819773010201841852000901943856009301952930003302045945002502078946001102103655001202114IND4441524120221122044111.0100820e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444152412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2010.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aQ115 0aQ5051 aMa, Gang10aEffect of 1-methylcyclopropene on the expression of genes for ascorbate metabolism in postharvest broccoli  ap. 121-128.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) on ascorbate (AsA) metabolism in two cultivars of broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica), ‘Haitsu' and ‘Ryokurei', were studied and the possible molecular mechanisms are discussed. The results showed that 1-MCP treatment delayed the yellowing and suppressed ethylene production. Meanwhile, the AsA content declined to a lower level in the control during storage, and the reduction of AsA was significantly suppressed by the treatment with 1-MCP in the two cultivars. Gene expression analyses by real-time PCR showed that 1-MCP treatment down-regulated the expression of BO-APX1 and BO-APX2, and up-regulated that of BO-DHAR and BO-GLDH compared with the control. The regulation of this gene expression might contribute to the suppression of AsA reduction by the 1-MCP treatment in ‘Haitsu' and ‘Ryokurei' broccoli. The results arising from this study might provide new insights into the possible mechanism, by which treatment with 1-MCP delayed senescence. 3aethylene 3ametabolism 3apostharvest treatment 3abroccoli 3acultivars 3afood processing quality 3ashelf life 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3agene expression 3aethylene production 3aenzyme activity 3aBrassica oleracea 3achemical treatment 0a1-methylcyclopropene 0afood quality1 aZhang, Lancui1 aKato, Masaya1 aYamawaki, Kazuki1 aAsai, Tatsuo1 aNishikawa, Fumie1 aIkoma, Yoshinori1 aMatsumoto, Hikaru0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2010 Nov., v. 58, no. 2 p.121-128dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2010.05.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20110403b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/01/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03810naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245011000145300001600255520210100271650000902372650002902381650002002410650001802430650001202448650001002460650001202470650001802482650002702500650004302527650002302570650000902593650002402602650005802626650005502684650002802739650002602767650003702793650000902830650002702839650006502866650000902931650002502940650002802965650003302993653002303026700001803049700001603067773009303083852000903176930003303185945001303218946001303231655001203244IND2041775620221122001557.0940902e199405  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204177562DNAL7 a79104202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorroz, K.I.10aModulation of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase large subunit mRNA expression by butylated hydroxyanisole  ap. 150-155.  aDietary 2(3)-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (BHA) treatment has been shown to increase hepatic glutathione (GSH) content in rats and mice. Subsequent studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that hepatic gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) activity is increased in mice treated with dietary BHA. To test whether this increase in GCS activity follows an increase in hepatic messenger RNA for the large subunit of GCS (GCS-LS mRNA), a 390-base pair fragment corresponding to a region near the 5' end of the rat GCS-LS cDNA sequence was amplified using the PCR reaction and used to detect GCS-LS mRNA on Northern blots. Hepatic GSH, GCS activity, and GCS-LS mRNA levels were determined either in mice treated with BHA in the diet for 12 days or mice injected with diethyl maleate (DEM), phorone, and/or DL-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO) over a 24 hr period. BHA caused a 1.5-fold increase in GSH levels, a 1.7-fold increase in hepatic GCS activity by Day 12, and a rapid 5-fold increase in hepatic GCS mRNA levels reaching maximal levels after 2-3 days. Partial depletion of GSH with either phorone (70%) or DEM (50%) resulted in a 4- to 5-fold increase in hepatic GCS-LS mRNA levels by 9 hr and a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in hepatic GSH and GCS activity by 24 hr. Depletion of GSH with the GCS enzyme inhibitor BSO had no effect on GCS mRNA expression, even though GSH was depleted to 30%. When BSO was combined with the phorone treatment GSH levels were depleted to < 10%, but the large increase in GCS-LS mRNA seen with phorone alone was greatly attenuated. These data suggest that depletion of GSH per se, is not sufficient to induce elevation of GCS-LS mRNA levels, but that the formation of GSH conjugates may be required to trigger GCS-LS mRNA induction. The increase in GCS-LS mRNA levels may account for the increase in GCS activity and elevation of GSH observed following BHA treatment, as well as the "rebound" of GSH above control levels observed 18-24 hr following depletion of GSH by other chemicals. These results are consistent with the Michael acceptor hypothesis by Talalay. 3amice 3abutylated hydroxyanisole 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aligases 3aliver 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aButhionine Sulfoximine 2aButylated Hydroxyanisolexpharmacology 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDiet 2aFastingxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxdrug effects 2aGlutamate-Cysteine Ligasexdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aKetonesxpharmacology 2aLiverxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aMale 2aMaleatesxpharmacology 2aMethionine Sulfoximinexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred Strains 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Messengerxdrug effects 0agenetic regulation1 aBuetler, T.M.1 aEaton, D.L.0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g1994 May, v. 126, no. 1 p.150-155x0041-008X7nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03602naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245012200147300001200269520194500281650001502226650001502241650001602256650002102272650001302293650001002306650001502316650001102331650001502342650002602357650001002383650002902393650000902422650002502431650001202456650001802468650002202486650002002508650001102528650002002539650002802559650004002587650001102627650004502638650000902683650002402692650000902716653001302725653001402738653001902752700001502771700001602786700001602802773009002818852000902908930003302917945001302950946001302963655001202976IND2051834820221121230940.0960624e199601  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205183482DNAL7 a85604612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeinonen, J.T.10aDetermination of aflatoxin B1 biotransformation and binding to hepatic macromolecules in human precision liver slices  ap. 1-7.  aAlthough epidemiological studies suggest that aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a human carcinogen, at least in the presence of hepatitis B virus infection, animal studies have demonstrated large differences in species sensitivity to AFB1, and the sensitivity of humans relative to experimental animals remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the profile of AFB1 metabolism and the extent of AFB1 binding to cell macromolecules in human liver slices under experimental conditions that would allow direct comparison to similar endpoints in the rat, a species sensitive to the carcinogenic actions of AFB1. Liver slices were prepared from three individual human liver samples with a Krumdieck tissue slicer and incubated with 0.5 micromolar [3H]AFB1 for 2 hr. Significant interindividual variations were observed in the rates of oxidative metabolite formation and in specific binding to cell macromolecules. The rates of oxidative metabolism of AFB1 to AFQ1, AFP1, and AFM1 in the three human liver samples were similar to those previously observed in rat liver slices. AFB1-GSH conjugate formation was not detected in any of the human liver samples, and yet specific binding of AFB1 to cell macromolecules was considerably lower in the human liver slices relative to that in rat liver slices. AFB1-DNA binding levels ranged from 3 to 26% of control rat and AFB1-RNA binding levels ranged from 25 to 49% of control rat. The AFB1-protein binding level in the one human sample measured was 20% of that observed for control rat. While these results suggest that humans do not form as much AFBO as the rat, they are also consistent with the hypothesis that humans do not possess GST isozyme(s) with high specific activity toward AFBO. Significant individual differences in AFB1 metabolism and binding between humans suggest the presence of genetic and/or environmental factors that may confer large variability in susceptibility to AFB1. 3aaflatoxins 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3abinding proteins 3atoxicity 3aliver 3amicrosomes 3ahumans 3atoxicology 3abiological resistance 2aAdult 2aAflatoxin B1xmetabolism 2aAged 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aBiotransformation 2aDNAxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFrozen Sections 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aGlutathione Transferasexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aLiverxcytologyxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aRats 0ain vitro 0avariation 0atransformation1 aFisher, R.1 aBrendel, K.1 aEaton, D.L.0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g1996 Jan., v. 136, no. 1 p.1-7x0041-008X7nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle04012naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245014500146300001800291520183600309650001102145650001602156650001902172650001802191650001802209650001502227650001902242650002602261650002502287650001402312650002102326650002502347650001602372650002102388650001802409650002302427650002002450650001202470650002302482650002002505650002802525650003502553650004002588650004002628650005602668650003402724650004302758650003202801650000902833650002902842650002402871650004502895650003002940650002802970650003002998650003903028653002603067653002003093700001803113700001803131773008503149852000903234930003303243945001303276946001303289655001203302IND2330896720221121230943.0030220e200209  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233089672DNAL7 a123624612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMashek, D.G.10aMetabolic fate of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids and their effects on palmitic acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis in bovine hepatocytes  ap. 2283-2289.  aThe objectives were to determine the metabolic fate of different long-chain fatty acids, and their effects on palmitic acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis in bovine hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were isolated from four ruminating calves and exposed in suspension for 3 h to one of the following treatments: 1 mM palmitic acid (1C16), 2 mM palmitic acid (2C16), or 1 mM palmitic acid plus either 1 mM oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), linolenic (C18:3), eicosapentaenoic (C20:5), or docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6). Oxidation of [1-14C]palmitic acid or one of the [1-14C]-labeled treatment fatty acids to CO2 or incorporation into cellular triglycerides (TG), phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesterol esters were measured. Rates of oxidation to CO2 were 3- to 4-fold higher for C22:6 than for other fatty acids, with the exception of C20:5, which had intermediate rates of oxidation to CO2. In general, treatments 2C16 and C18:1 yielded the highest rates of incorporation into most cellular lipids, whereas the polyunsaturated fatty acids were poor substrates for incorporation into cellular lipids. The most pronounced change was a large reduction of polyunsaturated fatty acid incorporation into cellular TG compared to 1C16, 2C16, and C18:1. The unsaturated fatty acids also influenced palmitic acid metabolism. The addition of C20:5 yielded the highest rates of palmitic acid oxidation to CO2 followed by addition of C18:1 and C22:6. Treatments containing polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased palmitic acid metabolism to TG and total cellular lipids compared with treatments 2C16 and C18:1. Rates of gluconeogenesis from propionate were significantly higher for the treatment containing C18:1. Long-chain fatty acids vary in their routes of metabolism and influence palmitic acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis in bovine hepatocytes. 3acalves 3ahepatocytes 3aliver function 3aculture media 3apalmitic acid 3aoleic acid 3alinolenic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aoxidation 3alipid metabolism 3abiochemical pathways 3acholesterol 3atriacylglycerols 3aphospholipids 3acholesteryl esters 3agluconeogenesis 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aCells, Cultured 2aCholesterolxmetabolism 2aCholesterol Estersxmetabolism 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxpharmacology 2aEicosapentaenoic Acidxpharmacology 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aGluconeogenesisxdrug effects 2aHepatocytesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aLinoleic Acidxpharmacology 2aMale 2aOleic Acidxpharmacology 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPalmitic Acidxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPhospholipidsxmetabolism 2aPropionatesxmetabolism 2aTriglyceridesxmetabolism 2aalpha-Linolenic Acidxpharmacology 0acell culture vaccines 0acellular lipids1 aBertics, S.J.1 aGrummer, R.R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Sept., v. 85, no. 9 p.2283-2289x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle04076naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003400164245018600198300001800384520223800402650003502640650001202675650001202687650001702699650001302716650002102729650001102750650002602761650001602787650001702803650001402820650002002834650001102854650001402865650001502879650001102894650003302905650001802938650001102956650002802967651001002995653002603005653001003031653001703041700003203058700002903090700003303119700003103152700002903183773013603212852000903348856008503357930003303442946001103475655001203486IND4439505820221121220633.0100702e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443950582DNAL7 a204736552pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-010-3822-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIglesias Rodríguez, Roberto 10aComparison of several chemometric techniques for the classification of orujo distillate alcoholic samples from Galicia (northwest Spain) according to their certified brand of origin  ap. 2603-2614.  aThis paper has a double objective. The first goal was to develop an authentication system to differentiate between traditional orujo alcoholic distillates with and without a certified brand of origin (CBO). Owing to their low price and quality, samples without a CBO can be used as substrates for falsification of genuine CBO ones. The second objective was to perform a comparison of the abilities of the different chemometric procedures employed for this classification. The classification was performed on the basis of the chemical information contained in the metal composition of the orujo distillates. Eight metals determined by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry were considered (Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, K, Mg, Na and Ni). After the appropriate pretreatment, the data were processed using different chemometric techniques. In the first stage, principal component analysis and cluster analysis were employed to reveal the latent structure contained in the data. Once it had been demonstrated that a relation exists between the metal composition and the raw materials, and not between the metal composition and the distillation systems employed for the orujo production, the second step consisted in the comparative application of different supervised pattern recognition procedures (such as linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbours, soft independent modelling of class analogy, UNEQ and different artificial neural network approaches, including multilayer feed-forward, support vector machines, learning vector quantization and probabilistic neural networks). The results showed the different capabilities of the diverse classification techniques to discriminate between Galician orujo samples. The best results were those provided by probabilistic neural networks, in which the correct recognition abilities for CBO classes and without CBO classes were 98.6 ± 3.1 and 98.0 ± 4.5%; the prediction results were 87.7 ± 3.3 and 86.2 ± 5.0%, respectively. The usefulness of chemical metal analysis in combination with chemometric techniques to develop a classification procedure to authenticate Galician CBO orujo samples is demonstrated. 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achemometrics 3achromium 3acluster analysis 3acopper 3adiscriminant analysis 3adistillates 3adistillation 3amagnesium 3aneural networks 3anickel 3apotassium 3aprediction 3aprices 3aprincipal component analysis 3araw materials 3asodium 3asupport vector machines 3aSpain 0aAlcoholic distillates 0aOrujo 0aChemometrics1 aFernández Delgado, Manuel.1 aBarciela García, Julia 1 aPeña Crecente, Rosa María 1 aGarcía Martín, Sagrario 1 aHerrero Latorre, Carlos 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2010 July, v. 397, no. 6 p.2603-2614dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-010-3822-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100702b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02722naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245012100165300001600286500002400302520165100326650001501977650001901992650002802011650001902039650001602058650001002074650001302084650001502097650002102112650001702133700001502150700001402165700001802179773009402197852000902291856004802300655001202348IND4430705520221121220751.0100101e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443070552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-009-9993-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirilova, E.

The dominant diatoms indicating meso- to eutrophic conditions were Aulacoseira subarctica, Cyclotella ocellata, C. cyclopuncta, C. meneghiniana, Puncticulata bodanica, Aulacoseira granulata, Cyclostephanos dubius, C. invisitatus, Stephanodiscus hantzschii, S. medius, and S. parvus. Ordination of diatom data separated the lakes into four groups according to their total phosphorus concentrations (TP), water supply, water management, and origin. The first group consists of dike-breach lakes, which were in stable eutrophic to hypertrophic conditions throughout the past century with diatom-inferred TP (DI-TP) concentrations of between 70 and 300 μg l⁻¹. The main factors influencing these dike-breach lakes are river management, ground water supply of riverine origin, and local land use. The second group are artificial lakes of fluctuating oligo- to mesotrophic conditions and DI-TP concentrations of 10-30 μg l⁻¹. Only one of the artificial lakes showed a DI-TP increase due to changes in catchment agricultural practice. A third group includes an artificial moat and an inland dike-breach lake with DI-TP concentrations of 50-100 μg l⁻¹. The fourth group contains an individual dike-breach lake with stable mesotrophic conditions of 50 μg l⁻¹ throughout the past century. Rather than showing a regional pattern, the studied lakes behave very individualistically with regard to their trophic history, reflecting changes in the local hydrology and in their nutrient sources. 3aCyclotella 3aStephanodiscus 3aagricultural watersheds 3aeutrophication 3agroundwater 3alakes 3aland use 3aphosphorus 3awater management 3awater supply1 aCremer, H.1 aHeiri, O.1 aLotter, A.

Percent recovery of P. erythroseptica after 3 weeks of storage exceeded 90% and was significantly higher (P = 0.05) than for isolates of P. infestans. After 4 months of storage, recovery of P. erythroseptica was 100% for isolates stored at -80 degrees C and 0% for those at -20 degrees C. Storage of P. erythroseptica at -80 degrees C is a convenient method of maintaining isolates that are to be used in short-term studies. 3aPhytophthora erythroseptica 3afrozen storage 3afreezing 3amortality 3astrains 3aPhytophthora infestans 3amycelium 0agrowth 0asample processing1 aSturz, A.V.0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2001 Mar., v. 23, no. 1 p.106-109x0706-06617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/070606601095069163Available from publisher's Web site  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02280naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245007100162300001600233500002300249500001500272520114400287650001801431650002101449650001501470650001401485650001801499650001301517650002301530650001901553650001401572650001401586651001701600653000901617773009301626852000901719856008501728930003301813945001301846946001101859655001201870IND2322383620221121182538.0010803e200106  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232238362DNAL7 a10.1080/070606601095069222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGossen, B.D.10aImpact of burial on survival of Ascochyta lentis on lentil residue  ap. 146-148.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aIn the fall of 1994, a trial was initiated to assess the survival of Ascochyta lentis Vassil. on naturally infected lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) residue buried at 0-, 5- and 10-cm depth in a clay loam soil at Saskatoon, Sask. Samples were collected and assessed from 1995 to 1998, with six replicates for each depth x sampling date combination. After collection, the material was air dried, divided in half (by mass), and assessed using a plating and a bioassay technique. Results from both techniques were similar. Inoculum levels in the spring of 1995 were almost an order of magnitude higher than the previous fall, indicating that the pathogen had spread in the infected residue. Inoculum potential declined slowly over the course of the trial, but the pathogen was still present and infectious (although at low levels) in the residue almost 4 years after harvest. There was a consistent pattern of seasonal fluctuation in the level of A. lentis in infected residue: levels were higher in spring than in the previous fall. Contrary to previous reports, burial did not have a substantial impact on the long-term survival of A. lentis. 3acrop residues 3ainoculum density 3asoil depth 3abioassays 3apathogenicity 3aduration 3aseasonal variation 3aLens culinaris 3amortality 3aAscochyta 3aSaskatchewan 0aLens0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2001 June, v. 23, no. 2 p.146-148x0706-06617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/070606601095069223Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02861naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245009100160300001600251500002300267500001500290520135400305650002501659650001501684650002801699650001101727650001601738650001401754650003001768650001301798650001801811650002301829650002201852650001801874650001001892653002401902653002001926653001101946653001001957700001701967700001801984700001602002700002102018700002002039700001602059773009302075852000902168856008502177930003302262945001302295946001102308655001202319IND2322383220221121152512.0010803e200106  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232238322DNAL7 a10.1080/070606601095069202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChongo, G.10aReaction of seedling roots of 14 crop species to Fusarium graminearum from wheat heads  ap. 132-137.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aTo increase our understanding of the epidemiology of fusarium head blight of wheat and barley, a study was conducted under controlled conditions to determine whether Fusarium graminearum Schwabe from wheat can cause seedling blight or root rot in various crop species. Inoculum of F. graminearum, consisting of a wheat floret infected with the pathogen, was placed adjacent to surface-sterilized seed of each crop in a sterile potting mix. Wheat, barley, oat, rye, triticale, canaryseed, flax, canola (Brassica napus L. and Brassica rapa L.), mustard, bean, field pea, lentil, and chickpea were included in the study. Seedling emergence and root rot severity were scored at 3-4 weeks after seeding. The effect of temperature on seedling blight severity was also tested in barley cv. Brier. Inoculation reduced emergence in all crops, except canola, mustard, and field pea, and increased root rot severity in most crops. Emergence of seedlings was not affected at the lowest temperature (10:5 degrees C day:night) and no root infection occurred. However, as the temperature increased from 10 to 30 degrees C, seedling emergence and establishment were reduced and root rot severity increased. Infection of roots, crowns, and seedlings of the crops grown in rotation with wheat indicates that these crops may act as alternative hosts to F. graminearum. 3aFusarium graminearum 3ahost range 3ainterspecific variation 3ablight 3agrain crops 3aseedlings 3afungal diseases of plants 3aroot rot 3aoilseed crops 3aseedling emergence 3aalternative hosts 3acrop rotation 3aroots 0aspecies differences 0aGibberella zeae 0aplants 0acrops1 aGossen, B.D.1 aKutcher, H.R.1 aGilbert, J.1 aTurkington, T.K.1 aFernandez, M.R.1 aMcLaren, D.0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2001 June, v. 23, no. 2 p.132-137x0706-06617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/070606601095069203Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02812naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010500165300001600270500002300286500001500309520145000324650001401774650001701788650001001805650003301815650003001848650001901878650002201897650003501919650001001954650002301964650002201987650001302009653002802022653002602050700001702076700001702093773009302110852000902203856008502212930003302297945001302330946001102343655001202354IND2322383820221121114842.0010803e200106  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232238382DNAL7 a10.1080/070606601095069242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez, M.R.10aReaction of common and durum wheat cultivars to infection of kernels by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis  ap. 158-162.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aKernel discoloration caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Died.) Drechs. is an important downgrading factor in wheat. Twenty-nine durum and common wheat cultivars belonging to four different quality classes were compared for their reaction to inoculation of kernels with P. tritici-repentis under controlled conditions. All cultivars were susceptible to this pathogen but they differed in the predominant type and (or) intensity of kernel discoloration and in incidence and severity of infection. The most common symptom associated with infection by this pathogen is red smudge, a pink to bright red discoloration. This developed in all Canada Western Amber Durum cultivars but was less apparent in the Canada Western Red Spring cultivars. Other common symptoms observed in all cultivars were black point, dark smudge, and specks. Some differences in the incidence and severity of the discoloration among cultivars appeared to be related to seed colour. The white-seeded cultivars, regardless of quality class, were in general more susceptible than the red-seeded cultivars. However, there were also differences in the predominant type of symptom and in the incidence and severity of infection among and within classes that were not related to seed colour. It was concluded that the type of symptom, and its incidence and severity, are mostly genotype-dependent and only partially conditioned by seed colour or wheat quality class or species. 3acultivars 3acrop quality 3aseeds 3aPyrenophora tritici-repentis 3afungal diseases of plants 3aseed pathology 3aTriticum aestivum 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3acolor 3adisease resistance 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 0aexperimental infections 0abiological resistance1 aDePauw, R.M.1 aClarke, J.M.0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2001 June, v. 23, no. 2 p.158-162x0706-06617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/070606601095069243Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02457naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245006800145300001800213520108800231650002201319650001501341650001301356650001501369650001801384650002301402650002001425650002101445650002401466650001201490650001101502650003701513650001101550650001401561650004801575650001101623651001901634651001801653653001901671653002201690700001701712700001901729700001701748700002101765773008501786852000901871930003301880945001301913946001301926655001201939IND2330888520221121114836.0030219e200209  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233088852DNAL7 a123624572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, L.E.14aThe impact of clinical lameness on the milk yield of dairy cows  ap. 2250-2256.  aThis paper investigates the impact of lameness on milk yield. The dataset includes approximately 8000 test-day milk yields from 900 cows on five farms in Gloucester, UK, collected over 18 mo from 1997 to 1999. The data were structured to account for repeated measures of test-day yield (1 to 10 per cow) and analyzed to account for this autocorrelation. Factors affecting milk yield included: farm of origin, stage of lactation, parity, and whether a cow ever became lame. In clinically lame cows, milk yield was reduced from up to 4 mo before a case of lameness was diagnosed and treated and for the 5 mo after treatment. The total mean estimated reduction in milk yield per 305-d lactation was approximately 360 kg. We conclude that clinical lameness has a significant impact on milk production. This is important information for assessing the economic impact of clinical lameness and its impact on cow health. It adds weight to the importance of early identification of clinical lameness and the urgency of techniques to improve the definition of this highly subjective diagnosis. 3adisease diagnosis 3adairy cows 3alameness 3amilk yield 3adairy farming 3adisease prevalence 3alactation stage 3alactation number 3amathematical models 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxphysiopathology 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aLameness, Animalxphysiopathologyxtherapy. 2aParity 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain 0amilk recording 0amultilevel models1 aHedges, V.J.1 aSchukken, Y.H.1 aBlowey, R.W.1 aPackington, A.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Sept., v. 85, no. 9 p.2250-2256x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle04617naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245014500147300001600292520280100308650003103109650001503140650001303155650002003168650001203188650001403200650000903214650001203223650003203235650002403267650004103291650001103332650002903343650002403372650002903396650000903425650003803434650003703472650004603509650003903555650002703594650004803621650002703669650000903696650002503705650001003730650004003740653001603780700001603796700001603812700001903828700001903847773009403866852000903960939003303969946001304002655001204015IND9204175120221121063040.0920701e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920417512DNAL7 a13101652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtchison, W.D.10aComparative neuromuscular blocking actions of levamisole and pyrantel-type anthelmintics on rat and gastrointestinal nematode somatic muscle  ap. 133-143.  aThe basis for the comparative toxicity to parasitic nematodes and their mammalian hosts of the anthelmintics levamisole, pyrantel, and several related analogs on somatic nicotinic cholinergic transmission was examined. Measurements of muscle contractility and membrane potential were made using the isolated hemidiaphragm preparation of the rat and isolated axial muscle segments from the gastrointestinal nematode Haemonchus contortus. Pyrantel caused a dose- and time-dependent reduction of nerve-evoked twitches in the rat diaphragm. These effects were exacerbated by increasing the frequency of phrenic nerve stimulation from 0.5 to 50 Hz. Levamisole was less potent and the onset of its effects slower than pyrantel. Neither drug significantly affected twitches evoked from d-tubocurarine-blocked preparations following direct stimulation of the diaphragm. Twitch depression was reversed by washing, but not by application of physostigmine. In H. contortus, both drugs stimulated a spastic contraction and sustained paralysis in the concentration range of 1-10 micromolar, mimicking the action of nicotine. Neither nicotinic nor muscarinic antagonists blocked these responses. Moreover, neither nicotinic antagonists nor muscarinic agonists or antagonists had any independent effect on contractility of the parasite muscle segments. The blocking actions of levamisole and pyrantel on H. contortus axial muscle were associated with membrane depolarization at the muscle. In the rat-isolated hemidiaphragm, pyrantel, but not levamisole, depolarized end-plate regions of muscle fibers. d-Tubocurarine blocked the depolarizing action of pyrantel but not levamisole on rat-isolated hemidiaphragm. In axial muscle fibers of H. contortus, d-tubocurarine did not block the depolarizing actions of pyrantel, levamisole, or nicotine. 3-Bromo and 3-amino derivatives of levamisole were equipotent with and mimicked the actions of the parent compound on H. contortus axial muscle contractility. In the rat preparation, the 3-bromo derivative was more potent than levamisole or 3-amino-levamisole. 3-Amino-levamisole, but not 3-bromo-levamisole, depolarized muscle endplate membrane in the rat diaphragm. Results of the present study are consistent with the following conclusions: (a) both levamisole and pyrantel block contractility of nematode axial muscle by causing sustained depolarization of the muscle membrane; (b) both drugs block neuromuscular transmission at the mammalian neuromuscular junction but their mechanisms appear to differ; (c) levamisole and pyrantel are more potent blockers of neuromuscular transmission in H. contortus than in the rat. These results suggest that potentially important pharmacological differences exist between nematode and mammalian somatic nicotinic receptors. 3aanimal parasitic nematodes 3alevamisole 3apyrantel 3adigestive tract 3amuscles 3areceptors 3arats 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxpharmacology 2aCholinexphysiology 2aDiaphragmxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aHaemonchusxdrug effects 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aLevamisolexpharmacology 2aMale 2aMembrane Potentialsxdrug effects 2aMuscle Contractionxdrug effects 2aMuscle, Smoothxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMusclesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aNematodaxdrug effects 2aNeuromuscular Blocking Agentsxpharmacology 2aPyrantelxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aSheep 2aSynaptic Transmissionxdrug effects 0acomparisons1 aGeary, T.G.1 aManning, B.1 aVandeWaa, E.A.1 aThompson, D.P.0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g1992 Jan., v. 112, no. 1 p.133-143x0041-008X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03382naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245013100162300001600293500002300309520205500332650002702387650002602414650001602440650002302456650001002479650001602489650001402505650004302519650002002562650001202582650002102594653004002615700001102655700001902666700001802685773009402703852000902797856008502806930003302891945001302924946001102937655001202948IND2208228720221121062833.0001208e200009  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220822872DNAL7 a10.1080/070606600095004792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutton, J.C.10aRelationships of ultraviolet radiation dose and inactivation of pathogen propagules in water and hydroponic nutrient solutions  ap. 300-309.  aSummary in French.  aConidia of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cyclaminis and zoospores of Pythium aphanidermatum were suspended in water and hydroponic nutrient solutions and treated with various doses of UV radiation (253.7 nm) by means of a collimated-beam apparatus and a flow-through apparatus. Germination and colony-forming ability of spores from treated suspensions were estimated on agar media. Colony-forming ability of F. oxysporum f. sp. cyclaminis decreased logarithmically, with increase in applied dose of UV radiation, and in curves that were 3 to 10 times steeper for conidia in water compared to crop nutrient solutions. In tests in the flow-through apparatus, applied doses required to inactivate 99.90% of conidia in water, in fresh nutrient solution, and in nutrient solutions from pepper and tomato crops were 20, 93, 104, and 254 mW(.)s(.)cm-2, respectively. In the collimated-beam apparatus, applied doses to inactivate 99.90% of conidia were two to three times higher. Colony-forming ability of P. aphanidermatum zoospores decreased logarithmically, with UV radiation dose, in curves that ranged from similar to twice as steep for zoospores in water compared to plant nutrient solutions. Inactivation of 99.99% of zoospores in water, fresh plant nutrient solution, and pepper crop nutrient solution, respectively, required doses of 12, 17, and 38 mW(.)s(.)cm-2 as estimated in the flow-through apparatus, and 34, 46, and 213 mW(.)s(.)cm-2 as estimated in the collimated-beam apparatus. Colony-producing ability of zoospores of P. aphanidermatum and an unidentified species of Pythium from hydroponic lettuce declined more rapidly than did germination incidence as UV dose was increased. In conclusion, UV radiation doses of 30-40 and 20-30 mW(.)s(.)cm-2 inactivated most conidia of F. oxysporum f. sp. cyclaminis and zoospores of P. aphanidermatum, respectively, when applied to suspensions of the spores in water. For spores in plant nutrient solutions, the applied dose must be increased to compensate for absorbance of UV radiation in the solution. 3aPythium aphanidermatum 3aultraviolet radiation 3airradiation 3anutrient solutions 3awater 3asterilizing 3azoospores 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aCapsicum annuum 3aconidia 3aapplication rate 0afusarium oxysporum f.sp. cyclaminis1 aUy, H.1 aGrodzinski, B.1 aJohnstone, M.0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2000 Sept., v. 22, no. 3 p.300-309x0706-06617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/070606600095004793Available from publisher's Web site  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03071naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245017800181300001800359520111500377650001701492650001501509650001301524650001001537650002601547650002201573650001301595650002101608650001801629650001701647650001001664650007001674650001801744650003601762650005801798650005301856650001101909650003301920650003001953650005701983653001002040653001102050653002102061653002402082700002102106700001702127700001902144700002002163700002402183773013602207852000902343856008502352930003302437946001102470655001202481IND4439501620221121062910.0100702e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443950162DNAL7 a203364492pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-010-3639-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGika, H.

Chromatography was performed on a C₁₈ column and detection was performed by a single-quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to LC via an electrospray interface (ESI). The column effluent was also monitored at 370 nm using a photodiode-array detector. The developed method provided a linear dynamic range for concentrations from 0.5 μg mL⁻¹ to 100 μg mL⁻¹. Method precision and accuracy were found to be satisfactory for clinical application, thus the method was successfully used for the analysis of daptomycin in pharmacokinetic studies. The drug was preventively administered against Gram-positive infections to 19 clinical patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Peritoneal fluid, blood plasma, and urine samples were collected at 13 time points over a period of 48 h. Clinical samples were analysed following simple sample-preparation procedures and daptomycin was unambiguously detected and quantified. 3ablood plasma 3adaptomycin 3adialysis 3adrugs 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apatients 3apharmacokinetics 3aspectrometers 3atherapeutics 3aurine 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aAscitic Fluid 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aDaptomycinxanalysisxbloodxpharmacokineticsxurine. 2aGram-Positive Bacterial Infectionsxdrug therapy 2aHumans 2aPeritoneal Dialysisxmethods 2aRenal Replacement Therapy 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionizationxmethods 0aLC-MS 0aPlasma 0aPeritoneal fluid 0aPeritoneal dialysis1 aMichopoulos, F. 1 aDivanis, D. 1 aMetalidis, S. 1 aNikolaidis, P. 1 aTheodoridis, G.

Honeybee foragers with their high metabolic demand due to flight are especially prone to such a stress when they are infected. We hypothesized that infection by the microsporidian gut parasite Nosema ceranae can lower the hemolymph sugar level of an individual forager and uncouple its energetic state from its normally tight correlation with the colony energetic state. We support our hypothesis by showing that free-flying foragers that are infected have lower trehalose levels than uninfected ones but the two do not differ in their trehalose levels when fed until satiation. The trehalose level of infected bees was also found to decline at a faster rate while their glucose level is maintained at a quantity comparable to uninfected bees. These results suggest that infected foragers have lower flying ability and the intriguing possibility that the carbohydrate levels of an individual bee can act as a modulator of its foraging behavior, independent of social cues such as colony demand for nectar. We discuss the importance of such pathophysiological changes on foraging behavior in the context of the recently observed colony collapses. 3atemporal variation 3ainsect colonies 3aApis mellifera 3aNosema ceranae 3aglucose 3aenergy metabolism 3acolony collapse disorder 3anosema disease 3aworker honey bees 3atrehalose 3aforaging 3ahemolymph 3asatiety 3aenergy balance 3ainsect flight 3asugar content 2aAnimals 2aBeesxmicrobiology 2aHemolymphxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aNosemaxphysiology 2aTime Factors 2aTrehalosexanalysisxmetabolism. 0aenergetic state 0acarbohydrates1 aNaug, Dhruba0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2010 Nov., v. 56, no. 11 p.1572-1575dPergamonx0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.05.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20101203b20110101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/10/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02673naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245009800147300001800245520139800263650001501661650002001676650001201696650001101708650001401719650002201733650002201755650001901777650001201796650002101808650002301829650002101852650001101873650001401884650001201898650001601910650002001926653002101946653000901967700001701976700001701993700001602010773008502026852000902111930003302120945001302153946001302166655001202179IND2330899220221121052624.0030220e200209  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233089922DNAL7 a123624762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOverton, M.W.10aUsing time-lapse video photography to assess dairy cattle lying behavior in a free-stall barn  ap. 2407-2413.  aThe objectives of this observational study were to use time-lapse video photography to document dairy cow behavioral patterns, examine factors affecting lying behavior, and to develop guidelines for visual assessment of free-stall usage during summer conditions in a high producing dairy. Four video cameras were placed in a free-stall pen containing 144 stalls and 129 high producing cows. The videos were recorded over a 6-d period in July 1999 and then were reviewed using 60-min scan sampling techniques. Cows were counted as lying, standing in alley without eating, standing in free stalls, or eating in each of the four sections of the pen. Temperature probes were placed on the feedline, free stalls, on both ends of the pen, and at an outside location. Relationships between proportion eligible lying and ambient temperature, feeding time, and time since milking were examined. Proportion eligible lying was equal to number of cows lying divided by total number of cows lying or standing but not eating. Cattle showed a significant pattern of temporal cyclicity in their lying behavior, with the highest average proportion of eligible cows lying at 6:00 a.m. (85%) and the lowest at 9:00 p.m. (53%). Increasing environmental temperatures and time elapsed since milking negatively impacted proportion of eligible cows observed lying when evaluated using 60-min scan sampling techniques. 3adairy cows 3aanimal behavior 3aposture 3asummer 3aingestion 3amilking frequency 3aphysical activity 3aanimal comfort 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aPosture 2aTemperature 2aVideo Recording 0avideo recordings 0arest1 aSischo, W.M.1 aTemple, G.D.1 aMoore, D.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Sept., v. 85, no. 9 p.2407-2413x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03002naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196100001900205245009100224300001800315500002400333500001500357520122900372650002001601650001501621650001801636650002301654650001701677650001001694650002101704650001101725650002101736650001601757650002601773650002201799650001101821650001201832650002401844650003301868650002101901650001101922650001001933650000901943650003101952650001001983650001601993650001702009653001802026700002302044700001802067773009902085852000902184856009002193930003302283945002502316946001102341655001202352IND4441671920221121053034.0100823e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444167192DNAL7 a204523562pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.04.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL600 0aL001 0aL3001 aRomero, Alvaro10aCircadian rhythm of spontaneous locomotor activity in the bed bug, Cimex lectularius L  ap. 1516-1522.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBed bugs must avoid detection when finding hosts and returning to hidden harborages. Their stealthy habits include foraging when hosts are asleep. Characteristics of spontaneous locomotor activity rhythm of bed bugs with different feeding histories were studied. In the absence of host stimuli, adults and nymphs were much more active in the dark than in the light. The onset of activity in the scotophase commenced soon after lights-off. The free-running period (τ) for all stages was longer in continuous darkness (DD) than in continuous light (LL). The lengthening of τ in DD is an exception for the circadian rule that predicts the opposite in nocturnal animals. Activity in all stages was entrained to reverse L:D regimes within four cycles. Short-term starved adults moved more frequently than recently fed adults. While bed bugs can survive for a year or more without a blood meal, we observed a reduction in activity in insects held for five weeks without food. We suggest that bed bugs make a transition to host-stimulus dependent searching when host presence is not predictable. Such a strategy would enable bed bugs to maximize reproduction when resources are abundant and save energy when resources are scarce. 3ainsect behavior 3alocomotion 3aectoparasites 3anocturnal activity 3ahost seeking 3ahosts 3afeed deprivation 3anymphs 3acircadian rhythm 3aphotoperiod 3ahematophagous insects 3aCimex lectularius 3aimagos 2aAnimals 2aBedbugsxphysiology 2aCircadian Rhythmxphysiology 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aLight 2aMale 2aMotor Activityxphysiology 2aNymph 2aPhotoperiod 2aTime Factors 0aadult insects1 aPotter, Michael F.1 aHaynes, K.

Genetic marker genotypes were determined on 568 cows (from 168 milk samples and 400 hair samples) and 96 putative sires (from semen samples). The estimated pedigree error rate from the hair samples was 8.8%, and from the milk samples, 13.1%, giving an overall estimate of the error rate of 10%. This level of pedigree errors will have a relatively large impact on the efficiency of progeny testing and the accuracy of cow predicted breeding values. We predict a loss of response to selection of approximately 2 to 3% given this error rate. 3asires 3adairy cows 3apedigree 3aprogeny testing 3abreeding value 3aprediction 3amicrosatellite repeats 3agenetic markers 3amilk 3agenotype 3aselection response 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgenetics 2aDNAxanalysis 2aDairying 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aHairxchemistry 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aMilkxchemistry 2aPedigree 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSalivaxchemistry 2aSemenxchemistry 2aSensitivity and Specificity 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain 0ahair 0aerrors1 aWoolliams, J.A.1 aSmith, D.1 aWilliams, J.L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Sept., v. 85, no. 9 p.2368-2375x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02829naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002100129245007700150300001800227520106700245650001301312650002801325650002301353650002901376650003001405650001801435650001501453650001801468650001401486650001201500650001801512650001101530650001601541650002901557650003301586650001101619650004701630650002301677650005201700650003401752650003201786650005301818650006601871650001701937653002801954700001501982700001801997700001602015700001302031700001702044700001402061773008402075852000902159930003302168945001302201946001302214655001202227IND2331020620221120173551.0030226e200207  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233102062DNAL7 a122015222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeiri-Bendek, I.12aA PCR-based method for the detection of Streptococcus agalactiae in milk  ap. 1717-1732.  aBovine mastitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae is mainly subclinical and therefore can be diagnosed only in the laboratory. We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method for specific and sensitive detection of S. agalactiae in raw milk. The specificity of the PCR reaction is based on unique S. agalactiae DNA sequences within the 16S subunit of the rRNA genes. Two pairs of sequences were used as positive controls; general streptococci primers, which anneal to conserved areas within the 16S rRNA subunit gene, and primers, which anneal to sequences within bovine mitochondrial DNA. The method of detection includes selective enrichment of S. agalactiae in the milk sample, followed by DNA extraction using a rapid and simple procedure developed for this purpose, and specific PCR reaction with appropriate controls. The method enables the detection of one bacterium in 1 ml of raw milk. The method developed can be easily incorporated as part of routine screening of bulk milk collection tanks for early detection of infected cows in a herd. 3araw milk 3amicrobial contamination 3afood contamination 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3aDNA probes 3arapid methods 3ascreening 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCattle 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxanalysis 2aFemale 2aMastitis, Bovinexdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aStreptococcal Infectionsxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aStreptococcus agalactiaexgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aTime Factors 0aasymptomatic infections1 aLipkin, E.1 aFriedmann, A.1 aLeitner, G.1 aSaran-a.1 aFriedman, S.1 aKashi, Y.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 July, v. 85, no. 7 p.1717-1732x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03271naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245011700144300001800261500001500279520164000294650002301934650001701957650001501974650001501989650003902004650001702043650002302060650001802083650001402101650001002115650001402125650001702139650002702156650000802183650001202191650002102203650002902224650002702253650001002280650002702290650002402317650002602341650004002367650001002407650001702417653002002434653001902454653001002473700001902483700001502502773008402517852000902601930003302610945001302643946001302656655001202669IND2331019220221120173505.0030226e200207  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233101922DNAL7 a122015192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWold, J.P.10aNondestructive measurement of light-induced oxidation in dairy products by fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging  ap. 1693-1704.  a2019-12-05  aThe purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of solid-sample fluorescence spectroscopy in nondestructive assessment of light-induced oxidation in different dairy products such as Swiss cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream. Analytical and quantitative spectral properties of fluorescence were elucidated by use of principal component analysis with designed experiments involving different levels of air and light exposure. A significant reduction in fluorescence intensity at approximately 525 nm, and a corresponding increase in the region 415 to 490 nm as a result of illumination was observed on all the products. The effect was ascribed to photodegradation of riboflavin. Variation in two smaller peaks at approximately 620 nm and 630 nm was an interaction effect between exposure to light and air. A pronounced interaction effect between light and air produced intense blue fluorescence and off-flavors on Swiss-like Jarlsberg cheese. High correlations (0.83 to 0.93) between fluorescence spectra and sensory measured off-flavors were obtained for cream cheese. Results indicate that solid-sample fluorescence can be used as a nondestructive and rapid tool to measure the degree of light-induced degradation of riboflavin as well as sensory properties connected to storage of dairy products. Images of fluorescence can be used to visualize the intensity and propagation of this process. The simplicity and rapidity of the method offer rich opportunities for efficient evaluation of factors affecting light-induced oxidation in dairy products, such as packaging materials, light sources, exposure time, and temperature. 3asensory evaluation 3aSwiss cheese 3aphotolysis 3ariboflavin 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescence 3alipid peroxidation 3arapid methods 3aoxidation 3aodors 3agoat milk 3acream cheese 3anondestructive methods 2aAir 2aAnimals 2aCheesexanalysis 2aDairy Productsxanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aGoats 2aLightxadverse effects 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aRiboflavinxchemistry 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescencexmethods 2aTaste 2aTime Factors 0aoxidized flavor 0acultured cream 0alight1 aJørgensen, K.1 aLundby, F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 July, v. 85, no. 7 p.1693-1704x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03970naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002700172245012400199300001800323500002400341500001500365520205400380650002302434650003002457650001202487650001602499650001502515650001602530650001002546650002702556650001102583650001402594650002102608650002002629650002102649650001702670650002402687651001102711653001502722700002002737700002402757700002202781700002202803700001802825700001802843700002402861700002302885700002202908700002402930700002102954700001802975700002102993700001703014773010203031852000903133856008503142930003303227945002503260946001103285655001203296IND4439803020221120173813.0100709e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443980302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-009-9685-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aK001 0aP0101 aGrabenweger, Giselher 10aTemporal and spatial variations in the parasitoid complex of the horse chestnut leafminer during its invasion of Europe  ap. 2797-2813.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe enemy release hypothesis posits that the initial success of invasive species depends on the scarcity and poor adaptation of native natural enemies such as predators and parasitoids. As for parasitoids, invading hosts are first attacked at low rates by a species-poor complex of mainly generalist species. Over the years, however, parasitoid richness may increase either because the invading host continuously encounters new parasitoid species during its spread (geographic spread-hypothesis) or because local parasitoids need different periods of time to adapt to the novel host (adjustment-hypothesis). Both scenarios should result in a continuous increase of parasitoid richness over time. In this study, we reconstructed the development of the hymenopteran parasitoid complex of the invasive leafminer Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae). Our results show that the overall parasitism rate increases as a function of host residence time as well as geographic and climatic factors, altogether reflecting the historic spread of C. ohridella. The same variables also explain the individual parasitism rates of several species in the parasitoid complex, but fail to explain the abundance of others. Evidence supporting the “geographic spread-hypothesis” was found in the parasitism pattern of Cirrospilus talitzkii (Hymenoptera, Eulophidae), while that of Pediobius saulius, another eulophid, indicated an increase of parasitism rates by behavioral, phenological or biological adjustments. Compared to fully integrated host-parasitoid associations, however, parasitism rates of C. ohridella are still very low. In addition, the parasitoid complex lacks specialists, provided that the species determined are valid and not complexes of cryptic (and presumably more specialized) species. Probably, the adjustment of specialist parasitoids requires more than a few decades, particularly to invaders which establish in ecological niches free of native hosts, thus eliminating any possibility of recruitment of pre-adapted parasitoids. 3atemporal variation 3ageographical distribution 3ahistory 3aparasitoids 3ahost range 3aCirrospilus 3ahosts 3ageographical variation 3aniches 3aPediobius 3ainvasive species 3anatural enemies 3aclimatic factors 3aforest pests 3aCameraria ohridella 3aEurope 0aadaptation1 aKehrli, Patrik 1 aZweimüller, Irene 1 aAugustin, Sylvie 1 aAvtzis, Nikolaos 1 aBacher, Sven 1 aFreise, Jona 1 aGirardoz, Sandrine 1 aGuichard, Sylvain 1 aHeitland, Werner 1 aLethmayer, Christa 1 aStolz, Michaela 1 aTomov, Rumen 1 aVolter, Lubomir 1 aKenis, Marc 0 tBiological invasions.g2010 Aug., v. 12, no. 8 p.2797-2813dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-009-9685-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101123b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/10/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03331naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100002100189245015600210300001500366500002400381520178000405650001202185650002102197650002502218650002502243650001302268650001802281650001502299650001602314650001602330650002502346650001402371650002702385700002302412700001802435700002302453700002402476700001902500700002202519773010102541852000902642856009302651930003302744945002502777946001102802655001202813IND4441525020221120153133.0100820e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444152502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2010.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aQ105 0aQ115 0aQ5051 aAngeletti, Pablo10aEffect of preharvest calcium applications on postharvest quality, softening and cell wall degradation of two blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) varieties  ap. 98-103.  aIncludes references  aExcessive softening is the main factor limiting blueberry storage. We evaluated the effect of preharvest calcium applications on ‘O'Neal' and ‘Bluecrop' blueberry quality during refrigerated storage. Blueberry plants were fertilized with CaSO₄ (0.06kgm⁻²). On the following season, fruit was harvested at commercial maturity (100% blue) and stored at 2°C for 23d. During storage, we analyzed firmness, weight loss, surface color, anthocyanins, respiration rate, decay, acidity, pH and total sugars. In addition, changes in loosely and tightly bound pectins, hemicelluloses and calcium content were evaluated. Calcium-treated fruit for both varieties had less softening and weight loss than control fruit. Respiration rate increased during storage, but this increment was lower in calcium-treated blueberries. The fertilization treatment did not affect other quality attributes such as color, anthocyanins, acidity or sugars. Calcium treatments did not alter hemicellulose content but in some cases reduced solubilization of pectic polymers. At harvest a 10% increase in calcium content within the cell wall was found in both varieties. At the end of the storage period the differences were more marked, suggesting that the modest but significant increase in calcium in treated blueberries at harvest might have affected wall disassembly. Results showed that calcium sulphate fertilization was useful to delay postharvest softening and decrease weight loss of blueberry fruit harvested in the following season. The treatments might be useful for fruit intended for long distance shipping. Further work is needed to determine the efficacy of the treatments with a low soluble calcium source such as CaSO₄ as well as the effects of repeated applications to the soil. 3acalcium 3adietary minerals 3apreharvest treatment 3apostharvest diseases 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3acell walls 3adegradation 3ablueberries 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3acultivars 3apostharvest physiology1 aCastagnasso, Hilda1 aMiceli, Elisa1 aTerminiello, Laura1 aConcellón, Analía1 aChaves, Alicia1 aVicente, Ariel R.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2010 Nov., v. 58, no. 2 p.98-103dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2010.05.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20110403b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/01/27  aNon-US 7aarticle00935naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001600117245010600133520019100239650002000430651001400450653001300464710004600477773012000523852000900643939003300652945000800685655001200693991579486160742620221120143320.0780301e197710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7899119372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorty, F.L.10aLegal and economic aspects of farm estate planning in Louisiana, following the Tax Reform Act of 1976  aThis report summarizes provisions of the succession laws of Louisiana and updates information on federal estate taxation to conform with the new provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1976. 3aestate planning 3aLouisiana 0aTax laws2 aLouisiana Agricultural Experiment Station0 pA E A Inf Ser Dep Agric Econ Agribus La State Univ Agric Mech Coll Agric Exp Stng1977 Oct., v. 44x0459-83267nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19780301c00000000  aAGE 7aarticle03699naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100002200181245014300203300001800346500002400364500001500388520173300403650002402136650002202160650002502182650001502207650001702222650001902239650002102258650001802279650002602297650002302323650002302346650001402369650001302383650001202396650001502408650001602423650001802439650001802457650001702475650002502492651001602517653001502533653002002548653002602568653001802594653001902612700002002631700002602651700002302677700002602700700002202726773010202748852000902850856008502859930003302944945002502977946001103002655001203013IND4439801720221120143309.0100709e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443980172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-009-9670-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK001 0aP010 0aJ1001 aWardle, David A. 10aDetermining the impact of scale insect honeydew, and invasive wasps and rodents, on the decomposer subsystem in a New Zealand beech forest  ap. 2619-2638.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRelatively few studies have considered how aboveground invasive consumers influence decomposer communities. We investigated the potential effects of three types of animals on the decomposer subsystem in a floristically simple New Zealand Nothofagus forest. These animals are the native beech honeydew scale insect (Ultracoelostoma spp.) that secretes large amounts of sugar-rich honeydew that washes to the soil, invasive social wasps (Vespula spp.) that remove honeydew and prevent it from reaching the ground, and invasive rodents (the house mouse (Mus musculus) and ship rat (Rattus rattus)) that are predators of litter invertebrates. We performed a 4 years manipulative experiment involving addition of synthetic honeydew to the soil surface at amounts equal to that washed to the soil both in the absence and presence of wasps. All treatments were subjected to both exclusion and non-exclusion of rodents. Full honeydew addition influenced several components of the belowground community (both positively and negatively), and promoted fungi and fungal feeding fauna at the expense of bacteria and bacterial-feeders. The reduced addition of honeydew (representing effects of wasps) reversed some (but not all) effects of full honeydew addition. Rodents also influenced some belowground organisms, often reversing the effects of honeydew addition. The honeydew levels simulating wasp effects and the presence of rodents both greatly promoted humus carbon and nutrient storage relative to all other treatments, highlighting that invaders can alter soil carbon sequestration and nutrient capital. Our study points to invasive animals modifying the effects of a native animal on multiple components of the decomposer subsystem. 3asoil organic carbon 3atemperate forests 3acarbon sequestration 3aNothofagus 3aMus musculus 3asoil fertility 3ainvasive species 3aRattus rattus 3aquantitative analysis 3aecosystem services 3asoil invertebrates 3apredation 3ahoneydew 3aVespula 3asoil fungi 3asaprophytes 3ascale insects 3aforest litter 3adetritivores 3aenvironmental impact 3aNew Zealand 0asoil fauna 0aUltracoelostoma 0atrophic relationships 0ainvertebrates 0aforest ecology1 aKarl, Brian J. 1 aBeggs, Jacqueline R. 1 aYeates, Gregor W. 1 aWilliamson, Wendy M. 1 aBonner, Karen I. 0 tBiological invasions.g2010 Aug., v. 12, no. 8 p.2619-2638dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-009-9670-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20101123b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/10/15  aNon-US 7aarticle01718naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001800143245008900161300001600250520062300266650002300889650001900912650001900931700001700950700003000967700002200997700002001019700002401039700002201063700002001085773012501105852000901230856008301239930003301322946001301355655001201368IND4409089620221120143353.0080815e20080815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440908962DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11576262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz, Ricardo10aDensity Multiplication and Improved Lithography by Directed Block Copolymer Assembly  ap. 936-939.  aSelf-assembling materials spontaneously form structures at length scales of interest in nanotechnology.

Of 60 dairy farmers participating, 51 were from Holstein farms (85%) and nine from farms with other breeds, primarily Jersey. Cows were milked either twice (n = 44 herds; 73%) or three times (n = 16) per day. Farmers were evenly split between the "E" and "I" dimension, whereas 93% of the farmers were "S," 75% "T," and 62% "J.". Individuals with a preference for the "I" dimension were associated with higher peak and mature equivalent milk yield than those individuals with a preference for the "E" dimension. The "T" and "J" dimensions had a significantly higher percentage of the herd with records usable by USDA and a lower percentage of animals pregnant by the goal set by the dairy producer than the "F" and "P" dimensions. Herds managed by individuals with a combination preference of "E" and "P" produced 7 to 10 kg of 3.5% FCM/cow per day less or 1820 to 2752 kg/cow RHA ECM less than other combinations of the "E-I" and "J-P" dimensions. Those herds also had longer days dry and a lower percentage of records usable by USDA, suggesting that the "E-P" preference is less favorably associated to those measures of herd performance. The MBTI had limited association with many DHI production variables, but relationships to measures of labor and business management should be examined. 3adairy cows 3afarmers 3afarm management 3areproductive efficiency 3adairy farming 3amilk yield 3adecision making 2aAdministrative Personnelxpsychology 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDairyingxmethods 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLactation 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPersonality Inventory 2aPregnancy 3aUtah 0apersonality 0amilk production1 aWalters, Janet Lane.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Aug., v. 85, no. 8 p.2046-2052x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02531naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245007300143300001800216520131900234650001801553650001901571650002001590650001801610650002501628650001201653650002501665650002101690650001001711650004701721650003101768650002101799650002801820650001601848650002001864653001501884653001501899700001801914773008501932852000902017930003302026945001302059946001302072655001202085IND2330883620221120132936.0030219e200209  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233088362DNAL7 a123624422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlabi, A.10aTemperature-induced moisture migration in reduced-fat Cheddar cheese  ap. 2114-2121.  aMoisture migration during cooling of 290-kg Cheddar cheese blocks is a problem. The problem is of greater magnitude in reduced and low fat varieties. The objective of this study was to design and evaluate the performance of a laboratory-scale apparatus for simulation of temperature induced moisture migration in 290-kg blocks of Cheddar cheese. Two apparati were designed to produce a systematic temperature gradient in small cheese slabs over a 36-h period to simulate the temperature gradient that develops during cooling of a 290-kg block. One of the apparati was designed to induce a moisture migration downwards with gravity and the other against gravity. The apparati produced moisture migration ranges of 9.7 and 6.4%, for the apparatus to induce moisture migration downwards and upwards, respectively. The moisture moved from areas of warm cheese to areas of cold cheese during cooling, as occurs in 290-kg blocks. These ranges were comparable to those obtained with 290-kg reduced-fat Cheddar blocks. In addition, small but significant differences in pH were created within slabs. The direct effect of the temperature gradient on moisture migration within cheese slabs appeared to be more important than the possible impact of the small pH gradient produced within the cheese by the temperature gradient. 3awater content 3aCheddar cheese 3alow fat cheeses 3aheat transfer 3alaboratory equipment 3acooling 3atemperature profiles 2aCheesexanalysis 2aColor 2aFood Technologyxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aTemperature 2aWaterxanalysis 0asimulation 0awater bath1 aBarbano, D.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Sept., v. 85, no. 9 p.2114-2121x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02938naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008400128300001500212500001500227520140600242650001801648650000901666650001001675650001901685650001601704650001501720650001101735650001801746650002001764650000901784650001801793650002901811650003001840650001201870650000901882650002001891650001901911650003701930650002101967650001401988651001002002653002202012653001402034653001402048653001802062700001702080700001902097700002302116700001502139700002002154700001602174773008002190852000902270930003302279945001302312946001102325655001202336IND2053587820221120102601.0961017e199607  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205358782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPugh, A.L. IV10aInteractions between peat and salt-contaminated runoff in Alton Bog, Maine, USA  ap. 83-104.  a2019-12-05  aYear round, concentrations of base cations (Ca, Mg, Na, and K) and Cl- in surface and groundwater decline exponentially away from Interstate 95, a four-lane asphalt highway which bisects Alton Bog, a poor fen in Penobscot County, Maine, USA. The increased concentrations close to the highway are caused primarily by runoff of road-salt and weathering products of road-bed fill. Concentration ratios, constant with time, between base cations and H+ at individual sites suggest that cation exchange reactions between peat and water achieve a state of equilibrium. These ratios change systematically with increasing distance from the highway, indicating systematic changes in the character of the peat exchange surfaces. The major change is a decrease in the occupancy of exchange sites by Na away from the road. These relationships and inferred processes have been duplicated with laboratory experiments. Base saturation of the peat, dominated by Ca, decreases with distance from the highway. Thus, in the short term, peat-water equilibration exerts strong controls on the water chemistry, particularly ion ratios. Long term exposure to elevated concentrations of Ca, Mg, and NaCl in the shallow ground waters has altered the peat chemistry. Availability of plant nutrients (Ca, Mg, and K) has been generally increased by the weathering of road-bed fill and equilibration of the NaCl salt with the peat. 3aoverland flow 3apeat 3aroads 3aroadside soils 3agroundwater 3aweathering 3asodium 3asurface water 3abase saturation 3afens 3awater quality 3acation exchange capacity 3agroundwater contamination 3acalcium 3abogs 3asodium chloride 3ainorganic ions 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3agroundwater flow 3amagnesium 3aMaine 0ahigh water tables 0aroad salt 0achlorides 0ade-icing salt1 aNorton, S.A.1 aSchauffler, M.1 aJacobson, G.L.

The widespread adoption and use of ultrasonography for routine reproductive examinations of dairy cattle by bovine practitioners is the next contribution this technology will make to the dairy industry. Assessment of pregnancy status and fetal viability early postbreeding to identify cows that fail to conceive improves reproductive efficiency by decreasing the interval between artificial insemination services and increasing artificial insemination service rate. Early identification of cows carrying twin fetuses will allow for implementation of differential management strategies to abrogate negative effects of twinning during the periparturient period once such strategies have been developed. Ovarian and uterine pathologies not accurately detected via rectal palpation can easily be visualized by ultrasound, and appropriate therapies can be implemented. Determination of fetal sex in utero is useful when coupled with a management decision that justifies the expense of fetal sexing. Development of integrated reproductive management systems that combine ultrasound with new and existing reproductive technologies will further enhance the practical applications of ultrasonography. Development of Extension education programs to train bovine practitioners to use ultrasound for routine reproductive examinations is a critical step toward rapid implementation of this technology into the dairy industry. 3adairy cows 3aultrasonography 3alarge animal practice 3aveterinary equipment 3aovarian cysts 3aGraafian follicles 3acorpus luteum 3apregnancy diagnosis 3aembryonic mortality 3acost benefit analysis 3acalving interval 2aAbortion, Veterinaryxultrasonography. 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxultrasonography. 2aDairyingxeconomicsxmethods. 2aEmbryo Lossxveterinary 2aFemale 2aOvarian Cystsxultrasonographyxveterinary. 2aOvaryxultrasonography. 2aPregnancy 2aReproduction 2aUltrasonographyxeconomics 2aUltrasonography, Prenatalxveterinary 2aUterusxultrasonography. 0arepeat breeders 0atwinning 0atransducers 0aultrasonic diagnosis0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Aug., v. 85, no. 8 p.1918-1926x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03709naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245012200146300001800268500001500286520160000301650002401901650001601925650001301941650001801954650001701972650002101989650001502010650001702025650002202042650001702064650001902081650001302100650002102113650001202134650002302146650002602169650002102195650000902216650001302225650001602238650001202254650004602266650002802312650002902340650002302369650004002392650002102432650003802453650000902491650002002500650002602520650001902546650001302565650002302578650000902601650002802610650002502638650004202663650001602705653001802721653001402739653003102753700001502784773008402799852000902883930003302892945001302925946001302938655001202951IND2330966320221123042624.0030224e200208  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233096632DNAL7 a122149852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHusler, B.R.10aMetabolic and endocrine changes in response to endotoxin administration with or without oral arginine supplementation  ap. 1927-1935.  a2019-12-05  aThis study was performed to investigate blood metabolite, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and hormone responses to intravenous administration of lipopolysaccharides (2 microgram of endotoxin of Escherichia coli O26:B6/kg body weight at times of feeding) in veal calves orally supplemented with arginine (0.25 g/kg of body weight twice daily for 4 d; group GrA) compared with calves not supplemented with arginine (group GrC). Arginine supplementation alone caused a significant rise of plasma arginine, urea, and insulin concentrations, whereas glucagon concentrations tended to increase, but there were no significant group differences. Concentrations of triglycerides, NEFA, glucose, protein, albumin, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-I, 3.5.3'-triiodothyronine, and thyroxine were not affected by arginine supplementation. Lipopolysaccharide administration alone caused a rise of tumor necrosis-factor-alpha, lactate, and cortisol concentrations and concentrations of tumor necrosis-factor-alpha after 1 h, and of triglycerides and urea after 6 h were higher, whereas of glucose after 3 h were lower in GrA than in GrC. Concentrations of NEFA, glucose, protein, albumin, insulin, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-I, 3.5.3'-triiodothyronine, and thyroxine were not affected by lipopolysaccharide administration. In conclusion, arginine supplementation had selective effects on plasma metabolites and hormones, but barely modified lipopolysaccharide effects. Effects of lipopolysaccharides in the postprandial state were different from what is usually seen in the fasted state. 3alipopolysaccharides 3alactic acid 3aglucagon 3aserum albumin 3ablood plasma 3amilk substitutes 3aendotoxins 3ablood lipids 3ahormone secretion 3asomatotropin 3afeed additives 3aarginine 3atriacylglycerols 3ainsulin 3anutritional status 3aintravenous injection 3atriiodothyronine 3aurea 3acortisol 3aveal calves 2aAnimals 2aArgininexadministration & dosagexblood. 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBlood Proteinsxanalysis 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aEndotoxinsxadministration & dosage 2aEscherichia coli 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFood 2aGlucagonxblood 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aInsulinxblood 2aKinetics 2aLactic Acidxblood 2aMale 2aSerum Albuminxanalysis 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxanalysis 2aUreaxblood 0ablood protein 0athyroxine 0ainsulin-like growth factor1 aBlum, J.W.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Aug., v. 85, no. 8 p.1927-1935x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03231naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100002000196245013800216300001800354500002400372500001500396520138500411650002801796650002001824650002701844650001701871650002901888650001001917650002101927650002301948650002901971650001402000650001602014650003202030650001102062650002402073650001202097650001202109650004202121650001102163650000902174650002902183650004202212650002402254653002402278653002502302700002302327773009902350852000902449856009002458930003302548945002502581946001102606655001202617IND4441672520221123042735.0100823e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444167252DNAL7 a204938732pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL001 0aF8211 aYamane, Takashi10aInhibition of female mating receptivity by male-derived extracts in two Callosobruchus species: Consequences for interspecific mating  ap. 1565-1571.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe investigated the effects of injecting male-derived extracts on congeneric female receptivity in two species of Callosobruchus beetle, C. chinensis and C. maculatus. We also examined the influence of interspecific mating on female remating behaviour in these two species. Male-derived extracts reduced congeneric female receptivity in both species. As quick-acting components, extracts of C. chinensis male seminal vesicles reduced the receptivity of C. maculatus females, whereas extracts of C. maculatus male testes reduced the receptivity of C. chinensis females. As slow-acting components, extracts of male accessory glands of other species reduced the receptivity of both C. maculatus and chinensis females. After interspecific mating, the sperm of C. maculatus males were transferred to the reproductive organs of C. chinensis females, thereby reducing their receptivity. In contrast, no C. chinensis sperm were transferred to the reproductive organs of C. maculatus females; accordingly, the latter's receptivity was not reduced. Furthermore, the survival rate of C. chinensis females decreased markedly after interspecific mating. These results raise the possibility that under circumstances where populations of these two species share the same habitat, reproductive interference would occur only in the interactions between C. maculatus males and C. chinensis females. 3ainterspecific variation 3asexual behavior 3aanimal tissue extracts 3ainsect pests 3aCallosobruchus chinensis 3amales 3aseminal vesicles 3agender differences 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3amortality 3aspermatozoa 3ainterspecific hybridization 3atestes 3ainsect reproduction 3afemales 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aSpecies Specificity 0aspecies differences 0aaccessory sex glands1 aMiyatake, Takahisa0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2010 Nov., v. 56, no. 11 p.1565-1571dPergamonx0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.05.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20101203b20110101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/10/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02495naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245009900146300001400245520101600259650002701275650002501302650001301327650001601340650001101356650002201367650001601389650001201405650001401417650001201431650001201443650001201455650001501467650001301482650002601495650002201521650006201543650003301605650003001638650004301668700001701711700001701728700001701745700001401762773013501776852000901911930003301920945001301953946001101966655001201977IND2205849920221123032901.0000718e19991201ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220584992DNAL7 a105647882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolinaro, A.10aIsolation and characterisation of the lipopolysaccharide from Xanthomonas hortorum pv. vitians  ap. 49-53.  aXanthomonas hortorum pv. is a Gram-negative bacterium that acts as the causative agent of bacterial leaf spot and headrot in lettuce. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of this bacterium is suspected to be an important molecule for adhesion to the plants. We have isolated the LPS, prepared the lipid A and the polysaccharide moieties thereof, and characterised all preparations by compositional analysis. Main sugar components are rhamnose and 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-galactose which presumably furnish the O-specific polysaccharide. Other sugars are mannose, glucose, 6-deoxygalactose (fucose), and galacturonic acid, which should be core region constituents, and glucosamine, which builds up the carbohydrate backbone of lipid A. The LPS contains several phosphate groups, most of which are present in the core region. The main fatty acids in the lipid A are C10:0, 3-OH-C10:0 and 3-OH-C12:0. The latter is the only amide-linked fatty acid. Two fatty acids present in small amounts were identified, C8:0 and C11:0. 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aXanthomonas hortorum 3aadhesion 3afatty acids 3afucose 3agalacturonic acid 3aglucosamine 3aglucose 3aleaf spot 3alettuce 3alipid A 3amannose 3aphosphates 3arhamnose 2aLettucexmicrobiology 2aLipid Axanalysis 2aLipopolysaccharidesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPolysaccharidesxanalysis 2aXanthomonasxchemistryxpathogenicity.1 aLanzetta, R.1 aEvidente, A.1 aParrilli, M.1 aHolst, O.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g1999 Dec. 1, v. 181, no. 1 p.49-53aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03445naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013200126300001300258520222000271650002102491650001302512650002202525650002602547650001002573650002202583650001802605650003702623650001302660650001302673651001102686653001702697653002402714653001302738653002702751653001902778653002102797653001902818700001602837773008002853852000902933930003302942945001302975946001102988655001202999IND2052882120221123021741.0960904e19960515ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205288212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFillion, E.10aFlow modelling in a dual porosity domain with automatic mesh generation and parameter calibration: application to the Aspo site  ap. 1-19.  aThis paper presents the flow modelling of the Aspo site (Sweden) performed with a finite element code, ROCKFLOW, which is able to take into account the flow in the porous matrix and in the 22 large fracture zones individualized in the conceptual model. The use of various computing tools--3D automatic mesh generator, various efficient solvers, and automatic calibration program--is described. ROCKFLOW is a 3D finite element code, originally developed at Hanover University Institut fur Stromungsmechanik (IFS), designed to simulate flow and transport in a permeable rock mass intersected by some fracture zones of relatively high conductivity (dual porosity model). The mesh generator, which had never been used on such a complicated geometry, gave satisfactory results (especially when the mesh was improved by introducing refinement planes), and so did the various ROCKFLOW modules we used. Because of too many uncertainties in hydrodynamic parameters (storage coefficient of porous matrix and fractures, matrix conductivity, water salinity variation with depth) and in geometric parameters (lateral extension of fractures, model boundaries) a precise model calibration of all model parameters could not be attempted. Instead, we concentrated on testing the feasibility of an accurate representation of the Aspo site with its 22 individualized fractures. In that respect, the results in both natural steady and transient state for simulation of the LPT2 pumping test were satisfactory. We recovered the natural piezometric state and drawdown evolutions with a good accuracy and brought to light the importance of several parameters such as matrix conductivity, water salinity variation with depth and infiltration rate. An automatic calibration of hydrodynamic parameters, using Newton's method to minimize an error criterion, gave proof of the steady flow model consistency. This automatic calibration, which was also carried out for transient state computations (at the end of LPT2), helps us to understand the model sensitivity to several hydrodynamic parameters such as storage coefficient of the matrix blocks and transmissivities for deep fractures, and reinforces confidence in the accuracy of the model. 3agroundwater flow 3aaquifers 3acomputer software 3asoil parent materials 3arocks 3asimulation models 3ahydrodynamics 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asalinity 3aporosity 3aSweden 0ainfiltration 0acomputer simulation 0afracture 0a3d finite element code 0atransmissivity 0arockflow program 0afracture zones1 aNoyer, M.L.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1996 May 15, v. 180, no. 1/4 p.1-19x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02026naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006400126300001600190500013200206500001500338520091400353650003001267650001401297650002101311650001501332650001301347650001701360650001901377650001301396650001501409653003101424653001501455700002301470773008101493852000901574930003301583945001301616946001101629655001201640IND2053663720221122232945.0961022e199608  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205366372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchafer, W.10aTransport of reactive species in heterogeneous porous media  ap. 151-168.  aIn the special issue: Effective parameter estimation for flow and transport in the subsurface / edited by J.J.

For simple linear adsorption standard methods can be applied to arrive at effective retardation and dispersion parameters. Effective time-scales for chemical reactions such as adsorption and degradation may no longer be determined by the time-scales of processes on the molecular scale only but also by rate-limiting steps arising from the variable accessibility of reactive parts of the medium. For a bacterial degradation reaction it is suggested that an exchange coefficient between mobile water and reactive phase can parameterize subscale processes. The coefficient depends on the degree of heterogeneity of the medium. 3agroundwater contamination 3aequations 3agroundwater flow 3apollutants 3aaquifers 3aporous media 3abiodegradation 3abacteria 3aadsorption 0amathematics and statistics 0asimulation1 aKinzelbach, W.K.H.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1996 Aug., v. 183, no. 1/2 p.151-168x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03207naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245012200162300001600284520201400300650002302314650002002337650001202357650002402369650001002393650001502403650001502418650001202433650003402445650001302479650003002492650001102522650001702533650001302550651001202563700002802575700001902603773012402622856004202746852000902788655001202797IND60593088820221122233127.0180416s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059308882DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc2012-1352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpang, Elizabeth10aStakeholder engagement: A foundation for natural heritage systems identification and conservation in southern Ontario  ap. 686-696.  aIn southern Ontario, multiple organizations apply various approaches to identifying natural heritage systems (NHS). Natural heritage systems comprise a network of natural features and areas, such as protected areas, forests, wetlands, river corridors, lakes, and meadows, as well as the associated natural processes to be conserved and/or managed for various environmental and public services. The application of a variety of approaches can lead to a lack of connections between natural heritage features across political jurisdictions. To further complicate the situation, not all municipalities have the necessary tools and information available to identify and protect NHS nor do they have the capacity to coordinate designing NHS with neighbouring jurisdictions. To address these challenges, a new approach was developed and tested that engages many stakeholders in the collaborative design of a NHS for an ecologically based landscape that crosses several political boundaries. Engagement is an opportunity to work together on common goals with stakeholders, communities, and citizens to find solutions to complex problems and move beyond the traditional consultation that government has used extensively in the past. We engaged a representative group of stakeholders to design and map a scientifically based, quantitatively derived NHS. The engagement process alternated data preparation and analysis activities with target-setting and decision-making by a diverse group of stakeholders, including municipalities, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, stewardship groups, landowners, and other interests. Throughout the target-setting process, observations and feedback from the stakeholders were collected. This paper both documents a number of lessons learned through the engagement process, and demonstrates that stakeholder engagement in NHS design has great potential to coordinate conservation efforts across political jurisdictions and the varied mandates of several organizations. 3aconservation areas 3adecision making 3aforests 3agovernment agencies 3alakes 3alandowners 3alandscapes 3ameadows 3anongovernmental organizations 3apolitics 3apublic services and goods 3arivers 3astakeholders 3awetlands 3aOntario1 aLemieux, Christopher M.1 aStrobl, Silvia0 tForestry chronicle.g2012 Dec., v. 88, no. 6 p.686-696dCanadian Institute of Forestry.wJournal:12176x0015-75467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc2012-135  aDNAL 7aarticle01798naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008300160300001400243520065500257650001900912650003600931650002600967650001000993650002301003650002001026650002601046650001201072650002101084650002101105650001401126650001801140650002001158650002201178650001701200651001101217773012201228856004101350852000901391655001201400IND60593088720221122195940.0180416e196812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059308872DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc44031-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinget, Carl H.10aSpecies Composition and Development of Second-Growth Hardwood Stands in Quebec  ap. 31-35.  aSecond-growth, tolerant hardwood stands developed rapidly and, almost entirely from shade-tolerant advance growth, regardless of cutting intensity.

The process of developing and applying stage-discharge relationships has been documented, the decision support system framework established, and a number of expert 'rules' developed and evaluated for stable and non-stable channels. The system categorizes stage-discharge rating curves as stable if they deviate within a predetermined accuracy (e.g. +/- 5% of discharge), or if one of a suite of curves can be applied within the predetermined accuracy specifications for given changes in the energy slope caused by weed growth, channel ice and other conditions affecting backwater. Non-stable channels are defined as channels that experience evolution or abrupt changes in stage-discharge relationships resulting from changes in channel form. Rating curve stability is determined based on deviations in the stage-discharge relationship, utilizing specific gauge, absolute differences between sequential streamflow measurements and an analysis of residuals. Periods of instability, such as a meander cut-off changing the hydraulic control, are often repetitive in hydraulic response, such that a pattern of instability is recognizable as events occur. In addition, periods of instability are interspersed with periods of stability. The repetition in pattern allows knowledge of correctly identified historic events to be applied to contemporary hydraulic conditions. A suite of rating curves can be developed for specific periods (e.g. summer weed growth) and stages. These curves can be automatically applied based on changing streamflow conditions such that streamflow estimates can be generated in a rigorous and accurate manner with minimal hydrographer intervention. 3aexpert systems 3arivers 3aaquatic weeds 3astream flow 3ahydrologic data 3afluid mechanics 3adata analysis 3aice 3adecision making 3aManitoba 0ariver regulation 0astable channels 0anon-stable channels 0adischarge 0awater flow 0achannel stability 0achannels1 aDouglas, G.G.1 aHudson, H.R.1 aSimonovic, S.P.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1996 Oct. 15, v. 184, no. 3/4 p.225-241x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02332naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008200128300001600210500001500226520111700241650002201358650002301380650001401403650002601417650002101443650001201464650001501476650002201491650002401513650001601537651001601553653002401569653002201593653001701615653002401632653001701656653001801673700001901691700001401710773008401724852000901808930003301817945001301850946001101863655001201874IND2054165220221122195940.0961122e19961015ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205416522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDam, J.C. van10aUnsaturated soil water movement in hysteretic and water repellent field soils  ap. 153-173.  a2019-12-05  aCorrect simulation of soil water fluxes in the unsaturated zone is needed for studies on leaching of contaminants. Both hysteresis and preferential flow affect soil water movement in the unsaturated zone. Hysteresis of the soil water characteristic and preferential flow in the case of water repellent soils were incorporated in a general agrohydrological numerical model. The model was applied to data sets from two locations with hysteretic and water repellent soils. It is shown that hysteresis retards soil water movement, while preferential flow enhances soil water movement. During infiltration events, hysteresis retains more water in the root zone than the amount computed for reference simulations that neglect hysteresis. However, generally in field conditions incorporation of hysteresis decreases the amount of simulated water storage. Furthermore, it is shown that in fields with shallow water tables and without ponding, soil water fluxes are marginally affected by hysteresis and preferential flow. However, preferential flow directly affects the residence time of solutes in the unsaturated zone. 3asimulation models 3asoil water content 3aequations 3awater repellent soils 3aunsaturated flow 3atopsoil 3ahysteresis 3apreferential flow 3asoil water movement 3awater table 3aNetherlands 0amathematical models 0ahigh water tables 0aswap93 model 0acomputer simulation 0ainfiltration 0awater balance1 aWosten, J.H.M.1 aNemes, A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1996 Oct. 15, v. 184, no. 3/4 p.153-173x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02612naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013000163300001400293520140200307650001501709650001001724650001401734650002201748650002301770650001201793650002201805650002401827650001201851650001301863650001201876650001401888650001301902650001301915650002201928650001901950650001001969650001601979651001101995773012202006856004102128852000902169655001202178IND60593088520221122165740.0180416e196812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059308852DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc44013-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, J. Harry G.10aImplications for Forest Industries and Management of an Expanded Role for North American Forestry in Meeting World Wood Needs  ap. 13-21.  aNorth American wood can become a much more important World resource if the opportunities that exist are recognized and supported by appropriate national policies. As a basis for effective planning, economic and total inventories are needed. These should define the economic availability of the wood inventory and recognize that rate of annual height growth will govern tree harvest in the long run. The extremely high rates of growth of plantation grown Southern pines and eucalypts permit a high concentration of ownership, thereby reducing transportation costs and creating substantial advantages for plantations of these species. Since all systems of logging and milling now and in the forseeable future, will involve linear flow methods of processing, forest managers should control stocking to reduce the proportion of small logs and trees harvested. Because of the rapid evolution and diffusion into use expected of pulpwood processing machines in Eastern Canada it seems desirable that uncertainty in North American timber production planning be reduced by classification of land capability for intensive management. High priority should be given to exploitation of the excellent investment opportunities which exist for timber growth on the best sites and in the best Regions. Location decision factors need more study since the importance of timber control seems to have been under-rated. 3aEucalyptus 3aPinus 3aequipment 3aforest industries 3aforest plantations 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3aland classification 3alogging 3amanagers 3amilling 3aownership 3aplanning 3apulpwood 3atimber production 3atransportation 3atrees 3auncertainty 3aCanada0 tForestry chronicle.g1968 Dec., v. 44, no. 6 p.13-21dCanadian Institute of Forestry.wJournal:12176x0015-75467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc44013-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008600126300001600212520162700228650001401855650001301869650002001882650002401902650002001926650003501946650002201981650001502003650001402018651001002032653001202042653001502054653001902069700001802088773008102106852000902187930003302196945001302229946001102242655001202253IND2053048220221122165712.0960916e199606  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205304822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCazorzi, F.10aSnowmelt modelling by combining air temperature and a distributed radiation index  ap. 169-187.  aHigh spatial variability in snowmelt phenomena was observed in the experimental watershed of the upper Cordevole (7 km2), in the Dolomites. Snowmelt depends, at a point scale, on available energy, which in turn is heavily affected by slope, aspect and shading effects of the site. A distributed hourly model of snowmelt was set up as a geographical information system (GIS) module. The model accumulates snowfall for each raster element (20 m X 20 m) using a temperature threshold. It simulates snowmelt using air temperature and a radiation index consisting of daily average values of clear sky radiation that have cumulated at selected dates since 21 December. It should be underlined that the only relevant calibration parameter of the model is the combined snowmelt factor, which is unique for the whole basin. The clear sky radiation maps were computed for a selected period of the year, based on the watershed digital terrain model and the solar path sampled at very short intervals. When run for a season, the model produces snow water equivalent maps at given dates. The model was validated, with satisfactory results, by comparing these maps with 60 snow-covered area surveys and related water equivalent measures collected in six snowmelt seasons from 1986 to 1991. The classical temperature index approach to snowmelt modelling does not allow the full variability over the basin to be taken into account. Besides, it seems important to point out that this fully distributed approach allows us to avoid the use of snow covered area (SCA) depletion curves, the definition of which still proves a troublesome task. 3amountains 3asnowmelt 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3asolar radiation 3ageographic information systems 3asimulation models 3aalgorithms 3ahighlands 3aItaly 0aindexes 0asnow cover 0adolomitic alps1 aFontana, G.D.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1996 June, v. 181, no. 1/4 p.169-187x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02317naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245010000130300001600230500001500246520110000261650001501361650002401376650002401400650002301424650001401447650002401461650001601485650001501501650001001516651000901526651001301535651001301548651002501561653002901586653002001615653002601635653004401661700001601705773008401721852000901805930003301814945001301847946001101860655001201871IND2054168620221122131547.0961122e19961015ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205416862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFennessey, N.M.10aRegional models of potential evaporation and reference evapotranspiration for the northeast USA  ap. 337-354.  a2019-12-05  aMultivariate regression models of average monthly reference crop evapotranspiration, Et(tau), and potential evaporation, Ep(tau), are developed for the northeast USA. Average monthly values of daily Et and Ep are estimated from the Penman-Monteith equation using monthly climate data from 34 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) First Order weather observatories and specific reference vegetation characteristics. The periodic seasonal behavior of Et(tau) and Ep(tau) and average monthly temperature are approximated by Fourier series functions. Regional regression relationships are then developed which relate the Et(tau) and Ep(tau) Fourier series coefficients with the average monthly temperature Fourier coefficients, station longitude and station elevation. The regional Et(tau) model is shown to be an improvement over the Linacre method (Linacre, 1977, Agric. Meteorol., 18: 409-424) and the Hargreaves and Samani method (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985, Appl. Eng.

Water in the vadose zone was sampled at depths of 6, 12, 24, and 36 in. (0.15, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 m) with suction lysimeters from early spring to midfall for two consecutive years. Endrin was the only pesticide detected; it had been applied to the study site five times during the period of 1974 to 1981. None of the 17 pesticides applied under an Integrated Orchard Management program during this study were detected in water samples. Concentrations of endrin in soil water ranged from 0.1 to 13.2 ppb (microgram/L). About 20% of all soil water samples within the orchard tested positive (greater than or equal to 0.1 ppb) for this pesticide. Endrin was detected at all depths; however, the frequency of positive samples and levels of residues tended to decrease with depth of sampling. Only 4.3% of soil water samples collected offsite (105 ft downslope from the orchard) contained endrin; concentrations were less than 0.1 and 0.5 ppb in two samples from the 6-in depth. Endrin concentrations in soil from within the orchard were highly variable among the sites sampled. Mean concentrations (+/- SD) at surface (0-1 in.), 6, 12, 24, and 36 in. were 12,100 (+/- 11,200), 900 (+/- 800), 1,700 (+/- 1,800), 200 (+/- 300), and less than 10 (+/- 10) ppb (microgram/kg), respectively. Off-site (one sample), endrin was detected only at the surface and 6-in, depth at 750 and 46 ppb, respectively. 3aendrin 3aorchards 3asamplers 3asoil depth 3apesticide residues 3ahighlands 3asoil water 3aMalus domestica 3avadose zone 3aWest Virginia 0apesticides1 aHogmire, H.W.1 aBrooks, J.L.1 aSencindiver, J.C.0 tApplied agricultural research.g1990 Winter, v. 5, no. 1 p.37-43x0179-03747nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03999naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100002400183245013300207300002200340500002400362500001500386520168400401650001302085650001802098650001002116650002102126650002102147650001502168650001902183650001902202650001002221650004302231650004402274650001102318650003802329650003402367650001102401650001902412650003302431650003802464650000902502650003102511650004202542650003402584650001502618653003802633653002802671653002002699653001002719700002102729700001902750700002202769700001802791700001802809700002102827700002202848700002002870700002502890773018102915852000903096856007703105930003303182945002503215946001303240655001203253IND4429733020221122103844.0091208e20091125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442973302DNAL7 a199191192pmid7 a10.1021/jf90223672doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ505 0aT300 0aX3801 aPravettoni, Valerio10aTomato Allergy: Detection of IgE-Binding Lipid Transfer Proteins in Tomato Derivatives and in Fresh Tomato Peel, Pulp, and Seeds  ap. 10749–10754.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThere is an increasing consumption of tomatoes worldwide: fresh in salads, cooked in household sauces, or industrially processed. Although many tomato allergens have been identified, there is no information in the literature on the allergenic components found in commercial tomato products. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the allergenic profile of commercial tomato products by skin prick tests (SPTs) and IgE/immunoblotting in tomato-allergic subjects. The secondary end point was the study of the IgE-binding profile of tomato peel, pulp, and seeds. Forty tomato-allergic patients, reporting oral allergy syndrome (OAS) at different grades of severity for fresh and, in some cases, also for cooked tomato, were selected on the basis of positive tomato allergy history or open food challenge (OFC). They were evaluated by SPTs with different experimental tomato extracts. SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting was performed to detect tomato allergens, which were then identified by Edman degradation. Twenty-three patients (57.5%) presented first-grade OAS at the OFC, whereas 17 (42.5%) reported severe symptoms. Ten of these 17 patients (25%) reported allergic reactions to cooked tomatoes; in immunoblotting tests, their sera reacted only to lipid transfer protein (LTP). In commercial products, LTP was the only detectable allergen. In contrast to other LTP-containing fruits, in tomato, an IgE-binding LTP was identified not only in the peel but also in the pulp and seeds. This study demonstrates that, in fresh tomato, different LTP isoforms are present and allergenic. Industrial tomato derivatives still contain LTP, thus presenting a problem for LTP-allergic patients. 3atomatoes 3alipid content 3aseeds 3abinding proteins 3aimmunoglobulin E 3askin tests 3avegetable pulp 3afood allergies 2aAdult 2aAntigens, Plantxanalysisximmunology. 2aCarrier Proteinsxanalysisximmunology. 2aFemale 2aFood Hypersensitivityximmunology 2aFruitxchemistryximmunology. 2aHumans 2aImmunoblotting 2aImmunoglobulin Exmetabolism 2aSolanum lycopersicumximmunology. 2aMale 2aPlant Extractsximmunology 2aPlant Proteinsxanalysisximmunology. 2aSeedsxchemistryximmunology. 2aSkin Tests 0aimmunoglobulin E binding proteins 0alipid transfer proteins 0atomato products 0apeels1 aPrimavesi, Laura1 aFarioli, Laura1 aBrenna, Oreste V.1 aPompei, Carlo1 aConti, Amedeo1 aScibilia, Joseph1 aPiantanida, Marta1 aMascheri, Ambra1 aPastorello, Elide A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Nov. 25, v. 57, no. 22 p.10749–10754-10749–10754dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf90223673Available from publisher's Web site  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/04/02  aOther US 7aarticle02575naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245013700124300001600261500001500277520148000292650001401772650001701786650002301803650002501826650002201851650001201873650001901885650002001904653001501924653002501939653002201964700001601986700001702002700001702019700001602036773007202052852000902124939003302133946001102166655001202177IND9304540120221122062733.0930802e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930454012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaier, W.10aSynthesis of 1,3-dihydroxy-N-methylacridone and its conversion to rutacridone by cell-free extracts of Ruta graveolens cell cultures  ap. 691-698.  a2019-12-04  aAcridone synthase was isolated from cell suspension cultures of Ruta graveolens which catalysed the formation of 1,3-dihydroxy-N-methylacridone from N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. No cofactors were required for this enzyme reaction. Potassium phosphate buffer was superior compared to Tris-HCl. Sodium ascorbate instead of mercaptoethanol as oxidation protectant showed an advantageous effect on acridone synthase activity. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by 1,3-dihydroxy-N-methylacridone and by the antibiotic cerulenin. Microsomal preparations from Ruta graveolens cell suspension cultures catalysed an NADPH- and oxygen-dependent condensation of 1,3-dihydroxy-N-methylacridone and isopentenyl pyrophosphate. The reaction product was identified as rutacridone. Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions were necessary for optimal rutacridone synthase activity. The enzyme was inhibited by a number of inhibitors of cytochrome P-450 enzymes. A prenylated acridone, viz. glycocitrine-II was identified as an essential intermediate. Under in vivo conditions glycocitrine-II is incorporated into rutacridone, but a clear-cut conversion of glycocitrine-II by microsomal preparations (cyclase) was not observed. Microsomes converted rutacridone into furofoline-I. A number of detergents was used for solubilization of membrane-bound proteins of Ruta microsomes. Highest specific glycocitrine-II synthase (prenyltransferase) activity was obtained after solubilization with dodecylmaltoside. 3aalkaloids 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3abiochemical pathways 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aligases 3acultured cells 3aRuta graveolens 0ametabolism 0arulacridone synthase 0aacridone synthase1 aBaumert, A.1 aSchumann, B.1 aFurukawa, H.1 aGröger, D.0 tPhytochemistry.g1993 Feb., v. 32, no. 3 p.691-698x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02608naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012000127300001800247500001500265520130600280650001801586650002101604650001201625650002901637650002001666650002201686650002101708650002001729650001901749650001601768650001001784650001801794653001501812653001601827653001401843653001501857653001901872653001701891700001301908700001901921700001501940700001701955773007601972852000902048930003302057945001302090946001102103655001202114IND2051073920221122062809.0960501e19951115enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205107392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, D.10aElectron transport regulated exchange of two forms of photosystem II D1 protein in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus  ap. 5457-5466.  a2019-12-05  aSynechococcus sp. PCC 7942 modulates photosynthetic function by transiently replacing the constitutive D1 photosystem II protein, D1:1, with an alternate form, D1:2, to help counteract photoinhibition under excess light. We show that a temperature drop from 37 to 25 degrees C also drives D1:1/D1:2 exchange under constant, moderate light. Chilling or light-induced D1 exchange results from rapid loss of psbAI message coding for D1:1 and accumulation of psbAII and psbAIII messages coding for D1:2. During chilling, a large pool of a novel form, D1:2*, transiently accumulates, distinguishable from normal D1 by an increase in apparent molecular mass. D1:2* is not phosphorylated and is probably a functionally inactive, incompletely processed precursor. After acclimation to 25 degrees C, D1:2* disappears and D1:1 again predominates, although substantial D1:2 remains. Partial inhibition of electron transport under constant, moderate light also triggers the D1 exchange process. These treatments all increase excitation pressure on photosystem II relative to electron transport. Therefore, information from photosynthetic electron transport regulates D1 exchange without any requirement for a change in light intensity or quality, possibly via a redox sensing mechanism proximal to photosystem II. 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3acooling 3abiochemical polymorphism 3aphotoinhibition 3aelectron transfer 3abinding proteins 3agene expression 3aphotosystem II 3atemperature 3alight 3aSynechococcus 0apsbai gene 0apsbaii gene 0apsba gene 0aprecursors 0aphotosynthesis 0apsbaiii gene1 aZhou, G.1 aGustafsson, P.1 aOquist, G.1 aClarke, A.K.0 tEMBO journal.g1995 Nov. 15, v. 14, no. 22 p.5457-5466x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03284naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245009400147300001600241520158700257650000901844650002301853650001801876650001901894650002401913650002401937650002201961650002001983650002002003650001402023650002302037650001502060650002502075650001202100650002402112650001102136650001102147650005602158650002402214650006202238650000902300650001902309650002102328650002002349650001902369650003402388653002302422653003102445653002302476700001902499700001402518773008202532852000902614930003302623945001302656946001302669655001202682IND2328859220221122054112.0020910e200202  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232885922DNAL7 a119136962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadsell, D.L.10aGenetic manipulation of the IGF-I axis to regulate mammary gland development and function  ap. 365-377.  aInsulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is known to regulate mammary gland development. This regulation occurs through effects on both cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Our laboratory has studied the IGF-I-dependent regulation of these processes by using transgenic and knockout mouse models that exhibit alterations in the IGF-I axis. Our studies of transgenic mice that overexpress IGF-I during pregnancy and lactation have demonstrated that this growth factor slows the apoptotic loss of mammary epithelial cells during the declining phase of lactation but has minimal effects during early lactation on milk composition or lactational capacity. In contrast, our analysis of early developmental processes in mammary tissue from mice carrying a targeted mutation in the IGF-I receptor gene suggests that IGF-dependent stimulation of cell cycle progression is more important to early mammary gland development than potential anti-apoptotic effects. With both models, the effects of perturbing the IGF-I axis are dependent on the physiological state of the animal. The diminished ductal development that occurs in response to loss of the IGF-I receptor is dramatically restored during pregnancy, whereas the ability of overexpressed IGF-I to protect mammary cells from apoptosis does not occur if the mammary gland is induced to undergo forced involution. Data from our laboratory on the expression of IGF-signaling molecules in the mammary gland suggest that this effect of physiological context may be related to the expression of members of the insulin receptor substrate family. 3amice 3atransgenic animals 3aanimal models 3amammary glands 3amammary development 3ahormonal regulation 3ahormone receptors 3alactation stage 3agene expression 3aapoptosis 3alactation duration 3amilk yield 3abiochemical pathways 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxgenetics 2aCattle 2aFemale 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixgeneticsxphysiology. 2aLactationxgenetics 2aMammary Glands, Animalxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aMice 2aMice, Knockout 2aMice, Transgenic 2aMilkxchemistry 2aModels, Animal 2aSignal Transductionxgenetics 0aliterature reviews 0ainsulin-like growth factor 0alaboratory mammals1 aBonnette, S.G.1 aLee, A.V.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 Feb., v. 85, no. 2 p.365-377x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03236naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001700137245009600154300001600250500002400266520136300290650001901653650001401672650001601686650002601702650002201728650001801750650001801768650001301786650002601799650001701825650002001842650001901862650002001881650001701901650001101918650003101929650002001960650001301980650001201993650002102005650002302026653003302049653002202082653002002104653001502124653002302139700001702162700001802179700001802197700001602215700001602231773013102247852000902378856012802387930003302515945002502548946001302573655001202586IND4441422520221122054006.0100820s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444142252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aP130 0aN2001 aHudson, G.T.12aA Mobile Unit for Demonstrating Performance, Efficiency, and Emissions of Biofueled Engines  ap. 521-525.  aIncludes references  aA mobile unit was constructed to demonstrate the relative power performance, fuel efficiency, and exhaust emissions of a compression-ignition engine fueled with biodiesel or petroleum diesel. A Kubota D902-E3B, Tier IV compliant, compression-ignition engine (3-cylinder, 16.1 kW @ 3200 rpm) was mounted on a modified 1.5- x 2.4-m trailer. The engine is fueled from two auxiliary fuel tanks; manual valves are used to select the tank and fuel type. Digital platform scales are used to measure fuel consumption (on a mass basis). A computer-controlled water brake dynamometer is used to load the engine and display engine rpm, torque, and power. Exhaust emissions (HC, CO, CO 2 , and NO (X)) are measured using a portable exhaust gas analyzer. Data can be imported into a spreadsheet template and the fuels can be compared on the variables of power, torque, specific fuel consumption, thermal efficiency, and exhaust emissions. The portable unit has been used in educational programs for public school students, college students, farmers, Extension personnel, and industry representatives. Informal feedback and data from pre- and post-test assessments indicate that the mobile unit is an effective method of demonstrating the relative performance, efficiency, and exhaust emissions from compression-ignition engines fueled with biodiesel and petroleum diesel. 3adiesel engines 3abiodiesel 3adiesel fuel 3aequipment performance 3aenergy efficiency 3agas emissions 3aair pollution 3atrailers 3aeducational materials 3adynamometers 3acarbon monoxide 3acarbon dioxide 3anitrogen oxides 3ahydrocarbons 3atorque 3aenergy use and consumption 3aheat production 3astudents 3afarmers 3aextension agents 3aconsumer education 0acompression-ignition engines 0apower performance 0afuel efficiency 0afuel tanks 0athermal efficiency1 aSallee, C.W.1 aJohnson, D.M.1 aWardlow, G.W.1 aEdgar, D.W.1 aDavis, J.A.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2010, v. 26, no. 3 p.521-525dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=26&issue=3&conf=aeaj&orgconf=aeaj20103Available from publisher's Web site  a20101203b20110101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/10/20  aOther US 7aarticle01990naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009100129300001600220500007900236500001500315520084800330650002201178650001101200650001901211650001101230650002101241650003501262650001501297650001401312650001401326650002001340653001701360653002001377653002001397700001401417773008301431852000901514930003301523945001301556946001101569655001201580IND2051887920221122044006.0960627e19960401ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205188792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamieson, D.G.14aThe 'WaterWare' decision-support system for river-basin planning. 1.

An approach of physically based modelling is used, with a fine grid resolution, on a very simple hill-slope model to analyse how ditches affect runoff. Results from the simulations show that the most important process is the change in behaviour of the sub-surface, under near-saturated conditions, when there is a much higher and more variable sub-surface exchange flow into the stream network. The speed of the surface runoff response is also affected. From the results of the analysis a method using effective parameterisation has been developed to recreate the effects of the drainage in a coarser resolution catchment model. The method involves calculating effective saturated hydraulic conductivities for the sub-surface flows and effective Strickler coefficients for the surface flows. The application of the method is demonstrated for a sub-catchment of the River South Tyne at Alston. Results from these simulations show that predictions of flow for the catchment can be improved by using the effective parameterisation to create a pseudo drainage representation of the sub-grid-scale channels within the model. Simulations of more intensive drainage scenarios show that the effects of open ditch drainage on hydrology are significant and that the direction of change is not intuitive. 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asimulation models 3astream flow 3asurface drainage 3adrainage channels 3awatershed hydrology 3arunoff 3awater table 3asubsurface flow 3aprediction 3aNorthern Ireland 0amathematical models 0aflow to drains 0asubsurface exchange flow 0aslope 0ahill land 0aditches 0asurface runoff1 aMacKay, R.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1996 May 1, v. 179, no. 1/4 p.37-66x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03443naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245012500165300001600290520136200306650002201668650002101690650001501711650002501726650002501751650002001776650001801796650001601814650003001830650006201860650002401922650001201946650001801958650005701976650002502033650002602058650005602084650001802140650002202158650002002180650001102200650002802211650002102239650002102260650003102281650002902312650004202341650002402383650004702407650003402454653002002488653002302508653001002531653002802541653001902569700001602588700001502604773007202619852000902691930003302700945001302733946001102746655001202757IND2051035520221121232722.0960429e19960201enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205103552DNAL7 a85999282pmid7 aPMC4499632pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeisman, R.12aA multicopy suppressor of a cell cycle defect in S. pombe encodes a heat shock-inducible 40 kDa cyclophilin-like protein  ap. 447-456.  aCyclophilins are peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases) which have been implicated in intracellular protein folding, transport and assembly. Cyclophilins are also known as the intracellular receptors for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). The most common type of cyclophilins are the 18 kDa cytosolic proteins containing only the highly conserved core domain for PPIase and CsA binding activities. The wis2+ gene of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of wee1-50 cdc25-22 win1-1, a triple mutant strain which exhibits a cell cycle defect phenotype. Sequence analysis of wis2+ reveals that it encodes a 40 kDa cyclophilin-like protein, homologous to the mammalian cyclophilin 40. The 18 kDa cyclophilin domain (CyP-18) of wis2 is followed by a C-terminal region of 188 amino acids. The C-terminal region of wis2 is essential for suppression of the triple mutant defect. Furthermore, this region of the protein is able to confer suppression activity on the 18 kDa S. pombe cyclophilin, cyp1, since a hybrid protein consisting of an 18 kDa S. pombe cyclophilin (cyp1) fused to the C-terminus of wis2 shows suppression activity. We also demonstrate that the level of wis2+ mRNA increases 10- to 20-fold upon heat shock of S. pombe cells, suggesting a role for wis2+ in the heat-shock response. 3aSaccharomycetales 3astructural genes 3aisomerases 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aheat stress 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 2aAmino Acid Isomerasesxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCarrier Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aCell Cyclexgenetics 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aFungal Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenes, Suppressor 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aMultigene Family 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPeptidylprolyl Isomerase 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSchizosaccharomycesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0ainhibitor genes 0agenetic regulation 0awis2+ 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x919811 aCreanor, J.1 aFantes, P.0 tEMBO journal.g1996 Feb. 1, v. 15, no. 3 p.447-456x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02443naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012600125300001600251520117000267650002801437650001401465650002101479650002501500650001901525650003201544650002001576650001901596650002301615650001801638650002901656650002001685650002601705650001801731650001901749653001701768653003101785653002801816700001501844773007201859852000901931930003301940945001301973946001101986655001201997IND2051036020221121220834.0960429e19960201enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205103602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCall, K.10aProbes for chromatin accessibility in the Drosophila bithorax complex respond differently to Polycomb-mediated repression  ap. 569-580.  aThe Polycomb group (PcG) of genes are required for maintenance of the repressed state of the homeotic genes in Drosophila. There are similarities between the PcG repression and mating-type silencing in yeast or heterochromatic position effect in Drosophila, which suggest that PcG repression may involve a highly compacted chromatin structure. To test for such a structure, heterologous DNA-binding proteins were used as probes for DNA accessibility in Drosophila embryos. Binding sites for the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 and for bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase were inserted into the bithorax (bx) regulatory region of the endogenous Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene, which is regulated by the PcG. Ubiquitously expressed GAL4 protein directs transcription through its binding sites only in the posterior segments where the bx region is active. The block to GAL4 activation in the more anterior segments is dependent on Polycomb (Pc) function. In contrast, T7 RNA polymerase can transcribe from its target promoter in all segments of the embryo. Thus, Pc-mediated repression blocks activated polymerase II transcription, but does not simply exclude all proteins. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3achromatin 3aDNA conformation 3aDNA-binding proteins 3abacteriophages 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3arecombinant DNA 3areporter genes 3abeta-galactosidase 3aembryogenesis 3atranscription (genetics) 3aembryo (animal) 3atranscription factors 3abinding sites 3ahistochemistry 0agal4 protein 0atranscriptional activators 0apolycomb group of genes1 aBender, W.0 tEMBO journal.g1996 Feb. 1, v. 15, no. 3 p.569-580x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02069naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008900125300001300214520083800227650001501065650002401080650002201104650001101126650000901137650001801146650001301164650001101177650001501188650001301203650001201216650002401228650001101252650001201263650001601275650001801291650002501309650001201334650001201346651001101358653001301369653003001382700001901412773007801431852000901509930003301518945001301551946001101564655001201575IND2053047020221121220955.0960916e199606  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205304702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurand, P.10aSolute transfer in agricultural catchments: the interest and limits of mixing models  ap. 1-22.  aThis paper deals with the applicability of the endmember mixing analysis (EMMA) to agricultural catchments. The basic assumptions of the method are discussed in the case of semi-natural and rural ecosystems. EMMA was applied to two storm events in a farmland catchment in Brittany (France) using four endmembers and three tracers. The results were validated using additional tracers. The sensitivity of the method to uncertainty in the endmember composition was analysed using a Monte-Carlo procedure. The results were satisfactory although the method is very sensitive when the endmember composition is close to the streamwater chemistry. It is concluded that mixing analysis is a valuable tool for studying water pathways in agricultural areas, provided it is applied over short periods and used with other hydrological approaches. 3awatersheds 3awatershed hydrology 3aagricultural land 3astorms 3arain 3awater quality 3anitrates 3asilica 3aalkalinity 3asulfates 3asilicon 3alabeling techniques 3aanions 3acations 3agroundwater 3asurface water 3astatistical analysis 3astreams 3asolutes 3aFrance 0atransfer 0aendmember mixing analysis1 aTorres, J.L.J.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1996 June, v. 181, no. 1/4 p.1-22x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02067naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009300128300001600221520109600237650001801333650001501351650002401366650002601390650001601416650001501432650001601447650001601463650001801479650001401497650001101511651000901522700001301531773008301544852000901627930003301636945001301669946001101682655001201693IND2052885320221121220914.0960904e19960515ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205288532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElsenbeer, H.10aHydrometric and hydrochemical evidence for fast flowpaths at La Cuenca, Western Amazonia  ap. 237-250.  aA hydrological reconnaissance study in a first-order tropical rainforest catchment in western Amazonia implicated overland flow as an important hydrological pathway. A complementary hydrometric and hydrochemical approach that involved the recording of overland flow hydrographs and the determination of streamflow, overland flow, groundwater, soil water, and throughfall chemical signatures, was essential to establish unambiguously the importance of this pathway. Largely uncontrolled by topography, overland flow does occur in any season, regardless of antecedent moisture conditions, which only influence the volumes generated. The latter effect is also reflected in a close approximation of stormflow and overland flow chemical signatures, as expressed in the K SiO2 ratio. We conclude that, despite its greater logistical demands, a complementary hydrometric hydrochemical approach is essential to understand a catchment's hydrological behaviour, especially where fast pathways are at work; such pathways are apparently common in more forest ecosystems than has been previously assumed. 3aoverland flow 3awatersheds 3awatershed hydrology 3atropical rain forests 3astream flow 3asoil water 3agroundwater 3athroughfall 3awater quality 3apotassium 3asilica 3aPeru1 aLack, A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1996 May 15, v. 180, no. 1/4 p.237-250x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02466naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245007600142300001600218520103900234650002701273650001801300650001701318650002101335650001101356650002801367650001201395650001301407650001401420650001001434650000901444650001201453650003801465650004801503650003801551650002701589650001101616650003101627650003701658700001501695700001801710700001501728700001301743773013801756852000901894930003301903945001301936946001101949655001201960IND2205626420221121220915.0000707e19991015ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220562642DNAL7 a105187452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkao, T.10aLectin activity of Bacillus thuringiensis parasporal inclusion proteins  ap. 415-421.  aParasporal inclusion proteins from a total of 151 Bacillus thuringiensis strains, consisting of 139 Japanese isolates and the type strains of 12 H serovars, were screened for haemagglutination (HA) activity against sheep erythrocytes.

The strains with high HA activity were derived from phylloplanes and soils of five geographically different localities, and belonged to H serovars kurstaki and other undefined serotype(s). The HA activities in the four selected strains were generated only when alkali-solubilised parasporal inclusion proteins were proteolytically processed. Furthermore, the lectin activity of the four strains was strongly inhibited by preincubation with N-acetylgalactosamine.

Field tests which give the infiltration parameters of sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity, two parameters found in the Philip infiltration model, were performed in the watershed using a disk permeameter. These field data were combined with coverages in an existing Geographical Information System (GIS) database and field observations of surface attributes (soil type and vegetation) which are known to contribute to variation in infiltration rates. Statistical tests performed on the field-test data indicate that the only surface attribute which influences variations in infiltration rates in this watershed (owing mainly to limited variations in soil type) is vegetation. Further, time-to-ponding calculations which indicate when and if runoff might occur following the start of a precipitation event indicate that for most precipitation events likely to occur in this area during the summer, infiltration in all but nonforested areas is unlikely. The coverages in the GIS database were used to develop a map of the watershed which delineates areas of low potential infiltration from areas of high potential infiltration which can be used in parameter estimation and watershed conceptualization in computer modeling of runoff. 3asorption 3ageographic information systems 3awatersheds 3asoil types 3avegetation 3awatershed hydrology 3aspatial variation 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aNevada 0asorptivity 0asoil properties 0acomputer simulation 0amapping 0amaps 0ainfiltration1 aWarwick, J.J.1 aTyler, S.W.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1996 June, v. 181, no. 1/4 p.149-168x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03292naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100001100128245010300139300001600242500002400258520180200282650001402084650002602098650002002124650002502144650001702169650001202186650002102198650001102219650001302230650002702243650002602270650001402296650002302310650002102333650002502354653001802379700001302397700001102410700001202421700001402433773013102447852000902578856012802587930003302715945002502748946001302773655001202786IND4441419720221121182352.0100820s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444141972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP210 0aW0001 aLi, J.10aEffects of Chlorination Schemes on Clogging in Drip Emitters during Application of Sewage Effluent  ap. 565-578.  aIncludes references  aChlorination is usually an economic method for treating clogging in drip emitters due to biological growth during sewage application. However, limited information is available for determining an optimal chlorination scheme. In this study, experiments were conducted to quantify the impact of chlorine injection concentrations and intervals on clogging and system performance of drip irrigation units that are used to apply a stored secondary effluent. Various chlorination schemes with concentrations of free chlorine residual at the end of laterals ranging from 0 to 10 mg L -1 and injection intervals ranging from one to four weeks were assessed using seven types of emitters with a nominal discharge of 1.0 to 2.6 L h -1 at 0.1-MPa pressure. It was found that emitter clogging was significantly affected by chlorination scheme and emitter type as well as their interaction. Clogging was greatly reduced by chlorination, especially for the emitters with a nominal discharge of less than 1.38 L h -1 . Chlorination is therefore highly recommended for emitters with a relatively small discharge when sewage effluent is applied. Both the chlorine concentration during chlorination and the injection frequency had an impact on the effectiveness of reducing clogging. The weekly chlorination of 1.5 and 2.5 mg L -1 of free chlorine residual at the end of laterals and the biweekly chlorination at 5 mg L -1 generally produced less clogging and more uniform water application than the weekly chlorination at 0.5 mg L -1 and the chlorination every four weeks at 10 mg L -1 . In general, a more frequent chlorination at a lower concentration is more effective in maintaining good system performance than a less frequent chlorination at a higher concentration, and is therefore recommended by this study. 3aeffluents 3awastewater irrigation 3amicroirrigation 3aemitters (equipment) 3achlorination 3afouling 3amicrobial growth 3asewage 3achlorine 3achemical concentration 3aequipment performance 3afrequency 3aapplication timing 3airrigation rates 3aspatial distribution 0adrip emitters1 aChen, L.1 aLi, Y.1 aYin, J.1 aZhang, H.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2010, v. 26, no. 4 p.565-578dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=26&issue=4&conf=aeaj&orgconf=aeaj20103Available from publisher's Web site  a20101206b20110101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/10/20  aOther US 7aarticle05272naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001400137245011900151300001600270500002400286500001500310520315800325650001803483650002403501650002503525650002403550650001503574650001703589650004103606650002703647650002203674650002303696650002303719650003103742650002203773650002103795650002303816650002303839650002503862650003003887650002603917651001303943653001503956653001903971653006503990653002704055700001504082700001704097700002204114700001704136700001504153700001804168700001804186700002004204700002304224773013104247852000904378856012804387930003304515945002504548946001304573655001204586IND4441419420221121182414.0100820s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444141942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aN200 0aC210 0aP2101 aIrmak, S.10aNebraska Agricultural Water Management Demonstration Network (NAWMDN): Integrating Research and Extension/Outreach  ap. 599-613.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMaximizing the net benefits of irrigated plant production through appropriately designed agricultural water management programs is of growing importance in Nebraska, and other western and Midwestern states, because many areas are involved in management and policy changes to conserve irrigation water. In Nebraska, farmers are being challenged to practice conservation methods and use water resources more efficiently while meeting plant water requirements and maintaining high yields. Another challenge Nebraska experiences in it's approximately 3.5-million-ha irrigated lands is limited adoption of newer technologies/tools to help farmers better manage irrigation, conserve water and energy, and increase plant water use efficiency. In 2005, the Nebraska Agricultural Water Management Demonstration Network (NAWMDN or Network) was formed from an interdisciplinary team of partners including the Natural Resources Districts (NRD); USDA-NRCS; farmers from south central, northeast, west central, and western Nebraska; crop consultants; and University of Nebraska-Lincoln faculty. The main goal of the Network is to enable the transfer of high quality research-based information to Nebraskans through a series of demonstration projects established in farmers' fields and implement newer tools and technologies to address and enhance plant water use efficiency, water conservation, and reduce energy consumption for irrigation. The demonstration projects are supported by the scientifically-based field research and evaluation projects conducted at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, South Central Agricultural Laboratory located near Clay Center, Nebraska. The Network was formed with only 15 farmers as collaborators in only one of the 23 NRDs in 2005. As of late 2009, the number of active collaborators has increased to over 300 in 12 NRDs and 35 of 93 counties. The Network is impacting both water and energy conservation due to farmers adopting information and newer technologies for irrigation management. The NAWMDN is helping participants to improve irrigation management and efficiency by monitoring plant growth stages and development, soil moisture, and crop evapotranspiration. As a result, they are reducing irrigation water application amounts and associated energy savings is leading to greater profitability to participating farmers. For example, surveys of 300 NAWMDN participants in 2008 estimated water conservation at an average of 66 mm for maize and 55 mm for soybean on 114,000 ha (58,000 ha of maize and about 56,000 ha of soybean). With 2008 diesel fuel prices, this water conservation was an equivalent of $2,814,000 and $2,270,000 for maize and soybean, respectively, in energy costs saved for the land area represented. Since the beginning of the NAWMDN, over 8,650 producers, crop consultants, and agricultural industry personnel have been reached and educated at over 231 meetings. This article describes the goals and objectives of the Network, technical and educational components, operational functions, and procedures used in the NAWMDN. The quantitative impacts in terms of water and energy conservation are reported. 3aprofitability 3ainnovation adoption 3adevelopmental stages 3aextension education 3acrop yield 3awater policy 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3aagricultural education 3aplant development 3awater conservation 3asoil water content 3aenergy use and consumption 3airrigated farming 3airrigation water 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation systems 3awater use efficiency 3ainformation dissemination 3airrigation management 3aNebraska 0atechnology 0anew technology 0aNebraska Agricultural Water Management Demonstration Network 0ademonstration projects1 aRees, J.M.1 aZoubek, G.L.1 avan DeWalle, B.S.1 aRathje, W.R.1 aDeBuhr, R.1 aLeininger, D.1 aSiekman, D.D.1 aSchneider, J.W.1 aChristiansen, A.P.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2010, v. 26, no. 4 p.599-613dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=26&issue=4&conf=aeaj&orgconf=aeaj20103Available from publisher's Web site  a20101203b20110101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/10/20  aOther US 7aarticle02311naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010100128300001600229500001500245520086400260650002301124650002201147650002001169650002301189650001401212650001201226650001501238650000901253650002401262650002001286650001101306650001501317650002401332651001501356651002201371653001501393653001901408653004301427653002801470653001901498653002401517653003501541653002201576700001701598700001801615773008201633852000901715930003301724945001301757946001101770655001201781IND2052500220221121182358.0960807e19960501ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205250022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiew, F.H.S.10aConceptual catchment scale rainfall-runoff models and AGCM land-surface parameterisation schemes  ap. 137-157.  a2019-12-05  aThe similarities and differences between conceptual rainfall-runoff models developed by hydrologists and land-surface parameterisation schemes developed for incorporation into atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) are explored. The simulations indicate that the key surface water and energy quantities estimated by a typical rainfall-runoff model (MODHYDROLOG) and a typical land-surface scheme (BEST) for a wet tropical catchment and a temperate ephemeral catchment are reasonably similar. The results suggest that the parameterisations used in land-surface schemes can simulate runoff satisfactorily for wet areas but are too simplified to model runoff adequately in ephemeral catchments. The simulations also suggest that the simple algorithms used in rainfall-runoff models can be adopted for climate change impact studies and for use with AGCMs. 3atemporal variation 3asimulation models 3asolar radiation 3aevapotranspiration 3aequations 3atropics 3awatersheds 3arain 3awatershed hydrology 3atemperate zones 3arunoff 3aalgorithms 3asoil water movement 3aQueensland 3aWestern Australia 0abest model 0asurface layers 0aatmospheric general circulation models 0awet tropical catchments 0asurface energy 0amathematical models 0atemperate ephemeral catchments 0amodhydrolog model1 aPitman, A.J.1 aMcMahon, T.A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1996 May 1, v. 179, no. 1/4 p.137-157x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02388naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002100144245009100165300001600256500002400272520097100296650001701267650001101284650001801295650002401313650002201337650001401359650002001373650001301393650001301406650001601419650001401435650002201449650001301471700001901484700002101503700002301524700001801547773014501565852000901710856012801719930003301847945002501880946001301905655001201918IND4441418220221121183837.0100820s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444141822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Drying experiments were conducted on dairy cattle manure slasb with thicknesses of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mm at drying air temperatures of 90°C, 100°C, 110°C, and 120°C with drying air velocities of 0.5, 1, and 1.5 m/s. A diffusion model was used to describe the moisture transfer and then the effective diffusivity was determined for each temperature. The effective moisture diffusivity of dairy cattle manure slab varied from 1.67× 10-6 to 11.79×10-6m2/s. The temperature dependence of the diffusivity coefficient was also described by the Arrhenius-type relationship. The activation energy of dairy cattle manure slab was in the range of 14.41 to 19.46kJ/mol. Three drying models (i.e., Henderson and Pabis, Lewis, and Page) were fitted to the experimental data. Based on the root mean square error values, the Page model showed the best fit of the three models. 3adairy manure 3adrying 3awater content 3amathematical models 3aconvection dryers 3athickness 3aair temperature 3aair flow 3avelocity 3adiffusivity 3aequations 3aactivation energy 3aaccuracy1 aKianmehr, M.H.1 aArabhosseini, A.1 aHassan-Beygi, S.R.1 aAghbashlo, M.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2010, v. 26, no. 4 p.689-697dAmerican Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=26&issue=4&conf=aeaj&orgconf=aeaj20103Available from publisher's Web site  a20101203b20110101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/10/20  aOther US 7aarticle03095naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009000164300001600254500002300270500001500293520163300308650001801941650001601959650001001975650002301985650001202008650001602020650001402036650001902050650001402069650001402083650002302097653002302120653001402143653002002157653001302177653001502190653002202205653002602227653002202253700001602275700001702291700001802308773008802326852000902414856008502423930003302508945001302541946001102554655001202565IND2058397720221121150839.0970715s1996    onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205839772DNAL7 a10.1080/070606696095005822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorworth, C.E.10aBiological control of red alder (Alnus rubra) with indigenous pathogenic Ascomycotina  ap. 315-324.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aRed alder (Alnus rubra) is a valuable timber tree on 10-20% of forested lands in Pacific Coastal North America and is an undesirable competitor of planted conifers, to a greater or lesser extent, on much of the remainder. A biological control strategy to manage red alder was developed for use in environmentally sensitive areas in which pesticides are prohibited by law, and as a complement to extent weed control measures. Red alder trees within a typical west coast forest were inoculated with pathogen-colonized wood dowels inserted into stem punctures, using technology designated PFC-MYCOCHARGE. Each of 11 blocks of 30 trees (6 per diameter class, 0.5 cm to approximately 50 cm diam) was inoculated with 1 of 11 isolates of seven species of Ascomycotina previously isolated from red alder in British Columbia. A 12th block of 30 trees was treated with noncolonized dowels and designated the control block. A single isolate of Nectria ditissima (PFC-082/ATCC 74260; U.S. Pat. Off 5 340 578) proved worthy of commercial development by virtue of nearly 100% inoculation success, notable alder tissue damage, and reduction in general health of inoculated trees. A significant relationship between pathogen species and mortality was not recorded during the limited period of the test. N. ditissima PFC-082 did not reproduce on the trees and was soon displaced by secondary organisms, so the danger of unwanted dispersion of the pathogen was nil. The PFC-MYCOCHARGE strategy is recommended for commercial development as a component of forest management plans for implementation during pre-commercial stand improvement activity. 3abrush control 3aAlnus rubra 3aValsa 3aHypoxylon mammatum 3aNectria 3awoody weeds 3aDiaporthe 3amycoherbicides 3amortality 3ainfection 3abiological control 0avalsa melanodiscus 0aPhomopsis 0amelanconis alni 0aefficacy 0aAscomycota 0anectria ditissima 0amelanconis marginalis 0axylaria hypoxylon1 aMacey, D.E.1 aSieber, T.N.1 aWoods, T.A.D.0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g1996, v. 18, no. 4 p.315-324x0706-06617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/070606696095005823Available from publisher's Web site  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdLJS  aNon-US 7aarticle03920naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245010900145300001800254520243400272650001602706650001502722650001702737650002302754650002202777650002302799650001202822650001302834650002102847650001102868650001802879650002402897650000902921650002002930650002402950650002302974650003202997650003103029650002303060650002203083653001903105653002303124653002703147700001903174700001603193700001703209773008403226852000903310930003303319945001303352946001303365655001203378IND2328675920221121150858.0020823e200206  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232867592DNAL7 a121464892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYazdi, M.H.10aHeritability, reliability of genetic evaluations and response to selection in proportional hazard models  ap. 1563-1577.  aThe purposes of this study were 1) to investigate the heritability, reliability, and selection response for survival traits following a Weibull frailty proportional hazard model; and 2) to examine the relationship between genetic parameters from a Weibull model, a discrete proportional hazard model, and a binary data analysis using a linear model. Both analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations were used to achieve these aims. Data were simulated using the Weibull frailty model with two different shapes of the Weibull distribution. Breeding values of 100 unrelated sires with 50 to 100 progeny (with different levels of censoring) were generated from a normal distribution and two different sire variances. For analysis of longevity data on the discrete scale, simulated data were transformed to a discrete scale using arbitrary ends of discrete intervals of 400, 800, or 1200 d. For binary data analysis, an individual's longevity was either 0 (when longevity was less than the end of interval) or 1 (when longevity was equal or greater than the end of interval). Three different statistical models were investigated in this study: a Weibull model, a discrete-time model (a proportional hazard model assuming that the survival data are measured on a discrete scale with few classes), and a linear model based upon binary data. An alternative derivation using basic expressions of reliabilities in sire models suggests a simple equation for the heritability on the original scale (effective heritability) that is not dependent on the Weibull parameters. The predictions of reliabilities using the proposed formulae in this study are in very good agreement with reliabilities observed from simulations. In general, the estimates of reliability from either the discrete model or the binary data analysis were close to estimates from the Weibull model for a given number of uncensored records in this simplified case of a balanced design. Although selection response from the binary data analysis depends on the end of interval point, there is a relatively good agreement between selection responses in the Weibull model and the binary data analysis. In general, when the underlying survival data is from a Weibull distribution, it appears that the method of analyzing data does not greatly affect the results in terms of sire ranking or response to selection, at least for the simplified context considered in this study. 3adairy bulls 3adairy cows 3aheritability 3aMonte Carlo method 3asimulation models 3aselection response 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgenetics 2aFemale 2aLinear Models 2aLongevityxgenetics 2aMale 2aModels, Genetic 2aModels, Statistical 2aMonte Carlo Method 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSurvival Analysis 0agenetic models 0agenetic parameters 0afrequency distribution1 aVisscher, P.M.1 aDucrocq, V.1 aThompson, R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 June, v. 85, no. 6 p.1563-1577x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03578naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245007300148300001800221500001500239520160800254650002301862650002401885650000901909650001201918650001001930650001401940650001501954650002401969650001201993650001902005650000902024650002302033650001402056650001602070650005402086650001202140650002002152650001102172650004002183650003502223650004002258650003902298650001902337650004502356650002602401650003802427650005402465650002002519650005502539650002302594650002202617653001702639653001302656700001502669700001902684700001902703700001802722773008402740852000902824930003302833945001302866946001302879655001202892IND2328675720221121150853.0020823e200206  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232867572DNAL7 a121464872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBequette, B.J.10aProtein metabolism in lactating goats subjected to the insulin clamp  ap. 1546-1555.  a2019-12-05  aA model of Leu and protein metabolism by the mammary gland and hind leg of lactating goats was constructed and evaluated from data collected by using [15N, 1-13C]Leu kinetics measured during amino acid (AA) infusion and a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (IC). Goats were given continuous intravenous infusions of either saline or AA (65 g/d) for 7.5 d and from d 5 to 7.5 goats were subjected to IC. Arteriovenous kinetics were monitored on d 4 and 8 by continuous infusion (8 h) of [15N, 1-13C]Leu. Milk protein yield was increased by IC (+10%) and IC + AA (+21%), whereas AA infusion had no effect. The data were used to construct model equations that describe rates of protein synthesis and degradation, and from these equations, milk and muscle net protein synthesis were described. The model was unable to describe the observed responses in milk protein synthesis. Similar to observations in the literature, net protein gain by the hind leg increased with AA, IC, and IC + AA infusion, primarily through stimulation of protein synthesis by AA. For both tissues, IC depressed Leu oxidation, but only in the absence of AA infusion. Although the IC appears to regulate the ability of the mammary gland to coordinate blood flow and Leu catabolism in support of protein synthesis, our ability to construct a precise model describing mammary protein anabolism is still limited. In contrast, the response in protein anabolism of the hind-leg tissues of these midlactation goats was predicted well by the model, which indicate that the leg tissues were more sensitive to AA supply than the mammary gland. 3amilk protein yield 3amathematical models 3adiet 3aleucine 3agoats 3alactation 3ablood flow 3ahormonal regulation 3ainsulin 3amammary glands 3alegs 3aprotein metabolism 3agoat milk 3ametabolites 2aAmino Acidsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aFemale 2aGlucose Clamp Techniquexveterinary 2aGoatsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aHindlimbxblood supplyxmetabolism. 2aInfusions, Intravenousxveterinary 2aInsulinxblood 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixmetabolism 2aLactationxmetabolism 2aLeucinexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aMammary Glands, Animalxblood supplyxmetabolism. 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysisxbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aModels, Biological 2aNitrogen Isotopes 0abody regions 0ainfusion1 aKyle, C.E.1 aCrompton, L.A.1 aAnderson, S.E.1 aHanigan, M.D.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 June, v. 85, no. 6 p.1546-1555x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03133naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245006300164300001800227520140400245650002801649650002101677650001801698650002501716650001901741650002501760650002301785650001801808650001201826650001801838650001801856650002401874650002801898650003601926650002801962650003001990650003702020650002002057650002002077650001702097650004802114650003702162650003602199653001502235653002302250653001602273653002602289700001302315700001702328700001702345700001402362773007702376852000902453930003302462945001302495946001102508655001202519IND2049348120221121150907.0951228e19950915enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204934812DNAL7 a75560962pmid7 aPMC3945452pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanaar, R.10aInteraction of the sex-lethal RNA binding domains with RNA  ap. 4530-4539.  aSex determination and X chromosome dosage compensation in Drosophila melanogaster are directed by the Sex-lethal (Sxl) protein. In part, Sxl functions by regulating the splicing of the transformer pre-mRNA by binding to a 3' splice site polypyrimidine tract. Polypyrimidine tracts are essential for splicing of metazoan pre-mRNAs. To unravel the mechanism of splicing regulation at polypyrimidine tracts we analyzed the interaction of Sxl with RNA. The RNA binding activity of Sxl was mapped to the two ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence domains of the protein. Quantitation of binding showed that both RNA binding domains (RBDs) were required in cis for site-specific RNA binding. Individual RBDs interacted with RNA more weakly and had lost the ability to discriminate between wild-type and mutant transformer polypyrimidine tracts. Structural elements in one of the RBDs that are likely to interact with a polypyrimidine tract were identified using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. In addition, our data suggest that multiple imino protons of the transformer polypyrimidine tract were involved in hydrogen bonding. Interestingly, in vitro Sxl bound with equal affinity to polypyrimidine tracts of pre-mRNAs that it does not regulate in vivo. We discuss the implications of this finding for the mechanism through which Sxl may gain selectivity for particular polypyrimidine tracts in vivo. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3abinding proteins 3amessenger RNA 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleoproteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aribonucleoproteins 3abinding sites 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aDrosophila melanogaster 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aOligoribonucleotidesxmetabolism 2aProtein Binding 2aRNAxmetabolism 2aRNA Splicing 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0aprecursors 0asex lethal protein 0asxl protein 0apolypyrimidine tracts1 aLee, Al.1 aRudner, D.Z.1 aWemmer, D.E.1 aRio, D.C.0 tEMBO journal.g1995 Sept. 15, v. 14, no. 18 p.4530-4539x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03174naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245018000163300001800343520096700361650003001328650001201358650002101370650001701391650001801408650001601426650002201442650001401464650001201478650002301490650003601513650002701549650006001576650002801636650004201664650003301706650003101739650001001770650003901780650005901819650001301878650001401891650002901905650010801934650003402042650002902076650002302105650003902128650002402167650002202191650003102213653001702244653001802261700001802279700001602297700001502313700001802328773007602346852000902422930003302431945001302464946001102477655001202488IND2049362920221121150832.0951229e19951016enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204936292DNAL7 a75886262pmid7 aPMC3946012pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarah, J.10aIsolation of a psaF-deficient mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: efficient interaction of plastocyanin with the photosystem I reaction center is mediated by the PsaF subunit  ap. 4976-4984.  aThe PsaF polypeptide of photosystem I (PSI) is located on the lumen side of the thylakoid membrane and its precise role is not yet fully understood. Here we describe the isolation of a psaF-deficient mutant of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii generated by co-transforming the nuclear genome of the cw15-arg7A strain with two plasmids: one harboring a mutated version of the psaF gene and the other containing the argininosuccinate lyase gene conferring arginine prototrophy. This psaF mutant still assembles a functional PSI complex and is capable of photoautotrophic growth. However, electron transfer from plastocyanin to P700+, the oxidized reaction center chlorophyll dimer, is dramatically reduced in the mutant, indicating that the PsaF subunit plays an important role in docking plastocyanin to the PSI complex. These results contrast with those obtained previously with a cyanobacterial psaF-, psaJ- double mutant where no phenotype was apparent. 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3amutants 3astructural genes 3apolypeptides 3aphotosystem I 3amutagenesis 3aelectron transfer 3aphenotype 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCell Compartmentationxgenetics 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aDose-Response Relationship, Radiation 2aElectron Transportxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aLight 2aLight-Harvesting Protein Complexes 2aMembrane Proteinsxbiosynthesisxdeficiencyxgenetics. 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPhotosynthesisxgenetics 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aPhotosystem I Protein Complex 2aPlastocyaninxmetabolism 2aProtozoan Proteins 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Deletion 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 0ainteractions 0aplastocyanins1 aRappaport, F.1 aChoquet, Y.1 aJoliot, P.1 aRochaix, J.D.0 tEMBO journal.g1995 Oct. 16, v. 14, no. 20 p.4976-4984x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03656naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245009200167300001800259500001500277520128700292650002501579650001901604650001901623650001101642650002201653650002101675650002301696650002301719650002201742650002101764650002201785650002501807650001801832650001201850650002401862650001701886650001801903650002001921650001101941650002801952650002001980650002502000650003102025650004102056650003502097650002502132650006302157650006302220650003802283650002702321650003402348650003202382650002402414650001702438650002702455650002402482653001902506653002002525653001902545653002802564653002502592700001602617700001802633700001602651700002202667700001802689773007702707852000902784930003302793945001302826946001102839655001202850IND2049350420221121114302.0951228e19950915enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204935042DNAL7 a75560972pmid7 aPMC3945462pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpson, G.G.10aMolecular characterization of the spliceosomal proteins U1A and U2B" from higher plants  ap. 4540-4550.  a2019-12-05  aIn addition to their role in pre-mRNA splicing, the human spliceosomal proteins U1A and U2B'' are important models of how RNP motif-containing proteins execute sequence-specific RNA binding. Genes encoding U1A and U2B'' have been isolated from potato and thereby provide the only evolutionary comparison available for both proteins and represent the only full-length genes encoding plant spliceosomal proteins to have been cloned and characterized. In vitro RNA binding experiments revealed the ability of potato U2B'' to interact with human U2A' to enhance sequence-specific binding and to distinguish cognate RNAs of either plant or animal origin. A comparison of the sequence of U1A and U2B'' proteins indicated that multiple residues which could affect RNP motif conformation probably govern the specific distinction in RNA binding by these proteins. Since human U1A modulates polyadenylation in vertebrates, the possibility that plant U1A might be exploited in the characterization of this process in plants was examined. However, unlike vertebrate U1A, neither U1A from potato nor Arabidopsis bound their own mRNA and no evidence for binding to upstream efficiency elements in polyadenylation signals was obtained, suggesting that plant U1A is not involved in polyadenylation. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3anucleoproteins 3aXenopus laevis 3ahumans 3acomplementary DNA 3astructural genes 3achemical reactions 3aribonucleoproteins 3aSolanum tuberosum 3abinding proteins 3asmall nuclear RNA 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding sites 3aintrons 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAutoantigens 2aBase Sequence 2aGenomic Library 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aRNA Precursorsxmetabolism 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional 2aRNA, Small Nuclearxmetabolism 2aRNA-Binding Proteins 2aRibonucleoprotein, U1 Small Nuclearxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRibonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclearxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRibonucleoproteins, Small Nuclear 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSolanum tuberosumxgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpliceosomes 2aTranscription, Genetic 2asnRNP Core Proteins 0agenbank/z49990 0apolyadenylation 0agenbank/z49991 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aClark, G.P.1 aRothnie, H.M.1 aBoelens, W.1 aVenrooij, W. van.1 aBrown, J.W.S.0 tEMBO journal.g1995 Sept. 15, v. 14, no. 18 p.4540-4550x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02529naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245011800165300001800283520093500301650002801236650002501264650002001289650001001309650001101319650001101330650001201341650001801353650001201371650002301383650002501406650004401431650003501475650003701510650003801547650002401585650002401609650003901633650003401672650001001706650006501716650001701781653001601798653001701814700001401831773007601845852000901921930003301930945001301963946001101976655001201987IND2049363020221121114251.0951229e19951016enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204936302DNAL7 a75886302pmid7 aPMC3946052pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoppler, S.10aTwo different thresholds of wingless signalling with distinct developmental consequences in the Drosophila midgut  ap. 5016-5026.  aDrosophila wingless encodes a Wnt protein which mediates communication between cells. Although wingless protein is secreted from cells, there is debate as to what is the range of wingless action. We examined the function of wingless in the larval midgut, and found that wingless acts at two different thresholds to pattern this tissue. Low wingless levels are required to promote the development of copper cells, highly differentiated midgut cells of the larval midgut that are specified by the homeotic gene labial. High wingless levels repress copper cell development and allow differentiation of an alternative cell type, called large flat cells. These two developmental outcomes reflect labial expression, which is stimulated at low levels and repressed at high levels of wingless signalling. Thus, midgut cells respond differentially to distinct wingless thresholds in terms of both gene control and cellular differentiation. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3acell differentiation 3aanimal proteins 3acells 3amidgut 3alarvae 3amutants 3aembryogenesis 2aAnimals 2aCell Communication 2aCell Differentiation 2aDigestive Systemxcytologyxembryology. 2aDigestive System Abnormalities 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrosophilaxembryologyxgenetics. 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aHeat-Shock Response 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aInsect Hormonesxbiosynthesis 2aLarva 2aProto-Oncogene Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aWnt1 Protein 0awnt protein 0acopper cells1 aBienz, M.0 tEMBO journal.g1995 Oct. 16, v. 14, no. 20 p.5016-5026x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01940naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245003600122300001600158500012100174500001500295520081800310650002001128650000801148650001701156650002201173650003601195650000901231650002701240651001201267653001601279653002101295653001401316653002301330653001601353700001501369700002101384773007201405852000901477939003301486946001101519655001201530IND9304541220221121114331.0930802e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930454122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Y.10aDiterpenes from Croton lechleri  ap. 755-760.  aPart 2 in the series 'Biological and Chemical Investigation of Dragon's Blood from Croton species of South America.'  a2019-12-04  aThe chloroform extract of Croton lechleri sap was chemically examined, and the major constituents characterized by mass and NMR spectroscopy.

In noninoculated plants, there was no correlation between total activity of soluble or tonically bound beta-1,3-glucanase and peroxidase and the presence of the se gene or resistance to E. turcicum. Enhancement of enzyme activity in both peroxidase fractions was detected after inoculation regardless of the presence or absence of the se gene. A higher increase was detected in tonically bound fractions of beta-1,3-glucanase than in soluble fractions of the enzyme. Isozymes in leaves of the two cultivars were visualized in native polyacrylamide gels after staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. In noninoculated leaves, two bands (a,c) with low intensity were observed in maize line IL678asu, and one intense band (b) appeared in IL678ase. After inoculation of these genotypes with E. turcicum, an intensification of all bands was detected in extracts prepared from the inoculated leaves. The isozyme patterns of soluble peroxidase presented no clear relationship to the se gene. However in the tonically bound fractions of peroxidase, a specific isozyme (a) was visible in all lines having the se gene. A specific isozyme of beta-1,3-glucanase (b) was also detectable in the soluble fractions of all lines having the se gene. The same isozyme (b) was also detected in a line which lacked the se gene but possessed partial resistance to northern leaf blight (NLB). Our data suggest that the pattern of peroxidase and beta-1,3-glucanase isozymes, rather than the total enzyme activity, may be considered as a marker to identify resistance to E. turcicum in maize genotypes having the se gene. 3aZea mays 3agenetic resistance 3afungal diseases of plants 3abeta-glucanase 3agenes 3adisease resistance 3aSetosphaeria turcica 3agenotype 3aenzyme activity 3aisozymes 3aperoxidase 3ainfection 0alines1 aReuveni, R.1 aBar-zur, A.0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g1996, v. 18, no. 4 p.403-408x0706-06617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/070606696095005953Available from publisher's Web site  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdLJS  aNon-US 7aarticle02552naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002000168245011400188300001600302500002400318500001500342520099400357650001401351650002801365650001101393650001301404650001401417650001101431650002001442650002101462650001801483650001601501650001901517653001501536653001601551653001801567653001601585653001801601653001001619700002201629700001801651700002101669700002401690700002201714773009401736852000901830856009001839930003301929945002501962946001101987655001201998IND4428045420221121052008.0091104e20100315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442804542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.07.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ5051 aAllouche, Yosra10aInfluence of olive paste preparation conditions on virgin olive oil triterpenic compounds at laboratory-scale  ap. 765-769.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe influence of olive paste preparation conditions on the triterpenic content of virgin olive oils from Arbequina and Picual cultivars was investigated. For this purpose, three sieve diameters of the hammer mill (4, 5, and 6mm), two malaxation temperatures (20 and 30°C), and two malaxation times (20 and 40min) were tested. Results obtained showed that for Arbequina oils, a finer crushing level resulted in higher maslinic acid and erythrodiol content. Increasing malaxing temperature and time lead to a rise in both oleanolic and maslinic acid concentration, whereas erythrodiol content increased only for the longer malaxation time. For Picual oils, higher concentrations of oleanolic acid, maslinic acid, and uvaol were obtained by prolonging the paste malaxation time. A finer crushing level resulted also in an increase of maslinic acid content. These findings suggest that virgin olive oil triterpenic composition can be improved by regulating olive paste preparation conditions. 3acultivars 3afood processing quality 3amixing 3acrushing 3aolive oil 3aolives 3afood processing 3afood composition 3aOlea europaea 3atemperature 3aoleanolic acid 0amalaxation 0aerythrodiol 0amaslinic acid 0aolive paste 0atriterpenoids 0auvaol1 aJimenez, Antonio.1 aUceda, Marino1 aPaz Aguilera, M.1 aGaforio, José Juan1 aBeltrán, Gabriel0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Mar. 15, v. 119, no. 2 p.765-769dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.07.0313Available from publisher's Web site  a20091229b20100101c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/12/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03780naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245010700163300001800270500001500288520132100303650002001624650002201644650003601666650002101702650002201723650002701745650002101772650002001793650002201813650002301835650001901858650003401877650002101911650004301932650003701975650004802012650003002060650004102090650001902131650003902150650002002189650001402209650006202223650004402285650004302329650001802372650004002390650003102430650002802461650001902489650002402508650004902532650003702581650003802618653002302656653002302679653001602702700001402718700001502732700001202747700002102759700001802780700001602798700001802814700001302832773007502845852000902920930003302929945001302962946001102975655001202986IND2050919420221121042232.0960422e19951201enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205091942DNAL7 a88467692pmid7 aPMC3946942pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeffa, R.10aCholera toxin elevates pathogen resistance and induces pathogenesis-related gene expression in tobacco  ap. 5753-5761.  a2019-12-05  aIn animals, plants and fungi, cholera toxin (CTX) can activate signalling pathways dependent on heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins (G-proteins). We transformed tobacco plants with a chimeric gene encoding the A1 subunit of CTX regulated by a light-inducible wheat Cab-1 promoter. Tissues of transgenic plants expressing CTX showed greatly reduced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas tabaci, accumulated high levels of salicylic acid (SA) and constitutively expressed pathogenesis-related (PR) protein genes encoding PR-1 and the class II isoforms of PR-2 and PR-3. In contrast, the class I isoforms of PR-2 and PR-3 known to be induced in tobacco by stress, by ethylene treatment and as part of the hypersensitive response to infection, were not induced and displayed normal regulation. In good agreement with these results, microinjection experiments demonstrated that CTX or GTP-gamma-S induced the expression of a PR1-GUS reporter gene but not that of a GLB-GUS reporter gene containing the promoter region of a gene encoding the class I isoform of PR-2. Microinjection and grafting experiments strongly suggest that CTX-sensitive G-proteins are important in inducing the expression of a subset of PR genes and that these G-proteins act locally rather than systemically upstream of SA induction. 3aVibrio cholerae 3aprotein synthesis 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci 3astructural genes 3atransgenic plants 3aguanosine triphosphate 3abinding proteins 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3adisease resistance 3asalicylic acid 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3abacterial toxins 2aCholera Toxinxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aGenes, Reporterxgenetics 2aGuanosine Triphosphatexpharmacology 2aImmunoblotting 2aLight-Harvesting Protein Complexes 2aMicroinjections 2aPhenotype 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aPseudomonasxpathogenicity 2aSalicylatesxmetabolism 2aSalicylic Acid 2aSignal Transduction 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aTranscription, Geneticxgenetics 2aTransformation, Geneticxgenetics 0agenetic regulation 0apseudomonas tabaci 0aPseudomonas1 aSzell, M.1 aMeuwly, P.1 aPay, A.1 aVogeli-Lange, R.1 aMetraux, J.P.1 aNeuhaus, G.1 aMeins, F.

While the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc2 gene product also requires an activating phosphorylation, the enzyme responsible has not been identified. We have isolated an essential S. pombe gene, mop1, whose product is closely related to MO15 and to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kin28. The functional similarity of Mop1 and MO15 is reflected in the ability of MO15 to rescue a mop1 null allele. This suggests that Mop1 would be a CDK, and indeed Mop1 associates with a previously characterized cyclin H-related cyclin Mcs2 of S.pombe. Also, Mop1 and Mcs2 can associate with the heterologous partners human cyclin H and MO15, respectively. Moreover, the rescue of a temperature-sensitive mcs2 strain by expression of mop1+ demonstrates a genetic interaction between mop1 and mcs2. In a functional assay, immunoprecipitated Mop1-Mcs2 acts both as an RNA polymerase II CTD kinase and as a CAK. The CAK activity of Mop1-Mcs2 distinguishes it from the related CDK-cyclin pair Kin28-Ccl1 from S. cerevisiae, and supports the notion that Mop1-Mcs2 may represent a homolog of MO15-cyclin H in S. pombe with apparent dual roles as a RNA polymerase CTD kinase and as a CAK. 3aSaccharomycetales 3acomplementary DNA 3astructural genes 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphorylation 3aenzyme activity 3acyclins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCyclin H 2aCyclin-Dependent Kinasesxgenetics 2aCyclinsxgenetics 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aGenes, Fungal 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxgenetics. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSchizosaccharomycesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTransformation, Genetic 0aproteins 0ainteractions 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/l47353 0acyclin dependent kinase activating kinase 0amop1 gene1 aMakela, T.P.1 aCottarel, G.0 tEMBO journal.g1995 Dec. 15, v. 14, no. 24 p.6164-6172x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03561naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245010100163300001800264520140800282650002901690650002101719650002101740650002501761650002501786650002001811650001801831650001201849650002901861650002001890650002401910650001201934650001801946650003701964650002302001650002602024650003002050650003902080650001802119650003002137650003202167650002302199650002802222650001302250650005402263650002402317650005202341650003802393650003402431650003102465653002302496653001402519653002302533653002802556653003102584653001902615700001502634700001502649700001602664700001702680773007602697852000902773930003302782945001302815946001102828655001202839IND2050728820221121022800.0960410e19951215enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205072882DNAL7 a85570312pmid7 aPMC3947362pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProft, M.10aCAT5, a new gene necessary for derepression of gluconeogenic enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 6116-6126.  aPCK1 encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is transcriptionally regulated by two upstream activating elements. By screening for mutants that failed to derepress a UAS2(PCK1)-CYC1-lacZ reporter gene we isolated the new recessive derepression mutation cat5. The CAT5 gene encodes a protein of 272 amino acids showing a 42% identity to the ZC395.2 gene product of Caenorhabditis elegans whose function is unknown. Deletion of CAT5 caused a complete loss of glucose derepression affecting gluconeogenic key enzymes. Respiration, but not mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity, was also affected. CAT5 expression is 5- to 6-fold repressed by glucose, and CAT5 transcriptional activation was dependent on CAT1 (SNF1), CAT8 and CAT5 itself. The CAT5 gene is necessary for UAS1(PCK1) and UAS2PCK1 protein binding since a carbon source-specific interaction was no longer detectable in cat5 mutants. Glucose derepression of gluconeogenesis depends on the active Cat1 (Snf1) protein kinase and the Cat8 zinc cluster activator. Mig1p-independent overexpression of CAT8 did not stimulate activation of gluconeogenic promoters in cat1 and in cat5 mutants. Since Cat8p multicopy expression suppresses the ethanol growth deficiency in cat1 (snf1) mutants, these results indicate that activation of Cat8p by the Cat1p (Snf1p) kinase and the Cat5p protein might be necessary for release from glucose repression. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3astructural genes 3abinding proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aglucose 3atranscription (genetics) 3agluconeogenesis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCaenorhabditis elegansxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGluconeogenesisxgenetics 2aHelminth Proteinsxgenetics 2aModels, Biological 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPhosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (GTP)xgenetics 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscriptional Activation 0agenetic regulation 0acat5 gene 0aglucose repression 0amolecular sequence data 0atranscriptional regulation 0agenbank/x829301 aKotter, P.1 aHedges, D.1 aBojunga, N.1 aEntian, K.D.0 tEMBO journal.g1995 Dec. 15, v. 14, no. 24 p.6116-6126x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03584naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245013600145300001800281500001500299520149600314650001301810650001901823650001401842650001501856650002301871650001101894650001801905650001901923650001601942650002801958650001101986650001201997650001502009650001302024650001602037650002102053650002402074650001102098650001102109650002202120650000702142650001602149650001202165650002302177650000902200650001102209650001102220650001202231650003102243650001302274650001402287650001602301650002002317650003402337650002302371650001502394650001102409650001702420653001502437653001902452653001502471653001502486653002502501653000902526653001802535653001902553700002102572700002202593773008302615852000902698930003302707945001302740946001302753655001202766IND2328790120221120225637.0020903e200205  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232879012DNAL7 a120860522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaekawa, M.10aEffect of concentrate level and feeding management on chewing activities, saliva production, and ruminal pH of lactating dairy cows  ap. 1165-1175.  a2019-12-05  aEight ruminally cannulated lactating Holstein cows were used in a double 4 x 4 Latin square to determine the effects of 1) proportion of barley silage [40, 50, and 60% of dry matter (DM)] in the diet, and 2) feeding a total mixed ration (TMR) compared with separate ingredients (SI) on chewing activities, saliva production, and ruminal pH. Although cows fed SI were offered a diet containing 50% silage, they actually consumed a diet containing 43% silage (DM basis). Dry matter intake and milk yield were similar for all diets (18.2 kg of DM/d and 27.2 kg/d, respectively). Cows fed the 40% silage TMR spent more time eating than cows fed SI (243 vs. 198 min/d), but rumination time was similar (546 min/d). Eating time was similar among the TMR diets, but rumination time increased from 498 to 516 and 584 min/d as silage in the TMR increased from 40 to 50, and then to 60%, respectively. The secretion of saliva per gram of feed was 4.43, 3.18, and 1.19 ml/g of DM with consumption of silage, TMR, and concentrate, respectively. Resting salivation rate was similar for all diets (101 ml/min). Regardless of the diet, cows secreted 239 +/- 17 L/d of saliva, and ruminal pH was below 5.8 for 10 h/d. Results indicated increased chewing time did not increase total daily saliva secretion because increased eating and ruminating saliva was associated with decreased resting saliva. Feeding SI increased the risk of acidosis, because cows ate a higher proportion of concentrate than intended. 3aacidosis 3amilk fat yield 3aingestion 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3abarley 3afiber content 3apelleted feeds 3aingredients 3amilk protein percentage 3aweight 3alactose 3asalivation 3aduration 3afeed intake 3afeeding behavior 3amilk fat percentage 3asaliva 3avolume 3adiurnal variation 3apH 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDiet 2aEating 2aFemale 2aHordeum 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aLactation 2aMastication 2aMilkxchemistry 2aRumenxchemistryxphysiology. 2aSalivaxmetabolism 2aSalivation 2aSilage 2aTime Factors 0adry matter 0arumen contents 0athroughput 0amilk yield 0achemical composition 0adiet 0abarley silage 0acomplete feeds1 aBeauchemin, K.A.1 aChristensen, D.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 May, v. 85, no. 5 p.1165-1175x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle04301naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100003100182245010000213300001600313500002400329500001500353520186600368650002502234650002802259650002002287650001402307650001802321650001902339650001902358650002102377650001902398650002102417650002102438650001102459650002902470650000902499650001802508650000902526650002502535650002102560650002502581650001202606650002202618650001702640650001102657650005202668650005902720650006602779650002002845650002702865650002802892650000902920650000902929650002502938650003102963650006802994650001703062650000903079650001003088651001203098653002403110653002503134653004603159700002703205773010003232852000903332856008503341930003303426945002503459946001103484655001203495IND4428053620221120194614.0091104e20091112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442805362DNAL7 a197035402pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2009.08.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aOsadebe, Patience Ogoamaka10aComparative acute toxicities and immunomodulatory potentials of five Eastern Nigeria mistletoes  ap. 287-293.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEthnopharmacological relevance: Traditionally, mistletoes of Eastern Nigeria origin, Loranthus micranthus Linn. have been used as immunostimulant for the management of certain diseases with high profile immune depleting potentials. This practice has remained till date without scientific validation. Aim of study: To obtain and validate evidence for or against its continued use as immunostimulant and afford data for further studies on this specie of mistletoe. The present work is an in vivo proof of ethnopharmacological concept of the age long immunomodulatory use of our local mistletoe. Materials and methods: Aqueous-methanol extracts of the plant leaves from five different host trees were evaluated for immunomodulatory activity using four in vivo models in mice or rats, namely; total and differential leukocyte count (TLC and DLC), the cellular mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (DTHR) test, the humoral mediated antibody titration (AT) test and the cyclophosphamide-induced myelosuppression (CIM) test at different dose levels (100, 200 and 400 or 50, 100 and 250mgkg⁻¹; depending on model) against standard controls. Phytochemical and acute toxicity tests were equally carried out on all the extracts. Results: Results obtained indicate that all the mistletoes contained the same phytochemical constituents, although in varying amounts. The mistletoes exhibited statistically significantly different (p <0.05 or p <0.001, ANOVA) immunomodulatory (up-regulatory) activities in the overall order of that from Kola acuminata > Citrus spp > Persia americana > Parkia biglobosa > Pentaclatra macrophylla. LD₅₀ values were generally greater than 5000mg/kg. Conclusion: The present study confirms the Eastern Nigeria mistletoe as a potent and safe alternative or complementary medicine for the management of immunodeficiency diseases. 3atraditional medicine 3ainterspecific variation 3aleukocyte count 3aLoranthus 3adose response 3aacute toxicity 3alethal dose 50 3ahumoral immunity 3aphytochemicals 3aimmunomodulators 3amedicinal plants 3adosage 3adelayed hypersensitivity 3amice 3aanimal models 3arats 3amedicinal properties 3aherbal medicines 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aAntibodiesxblood 2aErythrocytes 2aFemale 2aHypersensitivity, Delayedxbloodxdrug therapy. 2aImmunologic Deficiency Syndromesxbloodxdrug therapy. 2aImmunologic Factorsxanalysisxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aLeukocyte Count 2aLeukocytesxmetabolism 2aLoranthaceaexchemistry 2aMale 2aMice 2aMistletoexchemistry 2aMyelopoiesisxdrug effects 2aPlant Extractsxadverse effectsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aPlant Leaves 2aRats 2aSheep 3aNigeria 0aspecies differences 0aLoranthus micranthus 0acyclophosphamide-induced myelosuppression1 aOmeje, Edwin Ogechukwu0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2009 Nov. 12, v. 126, no. 2 p.287-293dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2009.08.0243Available from publisher's Web site  a20091229b20100101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/11/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02809naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245014300178300001600321500022600337520127000563650003401833650001901867650002501886650001701911650001501928650000901943650001501952650001801967650002501985650001002010650001102020650001802031650001502049700001802064700002102082700002002103700001502123700002802138773014502166856005502311852000902366655001202375IND60599321820181016000000.0180702e20180425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059932182DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1198.402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraujo, Y.

It is a widely consumed product due to its important antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The main aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics, along with total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidant activity in fresh bee pollen, dried bee pollen (dried by oven and lyophilization process) and in the bee pollen powder (residue left after drying in oven). The results indicate that bee pollen was within the requirements of the Brazilian legislation, with the exception of moisture content which may be due to the rainy season while collecting. The oven dried and lyophilized bee pollens showed higher antioxidant activity (69.77 and 71.06%, respectively) capable of reducing the DPPH radical. The results of dried bee pollen were not statistically (p<0.05) different from the bee pollen powder in most of these tests. Microbiological analysis showed that the fresh bee pollen should not be consumed before proper treatment.

Aim of the study: We investigated the effects of URH on 6-hydroxydapamine (6-OHDA)-induced neurotoxicity in in vitro and in vivo models of PD. Materials and methods: The cell viability, anti-oxidative activity, and anti-apoptotic activity of a water extract of URH (URE) were assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide, reactive oxygen species (ROS), total glutathione (GSH), and caspase-3 assays in PC12 cells stressed by 6-OHDA. We also investigated the behavioral recovery and dopaminergic neuron protection of URE using an apomorphine-induced rotation test and tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry in the hemi-parkinsonian rat model of the unilateral 6-OHDA lesion of the medial forebrain bundle. Results: In PC12 cells, URE significantly reduced cell death and the generation of ROS, increased GSH levels, and inhibited caspase-3 activity induced by 6-OHDA. In 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, posttreatment with URE (5mg/kg/day for 14 days) significantly reduced apomorphine-induced rotation, and it lowered dopaminergic neuronal loss in substantia nigra pars compacta. Conclusions: URE possesses neuroprotective activity against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity through anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic activities in PD models. 3ain vivo studies 3adopamine 3aanimal behavior 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aoxidative stress 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aapoptosis 3aherbal medicines 3aneurotoxicity 3aneurons 3ain vitro studies 3arats 3aantioxidant activity 3aneuroprotective effect 3aviability 3aUncaria rhynchophylla 3acultured cells 3aanimal models 3aParkinson disease 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolismxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCaspase 3xmetabolism 2aCell Line 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aMale 2aNeuronsxdrug effects 2aNeuroprotective Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aOxidopamine 2aParkinson Diseasexdrug therapyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Structures 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSubstantia Nigraxdrug effects 2aUncaria 0amedicinal properties1 aKim, Hyo Geun1 aJu, Mi Sun1 aChoi, Jin Gyu1 aJeong, Seo Young1 aOh, Myung-sook.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2009 Nov. 12, v. 126, no. 2 p.361-365dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2009.08.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20091229b20100101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/11/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03327naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245009200145300001800237520158500255650001201840650002001852650000901872650002501881650003001906650001301936650002301949650001601972650002001988650001602008650001202024650002502036650002802061650002302089650003002112650003002142650006602172650001702238650002202255650006702277650002402344650003402368650004702402650006702449651001002516653001702526700001802543700001402561700002202575773008402597852000902681930003302690945001302723946001302736655001202749IND2328659220221120102924.0020823e200206  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232865922DNAL7 a121464692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaruzzi, F.10aMicrobial community dynamics during the Scamorza Altamurana cheese natural fermentation  ap. 1390-1397.  aThe growth dynamics of the natural microbial community responsible for the fermentation of Scamorza Altamurana, a typical Southern Italian cheese made using backslopping, was investigated applying a polyphasic approach combining 1) microbial enumeration with culture media, 2) randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting of microbial communities, 3) sequencing of partial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes, and 4) physiological tests. Viable cell counts on different culture media showed that the cocci community prevailed during the 18 h of curd fermentation and the 6 d of cheese ripening. RAPD fingerprinting made it possible to isolate 25 different strains identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as belonging to five species of Lactobacillus, three species of Streptococcus, one species of Weissella, and one species of Enterococcus. The physiological analyses of all lactic acid bacteria strains revealed that the isolates belonging to Streptococcus genus were the most acidifying, whereas lactobacilli were most proteolytic. Streptococcus thermophilus C48W and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus B15Z dominated all through the fermentation process. Furthermore, they seemed to be stable in a subsequent whey sample analyzed after 7 mo. The recovery of strains endowed with interesting technological features, such as acidifying and proteolytic activities, and surviving in natural whey could allow the upscaling of cheese processing safeguarding the organoleptic characteristics of Scamorza Altamurana and could possibly improve other fermented dairy products. 3acheeses 3acheese starters 3awhey 3alactic acid bacteria 3apolymerase chain reaction 3abiotypes 3astrain differences 3aproteolysis 3acheese ripening 3aplate count 2aAnimals 2aCheesexmicrobiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistry 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistry 2aEnterococcusxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aFermentation 2aFood Microbiology 2aLactobacillusxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique 2aStreptococcusxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 3aItaly 0abackslopping1 aMatarante, A.1 aMorea, M.1 aCocconcelli, P.S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2002 June, v. 85, no. 6 p.1390-1397x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02399naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245014600172300001600318500001900334520102900353592002801382650001501410650002001425650002101445650001801466650002901484650002201513650001201535653002501547653001601572653002401588653001701612700002201629700002401651700001901675700002201694700001401716700001901730773008901749856008301838990002301921852000901944655001201953IND60697512420221120061521.0200605e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069751242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2016.09.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnacker, Daniel C.10aHPV31 utilizes the ATR-Chk1 pathway to maintain elevated RRM2 levels and a replication-competent environment in differentiating Keratinocytes  ap. 383-396.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aProductive replication of human papillomaviruses (HPV) is restricted to the uppermost layers of the differentiating epithelia. How HPV ensures an adequate supply of cellular substrates for viral DNA synthesis in a differentiating environment is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that HPV31 positive cells exhibit increased dNTP pools and levels of RRM2, a component of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) complex, which is required for de novo synthesis of dNTPs. RRM2 depletion blocks productive replication, suggesting RRM2 provides dNTPs for viral DNA synthesis in differentiating cells. We demonstrate that HPV31 regulates RRM2 levels through expression of E7 and activation of the ATR-Chk1-E2F1 DNA damage response, which is essential to combat replication stress upon entry into S-phase, as well as for productive replication. Our findings suggest a novel way in which viral DNA synthesis is regulated through activation of ATR and Chk1 and highlight an intriguing new virus/host interaction utilized for viral replication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA replication 3aPapillomaviridae 3akeratinocytes 3aribonucleotide reductase 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0aHuman papillomavirus 0aReplication 0aDNA damage response 0aPathogenesis1 aAloor, Heather L.1 aShepard, Caitlin N.1 aLenzi, Gina M.1 aJohnson, Bryan A.1 aKim, Baek1 aMoody, Cary A.0 tVirology.g2016 Dec., v. 499 p.383-396dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.09.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01507naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245008900165300001800254520048500272592002800757650002300785650002300808650001700831650001500848650002200863650002200885650002200907700001800929700002500947773011900972856008101091852000901172655001201181IND60576392220221119013720.0170804e20170721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057639222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b011152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Debobrata10aTotal Synthesis of Pestalotioprolide G and Putative Structure of Pestalotioprolide H  ap. 7437-7445.  aA concise and convergent route for the stereoselective total synthesis of cytotoxic macrolides pestalotioprolides G and H has been developed for the first time.

High-performance liquid chromatography was used to identify and quantify the active ingredients in the drugs (penicillin G, levamisole, oxytetracycline, diminazene diaceturate, vitamin A, and vitamin E acetate) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry to determine if organic chemical contaminants were present. The results showed that 69% of surveyed pastoralists used veterinary medicines to treat common illnesses. In addition, the most commonly used medications (procaine penicillin G and oxytetracycline) were used in a manner inconsistent with the recommended dosage, frequency, duration, and withdrawal period by 98% of the pastoralists. However, contrary to previous studies, the quality of the medications used by pastoralists was generally good. The poor compliance with recommended treatment protocols was much more prevalent than use of poor quality medications and presents a potential for treatment failure, drug resistance of animal pathogens, and harmful drug residues in the human food supply, all of which have potentially negative consequences for animal and human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aactive ingredients 3aanimal and human health 3abenzylpenicillin 3acattle 3acompliance 3adiminazene 3adrug residues 3adrug resistance 3afood availability 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aherds 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alevamisole 3aoxytetracycline 3apastoralism 3aprocaine 3aveterinary drugs 3avitamin A 3avitamin E 3aCameroon1 aTomdieu, Tiédja1 aZiébé, Roland1 aFoyet, HarquinSimplice1 aMoritz, Mark1 aVondou, Lazare1 aSchrunk, DwayneE.1 aImerman, PaulaM.1 aRumbeiha, WilsonK.1 aGarabed, RebeccaB.0 tPastoralism.g2017 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.6-6dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2262x2041-71367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13570-017-0081-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245011000177500001900287520164800306592002801954650002001982650001702002650001502019650001802034650001802052650001102070650001902081650001002100653002302110653000902133653002302142653003002165653004102195653001902236700001302255700002002268773010802288856008802396852000902484655001202493IND60696070120221119034234.0200614e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069607012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.1036142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReuschen, Sebastian10aBayesian inversion of hierarchical geostatistical models using a parallel-tempering sequential Gibbs MCMC  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe feasibility of probabilistic Bayesian inversion strongly depends on the dimensionality and complexity of the statistical prior model. Most geostatistical inversion approaches assume multi-Gaussian fields, and some assume (non-Gaussian) categorical fields, e.g., via multiple-point geostatistics. We combine these two into one hierarchical joint problem, which accounts for two (and possibly more) categories as well as heterogeneities inside each category. Recent works developed the conditional probability field method based on the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKf) for this scenario. However, EnKf-type approaches take implicit linearity and (trans-)Gaussian assumptions, which are not feasible in weak-information regimes. Therefore, we develop a tailored Gibbs sampler, a kind of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. It can do this inversion without assumptions. Our algorithm extends an existing Gibbs sampler with parallel tempering for categorical fields to account for multi-Gaussian internal heterogeneity. We show our key idea and derive our algorithm from the detailed balance, required for MCMC algorithms. We test our algorithm on a synthetic channelized flow scenario for different levels of data available: A highly informative setting (transient flow data) where the synthetic truth can be recovered and a weakly informative setting (steady-state data only) where the synthetic truth cannot be recovered. Instead, we obtain a multi-modal posterior. For the proper testing of convergence, we use the scale reduction factor by Gelman and Rubin. Overall, the test illustrates that our algorithm performs well in both settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3aalgorithms 3afield methods 3ageostatistics 3amodels 3atransient flow 3awater 0aBayesian inversion 0aMCMC 0aParallel tempering 0aMultiple-point statistics 0aSequential geostatistical resampling 0aTraining image1 aXu, Teng1 aNowak, Wolfgang0 tAdvances in water resources.g2020 July, v. 141 p.103614-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.1036143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024003000121040001800151100001700169245009800186300001600284500002000300506002800320506003000348520193300378592002802311596004502339506003702384650002002421650002302441650001002464650001602474650001202490650001302502650001702515650001002532650001802542650002102560650002802581650001902609650001002628650001502638650000902653650002402662650001202686650001902698650001702717650002602734700001702760700001602777700002002793700001702813773013102830856007302961903002203034852000903056655001203065IND60571744720221207051255.0170712e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057174472DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.126232doi7 a10.1111/lam.126232chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarlow, B.E.10aDegradation of spent craft brewer's yeast by caprine rumen hyper ammonia‐producing bacteria  ap. 307-312.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aSpent yeast from craft beers often includes more hops (Humulus lupulus L.) secondary metabolites than traditional recipes. These compounds include α‐ and β‐ acids, which are antimicrobial to the rumen hyper ammonia‐producing bacteria (HAB) that are major contributors to amino acid degradation. The objective was to determine if the hops acids in spent craft brewer's yeast (CY; ~ 3·5 mg g⁻¹ hops acids) would protect it from degradation by caprine rumen bacteria and HAB when compared to a baker's yeast (BY; no hops acids). Cell suspensions were prepared by harvesting rumen fluid from fistulated goats, straining and differential centrifugation. The cells were re‐suspended in media with BY or CY. After 24 h (39°C), HAB were enumerated and ammonia was measured. Fewer HAB and less ammonia was produced from CY than from BY. Pure culture experiments were conducted with Peptostreptococcus anaerobiusBG1 (caprine HAB). Ammonia production by BG1 from BY was greater than from CY. Ammonia production was greater when exogenous amino acids were included, but similar inhibition was observed in CY treatments. These results indicate that rumen micro‐organisms deaminated the amino acids in CY to a lesser degree than BY. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Spent brewer's yeast has long been included in ruminant diets as a protein supplement. However, modern craft beers often include more hops (Humulus lupulus L.) than traditional recipes. These compounds include α‐ and β‐ acids, which are antimicrobial to the rumen hyper ammonia‐producing bacteria (HAB) that are major contributors to amino acid degradation. This study demonstrated that hops acids in spent craft brewer's yeast protected protein from destruction by HABin vitro. These results suggest that the spent yeast from craft breweries, a source of beneficial hops secondary metabolites, could have value as rumen‐protected protein.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHumulus lupulus 3aPeptostreptococcus 3aacids 3aamino acids 3aammonia 3abacteria 3abakers yeast 3abeers 3abrewers yeast 3abrewing industry 3acell suspension culture 3acentrifugation 3agoats 3aharvesting 3ahops 3aprotein supplements 3arecipes 3arumen bacteria 3arumen fluids 3asecondary metabolites1 aBryant, R.W.1 aCohen, S.D.1 aO'Connell, S.P.1 aFlythe, M.D.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2016 Oct., v. 63, no. 4 p.307-312dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.126233Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010800155300001800263520160300281592002801884650000801912650002201920650001301942650001001955650002001965650001201985650002401997650003002021650003002051650001602081650001102097650001502108700001702123700001802140700001902158700002502177700001802202700002002220700001902240700002302259700002002282700001902302700002002321773012802341856007302469852000902542655001202551IND60529572420221120094511.0160717e20130205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052957242DNAL7 a10.1021/ac303426b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Linan10aDirect Detection of Bacterial Genomic DNA at Sub-Femtomolar Concentrations Using Single Molecule Arrays  ap. 1932-1939.  aWe report a method for the sensitive measurement of genomic DNA based on the direct detection of single molecules of DNA in arrays of femtoliter wells. The method begins by generating short fragments of DNA from large, double-stranded molecules of genomic DNA using either restriction enzymes or sonication. Single-stranded fragments are then generated by melting the duplex, and these fragments are hybridized to complementary biotinylated detection probes and capture probes on paramagnetic beads. The resulting DNA complexes are then labeled with an enzyme (streptavidin-β-galactosidase), and single enzymes associated with these complexes on beads are detected in single molecule arrays (Simoa). DNA concentration is quantified by determining the average number of enzymes per bead via Poisson statistics (digital) or the average bead intensity (analog). The Simoa DNA assay was used to detect genomic DNA purified from S. aureus with an average limit of detection (LOD) of 0.07 fM, or 2100 DNA molecules per 50 μL sample. We used this assay to detect S. aureus spiked into (a) whole blood, with an average LOD of 1100 bacteria per 25 μL sample (0.074 fM), and (b) water from the Charles River, with an LOD of 1300 bacteria per 50 μL sample (0.042 fM). Bacteria were detected in river water without prior purification of DNA. The Simoa DNA assay, which directly detects target DNA molecules without molecular replication, is an attractive alternative to existing sensitive DNA detection technologies that rely on amplification using polymerases, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3abacteria 3ablood 3adetection limit 3amelting 3amicrobial detection 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3ariver water 3arivers 3astatistics1 aShan, Dandan1 aZhao, Mingwei1 aPink, Brian A.1 aMinnehan, Kaitlin A.1 aYork, Lyndsey1 aGardel, Melissa1 aSullivan, Sean1 aPhillips, Aaron F.1 aHayman, Ryan B.1 aWalt, David R.1 aDuffy, David C.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 Feb. 05, v. 85, no. 3 p.1932-1939dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac303426b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02005naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011300156300002000269520094200289592002801231650001601259650001401275650001401289650002301303650001201326650002201338650002101360700001901381700001801400700001401418700001801432773012101450856007501571852000901646655001201655IND60550294620221116145750.0160910e20141107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055029462DNAL7 a10.1021/jo501989x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Lu-Jia10aOrganocatalytic Arylation of 3-Indolylmethanols via Chemo- and Regiospecific C6-Functionalization of Indoles  ap. 10390-10398.  aAn organocatalytic arylation of 3-indolylmethanols has been established via chemo- and regiospecific C6-functionalization of 2,3-disubstituted indoles, leading to the production of bisindolyloxindoles containing an all-carbon quaternary stereocenter in high yields (up to 99% yield). This reaction not only represents the first catalytic arylation of 3-indolylmethanols using 2,3-disubstituted indoles as aromatic nucleophiles but also serves as a good example of direct catalytic C6-functionalization of indoles, which have been scarcely investigated. Besides, this approach also provides an efficient method to access a biologically important 3,3′-disubstituted oxindole framework and a 3′,6-linked bisindole skeleton. Furthermore, the investigation of the activation mode suggested that the dual activation of an ion pair and H-bond between the substrates and the catalyst cooperatively contributed to the success of the reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aarylation 3acatalysts 3achemical structure 3aindoles 3aorganic chemistry 3aregioselectivity1 aZhang, Yu-Chen1 aZhao, Jia-Jia1 aShi, Feng1 aTu, Shu-Jiang0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2014 Nov. 07, v. 79, no. 21 p.10390-10398dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo501989x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024003700134040001800171100002800189245012400217300001600341506002800357506003600385506007600421506003100497520108600528592002801614596007001642596004501712596004401757596006601801506003701867650001401904650002501918650001101943650002001954650002701974650002702001650002002028650001602048650002302064650002802087650004402115650001302159653000902172653001702181653003702198653002302235700002302258700002102281700002202302700002202324700003002346700002302376700002602399773008902425856008402514903002202598990002302620852000902643655001202652IND60697512520221207080219.0200605e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069751252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2016.09.0272chorus7 a10.1016/j.virol.2016.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiaz-San Segundo, Fayna10aCombination of Adt-O1Manisa and Ad5-boIFNλ3 induces early protective immunity against foot-and-mouth disease in cattle  ap. 340-349.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aFoot-and-mouth-disease (FMD) remains the most infectious livestock disease worldwide. Although commercially available inactivated or adenovirus-vectored-vaccines (Ad5-FMD) are effective, they require 5–7 days to induce protection. Therefore, new control strategies that stimulate rapid immune responses are needed. Expression of bovine interferon λ3 using the Ad5-vector platform (Ad5-boIFNλ3) is able to delay disease in cattle, but clinical signs appear at 9 days after challenge. We hypothesized that combination of Ad5-boIFNλ3 and Ad5-FMD could induce immediate and lasting protection against FMD. Cattle were vaccinated with an Ad5-FMD, Ad5-boIFNλ3, or the combination of both, followed by challenge at three days post-immunization. All animals treated with Ad5-FMD combined with Ad5-boIFNλ3 were fully protected against FMD, despite the absence of systemic neutralizing antibodies or antiviral activity at the time of challenge. Induction of a strong cell-mediated immune response suggested that Ad5-boIFNλ3 is able to act as an adjuvant of Ad5-FMD vaccine in cattle.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cDHSdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000180  cUniversity of Connecticutdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000077100 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadjuvants 3aantiviral properties 3acattle 3acattle diseases 3acell-mediated immunity 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3aimmune response 3ainterferons 3alivestock diseases 3aneutralizing antibodies 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3avaccines 0aFMDV 0aAd5-boIFNλ3 0aEarly protection adjuvant effect 0aAd5-vector vaccine1 aMontiel, Nestor A.1 aSturza, Diego F.1 aPerez-Martin, Eva1 aHickman, Danielle1 aRamirez-Medina, Elizabeth1 aGrubman, Marvin J.1 ade los Santos, Teresa0 tVirology.g2016 Dec., v. 499 p.340-349dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.09.0273Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012100168520115200289592002801441650001501469650002601484650001301510650001401523650004301537650001101580650002801591700002301619700001801642700001901660700002401679773012301703856008201826852000901908655001201917IND60768471020221121064811.0220225e20220209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076847102DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110202292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScholtz, Beáta 10aSalivary miR-31-5p, miR-345-3p, and miR-424-3p Are Reliable Biomarkers in Patients with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma  aIf not detected early, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has very poor prognosis, emphasizing the need for reliable early diagnostics. Saliva is considered a promising surrogate biosample for OSCC detection, because it comes into contact with many cells of the tumor mass, providing a comprehensive sampling of tumor-specific biomolecules. Although several protein- and RNA-based salivary biomarkers have been proposed for the detection of OSCC, the results of the studies show large differences. Our goal was to clarify which salivary microRNAs (miRNA) show reliably high expression in the saliva of OSCC patients, to be used as cancer-specific biomarkers, and potentially as early diagnostic biomarkers. Based on a detailed literature search, we selected six miRNAs commonly overexpressed in OSCC, and analyzed their expression in saliva samples of cancer patients and controls by real-time quantitative PCR. Our results suggest that miR-345 and miR-31-5p are consistently upregulated salivary biomarkers for OSCC, and a three-miRNA panel of miR-345, miR-31-5p, and miR-424-3p can distinguish cancer and control patients with high sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3adiagnostic techniques 3amicroRNA 3aprognosis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asaliva 3asquamous cell carcinoma1 aHorváth, József,1 aTar, Ildikó,1 aKiss, Csongor 1 aMárton, Ildikó J.0 tPathogens.g2022 Feb. 09, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110202293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014000163300001600303520127500319592002801594650001801622650001701640650001401657650001801671650001901689650001301708650001201721650002801733650001201761650002201773650002501795650004301820650002101863650000901884650001201893700002101905700001901926700001601945700001701961700001501978700001701993773012802010856008202138852000902220655001202229IND60089470520221119145520.0141102e20111022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008947052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Esder10aAntioxidant treatment may protect pancreatic beta cells through the attenuation of islet fibrosis in an animal model of type 2 diabetes  ap. 397-402.  aIslet fibrosis could be important in the progression of pancreatic beta cell failure in type 2 diabetes. It is known that oxidative stress is involved in the pancreatic fibrosis through the activation of pancreatic stellate cells. However, no study has investigated the in vivo effects of antioxidants on islet fibrogenesis in type 2 diabetes. In this study, antioxidants (taurine or tempol) were administered in drinking water to Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats, an animal model of type 2 diabetes, for 16weeks. An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test revealed that the blood glucose levels after the glucose injection were decreased by the antioxidants. The insulin secretion after the glucose injection, which was markedly reduced in the rats, was also restored by the antioxidants. Beta cell mass and pancreatic insulin content were greater in the rats treated with the antioxidants than in the untreated rats. Beta cell apoptosis was attenuated in the rats by the antioxidants. Finally, islet fibrosis and the activation of pancreatic stellate cells were markedly diminished in the rats by the antioxidants. Our data suggest that antioxidants may protect beta cells through the attenuation of both islet fibrosis and beta cell apoptosis in type 2 diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3ablood glucose 3adrinking water 3afibrosis 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance tests 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3aislets of Langerhans 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3ataurine1 aRyu, Gyeong Ryul1 aKo, Seung-Hyun1 aAhn, Yu-Bae1 aYoon, Kun-Ho1 aHa, Hunjoo1 aSong, Ki-ho,0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 Oct. 22, v. 414, no. 2 p.397-402dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245009700190300001800287520151700305592002801822650001301850650000901863650002501872650002101897650001301918650002001931650000901951650001101960650001401971650000701985650001001992650002002002650004602022650003102068650001102099650002402110650003502134650004102169650003202210650001302242651001902255651001802274773013602292856004802428852000902476655001202485IND50069973520221119204855.0131018e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006997352DNAL7 a236365922pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-013-1737-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSapsford, Devin J.,10aNew perspectives on the passive treatment of ferruginous circumneutral mine waters in the UK  ap. 7827-7836.  aThis paper examines major physico-chemical processes during the passive treatment of ferruginous circumneutral drainage from abandoned coal mines in the UK. Data collected over several years of studies on mine water treatment systems shed new light on the relative importance of hydraulics, settling velocity, Fe(II) oxidation rates and cascade aeration, which, in turn, informs the design of future systems. This paper demonstrates that (1) the complex settling behaviour of Fe(III) precipitates may be described by a first-order volumetric process and that settling rate is different for different mine waters; (2) the hydraulic efficiency (ratio of time to peak tracer concentration to nominal residence time) of the settling ponds studied was widely variable at low flow rates in comparison to constructed wetlands; (3) aeration cascades contribute dissolved oxygen and lead to a rise in pH due to CO₂ degassing, which are very important in reducing the required time for iron oxidation and removal; (4) for at least 10 of the 30 sites examined, modelling of the rates of Fe(II) oxidation and particulate settling reveals that removal of iron is primarily dependent on settling rate; and (5) that substantial increases in pH can be brought about by forced aeration of mine water over several hours. Findings of this study apply to the majority of coal mine water treatment sites in the UK and may have broader application to other ferruginous waters with circumneutral pH or after treatment to increase pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3acoal 3aconstructed wetlands 3adissolved oxygen 3adrainage 3afluid mechanics 3airon 3amodels 3aoxidation 3apH 3aponds 3awater treatment 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediation 2aFerric Compoundsxanalysis 2aMining 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Purificationxmethods 2aWetlands 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 Nov., v. 20, no. 11 p.7827-7836dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-1737-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012400169300001800293520112700311592002801438596005101466596004701517650002001564650001501584650001001599650002501609650001601634650001301650700004101663700002501704700002101729700001801750700001901768700002101787700006801808773013801876856008302014852000902097655001202106IND60781793520221119100127.0220703e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078179352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-022-01906-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJavadmanesh, Ali10aMS-HRM protocol: a simple and low-cost approach for technical validation of next-generation methylation sequencing data  ap. 1101-1109.  aDNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic process and have a critical role in many biological processes. The study of DNA methylation at a large scale of genomic levels is widely conducted by several techniques that are next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based methods. Methylome data revealed by DNA methylation next-generation sequencing (mNGS), should be always verified by another technique which they usually have a high cost. In this study, we offered a low-cost approach to corroborate the mNGS data. In this regard, mNGS was performed on 6 colorectal cancer (case group) and 6 healthy individual colon tissue (control group) samples. An R-script detected differentially methylated regions (DMRs), was further validated by high resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis. After analyzing the data, the algorithm found 194 DMRs. Two locations with the highest level of methylation difference were verified by MS-HRM, which their results were in accordance with the mNGS. Therefore, in the present study, we suggested MS-HRM as a simple, accurate and low-cost method, useful for confirming methylation sequencing results.  aPublisher supplied data  a961906cMashhad University of Medical Sciences  a93048371cIran National Science Foundation 3aDNA methylation 3aalgorithms 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aepigenetics 3agenomics1 aMojtabanezhad Shariatpanahi, Afsaneh1 aShams Davodly, Ehsan1 aAzghandi, Marjan1 aYassi, Maryam1 aHeidari, Mehdi1 aKerachian, Matin1 aKerachian, Mohammad Amin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5016-28820 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2022 July, v. 297, no. 4 p.1101-1109dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl69781x1617-46157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-022-01906-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01687naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009600162300001600258520081800274592002801092650001101120650002401131650001201155651001001167700001801177700001701195773009501212856008101307852000901388655001201397IND60549088420221119210507.0160906e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054908842DNAL7 a10.1007/s40003-016-0214-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Qiong10aMarketing Capabilities Drive Competitive Advantages: Evidence from China’s Agribusinesses  ap. 305-315.  aAgribusinesses must develop key marketing capabilities to achieve and sustain competitive advantages with the fast changes in customer demand and the complex natures in agricultural production. This study examines how six specialized marketing capabilities affect different types of competitive advantages and their relationship-influenced contingencies in China’s agribusinesses. A survey of 268 agribusinesses indicates that product development capability is an important driver of cost and product advantages; brand management capability is positively related to product and service advantages; both selling capability and pricing capability have proposed effects on service advantage. The achievement of service advantage, derived from brand management and pricing capabilities, is contingent on ownerships.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprices 3aproduct development 3asurveys 3aChina1 aGong, Shiyuan1 aWei, Haiying0 tAgricultural research.g2016 Sept., v. 5, no. 3 p.305-315dSpringer Indiax2249-720X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40003-016-0214-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100002400164245006900188300001400257520100600271592002801277650001301305650002401318650001701342650002301359650001001382650001601392650000901408650001501417650003101432650001101463650001101474650000901485650001601494650003101510650002501541650002301566650001401589650002701603651001301630700002901643700002301672700002201695700002301717700002001740700002501760773011001785852000901895856008301904655001201987IND2037870820221119141742.0181206e199402  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203787082DNAL7 a81377012pmid7 a10.1177/0145721794020001062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Robert M.10aEvaluation of an Activated Patient Diabetes Education Newsletter  ap. 29-34.  aThis study evaluated a monthly; activated patient newsletter sent to over 7000 patients in Michigan with diabetes. The newsletter provided concise and action-oriented information about diabetes care. Patients who had signed up to receive the newsletter during the first 4 months of the project (1863) were surveyed to determine how many patients found the newsletter helpful; 80% (1498) of the patients replied. Patients who found the newsletter most helpful were older, had lower incomes, and reported more corrtplications, less understanding of diabetes, and being in poorer overall health. They also were more likely to have non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) than insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). We concluded that the activated patient newsletter is a useful public health/patient education intervention for persons with diabetes. Such a newsletter should be part of a coordinated system of ongoing patient care, education, screening, and social and psychological support.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes 3anutrition education 3apatient care 3aprogram evaluation 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aDemography 2aDiabetes Mellitusxtherapy 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPatient Education as Topic 2aPeriodicals as Topic 2aProgram Evaluation 2aSelf Care 2aSocioeconomic Factors. 3aMichigan1 aFitzgerald, James Thomas1 aFunnell, Martha M.1 aBarr, Patricia A.1 aStepien, Cathie J.1 aHiss, Roland G.1 aArmbruster, Betty A.0 tDiabetes educator.g1994 Feb., v. 20, no. 1 p.29-34dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x0145-72177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0145721794020001063Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03483naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012500167300001600292520184700308592002802155596006702183596006402250650002002314650001902334650001602353650001302369650001602382650002002398650002702418650002802445650003602473650002202509650002302531650002402554650002102578650000702599650001602606650001302622650002502635650001602660700001602676700002002692700005802712773012802770856008202898852000902980655001202989IND60687056420221120025021.0200324e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068705642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-019-01933-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamanta, Palas10aEffects of pH on growth and biochemical responses in Agarophyton vermiculophyllum under different temperature conditions  ap. 499-509.  aThe effects of pH (6.2, 7.2, 8.2, 9.2, and 10.2) under rising temperature (30 °C vs 20 °C) on Agarophyton vermiculophyllum growth and bio-physiology were investigated. Results showed that A. vermiculophyllum exhibited lower growth rates under elevated temperature in all pH values. Chlorophyll a, carotenoid, and phycocyanin levels were significantly enhanced by temperature elevation (p < 0.05). Enhanced H₂O₂ production either at lower or higher pH values correlated with lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels under elevated temperature, which suggested oxidative stress development. Oxidative damage was more severe at elevated pH values, which is confirmed by higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Compared with ambient pH 8.2 value, lower pH values under elevated temperature lead to increase activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione S-transferase (GST), indicating that these enzymes played an important role to combat stress. However, decreased glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities indicate least contribution for ROS scavenging at lower pH values. On contrary, SOD and CAT declined at elevated pH values compared with ambient pH, suggesting least contribution for ROS removal. Moreover, enhanced GR and GPx activities at elevated pH and temperature are not enough to scavenge ROS production. These data are consistent with higher H₂O₂ and LPO levels, and lower GST activities. Collectively, our results indicated that either pH fluctuations or elevated temperature displayed a disadvantageous influence on growth and bio-physiology of A. vermiculophyllum. Therefore, rising temperature alleviates adverse effects of seawater acidification, but it aggravates the negative effects of seawater alkalization on growth and bio-physiology of A. vermiculophyllum.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF-2017R1A6A1A06015181cNational Research Foundation of Korea  aNRF-2019R1F1A1059663cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aadverse effects 3aalkalinization 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alipid peroxidation 3aocean acidification 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3aphycocyanin 3aseawater 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature1 aJang, Sojin1 aShin, Sookkyung1 aKim, Jang Kyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7008-67680 tJournal of applied phycology.g2020 Feb., v. 32, no. 1 p.499-509dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-019-01933-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01309naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012100160300001800281520024100299592002800540650002300568650002600591650003300617650002500650650002200675650002200697700002200719700002000741700002000761773011800781856007500899852000900974655001200983IND60550519120221120183045.0160911e20150306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055051912DNAL7 a10.1021/jo502831w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorah, Madhurjya10aDiastereoselective Synthesis of Substituted Tetrahydrothiophenes and -thiopyrans via Thia-Prins Cyclization Reaction  ap. 2641-2648.  aTetrahydrothiophenes and -thiopyrans have been efficiently synthesized from thioacrylates via thia-Prins cyclization reaction mediated by trimethylsilyltrifluoromethanesulfonate with good diastereoselectivity and in good to high yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3acyclization reactions 3adiastereoselective synthesis 3adiastereoselectivity 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds1 aGogoi, Paramartha1 aIndukuri, Kiran1 aSaikia, Anil K.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2015 Mar. 06, v. 80, no. 5 p.2641-2648dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo502831w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245009300163500001900256520133900275592002801614650002001642650001301662650002201675650001601697650001001713651001201723700002701735700002301762700002101785700002001806700002101826700002301847773012001870856007301990852000902063655001202072IND60732070120221120040510.0210326e20210320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073207012DNAL7 a10.3390/f120303702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeighton, Holly  D.10aTrade-Offs among Release Treatments in Jack Pine Plantations: Twenty-Five Year Responses  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe assessed 27 indicators of plant diversity, stand yield and individual crop tree responses 25 years post-treatment to determine long-term trade-offs among conifer release treatments in boreal and sub-boreal forests. This research addresses the lack of longer-term data needed by forest managers to implement more integrated vegetation management programs, supporting more informed decisions about release treatment choice. Four treatments (untreated control, motor-manual brushsaw, single aerial spray, and complete competition removal) were established at two jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) sites in Ontario, Canada. Our results suggest that plant diversity and productivity in boreal jack pine forests are significantly influenced by vegetation management treatments. Overall, release treatments did not cause a loss of diversity but benefitted stand-scale yield and individual crop tree growth, with maximum benefits occurring in more intensive release treatments. However, none of the treatments maximized all 27 indicators studied; thus, forest managers are faced with trade-offs when choosing treatments. Research on longer term effects, ideally through at least one rotation, is essential to fully understand outcomes of different vegetation management on forest diversity, stand yield, and individual crop tree responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus banksiana 3aconifers 3aspecies diversity 3atree growth 3atrees 3aOntario1 aBell, Frederick  Wayne1 aThiffault, Nelson 1 aSearle, Eric  B.1 aLeitch, Mathew 1 aSharma, Mahadev 1 aDacosta, Jennifer 0 tForests.g2021 Mar. 20, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120303703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001200155245016200167300001600329500001500345520158900360592002801949650001301977650001601990650002202006650002402028650004202052650002702094650001002121650001402131650002702145650002602172650002502198650002702223650001502250650001102265650001302276653002402289653002402313653001402337653002302351653001602374653002402390700001702414700006302431700005602494700001202550700001802562700005902580773009102639856009002730852000902820655001202829IND60621650420221119194340.0190129e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062165042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hua10aEnhanced degradation of bisphenol A and ibuprofen by an up-flow microbial fuel cell-coupled constructed wetland and analysis of bacterial community structure  ap. 599-608.  a2019-12-06  aThis study aims to demonstrate that an up-flow microbial fuel cell-coupled constructed wetland (UCW-MFC) can effectively treat synthetic wastewater that contains a high concentration of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs, 10 mg L−1 level), such as ibuprofen (IBP) and bisphenol A (BPA). A significant decline in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) removal was observed when BPA was added, which indicated that BPA was more toxic to bacteria. The closed circuit operation of UCW-MFC performed better than the open circuit mode for COD and NH4+-N removal. Similarly, the removal rates of IBP and BPA were increased by 9.3% and 18%, respectively, compared with the open circuit mode. The majority of PPCPs were removed from the bottom and anode layer, which accounted for 63.2–78.7% of the total removal. The main degradation products were identified. The removal rates of IBP and BPA decreased by 14.6% and 23.7% due to a reduction in the hydraulic detention times (HRTs) from 16 h to 4 h, respectively. Electricity generation performance, including voltage and maximum power density, initially increased and then declined with a decrease in the HRT. Additionally, both the current circuit operation mode and the HRT have an impact on the bacterial community diversity of the anode according to the results of high-throughput sequencing. The possible bacterial groups involved in PPCP degradation were identified. In summary, UCW-MFC is suitable for enabling the simultaneous removal of IBP and BPA and successful electricity production.  aPublisher supplied data 3atoxicity 3abisphenol A 3aammonium nitrogen 3acommunity structure 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aelectricity generation 3afuels 3aibuprofen 3apersonal care products 3abacterial communities 3aconstructed wetlands 3achemical oxygen demand 3awastewater 3aanodes 3abacteria 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aConstructed wetland 0aIbuprofen 0aelectric potential 0aBisphenol A 0aMicrobial community1 aZhang, Shuai1 aYang, Xlq(Xiaoli),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6570-86301 aYang, Youli,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1282-77291 aXu, Han1 aLi, Xian-Ning1 aSong, Hai-Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5747-88470 tChemosphere.g2019 Feb., v. 217 p.599-608dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005600138245014700194300001600341500002000357520192600377592002802303596006602331596006602397650002702463650001402490650001002504650001102514650000902525650002702534650002102561650001202582650001802594651001302612700002302625700005902648700006402707773011902771856007202890852000902962655001202971IND60644712420221119090020.0190520e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064471242DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.30562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalma, Jorge1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5790-343310aEffects of anthropogenic noise as a source of acoustic stress in wild populations of Hippocampus guttulatus in the Ria Formosa, south Portugal  ap. 751-759.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study evaluated the effects of underwater noise as a source of acoustic stress in the wild populations of Hippocampus guttulatus in the Ria Formosa, south Portugal. Two different scenarios of underwater noise were tested: transient motor boat sound (63.4–127.6 dB) and constant sound produced by the motor of the boat directly above the animals (up to 137.1 dB). Observations were obtained in the wild between 4 and 10 m depth throughout a 3 min period, using a video camera and a hydrophone set, and compared with a control sample. A significant increase (P < 0.05) in the respiratory rate was observed in 87% of the observed fish. Opercular movements per minute (OMPM) increased from 35.7 ± 10 (control sample) to 41.2 ± 15.5 after the first minute, to 45.5 ± 13.3 after the second (both under transient sound) and to 49.7 ± 12.5 after the third (under constant sound exposure). Differences in means between the control fish and fish observed during the second (P < 0.01) and third minute of observation (P < 0.0001) were significant. Concordantly, a significant increase (P < 0.05) in the OMPM of fish observed in the first minute and the third minute was noted. In addition to the OMPM increase, 37.5% of the animals abandoned the observation location presumably in an attempt to avoid the negative sound stimuli. The noise caused by boat traffic generated an immediate physiological response, expressed as an increase in OMPM, and a behavioural response resulting in site abandonment, which together can be considered as a negative impact on the seahorse populations. This work contributes to an increasing number of studies that have shown that boat traffic can induce ecological and environmental consequences to aquatic species. Future research should evaluate how navigation exclusion areas could have a positive impact on the seahorse populations inhabiting shallow coastal areas.  aPublisher supplied data  aPTDC/MAR/122616/2010cFundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia  aSFRH/BPD/112127/2015cFundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia 3aHippocampus guttulatus 3aacoustics 3aboats 3acoasts 3afish 3aphysiological response 3arespiratory rate 3atraffic 3avideo cameras 3aPortugal1 aMagalhães, Marisa1 aCorreia, Miguel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1846-11741 aAndrade, José Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5482-97760 tAquatic conservation.g2019 May, v. 29, no. 5 p.751-759dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.30563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03609naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013900171300001800310506011700328506007600445520179600521592002802317506003702345650002102382650001102403650000902414650002002423650001802443650002402461650001102485650001302496650001302509650001502522650001802537650001002555653001602565653002302581653002302604653001802627653002202645700002502667700002102692700002102713700002202734700006202756700002402818700002502842773010902867856008202976852000903058655001203067IND60713098220221207135351.0220529e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071309822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2020.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, Juliana P.10aEffects of breeder age on embryonic development, hatching results, chick quality, and growing performance of the slow-growing genotype  ap. 6697-6704.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present study aimed to ascertain the effects of slow-growing breeder age on embryo development, incubation results, and chick quality and of the interaction between breeder age and hatching time on initial performance. A total of 630 hatching eggs obtained from a commercial flock of slow-growing broiler breeders (Isa Label Naked Neck) were evaluated in 2 experiments. The first experiment evaluated embryo development and hatching results for broiler breeder age treatments of 38 and 51 wk, whereas the second experiment evaluated broiler chick performance. For the second experiment, chicks were distributed in a 2 x 2 factorial randomized block (sex) experimental design consisting of 2 breeder ages (31 or 58 wk) and 2 hatching times (479–485 and 491–497 h). At 18 d of embryonic development, embryos of 51-wk-old breeders were larger than those of 38-wk-old breeders (P < 0.05), whereas yolk-free chick weight was similar (P > 0.05). Embryo organ weight was similar for the 2 breeder ages (P > 0.05); however, there was greater development of intestinal villi for embryos of the 51-wk-old breeders. There were no differences between breeder ages in hatchability and chick quality score (P > 0.05). Yolk-free chick weight at pulling was greater (P < 0.05) for chicks from 51-wk-old breeders. Hatching time did not affect performance from 1 to 7 d (P > 0.05); however, chicks hatching at 491–497 h had better performance from 1 to 28 d than did chicks hatching at 479–485 h (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the age of slow-growing breeders affects embryo villi development and chick weight but does not improve incubation results or chick quality. Chicks hatching later (491–497 h) had better performance results than chicks hatching earlier (479–485 h).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abroiler breeders 3achicks 3aeggs 3aembryo (animal) 3aembryogenesis 3aexperimental design 3aflocks 3agenotype 3ahatching 3aintestines 3atissue weight 3avilli 0abreeder age 0aembryo development 0afree-range broiler 0ahatching time 0anaked-neck strain1 aMesquita, Mariana A.1 aCafé, Marcos B.1 aAssis, Saullo D.1 aVeríssimo, Saulo1 aSantos, Raphael R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8910-46361 aLeandro, Nadja S.M.1 aAraújo, Itallo C.S.0 tPoultry science.g2020 Dec., v. 99, no. 12 p.6697-6704dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012800164300001400292520200000306592002802306650001202334650002102346650001202367650001002379650002202389650001102411650001502422650002202437650001402459650002102473650001902494650001602513650001302529650000902542650001902551650002202570650000902592650001102601650000902612650001702621650001102638650002102649651001002670700001802680773007002698856008402768852000902852655001202861IND60084205020221118175202.0141101e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008420502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2011.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Tao10aEffects of land use, land cover and rainfall regimes on the surface runoff and soil loss on karst slopes in southwest China  ap. 53-62.  aSurface runoff and soil loss from 2007 to 2010 related to land use and rainfall regimes in karst hill slopes in Guizhou Province, southwest China, were analyzed. Using the hierarchical clustering method, sixty-one rainfall events under the subtropical monsoon climate condition were classified into 5 types of rainfall regimes according to the depth, maximum 30-min intensity, and duration of rainfall. In our study, we first demonstrated that the amounts of surface runoff and soil loss on the karst hill slopes were very small compared to the non-karst areas, because the dual hydrological structure in the karst region, including ground and underground drainage systems, could influence the processes of rainfall recharge and runoff generation. Most rainfall water was transported underground through limestone fissures and fractures, while little was in the form of surface runoff. Second, the runoff and soil loss were affected by land use management and vegetation cover. Soil loss was intensified in a descending order to five types of land uses: pastureland>burned area>cropland>combination vegetation land>young forestland. Third, the runoff and soil loss exhibited remarkable variances among different rainfall regimes. Large runoff and soil loss were mainly created by heavy rainfall storms with a rainfall depth of more than 40mm and a maximum 30-min rainfall intensity of over 30mmh⁻¹. In addition, rainfall storms with large antecedent precipitations could also produce large runoff and soil loss. These observations indicated that limestone fissures and fractures play important roles in surface runoff generation on karst limestone slopes due to their large storage capacity and high infiltration rate. Lastly, the soil erosion risk in the karst pure limestone slope is quite high and should be paid particular attention, especially in regards to over-grazing because the soil loss created by a single heavy rainstorm in pastureland was 5 times the annual soil loss tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adrainage systems 3aforests 3ahills 3ainfiltration rate 3akarsts 3aland cover 3aland use planning 3alimestone 3alosses from soil 3amonsoon season 3aovergrazing 3apastures 3arain 3arain intensity 3arainfall duration 3arisk 3arunoff 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3astorms 3avegetation cover 3aChina1 aWang, Shi-jie0 tCatena.g2012 Mar., v. 90 p.53-62dElsevier B.V.x0341-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2011.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02137naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100003100186245005300217300001600270506007600286520079800362592002801160506003701188650002101225650002001246650001001266650001901276650001001295650001701305650001401322650004401336650003001380650004301410650003901453650001101492700002101503773010101524856008101625852000901706655001201715IND4480937020221207133612.0141111e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448093702DNAL7 a215110472pmid7 aPMC31432902pmcid7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2011.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamaranayake, Dhanushki P.10aMilestones in Candida albicans gene manipulation  ap. 858-865.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the United States, candidemia is one of the most common hospital-acquired infections and is estimated to cause 10,000 deaths per year. The species Candida albicans is responsible for the majority of these cases. As C. albicans is capable of developing resistance against the currently available drugs, understanding the molecular basis of drug resistance, finding new cellular targets, and further understanding the overall mechanism of C. albicans pathogenesis are important goals. To study this pathogen it is advantageous to manipulate its genome. Numerous strategies of C. albicans gene manipulation have been introduced. This review evaluates a majority of these strategies and should be a helpful guide for researchers to identify gene targeting strategies to suit their requirements.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida albicans 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3agene targeting 3agenes 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 2aCandida albicansxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCandidiasisxmicrobiology 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aHumans1 aHanes, Steven D.0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2011 Sept., v. 48, no. 9 p.858-865dElsevier Inc.x1087-18457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2011.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03563naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245006900156300001600225520199300241592002802234650000802262650001302270650001502283650002002298650002802318650000902346650002102355650003802376650001502414650002302429650002302452650002002475650002602495650002202521650001802543650000902561650001402570650003002584653001902614653001302633653002602646653002302672653002202695653002602717700001802743700001902761700002102780773013402801856007702935852000903012655001203021IND60480962220221119114941.0200226e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048096222DNAL7 a10.3920/WMJ2013.16052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrska, R.10aDetermination of T-2 and HT-2 toxins in food and feed: an update  ap. 131-142.  aBased on the recent scientific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain on the risks to human and animal health related to the presence of T-2 and HT-2 toxins in food and feed that was published by EFSA in the EFSA Journal, this article provides an update on the determination of these Fusarium mycotoxins. After a brief introduction into the chemistry of these toxins, both chromatographic and immuno-analytical methods are discussed for the determination of these type A trichothecenes. During the last decade, liquid chromatography with (tandem) mass spectrometry has become the most frequently used method for the determination of T-2 and HT-2 toxins, often within a multi-analyte approach. However, complex matrices and the resulting signal suppression effects, as observed particularly in electrospray-mass spectrometry methods owing to matrix effects, may require careful optimisation of clean-up, usage of matrix matched standards, or e.g. the use of internal standards. For specific purposes where extremely low limits of quantification are needed, e.g. for the analysis of duplicate diets, a dedicated gas chromatography method with multistage mass spectrometry has become available. Other novel analytical approaches to determine T-2 and HT-2 toxins in food and feed include biosensor-based methods in surface plasmon resonance and electrochemical formats, as well as DNA microchip assays. For rapid screening, several immunochemical methods (mostly ELISAs) have become available and some are sold as commercial test kits. Whereas these methods work fast, cross-reactivities with other trichothecenes can have an undesired effect on their accuracy. While proficiency tests including T-2 and HT-2 toxins have been carried out, none of the chromatographic or immunochemical methods have been formally validated in interlaboratory validation studies. There are no certified reference materials available for T-2 and HT-2 toxins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aFusarium 3aHT-2 toxin 3aanalytical kits 3aanimal and human health 3adiet 3aelectrochemistry 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afood chain 3afood contamination 3agas chromatography 3aimmunochemistry 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3arapid methods 3arisk 3ascreening 3asurface plasmon resonance 0atrichothecenes 0aanalysis 0aliquid chromatography 0agas chromatography 0amass spectrometry 0aimmunochemical method1 aMalachova, A.1 aBerthiller, F.1 avan Egmond, H.P.0 tWorld mycotoxin journal.g2014 Jan. 1, v. 7, no. 2 p.131-142dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4395724x1875-07967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/WMJ2013.16053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01760naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009000158300002000248520061800268592002800886650002600914650001800940650001300958650002700971650001500998650001301013650002201026700001601048700002001064700001201084700001701096700001901113700001801132700001901150773012101169856007501290852000901365655001201374IND60550294920221116145744.0160910e20141107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055029492DNAL7 a10.1021/jo502005j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lin-Bao10aCopper-Mediated Direct Alkoxylation of Arenes Using an N,O-Bidentate Directing System  ap. 10399-10409.  aHighly effective CuCl-mediated CH alkoxylation of arenes and heteroarenes has been developed by using a 2-aminopyridine 1-oxide moiety as an N,O-bidentate directing group.

The aim of this study was to investigate, using a rotary cell culture system (RCCS) bioreactor, the effects of microgravity on the chondrogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived MSCs (ADSCs), which were cultured in pellets with or without the chondrogenic growth factor TGF-β1. In addition, we evaluated the role of the p38 MAPK pathway in this process. The real-time PCR and histological results show that microgravity has a synergistic effect on chondrogenesis with TGF-β1. The p38 MAPK pathway was activated by TGF-β1 alone and was further stimulated by microgravity. Inhibition of p38 activity with SB203580 suppressed chondrocyte-specific gene expression and matrix production. These findings suggest that the p38 MAPK signal acts as an essential mediator in the microgravity-induced chondrogenesis of ADSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioreactors 3acell culture 3achondrogenesis 3agene expression 3ahumans 3amicrogravity 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3apellets 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astem cells 3asynergism 3atransforming growth factor beta 11 aYu, Degang1 aCao, Lei1 aZhao, Xin1 aLong, Teng1 aLiu, Guangwang1 aTang, Tingting1 aZhu, Zhenan0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 Oct. 22, v. 414, no. 2 p.412-418dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03589naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003100155245018800186520172800374592002802102650002602130650001602156650002402172650002002196650002002216650001602236650001002252650001302262650002302275650001502298650001002313650001202323650001102335650002302346650001202369650001302381650001402394650002202408650001402430650001202444650002002456653003002476653002002506653000902526653002202535653002602557700002302583700003202606700002302638700003102661700002702692700004102719700002902760773009902789856009002888852000902978655001202987IND60731346820221120122949.0220124e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073134682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7366452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraújo, FabrícioEugênio10aAssessment of isoleucine requirement of fast-growing Nile tilapia fingerlings based on growth performance, amino acid retention, and expression of muscle growth-related and mTOR genes  aRecent studies provide new mechanistic insights that isoleucine (ILE) regulates protein synthesis through genomic approaches. An 8-week feeding trial was performed to determine dietary ILE requirement based on growth performance, body composition, amino acid (AA) retention, and mRNA levels of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), including myogenic differentiation (MyoD), myogenin (MyoG), and myostatin (Mst) as negative regulatory of myogenesis, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) genes in fingerling Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. Fish (n = 288; 2.46 ± 0.10 g; mean ± SD) were randomly distributed into six treatments with four replicate groups of 12 fish. Fish were fed diets with graded levels of analyzed ILE at 9.08 (ILE1), 12.13 (ILE2), 15.11 (ILE3), 18.02 (ILE4), 21.15(ILE5), and 24.06 g kg⁻¹ diet (ILE6). Fish were hand-fed, six times a day, until apparent satiety. At the end of the feeding trial, incremental levels of dietary ILE significantly affected body weight gain (BWG), feed efficiency ratio (FER), protein retention efficiency (PRE), and essential and non-essential AA retention. Also, the relative expression of MyoD and MyoG genes in the white skeletal muscle and mTOR gene in the liver was up-regulated in fish fed diet ILE3 (P > 0.05). Optimal branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) ratio (Ile:Leu:Val) was found at 1:1.3:0.9. Based on one-slope broken line model of BWG, the optimal dietary ILE requirement for fingerling Nile tilapia was estimated at 13.67 g kg⁻¹. The results indicate that appropriate dietary ILE level at 5.0% dietary protein could improve protein synthesis and positively regulates muscle growth-related and mTOR genes in fast-growing Nile tilapia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aaquaculture 3abody weight changes 3adietary protein 3afeed conversion 3afingerlings 3agenes 3agenomics 3agrowth performance 3aisoleucine 3aliver 3amammals 3amodels 3amuscle development 3amuscles 3amyogenin 3amyostatin 3aprotein synthesis 3arapamycin 3asatiety 3askeletal muscle 0aBranched-chain amino acid 0aGene expression 0amTOR 0aProtein synthesis 0aOreochromis niloticus1 aMichelato, Mariana1 aSchemberger, Michelle Orane1 aSalaro, Ana Lúcia1 aVidal, Luiz Vitor Oliveira1 ada Cruz, Thais Pereira1 aFuruya, Valéria Rossetto Barriviera1 aFuruya, Wilson Massamitu0 tAquaculture.g2021 June 30, v. 539 p.736645-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7366453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011700164300001800281506011700299506007600416520151100492592002802003506003702031650001802068650001002086650001302096650001202109650002002121650002102141650001602162650001002178650001002188650001602198650001202214650002502226650001302251650001802264650001102282650002002293650001202313650001402325650001702339650001902356653001402375653001702389653001802406653001102424653001702435700002102452700001702473773010902490856008202599852000902681655001202690IND60713098320221207133704.0220529e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071309832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2020.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlores, K.R.10aEffect of feed form, soybean meal protein content, and Rovabio Advance on poult live performance to 3 wk of age  ap. 6705-6714.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBased on research reports, feed characteristics can increase poult growth via several factors. Two rearing experiments (EXP) were conducted to test the effects of feed form and ingredient quality in turkey poults. Bird performance and the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and cecum morphology were observed in both EXP. Poults were reared in battery cages (48 cages in EXP 1 and 72 cages in EXP 2). Four dietary treatments with differing feed form and function factors were evaluated in EXP 1. A completely randomized block design with a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments consisting of 2 levels of fines, 2 soybean meal (SBM) sources, and 2 levels of an enzyme cocktail (Rovabio Advance) was tested in EXP 2. Poult BW, BW gain (BWG), feed intake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were determined in both EXP. Apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen (AMEn) was determined in EXP 2. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at P ≤ 0.05. Feeding increased feed crumble particle size with fewer fines in the starter feed resulted in an increased BWG accompanied by an increased FI. Reduced feed fines reduced AMEₙ when the dietary enzyme cocktail was not present. The feed formulation with 60% CP SBM resulted in a lower FI and an improved FCR. The enzyme cocktail interacted synergistically with screening and fed SBM source factors on the AMEn and FCR. It was concluded that both the feed form and quality, as used in this study, affect poult performance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abattery cages 3acecum 3aduodenum 3aenzymes 3afeed conversion 3afeed formulation 3afeed intake 3afeeds 3aileum 3aingredients 3ajejunum 3ametabolizable energy 3anitrogen 3aparticle size 3apoults 3aprotein content 3arearing 3ascreening 3asoybean meal 3aturkey feeding 0afeed form 0afeed quality 0aparticle size 0aenzyme 0asoybean meal1 aFahrenholz, A.C.1 aGrimes, J.L.0 tPoultry science.g2020 Dec., v. 99, no. 12 p.6705-6714dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002000135245009000155300001500245520106200260592002801322650002201350650002801372650001401400650000801414650001401422650001401436650001301450650001401463700002001477700002001497773015201517856006901669856010601738990002301844852000901867655001201876IND60644625020221118035204.0190517e20190316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064462502DNAL7 a10.3791/592742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMueller, Robert10aImplantation of a new micro acoustic tag in juvenile pacific lamprey and american eel  ap. e59274.  aJuvenile Pacific Lamprey and American eels were used for laboratory evaluations to determine potential effects from tag implantation. Telemetry technology has been identified as a way to obtain more detailed information on movement and behavior across a broader spatial scale than is possible with other known technology. The purpose of this method is to provide a detailed step by step instruction on tag implantation for both lampreys and eel. For laboratory studies using actively migrating juvenile Pacific Lamprey (120-160 mm), we determined that the presence of the tag did not alter the swimming ability between tagged and untagged Individuals or have any significant tag loss (<3%). Similar results were determined during laboratory testing of Yellow phase American Eels (113-175 mm). No mortality occurred during a 38-day holding period and there was minimal tag loss (3.8%). The presence of the tag did not have any significant effect on the swimming ability or survival of tagged eels compared to untagged controls and there was minimal tag loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnguilla rostrata 3aEntosphenus tridentatus 3aacoustics 3aeel 3ajuveniles 3amortality 3aswimming 3atelemetry1 aLiss, Stephanie1 aDeng, Z.

At pH 8 and 25 Â°C, approximately 70% of the protein is S, and the lifetimes of the states are 1.3Â s (S) and 0.50Â s (D). Zn(II) and Fe(II) each bind and stabilize structured (S-like) states. Single amino acid substitutions at conserved residues were found that shift the equilibrium toward either the S or the D state. Cluster assembly takes place in the complex between IscU and the cysteine desulfurase, IscS, and our NMR studies demonstrate that IscS binds preferentially the D form of apo-IscU. The addition of 10% IscS to IscU was found to greatly increase H/D exchange at protected amides of IscU, to increase the rate of the SÂ âÂ D reaction, and to decrease the rate of the DÂ âÂ S reaction. In the saturated IscU:IscS complex, IscU is largely disordered. In vitro cluster assembly reactions provided evidence for the functional importance of the SâD equilibrium. IscU variants that favor the S state were found to undergo a lag phase, not observed with the wild type, that delayed cluster assembly; variants that favor the D state were found to assemble less stable clusters at an intermediate rate without the lag. It appears that IscU has evolved to exist in a disordered conformational state that is the initial substrate for the desulfurase and to convert to a structured state that stabilizes the cluster once it is assembled.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamides 3aamino acid substitution 3acysteine 3airon 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3azinc1 aTonelli, Marco1 aMarkley, John L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Jan. 10, v. 109, no. 2 p.454-459dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11143721093Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001900168245005500187300001600242500000900258500001500267520106100282592002801343650001101371650003701382653001101419700001901430773012001449852000901569856009801578655001201676991568295740742620221119181930.0191122e196907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7090026572DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1969.0011183X000900040019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyle, G.

Carbon assimilation in these conditions was then related to the stomatal and apparent mesophyll resistances to CO₂ transfer. Lack of nitrogen decreased carbon assimilation in all three species. Assimilation was enhanced in oxygen-free air in cotton and beans, but little affected in maize. The inhibition of assimilation in nitrogen-deficient plants was accompanied by an apparent increase in mesophyll resistance to CO₂ transfer, but some increase in stomatal resistance was also measured. Enhancement of carbon assimilation in oxygen-free air was negatively associated with the apparent mesophyll resistance to CO₂ transfer. Such apparent resistances in the mesophyll may be associated with differences in dark reactions, with a light or photosynthetically-induced respiratory pathway, as well as with CO₂ diffusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotany 3aPlant Science and Plant Products 0aplants1 aHesketh, J.

(Loranthaceae) is a semi-parasitic plant used in pharmacy and medicine mostly for its hypotensive and anticancer activity. The effects may be related to the presence of triterpenic acids, such as betulinic (BA) and oleanolic (OA) acids. Objectives: In our investigations the content of triterpenic acids in V. album from different host trees depending on the season of harvest was determined. Material and methods: V. album herb was dried and extracted with ethyl acetate using ultrasound energy. The reversed phase HPLC-PDA method was used for the analysis of triterpenic acids. The structure of the target components was confirmed by mass spectrometry with an electrospray ionization source. Results: Diversity in the content of both compounds was noted; however, OA was the dominant triterpenic acid and the amount thereof was ∼10 times higher than that of BA. The analysis of changes in the amount of triterpenic acids during the spring-winter period revealed the highest content of OA in summer (from 6.84 to 13.65 mg/g). In turn, in the other seasons of harvest, the content was in the range of 4.41–9.83, 6.41–9.56 and 5.59–12.16 mg/g for spring, autumn and winter, respectively. In most cases, a similar tendency was observed for BA. Discussion and conclusion: In most cases, the highest amount of the investigated compounds was found in summer; thus, this period seems to be optimal for acquisition of plant material rich in triterpenic acids.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLoranthaceae 3aViscum album 3aantineoplastic activity 3aautumn 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenergy 3aethyl acetate 3amedicine 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3atrees 3atriterpene acids 3aultrasonics 3awinter 0aMistletoe 0abetulinic acid 0aoleanolic acid1 aSowa, Ireneusz1 aPucek, Kamila1 aSzymczak, Grażyna1 aKocjan, Ryszard1 aLuchowski, Piotr0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2017 Jan. 1, v. 55, no. 1 p.1-4dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2016.12257733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010900170300001800279520147500297592002801772650002201800650001901822650001701841650001701858650000901875650001601884650001501900650001401915650000901929650001001938650001101948650001101959650002101970650002001991650001202011650001002023653002402033653001802057653002002075653002202095700001702117700001702134700002502151700001802176700002302194700002302217700002302240700001702263773014602280856008602426852000902512655001202521IND60754916720221118042512.0211027e20211028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075491672DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2020.17937272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaini, Praveen10aBioactive compounds, nutritional benefits and food applications of colored wheat: a comprehensive review  ap. 3197-3210.  aThe consumers’ demands have changed from energy providing diet to a diet with a balanced nutrient profile along with metabolic, physiological and functional health benefits. They are seeking colorants derived from natural sources to enhance the nutritional and antioxidant value of foods. Colored wheat (Triticum aestivum) contains many phytochemicals, responsible for numerous health benefits. Colored wheat (blue, black, purple and red) contains a good amount of anthocyanins and carotenoids that are primarily located in the outer aleurone layer. Food regulatory and safety authorities and food processing industries are trying to minimize the usage of synthetic food colorants and dyes. Colored wheat is imperative for food processing industries as high-value pigments present in the bran layer (milling industry co-product) can easily be extracted and utilized as functional foods and natural colorants. The extracted pigments such as anthocyanin can replace synthetic dyes currently used in food, drug and cosmetics. Additionally, natural additives improve the nutritional value, appearance, texture, flavor, and storage properties of food products. This review presents a brief knowledge of the nutritional composition of colored wheat including phytochemicals and bioactive compounds like flavonoids, phenolic compounds, their health benefits, methods and technologies used for processing and extraction as well as the effects of processing on these compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aaleurone layer 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidants 3abran 3acarotenoids 3acoproducts 3acosmetics 3adiet 3adrugs 3aenergy 3aflavor 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3atexture 3awheat 0aBioactive compounds 0aColored wheat 0aHealth benefits 0aNatural colorants1 aKumar, Nitin1 aKumar, Sunil1 aMwaurah, Peter Waboi1 aPanghal, Anil1 aAttkan, Arun Kumar1 aSingh, Vijay Kumar1 aGarg, Mukesh Kumar1 aSingh, Vijay0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2021 Oct. 28, v. 61, no. 19 p.3197-3210dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2020.17937273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04110naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245018400212300001800396520157700414592002801991596007502019596007502094596007502169596007502244596007502319596007502394596007502469596008302544596008302627596009902710650001802809650000802827650002202835650002102857650001402878650001302892650001202905650002502917700007602942700001903018700007203037700006003109700007303169700006203242700005803304773013803362856008303500852000903583655001203592IND60781793820221119100032.0220703e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078179382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-022-01911-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoso, Adauto Lima1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7287-503910aMeiotic behavior, transmission and active genes of B chromosomes in the cichlid Astatotilapia latifasciata: new clues about nature, evolution and maintenance of accessory elements  ap. 1151-1167.  aSupernumerary B chromosomes (Bs) are dispensable genetic elements widespread in eukaryotes and are poorly understood mainly in relation to mechanisms of maintenance and transmission. The cichlid Astatotilapia latifasciata can harbor Bs in a range of 0 (named B −) and 1–2 (named B +). The B in A. latifasciata is rich in several classes of repetitive DNA sequences, contains protein coding genes, and affects hosts in diverse ways, including sex-biased effects. To advance in the knowledge about the mechanisms of maintenance and transmission of B chromosomes in A. latifasciata, here, we studied the meiotic behavior in males and transmission rates of A. latifasciata B chromosome. We also analyzed structurally and functionally the predicted B chromosome copies of the cell cycle genes separin-like, tubb1-like and kif11-like. We identified in the meiotic structure relative to the B chromosome the presence of proteins associated with Synaptonemal Complex organization (SMC3, SYCP1 and SYCP3) and found that the B performs self-pairing. These data suggest that isochromosome formation was a step during B chromosome evolution and this element is in a stage of diversification of the two arms keeping the self-pairing behavior to protect the A chromosome complement of negative effects of recombination. Moreover, we observed no occurrence of B-drive and confirmed the presence of cell cycle genes copies in the B chromosome and their transcription in encephalon, muscle and gonads, which can indicates beneficial effects to hosts and contribute to B maintenance.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013/19898-7cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2013/25234-4cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2014/15756-6cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2015/16661-1cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2016/03912-9cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2016/07743-7cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2017/07484-4cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a305321/2015-3cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a304111/2020-1cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aBe1168/8-1cDeutsches Forschungszentrum für Gesundheit und Umwelt, Helmholtz Zentrum München 3aAstatotilapia 3aDNA 3achromosome number 3aeukaryotic cells 3aevolution 3agenomics 3amuscles 3asynaptonemal complex1 aVenturelli, Natália Bortholazzi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0287-61161 ada Cruz, Irene1 ade Sá Patroni, Fábio Malta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0221-83801 ade Moraes, Diogo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3270-74441 ade Oliveira, Rogério Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7568-748X1 aBenavente, Ricardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6361-06721 aMartins, Cesar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3534-974X0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2022 July, v. 297, no. 4 p.1151-1167dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl69781x1617-46157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-022-01911-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03648naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001400138245009400152300001600246500002000262520153300282592002801815596005601843596005101899596005601950596005802006596005802064596005802122596005802180596005602238596005802294650002602352650001302378650001902391650001102410650001002421650001702431650001202448650001502460650001302475650001302488650000902501650002002510650002702530650001202557650001902569650000902588700001802597700002202615700001702637700002102654700001602675700001702691700001402708700001702722700002702739700001702766773013402783856007202917852000902989655001202998IND60626790320221122023108.0181228e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062679032DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.42862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShoji, A.10aBiotransport of metallic trace elements from marine to terrestrial ecosystems by seabirds  ap. 106-114.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhysical systems, such as currents and winds, have traditionally been considered responsible for transporting contaminants. Although evidence is mounting that animals play a role in this process through their movements, we still know little about how such contaminant biotransport occurs and the extent of effects at deposition sites. In the present study, we address this question by studying how rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata), a seabird that occurs in immense colonies (∼300 000 pairs at our study site, Teuri Island), affect contaminant levels at their colony and at nearby sites. More specifically, we hypothesize that contaminants are transported and deposited by seabirds at their colony and that these contaminants are passed on locally to the terrestrial ecosystem. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the concentration of 9 heavy metal and metalloids, as well as δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N stable isotopes, in bird tissues, plants, and soil, both within and outside of the colony. The results show that rhinoceros auklets transport marine‐derived mercury (Hg), possibly from their wintering location, and deposit Hg via their feces at their breeding site, thereby contaminating plants and soils within the breeding colony. The present study confirms not only that animals can transport contaminants from marine to terrestrial ecosystems, potentially over unexpectedly long distances, but also that bird tissues contribute locally to plant contamination.

Their catalytic efficiency strongly depends on the type of substituent and is remarkable for derivatives with an electron-withdrawing group, showing reactivity comparable to that of flavinium salts which are the prominent organocatalysts for oxygenations. Because of their high stability and good accessibility, 4-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidinium and 3,5-dinitropyridinium triflates are the catalysts of choice and were shown to catalyze oxidation of aliphatic and aromatic sulfides to sulfoxides, giving quantitative conversions, high preparative yields and excellent chemoselectivity. The high efficiency of electron-poor heteroarenium salts is rationalized by their ability to readily form adducts with nucleophiles, as documented by low pKR₊ values (pKR₊ < 5) and less negative reduction potentials (Eᵣₑd > −0.5 V). Hydrogen peroxide adducts formed in situ during catalytic oxidation act as substrate oxidizing agents. The Gibbs free energies of oxygen transfer from these heterocyclic hydroperoxides to thioanisole, obtained by calculations at the B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p) level, showed that they are much stronger oxidizing agents than alkyl hydroperoxides and in some cases are almost comparable to derivatives of flavin hydroperoxide acting as oxidizing agents in monooxygenases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aLewis bases 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical structure 3achemoselectivity 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroperoxides 3amodels 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asulfides1 aBoháčová, Soňa1 aChudoba, Josef1 aMetelková, Radka1 aCibulka, Radek0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2015 Mar. 06, v. 80, no. 5 p.2676-2699dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo502865f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010900170300001400279520152200293592002801815650002401843650001101867650001601878650001201894650002601906650002301932650002701955650001901982650001202001650001102013653001802024653002002042653001202062653001702074653002402091700002602115700002002141700001902161700002702180773014502207856008402352852000902436655001202445IND60606234120221119174300.0190318e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060623412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2016.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvery, Sharon L.10aComparison of fin and muscle tissues for analysis of signature fatty acids in tropical euryhaline sharks  ap. 46-53.  aFatty acid (FA) analysis can provide an effective, non-lethal method of elucidating the trophic ecology of fish. One method utilised in the field is to collect biopsied muscle tissue, but this can be problematic in live sharks due to a thick dermal layer with extensive connective tissue. The aim of this research was to determine whether fin and muscle tissue yield similar FA profiles in three species of tropical euryhaline sharks: Carcharhinus leucas, Glyphis garricki and Glyphis glyphis. Fatty acid profiles were detectable in fin clips as small as 20mg (~5mm×6mm) and muscle biopsies >10mg mass. Overall profiles in relative (%) FA composition varied significantly between fin and muscle tissues for C. leucas and G. garricki (global R-values=0.204 and 0.195, P<0.01), but not G. glyphis (global R-value=0.063, P=0.257). The main FAs that contributed to these differences were largely 18:0 for C. leucas, 20:4ω6 for G. garricki and 20:5ω3 for G. glyphis, which reflect the different physiological functions and turnover rates of the two tissues. Notably, no significant differences were detected between tissue types for the major classes of FAs and abundant dietary essential FAs. It was concluded that FA profiles from either fin clips or muscle tissue may be used to examine the trophic ecology of these tropical euryhaline sharks when focusing on dietary essential FAs. Given that some non-essential FAs were different, caution should be applied when comparing FA profiles across different tissue types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarcharhinus leucas 3abiopsy 3adietary fat 3aecology 3aessential fatty acids 3aeuryhaline species 3afatty acid composition 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3asharks 0aElasmobranchs 0aTrophic ecology 0aGlyphis 0aCarcharhinus 0aBiochemical tracers1 aPethybridge, Heidi R.1 aCrook, David A.1 aKyne, Peter M.1 aFulton, Christopher J.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2016 June, v. 479 p.46-53dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2016.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010400165300001600269520204000285592002802325650002102353650002302374650001202397650001302409650001702422650001602439650001002455650002002465650002202485650001202507700002102519700002002540700002002560773010002580856008102680852000902761655001202770IND60120929820221119032510.0150212e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012092982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-002-0399-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTropel, David10aFerredoxin-mediated reactivation of the chlorocatechol 2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida GJ31  ap. 345-351.  aIn the chlorobenzene degrader Pseudomonas putida GJ31, chlorocatechol is formed as an intermediate and cleaved by a meta-cleavage extradiol chlorocatechol dioxygenase, which has previously been shown to be exceptionally resistant to inactivation by substituted catechols. The gene encoding this dioxygenase (cbzE) is preceded by a gene (cbzT) potentially encoding a ferredoxin, the function of which was studied. The cbzT gene product was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified in recombinant form. Two homologous proteins, CdoT and AtdS, encoded by genes identified in strains degrading nitrobenzene and aniline, respectively, were also purified and characterized. All three proteins showed spectroscopic properties typical for [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins. The chlorocatechol dioxygenase from strain GJ31 (CbzE) was fully inactivated when 4-methylcatechol was used as substrate. Inactivated CbzE could be rapidly reactivated in vitro in the presence of purified CbzT and a source of reductant. It is inferred that the ability of strain GJ31 to metabolize both chlorobenzene and toluene might depend on the regeneration of the chlorocatechol dioxygenase activity mediated by CbzT. Three CbzT-like ferredoxins, including AtdS, were found to be competent in the reactivation of CbzE, whereas XylT, a protein known to mediate reactivation of the catechol dioxygenase from P. putida mt2 (XylE), was ineffective. Accordingly, CbzT formed a covalent complex with CbzE when cross-linked with a carbodiimide, whereas XylT did not. In the reverse situation, CbzT was found to reactivate XylE as efficiently as XylT and formed an heterologous covalent complex with this enzyme upon cross-linking. We conclude that CbzT, CdoT and AtdS are isofunctional ferredoxins that appear to be involved in the reactivation of their cognate catechol dioxygenases. Based on primary structure comparisons, residues of the ferredoxins possibly involved in the molecular interaction with catechol dioxygenases were identified and their significance is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas putida 3aaniline 3acatechol 3acrosslinking 3aferredoxins 3agenes 3areducing agents 3aspectral analysis 3atoluene1 aMeyer, Christine1 aArmengaud, Jean1 aJouanneau, Yves0 tArchives of microbiology.g2002 Apr., v. 177, no. 4 p.345-351dSpringer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-002-0399-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010400169520082700273592002801100650002301128650002001151650002001171650002001191650001301211651001201224653002901236653002601265653002601291653001501317653001601332653002601348653001201374653001601386700002301402700002301425700002401448700002101472700001801493700002301511700002201534700002501556700002401581773009401605856008201699852000901781655001201790IND60725305420221119064549.0210223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072530542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1064242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgundepo, Ezekiel13aAn exploratory assessment of a multidimensional healthcare and economic data on COVID-19 in Nigeria  aThe coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that is ravaging Nigeria and the world at large.

Location: Central Pacific. Methods: We sequenced 586 bp of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) (n = 702) and analysed the data for population differentiation and demographic changes. We complemented the sequences with abundance surveys of targeted species and modelled potential habitat availability in response to sea-level change. Results: Sequence data revealed high haplotype diversity (h = 0.685-0.983) and low nucleotide diversity (π = 0.002-0.018) for all species. There was little population differentiation and extensive geographical haplotype sharing within all species, despite dramatic shifts in the abundance of species among locations, which appear to result from ecological interactions rather than limits to contemporary larval dispersal. Population expansion occurred most recently in the subtidal species Calcinus haigae (30-70 ka), whereas the intertidal species showed earlier expansions: Calcinus seurati: 110-140 ka, and Calcinus laevimanus: 220-250 ka. Differences in timing can be linked to the prediction that subtidal habitat area is strongly affected by changing sea level, while intertidal habitat area is affected less strongly. Interestingly, unlike the West Pacific, habitat in the Central Pacific remains relatively equidistant. Main conclusions: Habitat availability during sea-level fluctuations, rather than dispersal limitation per se, appears to be a potential force shaping the population genetic patterns of subtidal species, and perhaps speciation of tropical Calcinus hermit crabs. Insofar as this represents a general pattern, historical sea-level change may play a role in structuring Central Pacific reef species through alteration of habitat availability rather than isolation and vicariance. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrabs 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3ademography 3agenes 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ahaplotypes 3apopulation structure 3aprediction 3asea level 3asurveys1 aScott Godwin, L.1 aFranklin, Erik C.1 aCarlon, David B.1 aToonen, Robert J.1 aRocha, Luiz0 tJournal of biogeography.g2014 Feb., v. 41, no. 2 p.339-352dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.12181  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245015400160520156500314592002801879650002401907650003701931650001001968650001301978650002001991650002202011650002902033650001802062650002002080650001702100700002102117700001802138700001902156700002402175700002302199700002202222773012302244856007402367852000902441655001202450IND60754420120221121055134.0211023e20210930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075442012DNAL7 a10.3390/v131019712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Chang-Ming 10aViral Decoys: The Only Two Herpesviruses Infecting Invertebrates Evolved Different Transcriptional Strategies to Deflect Post-Transcriptional Editing  aThe highly versatile group of Herpesviruses cause disease in a wide range of hosts. In invertebrates, only two herpesviruses are known: the malacoherpesviruses HaHV-1 and OsHV-1 infecting gastropods and bivalves, respectively. To understand viral transcript architecture and diversity we first reconstructed full-length viral genomes of HaHV-1 infecting Haliotis diversicolor supertexta and OsHV-1 infecting Scapharca broughtonii by DNA-seq. We then used RNA-seq over the time-course of experimental infections to establish viral transcriptional dynamics, followed by PacBio long-read sequencing of full-length transcripts to untangle viral transcript architectures at two selected time points. Despite similarities in genome structure, in the number of genes and in the diverse transcriptomic architectures, we measured a ten-fold higher transcript variability in HaHV-1, with more extended antisense gene transcription. Transcriptional dynamics also appeared different, both in timing and expression trends. Both viruses were heavily affected by post-transcriptional modifications performed by ADAR1 affecting sense-antisense gene pairs forming dsRNAs. However, OsHV-1 concentrated these modifications in a few genomic hotspots, whereas HaHV-1 diluted ADAR1 impact by elongated and polycistronic transcripts distributed over its whole genome. These transcriptional strategies might thus provide alternative potential roles for sense-antisense transcription in viral transcriptomes to evade the host’s immune response in different virus–host combinations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnadara broughtonii 3aHaliotis diversicolor supertexta 3agenes 3agenomics 3aimmune response 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aviral genome1 aRosani, Umberto 1 aZhang, Xiang 1 aXin, Lu-Sheng 1 aBortoletto, Enrico 1 aWegner, K.

M.10aMutation of Nonessential Cysteines Shows That the NF-κB Essential Modulator Forms a Constitutive Noncovalent Dimer That Binds IκB Kinase-β with High Affinity  ap. 9141-9154.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) associates with catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ to form the IκB kinase (IKK) complex and is a key regulator of NF-κB pathway signaling. Biochemical and structural characterization of NEMO has been challenging, however, leading to conflicting data about basic biochemical properties such as the oligomeric state of active NEMO and its binding affinity for IKKβ. We show that up to seven of NEMO’s 11 cysteine residues can be mutated to generate recombinant full-length NEMO that is highly soluble and active. Using a fluorescence anisotropy binding assay, we show that full-length NEMO binds a 44-mer peptide encompassing residues 701–745 of IKKβ with a KD of 2.2 ± 0.8 nM. The IKKβ binding affinities of mutants with five and seven Cys-to-Ala substitutions are indistinguishable from that of wild-type NEMO. Moreover, when expressed in NEMO −/– fibroblasts, the five-Ala and seven-Ala NEMO mutants can interact with cellular IKKβ and restore NF-κB signaling to provide protection against tumor necrosis factor α-induced cell death. Treatment of the NEMO-reconstituted cells with H₂O₂ led to the formation of covalent dimers for wild-type NEMO and the five-Ala mutant, but not for the seven-Ala mutant, confirming that Cys54 and/or Cys347 can mediate interchain disulfide bonding. However, the IKKβ binding affinity of NEMO is unaffected by the presence or absence of interchain disulfide bonding at Cys54, which lies within the IKKβ binding domain of NEMO, or at Cys347, indicating that NEMO exists as a noncovalent dimer independent of the redox state of its cysteines. This conclusion was corroborated by the observation that the secondary structure content of NEMO and its thermal stability were independent of the presence or absence of interchain disulfide bonds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding capacity 3acell death 3acysteine 3adisulfide bonds 3afibroblasts 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amutants 3amutation 3asignal transduction 3athermal stability 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aGilmore, Thomas D.1 aShaffer, Robert1 aWeber, Urs1 aBollam, Rishitha1 aGolden, Mary S.1 aGlover, Kimberley1 aHerscovitch, Melanie1 aEnnis, Thomas1 aAllen, Karen N.1 aWhitty, Adrian0 tBiochemistry.g2013 Dec. 23, v. 52, no. 51 p.9141-9154dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi401368r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245016800163300001800331500002000349520174500369592002802114650001402142650001902156650002002175650001402195650001102209650001102220650003702231650002502268650001102293650002702304650001402331650001202345650002102357650002302378651001902401651001302420700002302433700002102456700002402477700001802501773013802519856007802657852000902735655001202744IND60595550220221119163906.0180605e199910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059555022DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.56201810062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGee, Beth L.10aAssessment of sediment contamination, acute toxicity, and population viability of the estuarine amphipod Leptocheirus plumulosus in baltimore harbor, maryland, USA  ap. 2151-2160.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, USA, some of the most contaminated sediments are found in the highly industrialized Baltimore Harbor—Patapsco River area. As part of a comprehensive assessment of sediment quality in this system, sediment toxicity was assessed in 10‐d acute tests with the estuarine amphipod Leptocheirus plumulosus. Mean amphipod survival was significantly reduced in 7 of the 25 samples tested despite the occurrence of minor experimental artifacts. The most toxic sediments were collected from Bear Creek; other areas exhibiting toxicity included the Inner Harbor and Colgate Creek. Marginal toxicity was observed in samples from Curtis Creek, Lazeretto Point, and Back River. Negative relationships were detected between survival and concentrations of select sediment—associated contaminants, whereas a very strong positive association existed between survival in laboratory exposures and density of L. plumulosus at the test sites. A weight of evidence approach, including correlation analyses, a model of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon bioavailability, and comparisons to benchmark sediment levels, was used to tentatively identify classes of contaminants that contributed to the observed toxicity. Analysis of results suggested that toxicity at stations in Bear Creek and Colgate Creek may have been driven by sediment—associated metals, whereas toxicity at stations in the Inner Harbor was likely due to both metal and organic contaminants. The observed relationships among toxicity test results, concentrations of sediment—associated contaminants, and abundance of L. plumulosus at the test sites suggests that acute toxicity tests with this species are indicative of adverse biological effects in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aacute toxicity 3abioavailability 3aestuaries 3ametals 3amodels 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apopulation viability 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3astreams 3atoxicity testing 3aweight-of-evidence 3aChesapeake Bay 3aMaryland1 aFisher, Daniel J.,1 aYonkos, Lance T.1 aZiegler, Gregory P.1 aTurley, Steve0 tEnvironmental toxicology and chemistry.g1999 Oct., v. 18, no. 10 p.2151-2160dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:2045x0730-72687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.56201810063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245006700133300001200200500001900212520113000231592002801361650002101389650002601410650002301436650000901459650002601468650001001494650001601504650002101520650001001541650001601551650001601567650001001583653001501593653001001608653001501618653001001633700001501643700001401658700001901672700002001691773012501711852000901836655001201845IND60716702720221118052908.0201224e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071670272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, V.

Borlaug Crop Research Center, Pantnagar, during the rainy seasons of 2009 and 2010 to evaluate the efficacy of tembotrione (42% SC), a new post-emergence herbicide against mixed flora in maize as well as its residual effect on growth and yield of the succeeding mustard crop. The experimental field was highly infested with Echinochloa colona, Digitaria sanguinalis and Cyperus rotundus. Post emergence application of tembotrione 120 g/ha along with surfactant was found most effective to control the grassy as well as non-grassy weeds as compared to other herbicidal treatments either applied as pre or post emergence. This treatment also recorded highest grain yield during both the years which was at par with a lower dose (110 g/ha + surfactant) or even pre emergence application of the herbicide. Addition of surfactant (1000 ml/ha) increased the kernel yield significantly and reduced the density of weeds effectively as compared to the application of tembotrione without surfactant. No residual effects were observed on the growth and yield of succeeding mustard crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyperus rotundus 3aDigitaria sanguinalis 3aEchinochloa colona 3acorn 3afield experimentation 3aflora 3agrain yield 3aresidual effects 3aseeds 3asurfactants 3atembotrione 3aweeds 0aHerbicides 0aMaize 0aWeed flora 0aYield1 aGuru, S.K.1 aKumar, A.1 aBanga, Akshita1 aTripathi, Neeta0 tIndian journal of weed science.g2012, v. 44, no. 1 p.1-5dIndian Society of Weed SciencewJournal:2005x0974-81647nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245008600203506007600289520102300365592002801388506003701416650001601453650001501469650001801484650001701502650002401519650001601543650000901559650001301568650002101581650002001602650001401622650000901636650001801645650001701663650001301680700001901693700001901712700001901731700002201750700002101772700002301793700001901816773011901835856007701954852000902031655001202040IND60660485720221207083440.0190823e20190813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066048572DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100806142doi7 aPMC67225782pmcid7 a314126872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkayneh, Hala 12aA Critical Review of Animal Models Used in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Pathophysiology  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most frequent, complex, and heterogeneous hematological malignancies. AML prognosis largely depends on acquired cytogenetic, epigenetic, and molecular abnormalities. Despite the improvement in understanding the biology of AML, survival rates remain quite low. Animal models offer a valuable tool to recapitulate different AML subtypes, and to assess the potential role of novel and known mutations in disease progression. This review provides a comprehensive and critical overview of select available AML animal models. These include the non-mammalian Zebrafish and Drosophila models as well as the mammalian rodent systems, comprising rats and mice. The suitability of each animal model, its contribution to the advancement of knowledge in AML pathophysiology and treatment, as well as its advantages and limitations are discussed. Despite some limitations, animal models represent a powerful approach to assess toxicity, and permit the design of new therapeutic strategies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aDrosophila 3aanimal models 3acytogenetics 3adisease progression 3aepigenetics 3amice 3amutation 3amyeloid leukemia 3apathophysiology 3aprognosis 3arats 3asurvival rate 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity1 aJishi, Batoul 1 aHleihel, Rita 1 aHamieh, Maguy 1 aDarwiche, Nadine 1 aBazarbachi, Ali 1 aEl Sabban, Marwan 1 aEl Hajj, Hiba 0 tGenes.g2019 Aug. 13, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100806143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245010800176506002800284520106700312592002801379506003701407650002601444650001201470650002301482650002601505650001201531650002001543650001601563650001301579650001701592650001501609700002301624773009601647856008301743852000901826655001201835IND60740038520221207093738.0200817s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074003852DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202023030022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurachenko, Natalya L.14aThe effect of the “Rizotorfin” inoculant on moisture consumption and productivity of yellow melilot  aResource is Open Access  aA significant part of the livestock feed in Siberia is obtained from yellow melilot (Melilotus officinalis Pall.) – a perennial legume crop. In addition to its nutritional benefits, melilot is valuable as a source of biological nitrogen in soil and has phytosanitary qualities. To increase the productivity of the crop with considerate consumption of moisture resources, it was proposed to use inoculation of melilot seeds with the nodule bacteria compound – “Rizotorfin”. It was proved in a field experiment that the “Rizotorfin” treatment of melilot seeds contributes to a more reasonable expenditure of soil moisture, the evapotranspiration coefficient characterizing the average moisture consumption per 1 ton of crop’s green mass is reduced by 0.7 relative to the control variant plants. The root system develops better, the morphometric parameters of the experimental plants are 25-31% higher than those of plants not treated with “Rizotorfin”. The green mass yield of the experimental plants is 28-33% higher than in the control variant.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMelilotus officinalis 3aSiberia 3aevapotranspiration 3afield experimentation 3alegumes 3alivestock feeds 3amorphometry 3anitrogen 3aroot systems 3asoil water1 aBopp, Valentina L.0 tBIO web of conferences.g2020, v. 23 p.03002-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202023030023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245009500176300001600271520094700287592002801234650001401262650001701276650001101293650001201304650003001316700002001346700002301366700002001389700001901409700002101428700002201449700002101471700002301492700002501515773012801540856008401668990002301752852000901775655001201784IND60090029920221122013705.0141110e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009002992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamperchioli, Alessia10aInvestigation of the Bcl-2 multimerisation process: Structural and functional implications  ap. 850-857.  aBcl-2 plays a prominent role in regulating the function of mitochondria during respiration and in determining the threshold of apoptotic sensitivity. Despite its relevance, the mechanism through which these processes are achieved is still unknown. Using surface plasmon resonance technology to monitor Bcl-2 multimerisation we discovered that a simple dimeric model does not fit with experimental data. A molecular model of the experimentally observed Bcl-2 homomeric complex has been developed. Accordingly, using a panel of mutants we identified in the loop a critical region for the process of Bcl-2 multimerisation. Our results indicate that the Bcl-2 loop posttranscriptional changes can modulate its ability to make homo and hetero-complexes, ultimately leading to functional modulation, suggesting an intriguing relationship between the ability of Bcl-2 to form multimeric complexes and its multi-functional role as a membrane channel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3amitochondria 3amodels 3amutants 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aMariani, Marisa1 aBartollino, Silvia1 aPetrella, Lella1 aPersico, Marco1 aOrteca, Nausicaa1 aScambia, Giovanni1 aShahabi, Shohreh1 aFerlini, Cristiano1 aFattorusso, Caterina0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

The experiment was realized using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with Central Composite Rotational Design (CCRD) with two factors, pH and sanguaza/seawater concentration in the range of 7 - 9 and 2 - 5 % (v/v), respectively. The culture media were stirred by bubbling air constantly (0.07 L/s) and continuously illuminated with 40 W of fluorescent light in glass containers of 1.5 L capacity at a temperature of 22.5 ± 2.1 °C. Using the Gompertz mathematical model was determined that from an 8.0 of pH and a ratio of 3.5% of sanguaza/seawater, the Tetraselmis suecica achieves maximum growth. An 8.71 of pH and a ratio of 4.56% of sanguaza/seawater allow the Tetraselmis suecica maximum growth (logN/N0) of 0.659, with a 12.3% of prediction error by applying a mathematical model of 2nd order. According to the study, the values obtained in sanguaza/seawater as a culture medium outperformed the traditionally used culture medium (Guillard F/2 with seawater). The results demonstrate the potential use of the sanguaza/seawater medium in scalable studies on pilot scale production of Tetraselmis suecica, with a view to the production of biodiesel  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTetraselmis suecica 3aair 3abiodiesel 3abiomass production 3aculture media 3afluorescent lighting 3aglass 3amathematical models 3apH 3aprediction 3aresponse surface methodology 3aseawater 3atemperature 0aGrowth kinetics 0aTetraselmis suecica 0asanguaza 0aresponse surface 0aGompertz model.1 aVíctor, Vásquez V.1 aFernando, Merino M.0 tScientia agropecuaria.g2011 Mar., v. 2, no. 1 p.13-23dUniversidad Nacional de TrujillowJournal:27801x2306-67417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17268/sci.agropecu.2011.01.023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014200155300002000297520121900317592002801536650004401564650002201608650002101630650002301651650001601674650002101690650001501711650002201726650003101748650001201779650001301791650001801804650001901822650001301841650003701854650003701891700001801928700001301946700001601959700001501975700001401990700001202004700001802016773012402034856007402158852000902232655001202241IND60640780920221119060333.0190505e20160621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064078092DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra06073k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Shuyao10aDirect electrochemistry of cholesterol oxidase and biosensing of cholesterol based on PSS/polymeric ionic liquid–graphene nanocomposite  ap. 59487-59496.  aA novel graphene nanocomposite, functionalized by polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) and poly(sodium-p-styrenesulfonate) (PSS), was successfully prepared and exhibited excellent conductivity, favourable biocompatibility and good film-forming properties as an electrode material. TEM showed that the nanocomposite possessed an individual nanosheet-like structure. Owing to the surface modification of graphene, PSS/PILs–GP can not only be well dispersed in aqueous solution, but also possesses a strong negative charge. Due to electrostatic interactions, positively charged cholesterol oxidase (ChOx) can be immobilized onto the surface of PSS/PILs–GP to form the ChOx/PSS/PILs–GP/GC electrode material. UV-vis and FT-IR spectroscopy were used to monitor the assembly process of the nanocomposite. Due to the conductivity and biocompatibility of PSS/PILs–GP, the immobilized ChOx exhibited enhanced direct electron transfer (DET) at a glassy carbon (GC) electrode. Furthermore, the ChOx/PSS/PILs–GP/GC electrode displayed excellent catalytic performance with a wide linear range of 10.5 × 10⁻⁶ to 10.4 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹, and a low detection limit of 3.5 μmol L⁻¹ for the detection of cholesterol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3abiocompatibility 3acatalytic activity 3acholesterol 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenzymes 3agraphene 3aionic liquids 3ananocomposites 3apolymers 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aWang, Yuxiang1 aMao, Hui1 aWang, Chong1 aXia, Lixin1 aZhang, Yu1 aGe, Hao1 aSong, Xi-Ming0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 21, v. 6, no. 64 p.59487-59496dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra06073k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245005600129300001300185500001900198520121800217592002801435650002301463650002001486650002701506650001201533650001101545650001601556650001401572650001801586650001801604650001501622650001101637650001701648653001201665653001201677653001501689653001701704653001201721773012601733852000901859655001201868IND60716702820221118053025.0201224e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071670282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, J.S.10aManagement of dodder in lucerne and Egyptian clover  ap. 6-10.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aField dodder (Cuscuta campestris), the most damaging annual obligate stem parasite is a serious problem in forage legumes lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) and Egyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.). Studies were conducted to investigate the interference of C.campestris densities in lucerne and the efficacy of herbicides for its control in lucerne and Egyptian clover. Even at Cuscuta density of 0.25 plants/m² (1 plant/4m²) caused detrimental effect on lucerne seed yield (85.5–95.3% loss). A high dose of pendimethalin (1000 g/ha) applied pre-emergence reduced Cuscuta emergence but was phytotoxic to lucerne as compared to lower doses and application at 14 days after sowing (DAS). Application of imazethapyr 100 g/ha and pendimethalin 750 g/ha at 14 DAS significantly improved green fodder yield of lucerne but failed to control Cuscuta infestation at reproductive stage resulting in poor seed yield. Method of seeding did not influence the population and green fodder yield of Egyptian clover and Cuscuta emergence. Post-emergence (at 14 DAS) application of pendimethalin 500–750 g/ha effectively controlled Cuscuta campestris in Egyptian clover and produced the maximum green fodder and seed yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCuscuta campestris 3aMedicago sativa 3aTrifolium alexandrinum 3aalfalfa 3aforage 3aimazethapyr 3aparasites 3apendimethalin 3aphytotoxicity 3aseed yield 3asowing 3aweed science 0aBerseem 0aCuscuta 0aHerbicides 0aInterference 0aLucerne0 tIndian journal of weed science.g2012, v. 44, no. 1 p.6-10dIndian Society of Weed SciencewJournal:2005x0974-81647nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002900155245013200184300001600316506002800332520152800360592002801888506003701916650002601953650001401979650001301993650001602006650001202022650002002034650001502054653001102069653002702080653001402107653001402121700002302135700001802158773009002176856009002266852000902356655001202365IND60774391220221215142819.0181227e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077439122DNAL7 a10.21776/ub.habitat.2018.029.3.162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAprilianto, Hendri Cahya10aPenerapan Jaringan Syaraf Tiruan Untuk Peramalan Penjualan Dalam Mendukung Pengembangan Agroindustri Coklat di Kabupaten Blitar  ap. 129-137.  aResource is Open Access  aUnstable sales in meeting the needs of chocolate products on the market by the chocolate processing unit in Blitar Regency have hampered the development of the cocoa agroindustry in the area. So that it has an impact on increasing production costs and inventory costs if there are products that are not sold out. On the other hand, if the fulfillment of the need for chocolate products in Blitar Regency is too small, there will be an increase in stock out costs and even loss of customers. Therefore, an accurate prediction is needed to be able to meet market needs with the right amount of production later. This study aims to model the ANN computing system with the smallest output error as a forecasting tool for chocolate sales in Blitar Regency and to analyze the accuracy of the forecasting method with testing data compared to forecasting the times series version. The method used in forecasting in this study is the artificial neural network method. Based on the calculation of demand forecasting using the artificial neural network method, it is found that the forecast sales of chocolate products at the beginning of the period from July 2017 to August 2017 will decrease. The lowest number of sales was in August 2017 which was 2306.22. While the highest number of requests occurred in January 2018 of 2546.93. So that in the month that experienced a decline in sales in forecasting, the comparison of sales forecasting results using the artificial neural network method was better than the times series method.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural industry 3achocolate 3ahabitats 3ainventories 3amarkets 3aneural networks 3aprediction 0acoklat 0ajaringan syaraf tiruan 0aperamalan 0apenjualan1 aKumalaningsih, Sri1 aSantoso, Imam0 tHabitat.g2018 Dec., v. 29, no. 3 p.129-137dUniversity of Brawijayax2338-20077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21776/ub.habitat.2018.029.3.163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01055naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003300144245011400177520010000291592002800391650003000419650001200449650001300461650002800474700002900502700003800531773012000569856007900689852000900768655001200777IND60766911520221119085621.0220211e20220129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076691152DNAL7 a10.3390/plants110303722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontoya-Martínez, Amelia C.10aBeneficial Microorganisms in Sustainable Agriculture: Harnessing Microbes’ Potential to Help Feed the World  aThe global population is projected to increase to near 10 billion people by the year 2050 [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3abeneficial microorganisms 3aharness 3aplanting 3asustainable agriculture1 aParra-Cota, Fannie Isela1 aSantos Villalobos, Sergio de los,0 tPlants.g2022 Jan. 29, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants110303723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01690naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245009500181300001800276520052000294592002800814650002300842650001700865650001200882650002200894650001600916700002500932700002300957700002600980700001801006700002101024700002101045700002101066700002901087773010601116856008501222852000901307655001201316IND60578946420221122050615.0170815e20150821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057894642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b019232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConstantinides, Christos

Beta-defensin proteins, expressed in the epididymis, continue to regulate sperm motility during capacitation and hyperactivation in the female reproductive tract. We characterized the mouse beta-defensin 41 (DEFB41), by generating a mouse model with iCre recombinase inserted into the first exon of the gene. The homozygous Defb41iCre/iCre knock-in mice lacked Defb41 expression and displayed iCre recombinase activity in the principal cells of the proximal epididymis. Heterozygous Defb41iCre/+ mice can be used to generate epididymis specific conditional knock-out mouse models. Homozygous Defb41iCre/iCre sperm displayed a defect in sperm motility with the flagella primarily bending in the pro-hook conformation while capacitated wild-type sperm more often displayed the anti-hook conformation.

This work aims to identify hydroxycinnamic acids and their derivatives in broa, a Portuguese traditional ethnic maize bread, and corresponding maize flours. Soluble and insoluble phenolic fractions of diverse maize flours and corresponding broas were prepared and analysed by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS (high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector and tandem mass spectrometry). Besides free hydroxycinnamic acids, mainly ferulic and p-coumaric acids, several structural isomers and stereoisomers of insoluble ferulic acid dehydrodimers (n = 18) and trimers (n = 11), were also identified. Hydroxycinnamic acid amides consisting of coumaroyl and feruloyl conjugates (n = 22) were present in both soluble and insoluble fractions of maize flours and breads, in different isomeric forms. A new compound was putatively identified as bis-N,N′-diferuloyl putrescine. Additionally, more complex and insoluble hydroxycinnamic acid amides, derived from ferulic acid dehydrodimers (n = 47) and trimers (n = 18), were also putatively identified for the first time, suggesting that hydroxycinnamic acid amides are also linked to maize cell walls. Since hydroxycinnamic derivatives were not only identified in maize flours, but also in broas, they can contribute to the antioxidant properties and beneficial health effects of maize-based foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamides 3aantioxidant activity 3acell walls 3aconstitutional isomers 3acorn 3adietary nutrient sources 3adiodes 3aferulic acid 3afoods 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ap-coumaric acid 3aputrescine 3astereoisomers 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aDuarte, Noélia 1 aMecha, Elsa 1 aBelo, Maria 1 aVaz Patto, Maria  Carlota1 aBronze, Maria  do Rosário0 tFoods.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods91014713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245010700164506002800271520166100299592002801960506003701988650001302025650002202038650002302060650001602083650002202099650001302121650002202134650002102156653001702177653002102194653001902215653002702234700001702261700001602278700001802294773012002312856007802432852000902510655001202519IND60774391420221207085410.0220330s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077439142DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha501125352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jiaqiang,10aAnalysis of codon usage pattern in Lonicera × heckrottii ‘Gold Flame’ based on chloroplast genome  aResource is Open Access  aCodon usage bias (CUB) was a unique feature of the genome, and revealing chloroplast genome codon usage bias can provide useful information for the evolution of plant species. Lonicera × heckrottii ‘Gold Flame’ is one of the members of the Lonicera genus with important ornamental value. However, the codon usage bias of chloroplast genome of this genotype has not been investigated. In this study, base compositions and various codon usage indices of 51 coding sequences from Lonicera × heckrottii ‘Gold Flame’ chloroplast genome was calculated, by Codon W, DnaSP, CUSP of EMBOSS and SPSS software. A total of 51 CDS of the Lonicera × heckrottii ‘Gold Flame’ chloroplast genome was selected to analyse codon usage bias. The results showed that the average GC content of 51 CDS sequences was 39.27%, and the average value of ENC was 48.75%. The chloroplast gene codon usage bias was weak, and preferred A/T ending. The general GC content order was GC1 (47.72%)>GC2 (39.89%)>GC3 (30.19%). Correlation analysis results showed that there was a significant positive correlation between GC content and GC1, GC2 and GC3 content. Combined with neutral plot analysis, ENC-plot and PR2-plot analysis, it is found that chloroplast gene codon usage preference was affected by mutations pressure and natural selection. In addition, the eight optimal codons in chloroplast genome were finally identified, codon bias ending with A/T. The study on the codon usage bias of Lonicera × heckrottii ‘Gold Flame’ provides a demonstration for exploring its genetic structure and molecular evolution mechanism, and provides a reference for molecular breeding.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLonicera 3achloroplast genes 3achloroplast genome 3acodon usage 3acomputer software 3agenotype 3anatural selection 3aornamental value 0agenetic code 0ainfluence factor 0aoptimal codons 0asynonymous codon usage1 aLIU, Huichun1 aWenting, XU1 aZhu, Kaiyuan,0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2022, v. 50, no. 1dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha501125353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03559naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001200155245007400167300001600241520180200257592002802059650002602087650002802113650002702141650001802168650001202186650001502198650002202213650001002235650001202245650001802257650001402275650001902289650001502308650001202323650001102335650001002346650001602356650001702372650004402389650002102433650001502454650001202469650001602481650001702497650001202514650002402526650001102550653001702561653002602578653001902604653000902623653002402632700005802656700001602714700001602730773007702746856008902823852000902912655001202921IND60558407620221117213238.0170105e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055840762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.10.1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Jie10aMetabolomic responses of Haliotis diversicolor to organotin compounds  ap. 860-869.  aOrganotin compounds, especially tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT), are a group of hazardous pollutants in marine environments. Haliotis diversicolor is an important marine model organism for environmental science. In this study, 1H NMR spectroscopy together with pattern recognition methods was used to investigate the responses of hepatopancreas and gill of Haliotis diversicolor to TBT and TPT exposure. It was found that obvious gender-, tissue- and compound-specific metabolomic alterations were induced after a 28-day exposure. TBT and TPT exposure not only caused the disturbance in energy metabolism and osmotic balance in hepatopancreas and gill tissues with different mechanisms, but also induced oxidative stresses. These metabolic alterations were highlighted in the accumulation of aspartate, uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine, uridine diphosphate glucose, guanosine and the depletion of leucine, isoleucine, valine, malonate, homarine, trigonelline in all exposure gills, as well as in the depletion of ATP, AMP, betaine in male exposure gills and pantothenate in male exposure hepatopancreases. The significant decreased aromatic amino acids (AAAs), lysine and glutamate in gills and increased betaine in hepatopancreases for TPT exposure together with increased glutamate and decreased betaine in gills and increased glutamate and glycine in hepatopancreases for TBT exposure demonstrated their specific metabolic characteristics. Among these characteristic metabolites, AAAs, lysine and glutamate in the gill as well as pantothenate in the hepatopancreas might be identified as potential biomarkers for TPT or TBT exposure in Haliotis diversicolor. The results provide a useful insight into the toxicological mechanisms of organotin compounds on Haliotis diversicolor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaliotis diversicolor 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aaspartic acid 3abetaine 3abiomarkers 3aenergy metabolism 3agills 3aglucose 3aglutamic acid 3aguanosine 3ahepatopancreas 3aisoleucine 3aleucine 3alysine 3amales 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidative stress 3apollutants 3atissues 3atributyltin 3atrigonelline 3auridine 3auridine diphosphate 3avaline 0aMetabolomics 0aHaliotis diversicolor 0aHepatopancreas 0aGill 0aOrganotin compounds1 aFeng, Jianghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8899-27501 aCai, Shuhui1 aChen, Zhong0 tChemosphere.g2017 Feb., v. 168 p.860-869dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.10.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245015200162300001800314520157000332592002801902650001601930650001501946650001301961650001101974650001201985650001701997650001102014700002002025700001702045700001802062700002202080700003002102700002602132700002302158700002502181700002202206700002302228700001902251773013202270856007502402852000902477655001202486IND60538481020170629000000.0160815e20120314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053848102DNAL7 a10.1021/ja21008022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedjanik, Katerina10aOrbital-Resolved Partial Charge Transfer from the Methoxy Groups of Substituted Pyrenes in Complexes with TetracyanoquinodimethaneA NEXAFS Study  ap. 4694-4699.  aIt is demonstrated that the near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) provides a powerful local probe of functional groups in novel charge transfer (CT) compounds and their electronic properties. Microcrystals of tetra-/hexamethoxypyrene as donors with the strong acceptor tetracyano-p-quinodimethane (TMP/HMP-TCNQ) were grown by vapor diffusion. The oxygen and nitrogen K-edge spectra are spectroscopic fingerprints of the functional groups in the donor and acceptor moieties, respectively. The orbital selectivity of the NEXAFS pre-edge resonances allows us to precisely elucidate the participation of specific orbitals in the charge transfer process. Upon complex formation, the intensities of several resonances change substantially and a new resonance occurs in the oxygen K-edge spectrum. This gives evidence of a corresponding change of hybridization of specific orbitals in the functional groups of the donor (those derived from the frontier orbitals 2e and 6a₁ of the isolated methoxy group) and acceptor (orbitals b₃g, aᵤ, b₁g, and b₂ᵤ, all located at the cyano group) with π*-orbitals of the ring systems. Along with this intensity effect, the resonance positions associated with the oxygen K-edge (donor) and nitrogen K-edge (acceptor) shift to higher and lower photon energies in the complex, respectively. A calculation based on density functional theory qualitatively explains the experimental results. NEXAFS measurements shine light on the action of the functional groups and elucidate charge transfer on a submolecular level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphotons 3aspectroscopy 3avapors1 aChercka, Dennis1 aNagel, Peter1 aMerz, Michael1 aSchuppler, Stefan1 aBaumgarten, M.q(Martin),1 aMüllen, K.q(Klaus),1 aNepijko, Sergej A.1 aElmers, Hans-Joachim1 aSchönhense, Gerd1 aJeschke, Harald O.1 aValenti, Roser0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Mar. 14, v. 134, no. 10 p.4694-4699dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja21008023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02055naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002600112245005500138300001600193506002800209520106400237592002801301506003701329650001601366650001701382650001101399650002001410650001101430650001901441651001401460653001301474653001601487653001501503653000901518700002001527700002401547773010101571852000901672655001201681IND60774391620221207085358.0120125e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077439162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPURNAMA, PURIN CANDRA10aReview: Mangrove ecosystem in Java: 2.

Because of its functions, wide range of people paid attention whenever mangrove restoration taken place. Mangrove restoration potentially increases mangrove resource value, protect the coastal area from destruction, conserve biodiversity, fish production and both of directly and indirectly support the life of surrounding people. This paper outlines the activities of mangrove restoration on Java island. The extensive research has been carried out on the ecology, structure and functioning of the mangrove ecosystem. However, the findings have not been interpreted in a management framework, thus mangrove forests around the world continue to be over-exploited, converted to aquaculture ponds, and polluted. We strongly argue that links between research and sustainable management of mangrove ecosystem should be established.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaquaculture 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3afish production 3apeople 3asocioeconomics 3aIndonesia 0amangrove 0arestoration 0amanagement 0aJava1 aWINARNO, KUSUMO1 aSETYAWAN, AHMAD DWI0 tBiodiversitas.g2004 July, v. 5, no. 2 p.105-118dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245011000164300001200274520099900286592002801285653001501313653002401328653001301352653000801365653001701373653002001390700001801410700002501428773010501453856008301558852000901641655001201650IND60638185120221119145345.0190426e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063818512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biteb.2018.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorya, Raj10aUtilization of glycerol by Bacillus sp.

Primary screening of the selected bacterium strain was performed by Nile red staining and afterward visualization under a fluorescence microscope. Nile red fluorescence measurement of bacterial culture was also investigated based on absorbance of spectrofluorometer. GC–MS, 1H NMR, TEM, and FT-IR analysis revealed that the produced material is PHV, which is co-polymer of PHB. Optimization of process parameters was performed to enhance the production of PHA. A substantial increase in PHA production from 1.29g/L to 4.44g/L (85.19% of CDW) was observed after optimization of process parameters, shows the importance of optimization.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBioplastic 0aPolyhydroxyvalerate 0aGlycerol 0aTEM 0aBacillus sp. 0aCell dry weight1 aManish Kumar,1 aThakur, Indu Shekhar0 tBioresource technology reports.g2018 June, v. 2 p.1-6dElsevier LtdwJournal:26760x2589-014X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2018.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245015100168300001600319520093300335592002801268650004401296650003701340650002801377650002501405650001801430650001401448650002001462650001401482650002601496650001901522650002401541650001901565650003301584653002101617653003101638653001901669653001501688653002601703700001801729700001601747773013501763856008601898852000901984655001201993IND60552865920221119202050.0170607e20150920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055286592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.01.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJu, Junping10aSuperhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic PVDF membranes via plasma-induced surface PEGDA for effective separation of oil-in-water emulsions  ap. 151-157.  aThis work describes the surface grafting of poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane with poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) via low-pressure plasma-induced graft polymerization. The chemical composition and microstructure of the surface modified PEGylated PVDF membranes were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning lectron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact angle measurements. By tuning polymerization conditions, a superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic PVDF-g-PEGDA membrane was successfully prepared. Results show that the as-prepared PVDF-g-PEGDA membranes can effectively separate oil-in-water emulsions with high separation efficiency and high fluxes under ultralow pressure. Importantly, the membrane showed excellent mechanical properties, which was also important parameter for practical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3achemical composition 3acontact angle 3aemulsions 3aethylene glycol 3afluorides 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 0aSuperhydrophilic 0aUnderwater superoleophobic 0aPVDF membranes 0aSeparation 0aOil–water emulsions1 aWang, Tingmei1 aWang, Qihua0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2015 Sept. 20, v. 481 p.151-157dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.01.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245005300209300001600262520140500278592002801683650001501711650002501726650002501751650001701776650001301793650002801806650002001834650001601854650001101870650000901881650000901890650002701899650000901926650002601935650001401961650001601975700002501991700002302016773012802039856008402167990002302251852000902274655001202283IND60090030320221122124519.0141110e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009003032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.02.0072doi7 aPMC30789792pmcid7 a213205352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovac, Suzana10aGastrins, iron homeostasis and colorectal cancer  ap. 889-895.  aThe peptide hormone gastrin has been identified as a major regulator of acid secretion and a potent mitogen for normal and malignant gastrointestinal cells. The importance of gastric acid in the absorption of dietary iron first became evident 50years ago when iron deficiency anemia was recognized as a long-term consequence of partial gastrectomy. This review summarizes the connections between circulating gastrins, iron status and colorectal cancer. Gastrins bind two ferric ions with micromolar affinity and, in the case of non-amidated forms of the hormone, iron binding is essential for biological activity in vitro and in vivo. The demonstration of an interaction between gastrin and transferrin by biochemical techniques led to the proposal that gastrins catalyze the loading of transferrin with iron. Several lines of evidence, including the facts that the concentrations of circulating gastrins are increased in mice and humans with the iron overload disease hemochromatosis and that transferrin saturation positively correlates with circulating gastrin concentration, suggest the potential involvement of gastrins in iron homeostasis. Conversely, recognition that ferric ions play an unexpected role in the biological activity of gastrins may assist in the development of useful therapies for colorectal carcinoma and other disorders of mucosal proliferation in the gastrointestinal tract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abioactive properties 3acolorectal neoplasms 3agastric acid 3agastrins 3agastrointestinal system 3ahemochromatosis 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aions 3airon 3airon deficiency anemia 3amice 3anutrient deficiencies 3asecretion 3atransferrin1 aAnderson, Gregory J.1 aBaldwin, Graham S.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

The need to conduct surveys is motivated by the advisability of combining two massive annual planned medical and prophylactic measures in reindeer husbandry (vaccination against Siberian sores and pharmacotherapy of edemagenosis), associated with large economic costs and labor intensity of the process. As a result of the conducted studies, the physicochemical compatibility of ivere-, avermectins and anti-STI vaccine strain 55 VNIVViM and harmlessness for deer was established. At the same time, a stable immunity against anthrax with an antibody titer from 1: 160 to 1: 640 and a 100% efficacy of larvocidal action against larvae of the subcutaneous gadfly is formed in the animals. The article also presents a split scheme for an unphaxic injection of medicinal and prophylactic drugs to deer, which contributes to a reduction in labor costs and a reduction in the timing of appropriate interventions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanthrax 3aantibodies 3aavermectins 3adrug therapy 3aimmunity 3alabor 3areindeer 3avaccination 3avaccines 0areindeer 0aedemagenoz 0aanthrax 0avaccination 0adrug treatment 0aiver- 0aavermectins 0atechnology 0aship0 tAgrarnaâ nauka Evro-Severo-Vostoka.g2017 Aug., v. 0, no. 4 p.44-47dFederal Agricultural Research Center of the North-East named N.V.

Elucidation and understanding of the hemicelluloses from bamboo play an important role in the efficient conversion of bamboo into biofuels and bioproducts. This review summarized the recent reports on hemicelluloses from bamboo, including immunohistochemical localization, focused on extraction and purification methods, chemical components, characterization of structural features, as well as physicochemical properties.

But when multiple stressors act simultaneously, the results are often difficult to predict. Effects of multiple anthropogenic stressors and their interactions with community processes are of particular concern in estuarine habitats because of their vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts and their provision of valuable ecosystem services such as fisheries production and sediment stabilization. Two stressors, warming temperatures and reduced light availability due to suspended materials, are expected to simultaneously affect important habitats such as seagrass systems, but the impacts of these stressors may be influenced by community processes such as immigration. Immigration of propagules can alter diversity and relative species abundances, rescue populations from extinction, and modify the capacity of communities to respond to environmental conditions. Using an experimental eelgrass (Zostera marina) system, we examined how warming, reduced light availability (shading), and periodic immigration of crustacean grazers influenced diversity, biomass, and structure of this community. Shading generally had large effects, and reduced biomass of all primary producers but did not affect grazer biomass. Warming reduced epiphytic algal biomass but only in the absence of grazers, while it increased sessile invertebrate biomass overall. Immigration of crustacean grazers did not interact significantly with stressors, and had little effect overall. Immigration did not influence diversity of grazers, relative abundance of grazer species, or biomass of primary producers and sessile invertebrates, however, it did increase biomass of grazers. Overall, reduced light availability by shading had strong effects on primary producers, whereas warming generally had weaker effects that differed with grazer presence. Thus, our results show that the impacts of reduced light availability and warming were independent and context specific, while crustacean grazer immigration effects were minimal in this model eelgrass system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3aZostera marina 3aalgae 3aanthropogenic activities 3aanthropogenic stressors 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aepiphytes 3aestuaries 3aextinction 3afisheries 3ahabitats 3aimmigration 3ainvertebrates 3amodels 3aseagrasses 3asediments 3ashade 3ashorelines 3atemperature 3atrophic relationships 0aSeagrass 0aStressors 0aImmigration 0aPropagules 0aClimate change1 aDuffy, J.

The effect of ozonation on genotoxicity in reclaimed water was investigated. It was found that ozonation decreased the genotoxicy dramatically in three tertiary treatment plants. In the further batch ozonation experiment in laboratory, secondary effluent sample used exhibited the genotoxicity of (41.1 ± 4.1) μg 4NQO/L. Ozonation with a dose of 10 mg O3/L completely removed the genotoxicity in secondary effluent. However, after ozonation, the dissolved organic carbonvalue of the sample didn't change much but the specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) value dropped sharply. With the help of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ozonation was found to change chemical aliphatic carbon and C–O of the dissolved arganic matter, which might be the reason of the significant decreases of SUVA and genotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorbance 3acarbon 3aecosystems 3agenotoxicity 3ahuman health 3aozonation 3awastewater 0aozonation 0agenotoxicy 0aspecific ultraviolet absorbance 0afourier transform infrared spectroscopy1 aWu, Qianyuan1 aYang, Yang1 aHu, Hongying0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2014 June 01, v. 26 p.1243-1248dElsevier B.V.aThe Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(13)60595-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008600172300001600258520101500274592002801289650001901317650001101336650002901347650001401376700002301390700002101413700002601434700002001460700002301480700002401503700002601527700002001553700002501573700002301598700002301621700002501644700002301669773008301692856008401775852000901859655001201868IND60553994420221117212016.0161023e20150806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055399442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2015.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiggs, Martin R.10aBOD1L Is Required to Suppress Deleterious Resection of Stressed Replication Forks  ap. 462-477.  aRecognition and repair of damaged replication forks are essential to maintain genome stability and are coordinated by the combined action of the Fanconi anemia and homologous recombination pathways. These pathways are vital to protect stalled replication forks from uncontrolled nucleolytic activity, which otherwise causes irreparable genomic damage. Here, we identify BOD1L as a component of this fork protection pathway, which safeguards genome stability after replication stress. Loss of BOD1L confers exquisite cellular sensitivity to replication stress and uncontrolled resection of damaged replication forks, due to a failure to stabilize RAD51 at these forks. Blocking DNA2-dependent resection, or downregulation of the helicases BLM and FBH1, suppresses both catastrophic fork processing and the accumulation of chromosomal damage in BOD1L-deficient cells. Thus, our work implicates BOD1L as a critical regulator of genome integrity that restrains nucleolytic degradation of damaged replication forks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFanconi anemia 3agenome 3ahomologous recombination 3aresection1 aReynolds, John J.,1 aWinczura, Alicja1 aBlackford, Andrew N.1 aBorel, Valérie1 aMiller, Edward S.,1 aZlatanou, Anastasia1 aNieminuszczy, Jadwiga1 aRyan, Ellis L.1 aDavies, Nicholas J.1 aStankovic, Tatjana1 aBoulton, Simon J.1 aNiedzwiedz, Wojciech1 aStewart, Grant S.0 tMolecular cell.g2015 Aug. 06, v. 59 p.462-477dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245006500205506007600270520150200346592002801848506003701876650002101913650002001934650001701954650001401971650001401985650001001999650002602009650004202035650001402077650001502091650001102106650002602117650001802143700002002161700002002181700002602201700002102227700002602248773011902274856007702393852000902470655001202479IND60660486220221207105604.0190823e20190816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066048622DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100806202doi7 aPMC67230422pmcid7 a314263522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoorni, Aboozar 10aTranscriptome Landscape Variation in the Genus <i>Thymus</i>  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAmong the Lamiaceae family, the genus Thymus is an economically important genera due to its medicinal and aromatic properties. Most Thymus molecular research has focused on the determining the phylogenetic relationships between different species, but no published work has focused on the evolution of the transcriptome across the genus to elucidate genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Hence, in this study, the transcriptomes of five different Thymus species were generated and analyzed to mine putative genes involved in thymol and carvacrol biosynthesis. High-throughput sequencing produced ~43 million high-quality reads per sample, which were assembled de novo using several tools, then further subjected to a quality evaluation. The best assembly for each species was used as queries to search within the UniProt, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) and TF (Transcription Factors) databases. Mining the transcriptomes resulted in the identification of 592 single-copy orthogroups used for phylogenetic analysis. The data showed strongly support a close genetic relationship between Thymus vulgaris and Thymus daenensis. Additionally, this study dates the speciation events between 1.5&ndash;2.1 and 9&ndash;10.2 MYA according to different methodologies. Our study provides a global overview of genes related to the terpenoid pathway in Thymus, and can help establish an understanding of the relationship that exists among Thymus species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aThymus daenensis 3aThymus vulgaris 3abiosynthesis 3acarvacrol 3adatabases 3agenes 3agenetic relationships 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aphylogeny 3aterpenoids 3athymol 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome1 aBorna, Tahereh 1 aAlemardan, Ali 1 aChakrabarti, Manohar 1 aHunt, Arthur G.,1 aBombarely, Aureliano 0 tGenes.g2019 Aug. 16, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100806203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013400166300001600300520094100316592002801257650002101285650001401306650002201320650002501342650001701367650001001384650002501394650002201419650001801441653002601459653002701485653002601512653002501538700001801563700001501581700001501596700001901611700001501630773010801645856008601753852000901839655001201848IND60540819920221120024208.0190318e20141126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054081992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.06.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Rui10aFlexible, highly transparent and iridescent all-cellulose hybrid nanopaper with enhanced mechanical strength and writable surface  ap. 264-271.  aWith the development of flexible electronic devices, there is increasing requirement for the inexpensive and environmental-friendly substrates. Cellulose paper has gained great attention because of its abundance, biodegradability and renewability. In this paper, we designed a hybrid nanopaper by introducing native cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) into cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs) matrix, which achieved a high optical transmittance while retaining iridescence under polarizing film. This nanopaper is less expensive than neat CNFs-based nanopaper and more feasible for large-scale production. Besides, our transparent hybrid nanopaper possesses the writable surface like regular paper. Compared with commercial paper, however, hybrid nanopaper shows superior optical properties and low surface roughness. The combination of these characteristics makes this nanopaper an excellent candidate for substrates of flexible electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3aelectronic equipment 3ananocrystals 3apaper 3astrength (mechanics) 3asurface roughness 3atransmittance 0aCellulose nanofibrils 0aCellulose nanowhiskers 0aTransparent nanopaper 0aFlexible electronics1 aHan, Yangyang1 aWang, Yaru1 aZhang, Wei1 aZhang, Xinxing1 aLu, Canhui0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 Nov. 26, v. 113 p.264-271dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.06.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02117naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245011500165300001400280520102500294592002801319653002201347653002901369653002401398653002301422653002201445700002001467700002101487700002201508700006201530773010701592856008301699852000901782655001201791IND60638185320221119145255.0190426e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063818532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biteb.2018.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKipf, Elena10aSystematic investigation of anode materials for microbial fuel cells with the model organism G. sulfurreducens  ap. 29-37.  aDifferent carbon and metal-based anode materials for microbial fuel cells were systematically investigated with a pure culture of the model organism G. sulfurreducens. The highest limiting current density of 756±15μAcm−2 at −0.253±0.037V vs. SCE was achieved with graphite foil using a step-wise galvanostatic technique. But also the application of completely different anode materials such as activated carbon cloth, stainless steel and graphite felt led to similar high limiting current densities, suggesting that G. sulfurreducens is able to use a large range of substantially different anode materials as external electron acceptor. Additionally, we could show that a step-wise galvanostatic technique to record polarization curves yields similar current densities as potentiostatic control at −0.400V vs. SCE with the investigated carbon-based materials. In case of stainless steel these techniques yield slightly different results, presumably due to an effect related to the material's surface properties.  aPublisher supplied data 0aG. sulfurreducens 0aAnode material screening 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aCarbon-based anode 0aMetal-based anode1 aErben, Johannes1 aZengerle, Roland1 aGescher, Johannes1 aKerzenmacher, Sven1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1217-97360 tBioresource technology reports.g2018 June, v. 2 p.29-37dElsevier LtdwJournal:26760x2589-014X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2018.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01945naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013600167300001600303520069100319592002801010650001801038650001901056650001901075650001801094650001701112650001101129653001601140653003401156653003601190653003401226653002101260700001501281700001901296700001501315773013401330856008601464852000901550655001201559IND60552866020221120171824.0161021e20150320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055286602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.01.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Song10aFabrication of highly ordered porous superhydrophobic polystyrene films by electric breath figure and surface chemical modification  ap. 294-299.  aTo apply SiO2 nanoparticles to assist the formation of polystyrene, PS, film via the electric breath figure, EBF, method in relation to various voltages, the obtained PS/SiO2 films showed highly ordered pore structures and the pore diameter was gradually reduced with the applied voltage increase.

The most effective drugs for treating influenza are the neuraminidase inhibitors, but resistance to these inhibitors has emerged, and additional drug discovery research on neuraminidase and other targets is needed. Traditional methods of neuraminidase production from embryonated eggs are cumbersome, while insect cell derived protein is less reflective of neuraminidase produced during human infection. Herein we describe a method for producing neuraminidase from a human cell line, HEK293-6E, and demonstrate the method by producing the neuraminidase from the 1918 H1N1 pandemic influenza strain. This method produced high levels of soluble neuraminidase expression (>3000 EU/mL), was enhanced by including a secretion signal from a viral chemokine binding protein, and does not require co-expression of additional proteins. The neuraminidase produced was of sufficient quantity and purity to support high resolution crystal structure determination. The structure solved using this protein conformed to the previously reported structure. Notably the glycosylation at three asparagine residues was superior in quality to that from insect cell derived neuraminidase. This method of production of neuraminidase should prove useful in further studies, such as the characterisation of inhibitor binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthomyxoviridae 3aasparagine 3achemokines 3acrystal structure 3adrugs 3aglycosylation 3ahuman cell lines 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ainfluenza 3ainsects 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apandemic 3asecretion 3asialidase 3aviruses1 aTanner, John J.1 aKrause, Kurt L.0 tViruses.g2021 Sept. 22, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131018933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01405naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245004500166300001800211520056100229592002800790650001900818650002000837650001300857650001500870700002100885700002200906773010300928856007501031852000901106655001201115IND60531316720221122130327.0160723e20131223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053131672DNAL7 a10.1021/bi40157092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunaway-Mariano, Debra10aW.

RT-PCR amplification of the intergenic regions showed that the genes dcmA, METDI2657, and METDI2658 formed an operon. Orthologs of the METDI2657 and METDI2658 genes were also found in the DCM destructors Methylopila helvetica DM9, Methylorhabdus multivorans DM13 and DM15, Ancylobacter dichloromethanicus DM16, and Methylobacterium extorquens DM17. A mobilized suicide vector pK18mob was used to obtain a knock-out mutant of M. dichloromethanicum DM4 (NOK353) with the “turned-off” METDI2657 gene, the nucleotide sequence of which was interrupted by insertion of a gentamycin cassette. After cultivation on methanol, the NOK353 mutant had a lower rate of growth on DCM than the wild type strain DM4.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAncylobacter 3aMethylobacterium dichloromethanicum 3aMethylobacterium extorquens 3aMethylopila helvetica 3aMethylorhabdus multivorans 3agentamicin 3aintergenic DNA 3aknockout mutants 3amessenger RNA 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3amicrobial growth 3anucleotide sequences 3aoperon 3aplasmid vectors 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction1 aFedorov, D.

However levels of access and delivery are unknown. Furthermore there is no research on perceived efficacy of physiotherapy or the use of complementary and alternative medicine in people with progressive MS in the United Kingdom.An online survey was carried out via the UK MS Register. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of progressive MS, a member of UK MS Register and 18 years or older. The survey asked participants regarding access and delivery of physiotherapy; perceived efficacy of physiotherapy and interventions received; barriers to accessing physiotherapy and use of complementary and alternative medicine. The following additional data were supplied from the UK MS Register: demographics, EQ5D, MSIS-29 physical and psychological sub-scales and geographical data.Total number of respondents was 1,298 from an identified 2,538 potential registrants: 87% could access physiotherapy services, 77% received physiotherapy from the NHS and 32% were currently receiving physiotherapy. The most common interventions received were home exercise programme (86%), exercises with a physiotherapist (74%) and advice/education (67%). 40% had recently used complementary and alternative medicine.Perceived efficacy of physiotherapy was high with 70% reporting it to be either ‘beneficial’ or ‘very beneficial’. Main barriers to accessing physiotherapy were mobility, fatigue, continence, transport issues, requiring someone to go with them and pain.Access to physiotherapy was high with most people reporting it as beneficial. However 13% reported not having access indicating a gap in accessibility. Considering some of the barriers reported may allow physiotherapy services to address this gap in accessibility.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEQ-5D-3L 0aMS 0aMSIS-29 0aNHS 0aSD 0aProgressive multiple sclerosis 0aPhysiotherapy 0aAccess 0aRehabilitation 0aComplementary therapies1 aCoulter, Elaine1 aMattison, Paul1 aMcFadyen, Angus1 aMiller, Linda1 aPaul, Lorna0 tMultiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders.g2017 Feb., v. 12 p.64-69dElsevier B.V.x2211-03487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2017.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02092naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100007600144245007700220500001900297500002000316520095600336592002801292650001601320650001901336650001501355650001901370650001401389650001701403700003701420700003001457700003401487700002101521773011301542856007801655852000901733655001201742IND60730228520210418000000.0210305e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073022852DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2020002102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaixão e Silva, Giselle de Lima1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9838-566310aPurple and Beige‐Fleshed Sweet Potato Starches Modified by Autoclaving  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, the effects on the morphological, functional, pasting, and thermal properties of purple (PSP) and beige (BSP)‐fleshed sweet potato starches, resulting from the application of the physical autoclave method (at 121 °C and 1.1 Kgf cm⁻²) under different moisture conditions and exposure times, are evaluated. The micrograph shows cracks on the surfaces of the starch granules exposed for 15 and 60 min with 30% moisture. The maximum points on the response surface graphs show that the treatment increases the initial and peak gelatinization temperatures, as well as the pasting temperature and the water absorption and solubility values. In relation to the pasting properties, there is a reduction in both the final viscosity and setback values of the autoclaved starches. Thus, the method proves to be useful for the modification of these native starches and for future research with their applications in different processed foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoclaving 3agelatinization 3asolubility 3asweet potatoes 3aviscosity 3awater uptake1 aBento, Juliana Aparecida Correia1 aBataus, Luiz Artur Mendes1 aSoares Júnior, Manoel Soares1 aCaliari, Márcio0 tStärke =.g2021 Mar., v. 73, no. 3-4 p.e2000210-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2020002103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012200173520201400295592002802309650001302337650001902350650001202369650001802381650002302399650001402422650001502436650002302451650001702474650001402491650001702505653001602522653001902538653002502557653002702582700002202609700001502631773011402646856008602760852000902846655001202855IND60720010120221120034544.0210715e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072001012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1247552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoning, Jasper.T.10aBiodegradation of third-generation organic antifouling biocides and their hydrolysis products in marine model systems  aThe environmental fate for some selected antifouling biocides, dichlofluanid, tolylfluanid, tralopyril, and medetomidine, is relatively poorly understood with nearly all data derived from the assessment reports. Water/sediment systems and biofilms were used to determine biodegradation of the antifouling biocides. Dichlofluanid and tolylfluanid are known to hydrolyze to form DMSA (N,N-dimethyl-N′-phenylsulfamide) and DMST (N,N-Dimethyl-N′-(4-methylphenyl)sulfamide), respectively. DMSA did not show biodegradation, but it was shown to transform abiotically into N,N-dimethylsulfamide (N,N-DMS). In contrast, the structurally similar DMST did show biodegradation with a half-life of 5.78 days. The resulting transformation product of the biodegradation of DMST is also N,N-DMS. N,N-DMS accounted for the majority of the mass balance after 27 days in the water/sediment systems. Moreover, the biofilm systems also degraded both DMSA and DMST to N,N-DMS. The hydrolysis product of tralopyril, called BCCPCA (3-bromo-5-(4-chlorophenyl)−4-cyano-1 H-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid), was not metabolized in the experiments and remained persistent. For this compound, a new log Kₒw of 2.47 was determined since the previously reported Kₒw value seemed to overestimate sediment partitioning. Medetomidine was removed from the water/sediment system, though, not significantly more than the control. However, a transformation product (medetomidine-acid) was detected in the incubation but not in the control, pointing to limited biodegradation. These results show that tolylfluanid can be rapidly removed by biodegradation in the marine environment, while dichlofluanid, tralopyril, and medetomidine remained in the system for a longer period of time. The prolonged stability of these biocides could mean that there is potential for accumulation in the environment. This potential is also there for the DMSA (dichlofluanid) and DMST (tolylfluanid) derived transformation product N,N-DMS, which was recalcitrant.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocides 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3adichlofluanid 3aenvironmental fate 3ahalf life 3ahydrolysis 3amarine environment 3amedetomidine 3asediments 3atolylfluanid 0aDegradation 0aTransformation 0aAntifouling biocides 0aWater/sediment systems1 aBollmann, Ulla.E.1 aBester, K.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 406 p.124755-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1247553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245012500167520155300292592002801845650001901873650002901892650001901921650001901940650001801959650001901977650001201996650001102008650001002019650001102029650001802040650002002058650001402078650001902092650001202111650002502123700002102148700001902169700002902188700002202217700001902239700002002258773012102278856007902399852000902478655001202487IND60787863620221122042711.0220811e20220728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078786362DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111519612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinis, Lia-Tânia 10aWater Deficit Timing Differentially Affects Physiological Responses of Grapevines Infected with Lasiodiplodia theobromae  aDiseases and climate change are major factors limiting grape productivity and fruit marketability. Lasiodiplodia theobromae is a fungus of the family Botryosphaeriaceae that causes Botryosphaeria dieback of grapevine worldwide. Abiotic stress may change host vitality and impact susceptibility to the pathogen and/or change the pathogen’s life cycle. However, the interaction between both stress drivers is poorly understood for woody plants. We addressed the hypothesis that distinct morpho-physiological and biochemical responses are induced in grapevine (Vitis vinifera)–L. theobromae interactions depending on when water deficits are imposed. Grapevines were submitted to water deficit either before or after fungus inoculation. Water deficit led to the reduction of the net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate, and increased the abscisic acid concentration regardless of fungal inoculation. L. theobromae inoculation before water deficit reduced plant survival by 50% and resulted in the accumulation of jasmonic acid and reductions in malondialdehyde levels. Conversely, grapevines inoculated after water deficit showed an increase in proline and malondialdehyde content and all plants survived. Overall, grapevines responded differently to the primary stress encountered, with consequences in their physiological responses. This study reinforces the importance of exploring the complex water deficit timing × disease interaction and the underlying physiological responses involved in grapevine performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotryosphaeria 3aLasiodiplodia theobromae 3aVitis vinifera 3aabiotic stress 3aabscisic acid 3aclimate change 3adieback 3afruits 3afungi 3agrapes 3ajasmonic acid 3amalondialdehyde 3apathogens 3aphotosynthesis 3aproline 3astomatal conductance1 aJesus, Cláudia 1 aAmaral, Joana 1 aGómez-Cadenas, Aurelio 1 aCorreia, Barbara 1 aAlves, Arthur,1 aPinto, Glória 0 tPlants.g2022 July 28, v. 11, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111519613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01358naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010800166506002800274520019500302592002800497506003700525653007700562653003600639653005100675653008600726700001900812700002400831773011000855856008200965852000901047655001201056IND60774908220221207142405.0190110e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077490822DNAL7 a10.15393/j4.art.2018.55682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOksana, Gontar10aImplementation of continuous environmental education in the Polar Alpine Botanical Garden and Institute  aResource is Open Access  aThe directions of educational activities of the Polar-Alpine Botanical Garden-Institute as an example of the implementation of continuous environmental educationare presented in the article.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 0aнепрерывное экологическое образование 0aботанический сад 0aколлекции живых растений 0aобразовательно-реабилитационные программы.1 aOlesya, Zotova1 aIrina, Kalashnikova0 tHortus botanicus.g2018 Dec., v. 13, no. 1dPetrozavodsk State UniversitywJournal:27791x1994-38497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15393/j4.art.2018.55683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245011800202300001400320506007600334520105700410592002801467506003701495650001401532650002501546650001001571650001201581650003301593650001201626650001401638650001801652651001101670651001101681653001401692653001401706653000901720653000801729653001101737700002301748773012401771856007401895852000901969655001201978IND60219815720221207071500.0151115e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6021981572DNAL7 a10.1111/jvec.121282doi7 aPMC48827632pmcid7 a260471802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorris, Laura C.10aPhylogeny of Anopheline (Diptera: Culicidae) Species in Southern Africa, Based on Nuclear and Mitochondrial Genes  ap. 16-27.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA phylogeny of anthropophilic and zoophilic anopheline mosquito species was constructed, using the nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) genes. The ITS2 alignment, typically difficult due to its noncoding nature and large size variations, was aided by using predicted secondary structure, making this phylogenetically useful gene more amenable to investigation. This phylogeny is unique in explicitly including zoophilic, non-vector anopheline species in order to illustrate their relationships to malaria vectors. Two new, cryptic species, Anopheles funestus-like and Anopheles rivulorum-like, were found to be present in Zambia for the first time. Sequences from the D3 region of the 28S rDNA suggest that the Zambian An. funestus-like may be a hybrid or geographical variant of An. funestus-like, previously reported in Malawi. This is the first report of An. rivulorum-like sympatric with An. rivulorum (Leeson), suggesting that these are separate species rather than geographic variants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3ahybrids 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amalaria 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aMalawi 3aZambia 0aAnopheles 0aphylogeny 0aITS2 0aCOI 0aZambia1 aNorris, Douglas E.0 tJournal of vector ecology.g2015 June, v. 40, no. 1 p.16-27dSociety for Vector EcologywJournal:19531x1081-17107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvec.121283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245016400167300001400331520133400345592002801679650001301707650001301720650000901733650003001742650001301772650001101785650002601796650002501822700002001847700002001867700001601887700001901903700002101922773008501943856008502028852000902113655001202122IND60567067720221117050936.0181002e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056706772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2017.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyun Su10aVolume control of expanded graphite based on inductively coupled plasma and enhanced thermal conductivity of epoxy composite by formation of the filler network  ap. 40-46.  aExpanded graphite (EG) is noticed as a thermally conductive carbon filler because of its advantages of a unique structure in which graphite sheets are intercalated and relatively a low price among carbon fillers. Nevertheless, the relationship between the volume expansion (≈interlayer spacing) of EG and the thermal conductivity of EG filled composites has been rarely reported on. We designed and developed an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) for the rapid expansion of a expandable graphite precursor. Greater extent of volume expansion of EG was observed at higher ICP treatment temperature and the thermal conductivity of the composites was increased with the expanded volume of the filler, at the same filler content. Based on a quantitative analysis on filler size within the composites using non-destructive micro-computed tomography, larger size of three dimensional (3D) thermally conductive filler networks with respect to the volume expansion were obviously confirmed. Excellent thermal conductivity (the highest value of 10.77 W/m·K) and heat dissipation characteristic of the composites were derived when the 3D thermally conductive EG filler network was generated at a larger size. These findings can contribute to realizing effective and low-priced thermally conductive carbon filler based polymer composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepoxides 3agraphene 3aheat 3amicro-computed tomography 3apolymers 3aprices 3aquantitative analysis 3athermal conductivity1 aKim, Jong Hyeok1 aKim, Woo-Young,1 aLee, Hun Su1 aKim, Seong Yun1 aKhil, Myung-Seob0 tCarbon.g2017 Aug., v. 119 p.40-46dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010300165300001600268520095800284592002801242650001101270650002301281650001101304650002901315650001101344650001501355650001001370650001901380650001701399650001501416650002301431650002001454653002601474653003001500653002701530700001701557700001701574700001501591773017901606856008501785852000901870655001201879IND60547130820221120114336.0160903e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054713082DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(13)60569-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Qiang10aReview on water leakage control in distribution networks and the associated environmental benefits  ap. 955-961.  aWater supply is the primary element of an urban system. Due to rapid urbanization and water scarcity, maintaining a stable and safe water supply has become a challenge to many cities, whereas a large amount of water is lost from the pipes of distribution systems. Water leakage is not only a waste of water resources, but also incurs great socio-economic costs. This article presents a comprehensive review on the potential water leakage control approaches and specifically discusses the benefits of each to environmental conservation. It is concluded that water leakage could be further reduced by improving leakage detection capability through a combination of predictive modeling and monitoring instruments, optimizing pipe maintenance strategy, and developing an instant pressure regulation system. The environment could benefit from these actions because of water savings and the reduction of energy consumption as well as greenhouse gas emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aecosystem services 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apipes 3asocioeconomics 3aurbanization 3awastewater 3awater conservation 3awater shortages 0awater leakage control 0awater distribution system 0aenvironmental benefits1 aLiu, Ruiping1 aChen, Qiuwen1 aLi, Ruonan0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2014 May, v. 26 p.955-961dElsevier B.V.aThe Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(13)60569-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03748naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245017600171300001600347520180400363592002802167650002202195650002202217650001502239650001502254650002402269650002202293650003702315650001702352650001902369650000902388650000902397650002002406650001102426650000702437650001302444650003302457650002302490650001702513650001702530650002402547650002102571650003702592653003302629653002402662653001102686653001502697700001902712700001602731700001802747700001802765700001502783700001902798700001902817700001702836700002802853773013402881856008603015852000903101655001203110IND60552864720221119201953.0161021e20150320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055286472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.01.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Shengxia10aEffective removal of Pb(II) using magnetic Co0.6Fe2.4O4 micro-particles as the adsorbent: Synthesis and study on the kinetic and thermodynamic behaviors for its adsorption  ap. 211-223.  aMagnetically separable adsorbent composed of Co0.6Fe2.4O4 micro-particles were successfully prepared by thermal decomposition of the Co0.6Fe2.4C2O4·2H2O. The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The specific surface area of the sample is determined to be 97.155m2g−1, with uniform pore size distribution centering at about 7.432nm. The as-obtained Co0.6Fe2.4O4 micro-particles exhibits ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature, which makes it magnetically separable under external magnetic field. The as-obtained magnetic Co0.6Fe2.4O4 micro-particles exhibits excellent adsorption capacity and high adsorption rate for the removal of Pb(II) in aqueous solution. The maximum adsorption capacity of Pb(II) is up to 80.32mgg−1 and 88% of the Pb(II) can be removed within the initial 30min of contact time. The effects of contact time, initial pH, ionic strength and temperature on the adsorption behavior of Pb(II) were systematically investigated. The kinetics of the adsorption process follows the pseudo-second-order model and is controlled by the film diffusion process. The equilibrium data can be fitted well using the Langmuir isotherm model, suggesting that the uptake of Pb(II) ions is a mono-layer adsorption process. Meanwhile, the mean free energy E calculated by D-R isotherm model demonstrates that the adsorption process is implemented via the chemical ion-exchange mechanism. The thermodynamic studies illustrate that the adsorption process is endothermic and spontaneous in nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3aaqueous solutions 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aion exchange 3aionic strength 3aions 3alead 3amagnetic fields 3amodels 3apH 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3aspectroscopy 3asurface area 3athermal degradation 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aCo0.6Fe2.4O4 micro-particles 0aMagnetic separation 0aPb(II) 0aAdsorption1 aTang, Rongfeng1 aXue, Zechun1 aZhang, Xianxi1 aZhao, Yueying1 aZhang, Wen1 aZhang, Junhong1 aWang, Bingquan1 aZeng, Suyuan1 aSun, Chuanfeng,d-1890,0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2015 Mar. 20, v. 469 p.211-223dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.01.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001300184245014100197506007600338520136400414592002801778506003701806650002001843650001501863650002201878650001101900650002401911650001501935700001501950700002001965773011901985856007702104852000902181655001202190IND60660484920221207083456.0190823e20190812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066048492DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100806082doi7 aPMC67228402pmcid7 a314090342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yan 10aDNILMF-LDA: Prediction of lncRNA-Disease Associations by Dual-Network Integrated Logistic Matrix Factorization and Bayesian Optimization  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIdentifying associations between lncRNAs and diseases can help understand disease-related lncRNAs and facilitate disease diagnosis and treatment. The dual-network integrated logistic matrix factorization (DNILMF) model has been used for drug&ndash;target interaction prediction, and good results have been achieved. We firstly applied DNILMF to lncRNA&ndash;disease association prediction (DNILMF-LDA). We combined different similarity kernel matrices of lncRNAs and diseases by using nonlinear fusion to extract the most important information in fused matrices. Then, lncRNA&ndash;disease association networks and similarity networks were built simultaneously. Finally, the Gaussian process mutual information (GP-MI) algorithm of Bayesian optimization was adopted to optimize the model parameters. The 10-fold cross-validation result showed that the area under receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) value of DNILMF-LDA was 0.9202, and the area under precision-recall (PR) curve (AUPR) was 0.5610. Compared with LRLSLDA, SIMCLDA, BiwalkLDA, and TPGLDA, the AUC value of our method increased by 38.81%, 13.07%, 8.35%, and 6.75%, respectively. The AUPR value of our method increased by 52.66%, 40.05%, 37.01%, and 44.25%. These results indicate that DNILMF-LDA is an effective method for predicting the associations between lncRNAs and diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3aalgorithms 3adisease diagnosis 3amodels 3anormal distribution 3aprediction1 aLi, Junyi 1 aBian, Naizheng 0 tGenes.g2019 Aug. 12, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100806083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011800173300001600291520168400307592002801991650001102019650002302030650001202053650002702065650001802092650002202110650001702132650002102149650001502170650001302185650002202198650001502220650001602235650001002251650001302261650001602274651001802290651001802308651001202326653002302338653002802361653002902389653002102418653002702439700002402466700002202490700002302512773012102535856008502656852000902741655001202750IND60536072220221120215523.0190215e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053607222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2013.07.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Michelle L.10aPredicting impacts of future human population growth and development on occupancy rates of forest-dependent birds  ap. 311-320.  aForest loss and fragmentation are among the largest threats to forest-dwelling wildlife species today, and projected increases in human population growth are expected to increase these threats in the next century. We combined spatially-explicit growth models with wildlife distribution models to predict the effects of human development on 5 forest-dependent bird species in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, USA. We used single-species occupancy models to derive the probability of occupancy for each species across the study area in the years 2000 and 2050. Over half a million new housing units were predicted to be added to the landscape. The maximum change in housing density was nearly 30 houses per hectare; however, 30% of the towns in the study area were projected to add less than 1 housing unit per hectare. In the face of predicted human growth, the overall occupancy of each species decreased by as much as 38% (ranging from 19% to 38% declines in the worst-case scenario) in the year 2050. These declines were greater outside of protected areas than within protected lands. Ninety-seven percent of towns experienced some decline in species occupancy within their borders, highlighting the value of spatially-explicit models. The mean decrease in occupancy probability within towns ranged from 3% for hairy woodpecker to 8% for ovenbird and hermit thrush. Reductions in occupancy probability occurred on the perimeters of cities and towns where exurban development is predicted to increase in the study area. This spatial approach to wildlife planning provides data to evaluate trade-offs between development scenarios and forest-dependent wildlife species.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aconservation areas 3aforests 3agrowth and development 3agrowth models 3ahuman development 3ahuman growth 3ahuman population 3alandscapes 3aplanning 3apopulation growth 3aprediction 3aprobability 3atowns 3awildlife 3awoodpeckers 3aMassachusetts 3aNew Hampshire 3aVermont 0aOccupancy modeling 0aHuman population growth 0aLand use change modeling 0aForest ecosystem 0aForest-dependent birds1 aDonovan, Therese M.1 aSchwenk, W.

CMA substrates are delivered by a cytosolic chaperone to the lysosomal surface, where, upon unfolding, they are internalized through a membrane translocation complex. The molecular components that participate in CMA substrate targeting and translocation are well characterized, but those involved in CMA regulation remain mostly unknown. In this study, we have identified that CMA is under the positive control of the phosphatase PHLPP1 that associates with the lysosomal membrane and counteracts the inhibitory effect of mTORC2 on CMA. Lysosomal Akt, a target of the mTORC2/PHLPP1 kinase-phosphatase pair, modulates CMA activity by controlling the dynamics of assembly and disassembly of the CMA translocation complex at the lysosomal membrane.

A relatively small but rapidly increasing percentage of these non-indigenous species is represented by tropical or subtropical fishes which are naturally not distributed in a sea adjacent to the MED. The occurrence of these species is mainly ascribed to shipping traffic and aquarium trade as they are not able to actively arrive at the MED via the Suez Canal or the Strait of Gibraltar. During a survey of siganid fishes at the Natural History Museum in Vienna, a single specimen of the Barhead spinefoot, Siganus virgatus that had been captured in 1975 in the Adriatic Sea was found. It represents the first record of this species for the MED. It is also one of the earliest confirmed records of the introduction of a tropical fish species into the MED and an example of a drastically translocated species (DTS). Nearly all records of drastically translocated fish species (DTFS) were just published this century, although one record dates back to the 19ᵗʰ century. A rapid increase of such translocations into the MED has been observed since 2010. The rising water temperatures caused by climate change increases the probability that such species will establish self-sustaining populations in the MED. A first compilation of DTFS into the MED is presented. Characters distinguishing S. virgatus from the closely related sister species S. doliatus, as well as from the Lessepsian migrants S. luridus and S. rivulatus, are given.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSiganus 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3amarine fish 3aprobability 3ashipping 3asurveys 3atraffic 3atropical fish 3awater temperature 3aAdriatic Sea 3aAustria 3aMediterranean Sea 3aStrait of Gibraltar 0aMediterranean 0aAdriatic Sea 0adrastic translocation 0aaquarium release 0aballast water 0afirst record0 tBiologia.g2016 Sept. 14, v. 71, no. 8 p.952-959dDe Gruyterx1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2016-01063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010400161300002000265520204500285592002802330650002902358650004402387650002302431650002202454650003702476650001102513650001802524650001102542650001402553650001502567650003102582650001302613650001302626650001302639650001402652650001302666650003302679650001702712650003702729700002102766700001802787773012402805856007402929852000903003655001203012IND60640780020221119060539.0190505e20160629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064078002DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra05833g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRupa kasturi, P.10aPt decorated Artocarpus heterophyllus seed derived carbon as an anode catalyst for DMFC application  ap. 62680-62694.  aA carbohydrate rich Artocarpus heterophyllus seed (AHS) is processed via a hydrothermal carbonization method (HTC) for various reaction times (12, 18, 24 and 30 h) and further thermally carbonized at 700 °C under N₂ atmosphere to sequester a high surface area carbon. Subsequently, Pt NPs are also decorated on the prepared carbon and this was used as an anode catalyst for a methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The XRD and Raman spectra showed the as-synthesized material has a typical graphitic structure of carbon and an fcc structure of platinum with a grain size smaller than 3–4 nm. The presence of functional groups including –OH, –CO and –C–O are identified along with some heteroatoms on the surface of carbon through Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis exposed the presence of expected species such as C 1s, O 1s, N 1s and Pt 4f. Moreover, BET analysis of the spherical hydrochar carbonized at 700 °C showed a surface area of 431.5 m² g⁻¹ with a mean pore diameter of 3.2 nm and a pore volume of 0.354 cm³ g⁻¹. Morphological analysis such as Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images revealed the spherical nature of the obtained hydrochar as well as its transformation into an agglomerated network after carbonization at 700 °C. The obtained Pt loaded carbon showed an excellent electrocatalytic activity in the potential range of interest with a high ECSA of 261.4 m² g⁻¹ for Pt/C (hydrochar formed during 24 h and carbonized at 700 °C). Moreover, the Pt decorated optimized carbon sample has much higher peak current and mass activity of about 0.32 mA mg⁻¹ and 54.4 A g⁻¹ towards MOR. In addition, chronoamperometry analysis also exposed a good stability over 10 000 s. It is also legitimated that a 20 : 80 wt% of Pt/C loading shows a high current density with no relevant change in the onset potential and long-term stability during MOR with a few comparable results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtocarpus heterophyllus 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanodes 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3ahydrochars 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3amethanol 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aplatinum 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aSelvan, R.

The main objective of this research was to quantify the biomass of sponges washed up on the beach at Mazatlan Bay (Mexico, eastern Pacific Ocean), and to determine its relationship with local weather and oceanographic conditions. To know whether this process has a significant effect on the sponge populations, changes in abundance of the species washed into the beach were also quantified in adjoining sublittoral areas. The sponges that were washed ashore were mainly branching (Mycale ramulosa), massive (Haliclona caerulea) and cushion-shaped (Callyspongia californica) species. Species with high content of spongin in their structure (e.g. Hyattella intestinalis) were common in the subtidal zone but were rarely found on the beach. Encrusting species were never found. Four-year data of sponge deposition on the beach showed that the total annual sponge biomass ranged from 30 to 60g DWm⁻² with an inter-annual range from 0.1 to 17.3g DWm⁻². The highest deposition of sponges was during the spring–summer transition (from April to July), which was associated with a change in wind direction (from NW to WSW). This change also matched with low tides and a high resuspension of bottom sediments, suggesting a high-energy environment during this transition. The increase in sponge biomass washed on the beach coincided with a decrease in the density of adjacent sponge populations. A multiple regression analysis showed that 68.48% of the variation on sponge biomass on the beach could be statistically explained using a combination of environmental factors (wind speed, sediment resuspension and tides). Thus, seasonal changes in wind direction combined with the effect of low tides and sediment resuspension could serve to predict fragmentation/detachment events of benthic organisms in shallow sublittoral areas worldwide. This study also provides insights to explain the predominance of encrusting sponges in the Mexican Pacific Ocean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycale 3abenthic organisms 3abiomass 3abranching 3aenvironmental factors 3aregression analysis 3aseasonal variation 3asediments 3atides 3awind direction 3awind speed 3aMexico 3aPacific Ocean1 aCarballo, José Luis1 aVega, Cristina1 aCamacho, Leonardo1 aBarrón-Álvarez, José J.1 aPadilla-Verdín, Claudia1 aYáñez-Chávez, Benjamín0 tJournal of sea research.g2011 Aug., v. 66, no. 2 p.172-180dElsevier B.V.x1385-11017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2011.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01785naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245012700166300001600293506002800309520071500337592002801052506003701080650001901117650001301136650000901149653002001158653002101178653001701199773016701216856007901383852000901462655001201471IND60774908420221207142409.0170907e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077490842DNAL7 a10.19113/sdufbed.825492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSAKIROGLU, Serpil10aElectric-field-induced Nonlinear Optical Rectification, Second- and Third-harmonic Generation in Asymmetrical Quantum Well  ap. 367-372.  aResource is Open Access  aThe effects of a static electric field on the nonlinear optical rectification, second- and third-harmonic generation in a quantum well described by Morse potential are theoretically investigated. Analytical expressions for the optical coefficients due to intersubband optical transitions with an applied electric field are extracted from the compact-density matrix approach and iterative scheme. Numerical results presented for a typical GaAs quantum well reveal the feasibility of control of optical transitions between the size-quantized subbands. In addition, we have to emphasize the fact that the optical response of the system is remarkably sensitive to the electric field and structural range parameter.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelectric field 3aextracts 3afens 0aMorse potential 0aNonlinear optics 0aQuantum well0 tSüleyman Demirel üniversitesi fen bilimleri enstitüsü dergisi.g2017 June, v. 21, no. 2 p.367-372dSuleyman Demirel UniversitywJournal:27744x1308-65297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.19113/sdufbed.825493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009300168520124300261592002801504650001601532650002701548650001201575650001201587650001201599650001701611650002101628650001701649650000901666650001501675650001001690650001501700651002001715653001901735653002001754653000901774653002301783653001701806653002501823653002401848700002201872700005701894700007101951773011402022856008602136852000902222655001202231IND60720010320221122222051.0211123e20210405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072001032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1247602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdam, Max G.10aBiomass burning-derived airborne particulate matter in Southeast Asia: A critical review  aSmoke haze episodes, resulting from uncontrolled biomass burning (BB) including forest and peat fires, continue to occur in Southeast Asia (SEA), affecting air quality, atmospheric visibility, climate, ecosystems, hydrologic cycle and human health. The pollutant of major concern in smoke haze is airborne particulate matter (PM). A number of fundamental laboratory, field and modeling studies have been conducted in SEA from 2010 to 2020 to investigate potential environmental and health impacts of BB-induced PM. The goal of this review is to bring together the most recent developments in our understanding of various aspects of BB-derived PM based on 127 research articles published from 2010 to 2020, which have not been conveyed in previous reviews. Specifically, this paper discusses the physical, chemical, toxicological and radiative properties of BB-derived PM. It also provides insights into the environmental and health impacts of BB-derived PM, summarizes the approaches taken to do the source apportionment of PM during BB events and discusses the mitigation of exposure to BB-derived PM. Suggestions for future research priorities are outlined. Policies needed to prevent future BB events in the SEA region are highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aatmospheric visibility 3abiomass 3aclimate 3aforests 3ahuman health 3ahydrologic cycle 3aparticulates 3apeat 3apollutants 3asmoke 3atoxicology 3aSouth East Asia 0aSoutheast Asia 0aBiomass burning 0aHaze 0aParticulate matter 0aHuman health 0aSource apportionment 0aExposure mitigation1 aTran, Phuong T.M.1 aBolan, Nanthi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2056-16921 aBalasubramanian, Rajasekhar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5627-36280 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Apr. 05, v. 407 p.124760-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1247603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010600160520145400266592002801720650003201748650001501780650002401795650001301819650001101832650001401843650001501857650001401872650001401886650002401900650001301924650001201937651001301949700002001962700002101982700001302003700001802016700002102034700002002055700001502075700001902090773012302109856007402232852000902306655001202315IND60754419620221119054342.0211023e20210922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075441962DNAL7 a10.3390/v131018962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Cynthia Y.10aCell-Adapted Mutations and Antigenic Diversity of Influenza B Viruses in Missouri, 2019–2020 Season  aInfluenza B viruses (IBVs) are causing an increasing burden of morbidity and mortality, yet the prevalence of culture-adapted mutations in human seasonal IBVs are unclear. We collected 368 clinical samples from patients with influenza-like illness in Missouri during the 2019–2020 influenza season and recovered 146 influenza isolates including 38 IBV isolates. Of MDCK-CCL34, MDCK-Siat1, and humanized MDCK (hCK), hCK showed the highest virus recovery efficiency. All Missourian IBVs belonged to the Victoria V1A.3 lineage, all of which contained a three-amino acid deletion on the HA protein and were antigenically distant from the Victoria lineage IBV vaccine strain used during that season. By comparing genomic sequences of these IBVs in 31 paired samples, eight cell-adapted nonsynonymous mutations were identified, with the majority in the RNA polymerase. Analyses of IBV clinical sample–isolate pairs from public databases further showed that cell- and egg-adapted mutations occurred more widely in viral proteins, including the receptor and antibody binding sites on HA. Our study suggests that hCK is an effective platform for IBV isolation and that culture-adapted mutations may occur during IBV isolation. As culture-adapted mutations may affect subsequent virus studies and vaccine development, the knowledge from this study may help optimize strategies for influenza surveillance, vaccine strain selection, and vaccine development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aantibodies 3aantigenic variation 3agenomics 3ahumans 3ainfluenza 3amonitoring 3amorbidity 3amortality 3avaccine development 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aMissouri1 aSegovia, Karen 1 aMcElroy, Jane A.1 aLi, Tao 1 aGuan, Minhui 1 aZhang, Xiaojian 1 aMisra, Shamita 1 aHang, Jun 1 aWan, Xiu-Feng 0 tViruses.g2021 Sept. 22, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131018963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005600145245007700201300001800278520150000296592002801796650001401824650002301838650001501861650001301876650001501889650001901904650002601923650001401949650002101963650001801984650001402002650001802016650001402034650002002048651001602068700006202084700005902146700001902205700006802224773014002292856007902432852000902511655001202520IND60645120320190719000000.0190523e20190425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064512032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b013632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMani, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5746-997210aMicroplastic Pollution in Benthic Midstream Sediments of the Rhine River  ap. 6053-6062.  aRivers are major transport vectors for microplastics (MP) toward the sea. However, there is evidence that MP can temporarily or permanently be inhibited from migrating downstream by retention in sediments or ingestion by organisms. MP concentrations, compositions, and fate within the different compartments of the fluvial environment are poorly understood. Here, benthic, midstream sediments of two undammed, open-flowing stretches were investigated in the Rhine River, one of the world’s busiest inland waterways. Twenty-five samples were collected at ten sites via riverbed access through a diving bell or dredging. We performed the first comprehensive analysis of riverbed sediment aliquots that avoids visual selection bias using state-of-the art automated micro-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (μFTIR) imaging. MP numbers ranged between 0.26 ± 0.01 and 11.07 ± 0.6 × 10³ MP kg–¹ while MP particles <75 μm accounted for a mean numerical proportion ± SD of 96 ± 6%. MP concentrations decreased with sediment depth. Eighteen polymers were identified in the size range of 11–500 μm; the acrylates/polyurethane/varnish (APV) cluster was found at all sites (mean numerical proportion, 70 ± 19%), possibly indicating particulate pollution from ship antifouling paint. Overall, polymers denser than freshwater (>1 g cm–³) dominated (85 ± 18%), which contrasts the large proportions of low-density polymers previously reported in near-surface compartments of the Rhine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylates 3aantifouling agents 3aautomation 3adredging 3afreshwater 3aimage analysis 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aingestion 3ainland waterways 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3apolyurethanes 3asediments 3astream channels 3aRhine River1 aPrimpke, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7633-85241 aLorenz, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7898-77281 aGerdts, Gunnar1 aBurkhardt-Holm, Patricia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5396-64050 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Apr. 25, v. 53, no. 10 p.6053-6062dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b013633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245013200171300001600303520174500319592002802064650001702092650001802109650002202127650001402149650001902163650001002182650001202192650001402204650002402218650000702242650001402249653002002263653002302283653002402306653000702330653003002337653001702367700002402384700002102408773013202429856008402561852000902645655001202654IND60606233720221119174338.0210311e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060623372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2016.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClements, Jeff C.10aPorewater acidification alters the burrowing behavior and post-settlement dispersal of juvenile soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria)  ap. 103-111.  aAlthough ocean acidification will impact marine organisms in the future, few studies have addressed the effects of sedimentary porewater acidification on benthic invertebrates. This study suggests that burrowing behavior and post-settlement dispersal of juvenile bivalves are altered by porewater acidification under present day conditions. We tested the efficacy of a novel method of stabilizing porewater pH using sediment underlain with food grade gelatin in both the lab and field, and then employed this method to test if porewater acidification could alter post-settlement clam dispersal under natural conditions. In the field, clams were exposed to a gradient of porewater acidification in manipulated (CO₂ added) sediments for 24h to determine if acidification could alter dispersal patterns of juvenile clams under natural flow conditions; juvenile clam dispersal in the presence of different buffer types was also tested. In addition, juvenile clams were placed on unmanipulated, field-collected sediment cores in the lab which varied naturally with respect to acidification to test burrowing behavior in response to natural porewater pH. Gelatin stabilized porewater pH for 24–48h and its presence did not influence clam burrowing behavior. In the field, a significant negative relationship between the percent of clams dispersed and acidification was observed, while stabilizing porewater pH significantly decreased clam dispersal. In the lab, there was a significant positive relationship between the percent of clams burrowed and porewater acidification. This study suggests that porewater acidification has the capacity to alter the burrowing behavior and dispersal patterns of juvenile bivalves under natural conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMya arenaria 3aacidification 3aaquatic organisms 3aburrowing 3acarbon dioxide 3aclams 3agelatin 3ajuveniles 3aocean acidification 3apH 3asediments 0aBenthic ecology 0aBurrowing behavior 0aOcean acidification 0apH 0aPost-settlement dispersal 0aMya arenaria1 aWoodard, Krystal D.1 aHunt, Heather L.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2016 Apr., v. 477 p.103-111dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2016.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013500165300001600300520116400316592002801480650002301508650001801531650001601549650001401565650002201579650001301601650002401614700001701638700002001655700002001675700002001695700002101715773012801736856008401864990002301948852000901971655001201980IND60090029220221122032727.0141110e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009002922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKano, Fumi10aHydrogen peroxide depletes phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate from endosomes in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner and perturbs endocytosis  ap. 784-801.  aPhosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) is a lipid that is enriched specifically in early endosomes. Given that early endosomes containing PI3P act as a microdomain to recruit proteins that contain a PI3P-binding domain (FYVE domain), the equilibrium between the production and degradation of PI3P influences a variety of processes, including endocytosis and signal transduction via endosomes. In the study reported herein, we have developed a novel analytical method to quantify the amount of PI3P in endosomes by introducing a GST-2xFYVE protein probe into semi-intact cells. The GST-2xFYVE probe was targeted specifically to intracellular PI3P-containing endosomes, which retained their small punctate structure, and allowed the semi-quantitative measurement of intracellular PI3P. Using the method, we found that treatment of HeLa cells with H₂O₂ decreased the amount of PI3P in endosomes in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. In addition, H₂O₂ treatment delayed transport through various endocytic pathways, especially post-early endosome transport; the retrograde transport of cholera toxin was especially dependent on the amount of PI3P in endosomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3acholera toxin 3aendocytosis 3aendosomes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aproteins 3asignal transduction1 aArai, Tamaki1 aMatsuto, Mariko1 aHayashi, Hanako1 aSato, Moritoshi1 aMurata, Masayuki0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

Sandwich-like graphene@MoS2@C sheets (G@MS@C), with MoS2 nanosheets perpendicularly connecting with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through the direct chemical coupling (COMo bonds), are synthesized by a facile two-step method, which involves in situ growth of MoS2 on rGO sheets and a followed amorphous carbon coverage process. The interfacial interaction via the COMo bonds can accelerate electron transport rate and enhance structural stability of G@MS@C electrode. Meanwhile, the vertical nanostructure provides more active sites and short diffusion distance for sodium ion reaction, leading to fast electrode reaction kinetics. The rGO sheets and carbon shells not only improve the electrical conductivity of the composite, but also act as buffers to accommodate the volume changes of MoS2 and ensure the integrity of the electrode during cycling. As an anode material for SIBs, the G@MS@C electrode shows superior reversible capacity (520 mAh g⁻¹ after 110 cycles at 100 mA g⁻¹), excellent rate capability (304 mAh g⁻¹ after 200 cycles at 5 A g⁻¹) and stable cycling performance (260 mAh g⁻¹ after 300 cycles at 10 A g⁻¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acoatings 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene oxide 3ananosheets 3aoxygen 3areaction kinetics 3asodium1 aZhao, Hailei1 aZhang, Zijia1 aZhao, Lina1 aZhang, Yang1 aLi, Zhaolin1 aXia, Qing1 aDu, Zhihong1 aŚwierczek, Konrad0 tCarbon.g2017 Aug., v. 119 p.91-100dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010000167300001600267520168200283592002801965650002101993650002802014650001602042650001602058650001302074650001302087650001202100650001702112650001202129650000702141650001302148650002002161650001902181650002402200650002102224650001802245650001402263700001802277773010002295856008102395852000902476655001202485IND60120929320221119032642.0150212e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012092932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-001-0393-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaspar, Sibylle14aThe sensor kinase CitA (DpiB) of Escherichia coli functions as a high-affinity citrate receptor  ap. 313-321.  aFor the CitA-CitB (DpiB-DpiA) two-component signal transduction system from Escherichia coli, three diverse functions have been reported: induction of the citrate fermentation genes citCDEFXGT, repression of the regulator gene appY, and destabilization of the inheritance of iteron-containing plasmids such as pSC101. This poses the question of the principal biological role of this system. Here it is shown that the periplasmic domain of the E. coli sensor kinase CitA functions as a high-affinity citrate receptor. Two CitA derivatives were purified by affinity chromatography and subjected to binding studies using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). One of them, termed CitAff215MBP, comprised the N-terminal part of CitA (amino acid residues 1–215), including the two transmembrane helices, and was fused to the amino terminus of the E. coli maltose-binding protein lacking its signal peptide. The second CitA derivative, designated CitAPEc, encompassed only the periplasmic domain (amino acid residues 38–177). CitAff215MBP bound citrate at 25 °C with a Kdof 0.3 µM and a binding stoichiometry of up to 0.9 in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7. Binding was driven by the enthalpy change (ΔH of –95.7 kJ mol–¹), whereas the entropy change was not favorable for binding (TΔS of –58.6 kJ mol–¹). ITC experiments with CitAPEcyielded similar Kdvalues for citrate (0.15–1.0 µM). Besides citrate, also isocitrate (Kd~15 µM) and tricarballylate (Kd~50 µM), but not malate were bound by CitAPEc. The results favor the assumption that the primary biological function of the CitA-CitB system is the regulation of the citrate fermentation genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aaffinity chromatography 3aamino acids 3acalorimetry 3acitrates 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3afermentation 3amalates 3apH 3aplasmids 3aregulator genes 3asignal peptide 3asignal transduction 3asodium phosphate 3astoichiometry 3atitration1 aBott, Michael0 tArchives of microbiology.g2002 Apr., v. 177, no. 4 p.313-321dSpringer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-001-0393-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03426naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001800166245013700184300001600321500002400337500001500361520168100376650002002057650003802077650001602115650002402131650002202155650002102177650001902198650002002217650001702237650001302254650002102267650002002288650001502308650002402323650002702347650001002374650002702384650002302411650001302434650002202447653001702469653002002486700001702506700002002523700001202543773011502555852000902670856008802679930003302767945002502800946001102825655001202836IND4390317820221120112052.0070412e20070415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439031782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aMelkebeek, V.10aComparison of immune responses in parenteral FaeG DNA primed pigs boosted orally with F4 protein or reimmunized with the DNA vaccine  ap. 199-214.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe previously showed that an intradermal (i.d.) FaeG DNA prime (2x)-oral F4 protein boost immunization induces a systemic response and weakly primes a mucosal IgG response in pigs, especially when plasmid vectors encoding the A and B subunit of the E. coli thermo-labile enterotoxin (LT) are added to the DNA vaccine. In the present study, we evaluated whether addition of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitD3) to the DNA vaccine could further enhance this mucosal priming and/or modulate the antibody response towards IgA. To further clarify priming of systemic and mucosal responses by the i.d. DNA vaccination, we firstly compared the localization of the F4-specific antibody response in pigs that were orally boosted with F4 to that in pigs that received a third i.d. DNA immunization and secondly evaluated cytokine mRNA expression profiles after i.d. DNA vaccination. The i.d. DNA prime (2x)-oral F4 boost immunization as well as the 3 i.d. DNA vaccinations induced mainly a systemic response, with a higher response observed following the heterologous protocol. Co-administration of vitD3, and especially of the LT vectors, enhanced this response. Furthermore, only the heterologous immunization resulted in a weak mucosal priming, which appeared to require the presence of the LT vectors or vitD3 as adjuvants. In addition, the LT vectors strongly enhanced the FaeG-specific lymphocyte proliferation and this was accompanied by the absence of a clear IL-10 response. However, despite two DNA immunizations in the presence of these adjuvants and an oral F4 boost, we failed to demonstrate the secretory IgA response needed to be protective against enterotoxigenic E. coli. 3adermal exposure 3aenteropathogenic Escherichia coli 3avaccination 3aoral administration 3aprotective effect 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aswine diseases 3adrug evaluation 3aenterotoxins 3afimbriae 3amucosal immunity 3adisease control 3acalcitriol 3avaccine development 3aEscherichia infections 3aswine 3abacterial colonization 3aantibody formation 3avaccines 3avaccine adjuvants 0aDNA vaccines 0aimmune response1 aVerdonck, F.1 aGoddeeris, B.M.1 aCox, E.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2007 Apr. 15, v. 116, no. 3-4 p.199-214dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.01.0213Available from publisher's Web site  a20070920b20071002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/08/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03448naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001100175245007700186300001600263500002400279500001500303520178500318650002002103650001802123650001802141650001402159650001302173650002502186650001202211650001702223650002402240650002102264650002102285650001802306650002002324650002202344650001902366650001902385650001102404653001502415653001502430700001202445700001702457700001502474700001702489700001502506700001502521700001702536773011502553852000902668856008802677930003302765945002502798946001102823655001202834IND4390317020221120111847.0070412e20070415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439031702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL800 0aL2001 aXu, J.10aCloning and functional characterization of recombinant equine P-selectin  ap. 115-130.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe recent molecular characterization and sequencing of equine P-selectin (ePsel), and its glycoprotein ligand, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), have provided the tools for further investigation into their role in leukocyte trafficking. Here, we report the generation of a genetically engineered chimeric protein (ePsel-IgG) in which the equine P-selectin lectin and epithelial growth factor (EGF) domains were covalently linked to the equine IgG1 heavy chain constant region. The soluble ePsel-IgG was observed to bind to equine monocytes by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Furthermore, equine monocytes bound to immobilized ePsel-IgG in a time course and dose dependent manner. Not only did ePsel-IgG act as an adhesion molecule, it was also found to activate ERK1/2 kinase and induce IL-8 mRNA expression in equine monocytes. That all of the aforementioned ePsel-IgG-induced cell binding and cell signaling were abolished by the addition of EDTA, suggested that ePsel-IgG chimera mediated events occurred via the P-selectin ligand, PSGL-1. We were able to demonstrate that 78% of equine monocytes cross-reacted with anti-human HECA-452 antibody, which recognizes the sialy-Lewis X (sLex) epitope, a well-known carbohydrate binding site on human PSGL-1. Pre-incubation of equine PBMC with neuraminidase or O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase (OSGP) reduced ePsel-IgG monocyte binding to 36% or 60%, respectively. Taken together, these data suggest that there might be two ligand recognition sites on P-selectin, one of which recognizes sLex and another which recognizes P-selectin ligand core protein. The ePsel-IgG chimera can be a useful as a reagent for further studies on the role of equine P-selectin and signal transduction in inflammatory events in horse. 3aprotein binding 3acell adhesion 3aglycoproteins 3amonocytes 3aadhesins 3arecombinant proteins 3alectins 3ainflammation 3asignal transduction 3aepithelial cells 3abinding proteins 3abinding sites 3aimmune response 3amolecular cloning 3agrowth factors 3ahorse diseases 3ahorses 0aP-selectin 0aleukocytes1 aCai, J.1 aAnderson, B.1 aWagner, B.1 aAlbrecht, R.1 aPeek, S.F.1 aSuresh, M.1 aDarien, B.J.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2007 Apr. 15, v. 116, no. 3-4 p.115-130dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.01.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070919b20071002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/08/27  aNon-US 7aarticle01727naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003000145245006600175300001600241520079800257653001401055653001401069653002201083653002101105653002001126700002201146773011901168852000901287856008501296930003301381946001101414655001201425IND4427198720221120101437.0091012e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442719872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10965-009-9273-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLakouraj, Moslem Mansour 10aSynthesis of polyamides from p-Xylylene glycol and dinitriles  ap. 681-686.  aA series of polyamides were prepared by direct polyamidation of the p-Xylylene glycol with various commercially available dinitriles via Ritter reaction.

Our results showed that relative fitness of genotypic classes, formed by the alleles of erythrocyte antigen loci, was different. It was demonstrated that the population examined carried the alleles responsible for fitness decrease, as well as the alleles with stable and unstable equilibrium points (with increased and decreased relative fitness of heterozygotes).

The country's transition implied changes in the production of knowledge, including the re-examination of research topics and bringing new theories into rural studies. The article strives to develop a theoretically informed critique of the recent studies, specifically addressing the changing vision of rurality. Taking as a starting point traditional concerns in rural discourses, i.e. the ways rurality have been traditionally studied in Russia, this paper seeks to identify what rural studies might gain and lose from the shift in academic research. Critics have focused on the problems of bringing together past and recent trajectories in rural research, concentrating on the power of construction of particular rural discourses in different environments. The reconstruction of changing rural discourses aims to provide an interpretative framework for understanding the ways various rural images and policy concepts are implicated in the construction of the Russian countryside. 3arural society 3arural education and training 3aRussia 0arurality 0arural studies 0acountryside0 tJournal of rural studies.g2006 Oct., v. 22, no. 4 p.422-440dElsevier Sciencex0743-01677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2006.02.0043electronic resource  a20070319b20070402c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/03/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02070naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001700168245010200185300001600287500002400303520100700327650001401334650001601348650002601364650001601390651001201406653001801418700002001436773010001456852000901556856007401565930003301639945002501672946001101697655001201708IND4388325220221120060707.0070227e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438832522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2006.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE500 0aA5001 aMadsen, L.M.10aKnowledge constructions in research communities: The example of agri-rural researchers in Denmark  ap. 456-468.  aIncludes references  aConstruction of scientific knowledge can be seen as a struggle over who should define the terms and conditions of legitimate fields of research. Sociologists of scientific knowledge (SSK) have pointed to the importance of analysing scientific knowledge in the same way as other types of knowledge. This idea guides the present paper on Danish research in agriculture and rural areas. Based on an ethnographic study of researchers involved in rural studies, we take stock of the agri-rural research community in Denmark and reflect upon the how and why 'fashions' in Danish rural studies differ from 'fashions' in rural studies in the UK. In the analysis, we show how a research community construct and reconstruct itself in relation to what is perceived as legitimate fields of research. Finally, the paper gives insight into the research world of those doing research outside the UK and adds to the discussion of 'putting philosophies of geography into practice' that is on-going in British geography. 3aknowledge 3aresearchers 3aagricultural research 3arural areas 3aDenmark 0arural studies1 aAdriansen, H.K.0 tJournal of rural studies.g2006 Oct., v. 22, no. 4 p.456-468dElsevier Sciencex0743-01677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2006.02.0013electronic resource  a20070319b20070402c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/03/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02828naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100002600176245011400202300001800316500039600334500002400730520108900754650001601843650001901859650001901878650001701897650002001914650001801934650001401952650001301966650002101979651001002000700001702010700002402027700002202051700002002073773009702093852000902190856009002199930003302289945002502322946001102347655001202358IND4390314320221120060211.0070412e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439031432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aJ500 0aJ2001 aAlmendro-Candel, M.B.10aEnvironmental evaluation of sewage sludge application to reclaim limestone quarries wastes as soil amendments  ap. 1328-1332.  aIn the special issue: Organic wastes in soils: Biogeochemical and environmental aspects / edited by C.E.

Currently the use of sewage sludge to improve the nutrient contents of a soil is a common practice. The soil to which a great amount of fertilizers is usually applied, may favour the solubilization of inorganic compounds. In order to study the mobility of some of these elements through the soil, we designed an experiment aimed to reproduce the behaviour of different compounds and heavy metals in the soil as a part of the non-saturated zone. A controlled experiment in a greenhouse using soil columns was used. A mineral residue from a limestone quarry in Alicante (south-east of Spain) was amended with 30 and 90 t of sludge ha-1. Nitrate, ammonium, cadmium, and nickel were analysed in leachates collected at the bottom of the columns. We found high concentrations of nitrates and ammonium in leachates, which imply an important environmental risk. No important displacements of Cd and Ni were found. 3amined soils 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3aheavy metals 3asoil amendments 3asewage sludge 3aleachates 3aleaching 3aland restoration 3aSpain1 aJordan, M.M.1 aNavarro-Pedreno, J.1 aMataix-Solera, J.1 aGomez-Lucas, I.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2007 June, v. 39, no. 6 p.1328-1332dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.12.0083Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/05/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03755naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176072000900185100001600194245014200210300001600352500002400368500001500392520220000407650001902607650001902626650002002645650002102665650003102686650001902717650000902736650002402745650004102769650002102810650003002831650001902861650002802880651000902908651001002917653001802927653001902945773009402964852000903058856008903067930003303156945002503189946001103214655001203225IND4390313920221120043736.0070412e20070415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439031392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aB200 0aJ800 0aW000 0aX1001 aChaplot, V.10aWater and soil resources response to rising levels of atmospheric CO₂ concentration and to changes in precipitation and air temperature  ap. 159-171.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe quantification of the diverse responses of soils and terrestrial fresh water to elevated levels of greenhouse gases and to climate change is crucial for the proper management of natural ecosystems in the future. Despite previous experiments and simulations, there is still a need for the evaluation of the impact of these global changes at the watershed level. The main objective of this paper is to examine the effects of increasing CO₂ concentrations and rainfall changes associated with changes in average daily rainfall intensity, and surface air temperature on loads of water, NO₃-N and sediments from watersheds exhibiting different environmental conditions. The interactively coupled (CO₂-climate-landuse) Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to predict the effect of variations in precipitation and rainfall intensity (a 10%, 20% and 40% increase or decrease) or surface air temperature (an increase of 0.5 and 3.5 °C in the mean winter temperature) associated with an increase of CO₂ concentration from 330 to 950 ppm in two agricultural watersheds in Iowa and Texas. Over a 100-year simulated period: (1) precipitation changes primarily affected flow and sediment discharges while temperature and changes in atmospheric CO₂ concentration had a smaller effect; (2) CO₂ concentration was the main controlling factor of NO₃-N loads; and (3) global changes in the humid watershed had a greater effect on the water and soil resources than in the semi-arid. In particular, increasing precipitations in the humid watershed significantly increased the median and interquartile of outputs of all the variables under consideration. In contrast, changes in surface air temperature had only a slight impact on loads. However higher temperatures in the more humid site tended to reduce the highest loads. These results demonstrate that changes in CO₂ concentration and climate, particularly an increase in precipitation, had significant effects on the soil and fresh water resources. The magnitude of these effects differed according to the watershed's characteristics. Finally, the general applicability of these results and the limits of the approach are discussed. 3asediment yield 3acarbon dioxide 3aair temperature 3anitrate nitrogen 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aglobal warming 3arain 3awatershed hydrology 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3alosses from soil 3anonpoint source pollution 3arain intensity 3aagricultural watersheds 3aIowa 3aTexas 0aprecipitation 0aclimate change0 tJournal of hydrology.g2007 Apr. 15, v. 337, no. 1-2 p.159-171dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.01.0263Available from publisher's Web site  a20071212b20080102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/12/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02546naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179072001700196072001700213100002000230245011500250300001600365500001500381520107500396650001601471650002601487650001501513650001701528650002101545650001901566650001801585650000901603650002501612650002101637653001701658653002801675700003101703700002201734700002001756700002001776773008101796852000901877856008501886930003301971945002502004946001102029655001202040IND4417461620221120043735.0090309e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441746162DNAL7 a10.1080/138802008023672472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

(Fabaceae) was investigated for its protective effect in two models of toxicity, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH), using isolated rat hepatocytes. CCl4 undergoes dehalogenation in the liver endoplasmic reticulum. This process leads to trichlormethyl radical (CCl3) formation, initiation of lipid peroxidation, and measurable toxic effects on the hepatocytes. Oxidative damage is widely recognized as being involved in the development of many pathological conditions. In our experiment, t-BuOOH was used as a model of oxidative stress. The hepatocytes were incubated with the PSM alone (0.01-100 μ M) and along with CCl4 (86 μ M) and t-BuOOH (75 μ M). As a sign of cytotoxicity, cell viability was used. CCl4 and t-BuOOH significantly decreased hepatocyte viability. Our data indicate that PSM showed lower toxic effects compared to CCl4 and t-BuOOH and in combination exerted statistically significant protection of cell viability against the toxic agents. 3ahepatocytes 3atriterpenoid saponins 3aAstragalus 3acytotoxicity 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aanimal models 3arats 3amedicinal properties 3aoxidative stress 0apurification 0aAstragalus corniculatus1 aKondeva-Burdina, Magdalena1 aVitcheva, Vessela1 aKrasteva, Ilina1 aNikolov, Stefan0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2008 Dec., v. 46, no. 12 p.866-870x1388-02097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/138802008023672473Available from publisher's Web site  a20090319b20090508c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/03/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03207naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001400158245008400172300001800256500039600274500002400670500001500694520157300709650002202282650003102304650001802335650002302353650001702376653001302393700002102406700001602427700001402443700001802457700001902475700001402494773009702508852000902605856009002614930003302704945002502737946001102762655001202773IND4390313720221120034502.0070412e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439031372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ5001 aBaffi, C.10aDetermination of biological stability in compost: A comparison of methodologies  ap. 1284-1293.  aIn the special issue: Organic wastes in soils: Biogeochemical and environmental aspects / edited by C.E.

By use of these three techniques independent assessment of compost stability was made possible. Evidence of unstable materials was found where labile, easily biodegradable, and non-humified organic fractions were present. The DRI was used as a reference index for biological stability, and no significant correlation was observed between DRI and the humification indices (HI, DH, HR) and the thermogravimetry index (R1). On the other hand, significant correlation was observed for DRI vs. non-humified carbon (NHC), which was determined using the chemical method and the labile fraction determined by thermogravimetry, as well as for NHC vs. “labile fraction”. These fractions represent labile, easily biodegradable, and non-humified organic matter. Significant correlations were also observed between the three above mentioned measurements and TEC, suggesting that this fraction is mainly formed of the easily degradable organic fraction. These results suggest that the integrated use of biological, chemical, and thermoanalytical methods could represent a useful tool in differentiating stabilized composts from non-stabilized ones, and it could provide more reliable information for both managerial and sanitary health aspects involved in good agricultural practice. 3acompost stability 3aphysicochemical properties 3awater content 3aanalytical methods 3ahumification 0acomposts1 aDell'Abate, M.T.1 aNassisi, A.1 aSilva, S.1 aBenedetti, A.1 aGenevini, P.L.1 aAdani, F.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2007 June, v. 39, no. 6 p.1284-1293dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.12.0043Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/05/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02459naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179072001700196100002400213245005500237300001600292520112100308650002501429650002101454650002501475650001801500650001301518650001701531650002101548650000901569650001801578650002401596650001901620651001001639700001901649700002401668700002401692700001701716773008101733852000901814856008501823930003301908945002501941946001101966655001201977IND4417463720221120034557.0090309e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441746372DNAL7 a10.1080/138802008023701672doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

(Cucurbitaceae), the aim of this study was to screen the glycemic attributes of an aqueous extract of Trichosanthes dioica leaves in normal as well as various diabetic models. The variable doses of 250, 500, and 750 mg kg- 1 body weight (bw) of the extract were administered orally to normal and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced sub- and mild-diabetic rats in order to define its glycemic potential. The dose of 500 mg kg- 1 bw was identified as the most effective dose which brings down the blood glucose level (BGL) by 32.9% (P < 0.001) at 6 h during fasting blood glucose (FBG) studies in normal rats. However, glucose tolerance test (GTT) showed the maximum reduction of 30.9% (P < 0.001) in BGL at 5 h in normal rats with the same dose, whereas the reduction observed was by 40.3% and 88.6% (P < 0.001) in sub- and mild-diabetic rats, respectively, at 3 h of glucose administration only. This evidence clearly indicates that the aqueous extract of Trichosanthes dioica leaves has good hypoglycemic potential along with a high anti-diabetic profile. 3aTrichosanthes dioica 3amedicinal plants 3amedicinal properties 3ablood glucose 3adiabetes 3ahypoglycemia 3aglycemic control 3arats 3aanimal models 3ahypoglycemic agents 3aplant extracts 3aIndia1 aJaiswal, Dolly1 aSingh, Rakesh Kumar1 aGupta, Rajesh Kumar1 aWatal, Geeta0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2008 Dec., v. 46, no. 12 p.894-899x1388-02097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/138802008023701673Available from publisher's Web site  a20090319b20090508c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/03/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02662naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245008300144300001400227520107700241650002601318650000901344650002901353650001801382650001601400650004101416650002401457650001201481650003301493650004301526650003201569650003801601650003801639650004001677650000901717650002401726650002301750650002801773650002701801650004201828653002801870653002201898700001501920700001701935700001401952773010001966852000902066930003302075945001302108946001102121655001202132IND2199756520221120034449.0990716e19990329ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219975652DNAL7 a102319502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKabeya, H.10aBovine leukaemia virus envelope peptides cause immunomodulation in BALB/c mice  ap. 39-48.  aImmunomodulatory activity of two bovine leukaemia virus envelope (BLVEnv) derived peptides were examined in BALB/c mice. One is a peptide homologous to CKS-17 which is known as a 17-amino acid peptide derived from p15E of feline leukaemia virus (CKS-17/BLV), and the other is an 18-amino acid synthetic peptide of BLV Env 61-78 (pep61). Priming with CKS-17/BLV in vitro, as well as CKS-17, significantly suppressed the mitogen-induced proliferative responses of spleen cells in naive BALB/c mice. In addition, priming of spleen cells with pep61 in vitro and in vivo resulted in suppression of lipopolysaccaride-induced B-cell proliferative response. This suppression was partially due to the basic amino acid sequence in the peptide because if the pep61-derived peptide lacking Arg was used, this inhibitory activity was partially restored. In contrast, pep61 enhanced both concanavalin A-stimulated proliferative response and IL-2 production. These findings showed that pep61 may contribute to the modification of the host immune responses in the course of BLV infection. 3aBovine leukemia virus 3amice 3alymphocyte proliferation 3ainterleukin-2 3asplenocytes 2aAdjuvants, Immunologicxpharmacology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aConcanavalin Axpharmacology 2aImmunosuppressive Agentsxpharmacology 2aInterleukin-2xbiosynthesis 2aLeukemia Virus, Bovinexchemistry 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aLymphocyte Activationxdrug effects 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptidesxpharmacology 2aViral Envelope Proteinsxpharmacology 0aviral immunosuppression 0aenvelope proteins1 aOhashi, K.1 aSugimoto, C.1 aOnuma, M.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g1999 Mar. 29, v. 68, no. 1 p.39-48x0165-24277nnas  aDNAL  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle01983naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008100166300001800247520082100265650002801086650002101114650001201135650001601147650002001163650001201183650001201195650001301207650001301220650002501233700002801258700002001286700002101306773013001327852000901457856008501466930003301551946001301584655001201597IND4427196820221123041044.0091012e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442719682DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954091000682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerbenko, V.

The RecA protein of D. radiodurans is expressed in E. coli cells, and its synthesis can be supplementary induced. The radioprotective effect of the xenologic protein does not exceed 1.5 fold and yields essentially to the contribution of plasmid pUC19-recA1.1 harboring the E. coli recA ⁺ gene in the recovery of resistance of the ΔrecA deletion mutant. These data suggest that the expression of D. radiodurans recA gene in E. coli cells does not complement mutations at gene recA in the chromosome possibly due to structural and functional peculiarities of the D. radiodurans RecA protein. 3aDeinococcus radiodurans 3aEscherichia coli 3aalleles 3achromosomes 3agene expression 3alactose 3amutants 3amutation 3aplasmids 3aradiation resistance1 aKuznet︠s︡ova, L.

Bred in Russia and former Soviet republics in the 20th century  ap. 1208-1214.  aAllelic diversity at five gliadin-coding gene loci has been studied in the most important spring durum wheat cultivars released in Russia and former Soviet republics in the 20th century (66 cultivars). Seven, 5, 8, 13, and 2 allelic variants of blocks of gliadin components controlled by the loci Gli-A1 d , Gli-B1 d , Gli-A2 d , Gli-B2 d , and Gli-B5 d , respectively, have been identified. The allelic diversity did not exhibit a consistent trend during the period studied. Nei's diversity index (H) was 0.68 in the period from 1929 to 1950, increased to 0.70 in 1951-1980, and decreased to 0.58 after the year 1981. It has been found that the most frequent alleles in this collection are relatively rare in other regions of the world, which suggests unique ways of the formation of the diversity of durum wheat cultivars in the former Soviet Union. The efficiency of electrophoresis of storage proteins as a method for identification of durum wheat cultivars by the gliadin electrophoretic pattern has been estimated. 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3aalleles 3acultivars 3adurum wheat 3aelectrophoresis 3agliadin 3aloci 3astorage proteins 3aRussia 3aUSSR1 aKudryavtsev, A.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of garden-based nutrition education on adolescents' fruit and vegetable consumption using a nonequivalent control group design. Sixth-grade students (n=99) at three different elementary schools made up a control and two treatment groups. Students in the treatment groups participated in a 12-week nutrition education program, and one treatment group also participated in garden-based activities. Students in all three groups completed three 24-hour food-recall workbooks before and after the intervention. A repeated-measures analysis of variance showed that adolescents who participated in the garden-based nutrition intervention increased their servings of fruits and vegetables more than students in the two other groups. Significant increases were also found in vitamin A, vitamin C, and fiber intake. Although further research is needed, the results of this study seem to indicate the efficacy of using garden-based nutrition education to increase adolescents' consumption of fruits and vegetables. 3afood intake 3afood choices 3anutrition education 3agardens 3aadolescent nutrition 3aadolescents 3amiddle school students 3avegetables 3adiet recall 2aAdolescent 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aChild 2aChild Nutrition Sciencesxeducation 2aChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aDietxstandards 2aFemale 2aFruit 2aGardeningxeducationxmethodsxorganization & administration. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSchools 2aVegetables 0aIdaho 0aeating habits 0aschoolyard gardens 0afruits (food)1 aRankin, L.L.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2007 Apr., v. 107, no. 4 p.662-665dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2007.01.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20071015b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/16  aOther US 7aarticle03498naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100002000183245007100203300001600274500002400290500001500314520155000329650002301879650001101902650001801913650001401931650001601945650002001961650002801981650001502009650001002024650001202034650004602046650002102092650002502113650002802138650005002166650002302216650003302239650001102272650004602283650001002329650001102339650001102350650002002361650000902381650000902390650001502399650001502414650001502429653001802444653001302462700001802475700001902493773013402512852000902646856008602655930003302741945002502774946001302799655001202812IND4390320320221122194005.0070412e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439032032DNAL7 a173832732pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2007.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE310 0aT0001 aFitzPatrick, E.10aPositive Effects of Family Dinner Are Undone by Television Viewing  ap. 666-671.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe purpose of this cross-sectional study was to test the independent associations of eating dinner as a family and having the television on during dinner with child feeding behaviors. Parents/guardians of children participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children in New York state were surveyed (n=1,336). Main outcome variables were frequencies of serving fruits, vegetables, and milk. Main exposure variables were the number of days per week the family ate dinner together and the number of days per week the television was on during dinner. Multiple logistic regressions assessed the association between the exposure variables and each of the main outcome measures controlling for race/ethnicity and parental educational attainment. Each night the family ate dinner together was positively associated with serving fruits (odds ratio [OR]=1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07 to 1.21) or vegetables (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.23). Serving fruits (OR= 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.99) or vegetables (OR=0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98) decreased with each night the television was on during dinner. Neither family dinner nor television on during dinner was significantly associated with serving milk. Family dinners and dinners without television on are independent predictors of servings of fruits or vegetables offered to preschool children. Because dietary habits and preferences are established early in life, parents should be counseled to promote family meal environments that support healthful eating. 3avegetable products 3adinner 3aeating habits 3alifestyle 3aWIC Program 3adietary surveys 3across-sectional studies 3atelevision 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aChild, Preschool 2aConfidence Intervals 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDietxstandardsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aFamilyxpsychology 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiologyxpsychology. 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMilk 2aOdds Ratio 2aTelevision 2aVegetables 0afruits (food) 0afamilies1 aEdmunds, L.S.1 aDennison, B.A.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2007 Apr., v. 107, no. 4 p.666-671dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2007.01.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20071015b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/16  aOther US 7aarticle04141naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183072000900192100001900201245011100220300001600331500002400347500001500371520170300386650001702089650001702106650002902123650002402152650001202176650002002188650001902208650001302227650000902240650003102249650002802280650001702308650001602325650002002341650001602361650001202377650004302389650006202432650004602494650005402540650001002594650004602604650002002650650002802670650001902698650004202717650001102759650001102770650004702781650000902828650001802837650002002855650002102875653001402896653004302910700001902953700001502972700001702987700001403004700001703018773013403035852000903169856008603178930003303264945002503297946001303322655001203335IND4390319420221122125536.0070412e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439031942DNAL7 a173832642pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2007.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT100 0aT300 0aX3801 aFriedman, L.A.10aInfluence of Intervention on Beverage Choices: Trends in the Dietary Intervention Study in Children (DISC)  ap. 586-594.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective: To compare treatment, sex, and visit differences in beverage choice and calcium intake in the Dietary Intervention Study in Children, to compare the relationship of other beverages to milk consumption, and document whether or not the dietary intervention affected choice of beverage and milk type over time. Design: Data from the Dietary Intervention Study in Children, a randomized, controlled, multicenter, clinical trial with five sets of three 24-hour recalls. Subjects: Six hundred fifty-three children from six clinics started the study at age 8 to 10 years. Participants had serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels between the 80th and 98th percentiles of age, and were followed for a median of 7.3 years. Intervention: Children were randomized to a total fat- and saturated fat-modified dietary intervention or usual care. Main Outcome Measures: Volume and percent of total energy from soft drinks, fruit-flavored drinks, fruit juice, and milk, calcium intake in milligrams and per 1,000 kcal, and percent reduced-fat and skim milk consumed. Statistical Analyses: General Estimating Equations methodology was used to adjust for treatment, sex, and visit differences. Results: The intervention group consumed more reduced-fat or skim milk than the usual care group. The intervention group also reported a greater increase in calcium per 1,000 kcal than those in the usual care group due to nonbeverage sources. Consumption of soft drinks increased over the course of the study, whereas total milk consumption decreased sharply. Conclusions: With nutrition education, children can make changes in the type of milk consumed, and in the quantity of dietary calcium consumed. 3alow fat diet 3ablood lipids 3anutritional intervention 3anutrition education 3acalcium 3achild nutrition 3ahyperlipidemia 3achildren 3amilk 3arandomized clinical trials 3alow density lipoprotein 3afood choices 3asoft drinks 3adietary surveys 3adiet recall 2aAnimals 2aBeveragesxstatistics & numerical data 2aBone Density Conservation Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aCarbonated Beveragesxstatistics & numerical data 2aChild 2aChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aChoice Behavior 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aCohort Studies 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypercholesterolemiaxbloodxdiet therapy. 2aMale 2aMental Recall 2aMilkxchemistry 2aSex Distribution 0abeverages 0aDietary Intervention Study in Children1 aSnetselaar, L.1 aStumbo, P.1 aVan Horn, L.1 aSingh, B.1 aBarton, B.A.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2007 Apr., v. 107, no. 4 p.586-594dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2007.01.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20071015b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/16  aOther US 7aarticle02015naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245009600158300001400254520073200268650001201000650002701012650001501039650002801054650004301082650002201125650001501147650001101162653001401173653001201187653001901199653001901218653001901237653002101256700001301277700001501290700001601305700001701321773009301338852000901431856008501440930003301525946001101558655001201569IND4399900020221122061823.0080113e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439990002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-007-0599-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, X. 10aα-Amino acid behaves differently from β- or γ-amino acids as treated by trimetaphosphate  ap. 47-53.  aThe condensation reactions of sodium trimetaphosphate with single amino acids, namely glycine, L-alanine, β-alanine and γ-aminobutyric acid or pairs of these amino acids were reinvestigated by electrospray ion-trap mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography. It was found when mixtures were treated by sodium trimetaphosphate only in the presence of α-amino acid dipeptides were formed. Without addition of α-amino acids, the β-amino acid or γ-aminobutyric acid could not form peptide either by themselves or with their mixtures under the same conditions.

Amino acids are used for processes other than growth, including stress response. This study intended to analyse how repeated acute handling stress can affect growth and amino acid requirements in fish. Senegalese sole juveniles were weekly held in the air during 3 min (Handling) for 9 weeks; Control groups were left undisturbed. Growth and plasma levels of stress indicators and of free amino acids were assessed at the end of the experiment. Plasma cortisol and osmolality levels showed that fish in the Handling treatment were stressed, but growth was unaffected.

M. 10aRegulation of ornithine decarboxylase during oncogenic transformation: mechanisms and therapeutic potential  ap. 213-223.  aThe activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC¹), the first enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, is induced during carcinogenesis by a variety of oncogenic stimuli. Intracellular levels of ODC and the polyamines are tightly controlled during normal cell growth, and regulation occurs at the levels of transcription, translation and protein degradation. Several known proto-oncogenic pathways appear to control ODC transcription and translation, and dysregulation of pathways downstream of ras and myc result in the constitutive elevation of ODC activity that occurs with oncogenesis. Inhibition of ODC activity reverts the transformation of cells in vitro and reduces tumor growth in several animal models, suggesting high levels of ODC are necessary for the maintenance of the transformed phenotype. The ODC irreversible inactivator DFMO has proven to be not only a valuable tool in the study of ODC in cancer, but also shows promise as a chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent in certain types of malignancies. 3aanimal models 3abiosynthesis 3acarcinogenesis 3acell growth 3achemoprevention 3adrug therapy 3aneoplasms 3aornithine decarboxylase 3aphenotype 3apolyamines 3aprotein degradation 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics) 2aAdenosylmethionine Decarboxylasexantagonists & inhibitors 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Genetically Modified 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Transformation, Neoplasticxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aEflornithinexpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplasticxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aMAP Kinase Kinase Kinasesxphysiology 2aOrnithine Decarboxylasexbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aOrnithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors 2aProteinsxpharmacology 2aSkin Neoplasmsxetiology 0aOncogenic transformation 0aDFMO1 aLevin, V.

In the present study, we show that this epitope is also present on a size-variant protein (PvpA) of the avian pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum. Application of monoclonal antibody 1E5 in Western immunoblot analysis of Triton X-114 phase-fractionated proteins and in colony immunoblots, as well as in trypsin and carboxypeptidase digestion experiments, has demonstrated that (i) PvpA is an integral membrane protein with a free C terminus, (ii) the shared epitope is surface exposed, and (iii) PvpA is subjected to high-frequency phase variation in expression. By using serum antibodies from M. gallisephicum-infected chickens, we were able to demonstrate the immunogenic nature of PvpA and identify three additional highly immunogenic Triton X-114 phase proteins (p67, p72, and p75) also undergoing high-frequency phase variation spontaneously and independently. Metabolic labeling experiments with [14C]palmitate and [14C]oleate revealed that PvpA, in contrast to p67, p72, and p75, is not lipid modified. Southern blot hybridization with restriction fragments carrying the pvpA gene of M. gallisepticum or the vspA gene of M. bovis against digested genomic DNA of the two Mycoplasma species indicated the absence of genetic relatedness between the pvpA and vspA genes. The apparent complexity of the antigenic variation phenomenon in M. gallisepticum is discussed. 3aMycoplasma gallisepticum 3aMycoplasma bovis 3alipoproteins 3aepitopes 3asurface antigens 3abacterial proteins 3achickens 3aantibodies 3astructural genes 3aantigenic variation 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3abacterial antigens 2aAnimals 2aAntigenic Variation 2aAntigens, Bacterialxchemistryximmunology. 2aAntigens, Surfacexchemistryximmunology. 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryximmunology. 2aChickensximmunology 2aEpitopes 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aLipoproteinsximmunology 2aMembrane Proteinsxchemistryximmunology. 2aMolecular Weight 2aMycoplasmaximmunology 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 0apvpa protein 0avsp proteins 0apvpa gene 0avspa gene1 aMenaker, D.1 aStrutzberg, K.1 aLevisohn, S.1 aKirchhoff, H.1 aHinz, K.H.1 aRosengarten, R.0 tInfection and immunity.g1994 Nov., v. 62, no. 11 p.4962-4968x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle03574naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245019200164300001800356500001500374520176700389650001302156650002702169650001402196650004902210650003202259650001202291650003302303650003502336650001102371650002002382650003002402650004102432650001902473650002802492650000902520650002402529650001302553650004602566650008902612650002702701650003702728653002702765700001502792700001902807700001502826700001602841773008302857852000902940930003302949945001302982946001302995655001203008IND2038417120221122043401.0940331e199311  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203841712DNAL7 a84068832pmid7 aPMC2812392pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenich, K.10aExpression of the murine interleukin-4 gene in an attenuated aroA strain of Salmonella typhimurium: persistence and immune response in BALB/c mice and susceptibility to macrophage killing  ap. 4818-4827.  a2019-12-05  aCytokines are potentially useful in vaccination as adjuvants or modulators of the type of response induced. The work below describes the expression of a cloned cytokine gene for murine interleukin-4 (mIL-4) by a live vaccine vector, an attenuated aroA strain (SL7207) of Salmonella typhimurium, in a murine model system. SL7207 was used as a carrier for two different high-level expression vectors. Both resulting strains, designated SL7207(pOmpAmIL-4) and SL7207(pKKmIL-4), expressed the cloned gene product as monitored by both immunological and biological assays. However, SL7207(pOmpAmIL-4) produced mIL-4 at higher levels and was more stable in vitro than SL7207(pKKmIL-4). When SL7207(pOmpAmIL-4) was used as a live vaccine in BALB/c mice, this strain grew and survived at higher levels than the parental attenuated strain or empty plasmid-carrying strain in spleens, livers, and intestines. This difference in growth and survival did not appear to be caused by alterations in specific lymphocyte-mediated anti-salmonella immune responses such as delayed-type hypersensitivity or serum antibody as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; such alterations have been induced by RA administration in other in vivo systems, and the lack of effect here may reflect the fact that IL-4 is not secreted from the bacteria in large quantities, most of the cytokine being in the cytoplasmic-membrane-bound fraction. Conversely, the ability of mouse macrophages to kill the bacteria in vitro was inhibited by bacterial production of MIL-4. This reduction in macrophage killing activity suggests that bacterial production of mIL-4 may be detrimental to host defense against Salmonella infection and may explain the enhanced bacterial growth and survival in vivo. 3avaccines 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3acytokines 2a3-Phosphoshikimate 1-Carboxyvinyltransferase 2aAlkyl and Aryl Transferases 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aBacterial Vaccinesximmunology 2aFemale 2aGene Expression 2aHypersensitivity, Delayed 2aInterleukin-4xgeneticsximmunology. 2aLethal Dose 50 2aMacrophagesximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aPlasmids 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalximmunology 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxgrowth & developmentximmunologyxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aTransferasesxanalysis 2aVaccines, Attenuatedximmunology 0aSalmonella typhimurium1 aBorlin, P.1 aO'Hanley, P.D.1 aHoward, M.1 aHeath, A.W.0 tInfection and immunity.g1993 Nov., v. 61, no. 11 p.4818-4827x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02621naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001900189245005800208300001600266500002400282520097900306650001401285650001701299650000901316650001701325650000901342650001701351650001501368650001501383650001101398650002001409650001201429650003801441650002801479650005001507650001901557650001501576650004301591650000901634650003101643650004701674653002301721700002001744700001401764773010701778852000901885856009201894930003301986945002502019946001102044655001202055IND4390501920221122012105.0070416e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439050192DNAL7 a174450832pmid7 a10.1111/j.1463-5224.2007.00533.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL800 0aL8411 aShelah, Michal10aAcute blindness in a dog caused by an explosive blast  ap. 196-198.  aIncludes references  aA 3-year-old, intact male, mixed breed dog was presented with a complaint of acute blindness. Ten days previously, the area where the dog was walking came under a rocket attack, and a rocket landed and exploded 300 meters away from the dog. Physical examination was unremarkable. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed posterior segment fibrin clots and extensive vitreal hemorrhage in the right eye. A total retinal detachment (360° retinal dialysis) with no evidence of hemorrhage was noted in the left eye. There was no sign of any penetrating ocular trauma, and it was assumed that the posterior segment findings were primary injuries caused by the blast wave itself. Following anti-inflammatory treatment, partial vision was restored in the right eye. Surgical re-attachment of the retina was discussed and declined by the owner. This report describes, for the first time, vitreal hemorrhage and retinal detachment as the sole injuries caused by an explosive blast wave. 3ablindness 3acase studies 3adogs 3adog diseases 3aeyes 3aeye diseases 3aexplosions 3ahemorrhage 3avision 3aanimal injuries 2aAnimals 2aBlindnessxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aDiagnosis, Differential 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosisxetiologyxpathology. 2aDogsxinjuries 2aExplosions 2aEye Hemorrhagexdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aMale 2aOphthalmoscopyxveterinary 2aRetinal Detachmentxdiagnosisxveterinary. 0aretinal detachment1 aWeinberger, Dov1 aOfri, Ron0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2007 May, v. 10, no. 3 p.196-198dBlackwell Publishing Incx1463-52167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-5224.2007.00533.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071029b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/10/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03082naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245009600146300001800242500001500260520138500275650001601660650002401676650001201700650001701712650001401729650002201743650001201765650001201777650001601789650001301805650002001818650002301838650001201861650004301873650001101916650001501927650002201942650001701964650001101981650001401992650002702006650003502033650001902068653002102087653002102108653001902129653001302148653001602161653001502177700001902192700001802211700001802229700001902247700001402266773008402280852000902364930003302373945001302406946001302419655001202432IND2196486320221121235827.0990114e199807  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219648632DNAL7 a97107602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarkema, H.W.10aManagement practices associated with low, medium, and high somatic cell counts in bulk milk  ap. 1917-1927.  a2019-12-05  aManagement practices associated with bulk milk somatic cell counts (SCC) were studied for 201 dairy herds grouped into three categories according to bulk milk SCC. The cumulative production of fat-corrected milk over 305 d of lactation and category for bulk milk SCC were highly correlated; herds within the low category had the highest milk production. Differences in bulk milk SCC among the categories were well explained by the management practices studied. This correlation was not only true for the difference between the high (250,000 to 400,000) and low (less than or equal to 150,000) categories for bulk milk SCC but also for the difference between the medium (150,000 to 250,000) and low categories and the high and medium categories. Management practices that are known to be important for herds in the high category for bulk milk SCC, such as dry cow treatment, milking technique, postmilking teat disinfection, and antibiotic treatment of clinical mastitis, were also found to be important in the explanation of the difference between herds in the medium and low categories for bulk milk SCC. More attention was paid to hygiene for herds in the low category than for herds in the medium or high category. Supplementation of the diet with minerals occurred more frequently for cows in the low category for bulk milk SCC than for cows in the medium and high categories. 3adairy herds 3amathematical models 3ahygiene 3acalf feeding 3abulk milk 3amedical treatment 3acalving 3amilking 3amilk prices 3aduration 3abovine mastitis 3asomatic cell count 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aCattle 2aCell Count 2aDairyingxmethods 2aDisinfection 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aMammary Glands, Animal 2aMastitis, Bovinexdrug therapy 2aMilkxcytology 0aprice penalities 0aanimal husbandry 0acattle feeding 0ateat dip 0acow housing 0adry period1 aSchukken, Y.H.1 aLam, T.J.G.M.1 aBeiboer, M.L.1 aBenedictus, G.1 aBrand, A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 July, v. 81, no. 7 p.1917-1927x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03761naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001800189245011500207300001600322500002400338520191900362650001002281650001102291650001102302650002102313650001602334650002602350650001402376650002002390650001202410650002502422650003702447650002302484650005602507650001102563650002802574650003502602650000902637650004302646650003602689650002102725650002202746653002302768653003202791653002402823700001702847700001802864773010702882852000902989856009202998930003303090945002503123946001103148655001203159IND4390501020221121215137.0070416e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439050102DNAL7 a174450742pmid7 a10.1111/j.1463-5224.2007.00521.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL8001 aTrost, Katrin10aSchirmer tear test, phenol red thread tear test, eye blink frequency and corneal sensitivity in the guinea pig  ap. 143-146.  aIncludes references  aTo establish reference values for Schirmer tear tests (STT) I and II, phenol red thread (PRT) tear test and eye blink frequency, and to determine corneal sensitivity for normal guinea pigs. One hundred and eight eyes of 54 adult Duncan-Hartley guinea pigs. Schirmer tear test (STT) I and then STT II were performed in 36 guinea pigs. PRT and STT I were compared in 18 adult Duncan-Hartley guinea pigs. Corneal sensitivity was determined in 23 guinea pigs by evaluating the corneal touch threshold (CTT) of five different regions using a Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer. Eye blink frequency was measured in 10 guinea pigs over a period of 20 min and in 17 guinea pigs over a period of 10 min. Mean STT I was 0.36 mm ± 1.09 mm (wetting/min) and mean STT II was 0.43 mm ± 1.29 mm (wetting/min). There was no significant difference between mean STT I and mean STT II (P = 0.79). The mean PRT-value was 16 ± 4.7 mm (wetting/15 s), and the mean STT I-value in the same guinea pigs was 0.6 ± 1.83 mm (wetting/min). Corneal sensitivity was significantly higher in the center than in the four limbal regions. The mean CTT for central, ventral, nasal, temporal and dorsal regions was 2, 1.7, 1.7, 1.7 and 1.6 cm or 3.7, 5.2, 5.6, 5.7 and 6.4 g/mm², respectively. Eye blink frequency was between two to five (mean 3.4 ± 1.04) blinks per eye over 20 min in guinea pigs in their home environment, while in handheld and restrained guinea pigs eye blink frequency showed a variation between 0 and 17 blinks per eye (mean 3.24 ± 3.64 blinks per eye) over 10 min. As there were no significant differences between STT I and STT II results, reflex tear secretion in the guinea pig may not exist. The most likely explanation is a lower corneal sensitivity in the guinea pig than in other species, such as cats, dogs and horses. Because of the small amount of tears, PRT is the preferred test for tear measurement in the guinea pig. 3atears 3aphenol 3acornea 3acorneal diseases 3aguinea pigs 3adiagnostic techniques 3afrequency 3aanimal diseases 2aAnimals 2aBlinkingxphysiology 2aColoring Agentsxdiagnostic use. 2aCorneaxphysiology 2aDiagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmologicalxveterinary 2aFemale 2aGuinea Pigsxphysiology 2aLacrimal Apparatusxsecretion. 2aMale 2aPhenolsulfonphthaleinxdiagnostic use. 2aReagent Stripsxdiagnostic use. 2aReference Values 2aTearsxsecretion. 0aSchirmer tear test 0aphenol red thread tear test 0aeye blink frequency1 aSkalicky, M.1 aNell, Barbara0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2007 May, v. 10, no. 3 p.143-146dBlackwell Publishing Incx1463-52167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-5224.2007.00521.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071029b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/10/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02827naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072001700151072001700168072001700185100003000202242006900232245007800301300001400379500002400393520150600417650001501923650002201938650003001960650001301990650002702003650002202030650001602052650002102068651001302089700002802102700002002130773007402150852000902224856009102233930003302324945002502357946001102382655001202393IND4419763420141219000000.0090430e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND441976342DNAL7 a10.1590/S1519-566X20090001000042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Species richness and specimen relative frequency of ants were positively correlated with area, whereas no significant correlation was found between species richness and the degree of isolation calculated for the forest patches. As the fragmentation affects different functional groups in different ways, we analyzed the species-area relationship for separate functional groups of ants. According to the habitat requirements we found that the species richness increased faster as area increased for ants inhabiting decomposing wood, followed by ants associated with trees, while species richness of ants living under dead leaves did not correlate with area. According to the food preference, species richness was positively correlated with area for the army ant group, while no significant correlation was found for solitary hunters or for leaf-cutting ants. Ant species richness and specimen density were calculated from equal size samples and examined in relation to the habitat area. An inverse correlation was found only for specimen density, the opposite of what was expected. To our knowledge this is one of the first studies showing differential responses of functional groups of ants to habitat loss. Moreover, it emphasizes the conservation value of small forest fragments for ants in a tropical dry forest. 3aFormicidae 3aspecies diversity 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3aplant-insect relations 3aforest ecosystems 3adry forests 3atropical forests 3aColombia1 aUlloa-Chacón, Patricia1 aArmbrecht, Inge0 tNeotropical entomology.g2009 , v. 38, no. 1 p.44-54x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20090001000043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090608b20090703c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/06/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02200naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245010900162300001600271520106900287650001201356650001901368650001201387650002201399650001801421650000901439650001801448650002401466650001601490650001501506700001601521700001301537700002001550773010601570852000901676856008501685930003301770946001101803655001201814IND4427186420221122053313.0091012e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442718642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10532-009-9273-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhirong 10aComparative study of the nitrification characteristics of two different nitrifier immobilization methods  ap. 859-865.  aThe research investigated the nitrification characteristics of two different immobilization methods: nitrifier encapsulation in polyethylene glycol (PEG) gel pellets and nitrifier biofilm attachment on elastic plastic filler. The two carriers were placed in identical reactors. They reached a maximum nitrification rate of 39 and 25 mgN/L·h 30 days after start-up. The results showed that the nitrification efficiency in the PEG reactor was higher than in the biofilm reactor under the same conditions. Variations in temperature decreased the nitrification rate by approximately 55% in the PEG reactor from 28 to 8°C, while 74.2% in the biofilm reactor. When the COD loading rate was increased to 0.8 kg/m³ day, the nitrification efficiency in the biofilm reactor dropped sharply to 23%, and that of PEG reactor remained over 80%. PEG pellets with a high nitrification rate under all conditions showed promise as an immobilization medium, and are likely to be utilized in the nitrification of high-strength ammonia and COD wastewater during long-term operation. 3aammonia 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3acomparative study 3aencapsulation 3agels 3anitrification 3apolyethylene glycol 3atemperature 3awastewater1 aZhang, Zhi 1 aLi, Jun 1 aZhang, Zhenjia 0 tBiodegradation.g2009 Nov., v. 20, no. 6 p.859-865dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0923-98207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10532-009-9273-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091012b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03250naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100001900183245013800202300001600340500002400356500001500380520133200395650001501727650002001742650001301762650001801775650002201793650002801815650001601843650001401859650002701873650001501900650001401915650001701929650001701946650001701963650002701980650001802007650002402025650001202049650003102061650002102092650001102113650002802124650003102152650002502183650002402208653002702232653003202259653001302291700001702304700001502321773008802336852000902424856008602433930003302519945002502552946001102577655001202588IND4388368120221122053201.0070301e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438836812DNAL7 a159140462pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2005.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL2101 aRobinson, R.S.10aSupra-basal progesterone concentrations during the follicular phase are associated with development of cystic follicles in dairy cows  ap. 340-346.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that supra-basal concentrations of progesterone during the follicular phase are associated with the development of follicular cysts. Twenty-five non-lactating dairy cows were used in the study, which was performed over five identical replicate trials. Luteolysis was induced during the mid-luteal phase. Transrectal ultrasonography was performed daily to determine the occurrence/timing of ovulation. Plasma samples were collected for progesterone, oestradiol and luteinizing hormone (LH) analysis. Three cows failed to ovulate (cystic anovulatory) but did ovulate in a subsequent replicate (cystic ovulatory). Eight cows from the appropriate replicates were used as control cows (normal group). Follicular growth patterns and plasma oestradiol concentrations were similar between the three groups. However, the plasma progesterone concentrations during the follicular phase were twofold higher in the cystic anovulatory group (P < 0.01). Furthermore, no LH surge was detected in these animals. While LH pulse amplitude was similar between groups, LH pulse frequency in the cystic anovulatory group was attenuated (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the formation of follicular cysts were preceded by elevated plasma progesterone concentrations and the suppression of the LH surge. 3adairy cows 3acattle diseases 3aetiology 3aovarian cysts 3ahormone secretion 3aepidemiological studies 3aanovulation 3aneoplasms 3afollicular development 3abiomarkers 3aestradiol 3ablood plasma 3aprogesterone 3apathogenesis 3abiochemical mechanisms 3aestrous cycle 3aluteinizing hormone 2aAnimals 2aCattlexbloodxphysiology. 2aEstradiolxblood 2aFemale 2aFollicular Phasexblood 2aLuteinizing Hormonexblood 2aOvarian Cystsxblood 2aProgesteronexblood 0areproductive disorders 0aendocrine system physiology 0ahormones1 aHunter, M.G.1 aMann, G.E.0 tVeterinary journal.g2006 Sept., v. 172, no. 2 p.340-346dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2005.04.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070720b20070802c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/06/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02955naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100002100174245011800195300001600313500002400329500001500353520103400368650001801402650001801420650002101438650001501459650001501474650002001489650000901509650003701518650001101555650001901566650001701585650002401602650001501626650001201641650007701653650006901730650002101799650000901820650006701829650002501896653002001921653001601941653001501957700001601972700001501988700001402003700001702017700001402034700001702048773008802065852000902153856008602162930003302248945002502281946001102306655001202317IND4388367920221122043303.0070301e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438836792DNAL7 a159941012pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2005.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8101 aAlbarellos, G.A.10aCiprofloxacin and norfloxacin pharmacokinetics and prostatic fluid penetration in dogs after multiple oral dosing  ap. 334-339.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aims of this study were to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) indices predictive of clinical outcome of ciprofloxacin (CIP) and norfloxacin (NOR) after multiple oral dosing, and to investigate their penetration into prostatic fluid in dogs. Eight dogs received seven oral doses b.i.d. of NOR (20 mg/kg) and CIP (15 mg/kg). Drug concentrations were determined in blood and in two prostatic fluid samples. Prostatic fluid concentrations were lower than plasma concentrations for both drugs. No statistically significant differences were determined between the pharmacokinetic parameters calculated after the first and seventh doses for either CIP or NOR. The PK/PD indices were found to be useful for predicting bacteriological outcome for fluoroquinolones (area under the disposition curve/minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] and peak plasma concentration/MIC) and indicate that with this dose regimen CIP presents a more favourable disposition than NOR for successful clinical outcome. 3adose response 3aciprofloxacin 3apharmacokinetics 3abiomarkers 3aabsorption 3adrug evaluation 3adogs 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3adosage 3aprostate gland 3ablood plasma 3aoral administration 3aprediction 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aCiprofloxacinxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aDogsxmetabolism 2aMale 2aNorfloxacinxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aProstatexmetabolism 0aprostatic fluid 0anorfloxacin 0aquinolones1 aMontoya, L.1 aWaxman, S.1 aKreil, V.1 aAmbros, L.A.1 aHallu, R.1 aRebuelto, M.0 tVeterinary journal.g2006 Sept., v. 172, no. 2 p.334-339dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2005.05.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20070720b20070802c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/06/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03082naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002800186245008800214300001600302506007600318520149000394506003701884650001201921650001801933650001601951650001201967650001201979650001201991650000902003650004302012650001302055650001402068650002802082650000902110700002202119700001702141700002502158700001402183700002402197700002002221700002602241700002402267700001902291773010202310852000902412856008502421930003302506946001302539655001202552IND4427187220221207090523.0091012e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442718722DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-009-9211-82doi7 aPMC27754602pmcid7 a196970802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolberg Woods, Leah C. 10aIdentification of genetic loci involved in diabetes using a rat model of depression  ap. 486-497.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhile diabetic patients often present with comorbid depression, the underlying mechanisms linking diabetes and depression are unknown. The Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat is a well-known animal model of depression and stress hyperreactivity. In addition, the WKY rat is glucose intolerant and likely harbors diabetes susceptibility alleles. We conducted a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis in the segregating F₂ population of a WKY × Fischer 344 (F344) intercross. We previously published QTL analyses for depressive behavior and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity in this cross. In this study we report results from the QTL analysis for multiple metabolic phenotypes, including fasting glucose, post-restraint stress glucose, postprandial glucose and insulin, and body weight. We identified multiple QTLs for each trait and many of the QTLs overlap with those previously identified using inbred models of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Significant correlations were found between metabolic traits and HPA axis measures, as well as forced swim test behavior. Several metabolic loci overlap with loci previously identified for HPA activity and forced swim behavior in this F₂ intercross, suggesting that the genetic mechanisms underlying these traits may be similar. These results indicate that WKY rats harbor diabetes susceptibility alleles and suggest that this strain may be useful for dissecting the underlying genetic mechanisms linking diabetes, HPA activity, and depression.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3aanimal models 3abody weight 3afasting 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3aloci 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aquantitative trait loci 3arats1 aAhmadiyeh, Nasim 1 aBaum, Amber 1 aShimomura, Kazuhiro 1 aLi, Qian 1 aSteiner, Donald F. 1 aTurek, Fred W. 1 aTakahashi, Joseph S. 1 aChurchill, Gary A. 1 aRedei, Eva E. 0 tMammalian genome.g2009 Aug., v. 20, no. 8 p.486-497dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-009-9211-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20091012b20091106c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02086naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001700170245007000187300001600257500002400273500001500297520069100312650001901003650000901022650002301031650001901054650001501073650001601088650002701104650000701131653002201138653002501160653001801185653002601203653001901229653002501248653001701273700002001290773012401310852000901434856009201443930003301535945002501568946001101593655001201604IND4390499820221122043315.0070416e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439049982DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-0307.2007.00316.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ101 0aQ5011 aSHON, JINHAN10aFunctional attributes of native and thermized sour and sweet whey  ap. 135-142.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe functional attributes of sour (cottage) and sweet (Edam and Cheddar) whey powders and the effect of thermization (80°C/30 min) were investigated.

Bemisia tabaci females were confined in acrylic boxes in which tomato leaflets were fixed at the bottom and top part of the boxes to allow insects to access the leaf surface to be tested (adaxial and/or abaxial) in both no-choice and free choice tests. Oviposition was always higher when the leaf was offered at the top of the box and preferably at the abaxial leaf surface. The effects of leaf trichomes (glandular and non glandular) on B. tabaci oviposition was evaluated by offering the abaxial surface of tomato leaflets to females after a 70% ethanol wash to remove glandular exsudates against a control treatment (without a ethanol wash). Oviposition was concentrated mostly near to non glandular trichomes, showing whitefly females can discriminate among the trichomes. 3aBemisia argentifolii 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3aphytophagous insects 3aoviposition 3areproductive behavior 3ahost preferences 3aplant-insect relations 3ahost plants 3atomatoes 3atrichomes 3aplant morphology1 aSouza, Antonio P. de1 aOngarelli, Maria das G.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2009 , v. 38, no. 1 p.126-132x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20090001000143Available from publisher's Web site  a20090609b20090703c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/06/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02741naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245010100161300001600262520151800278650001501796650002401811650002401835650001601859650001901875650001901894650001001913650002701923650001801950650001601968653001001984653005101994700001602045700001702061700002002078773009502098852000902193856008502202930003302287946001102320655001202331IND4393298620221122013132.0070722e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439329862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-006-0400-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLovell, R. 14aThe time-profile of the PBMC HSP70 response to in vitro heat shock appears temperature-dependent  ap. 137-144.  aHeat shock proteins (HSPs) are synthesised by cells subsequent to a stress exposure and are known to confer protection to the cell in response to a second challenge. HSP induction and decay are correlated to thermotolerance and may therefore be used as a biomarker of thermal history. The current study tested the temperature-dependent nature of the heat shock response and characterised its time profile of induction. Whole blood from 6 healthy males (Age: 26 ± (SD) 2 yrs; Body mass 74.2 ± 3.8 kgs; VO₂max: 49.1 ± 4.0 ml·kg-¹·min-¹) were isolated and exposed to in vitro heat shock (HS) at 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41 °C for a period of 90 min. After HS the temperature was returned to 37 °C and intracellular HSP70 was quantified from the leukocytes at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h after heat treatment. The concentration of HSP70 was not different between temperatures (P > 0.05), but the time-profile of HSP70 synthesis appeared temperature-dependent. At control (37 °C) and lower temperatures (38-39 °C) the mean HSP70 concentration increased up to 4 h post HS (P < 0.05) and then returned towards baseline values by 6 h post HS. With in vitro hyperthermic conditions (40-41 °C), the time-profile was characterised by a sharp rise in HSP70 levels immediately after treatment (P < 0.05 for 40 °C at 0 h), followed by a progressive decline over time. The results suggest a temperature-dependent time-profile of HSP70 synthesis. In addition, the temperature at which HSP70 is inducted might be lower than 37 °C. 3abiomarkers 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat shock response 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aheat treatment 3amales 3amononuclear leukocytes 3anormal values 3atemperature 0aPBMCs 0aHeat shock protein 70 - Temperature - In vitro1 aMadden, L. 1 aCarroll, S. 1 aMcNaughton, L. 0 tAmino acids.g2007 July, v. 33, no. 1 p.137-144dVienna : Springer-Verlagx0939-44517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-006-0400-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20070722b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04031naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147072000900156100001600165245011300181300001800294500002400312500001500336520225800351650001502609650001802624650001202642650001002654650001902664650001002683650001602693650001602709650002002725650002002745650001802765650001402783650002102797650001302818650002302831650001102854650002802865650001202893650003402905650001102939650002802950650003402978650001103012650000903023650002103032650002203053650004303075653002203118653001503140700001503155773011903170852000903289930003303298945002503331946001303356655001203369IND4390449120221122012839.0070416e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439044912DNAL7 a174309622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL100 0aE200 0aX1001 aOlynk, N.J.10aExpected Net Present Value of Pure and Mixed Sexed Semen Artificial Insemination Strategies in Dairy Heifers  ap. 2569-2576.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSexed semen has been a long-anticipated tool for dairy farmers to obtain more heifer calves, but challenges exist for integrating sexed semen into commercial dairy farm reproduction programs. The decreased conception rates (CR) experienced with sexed semen make virgin heifers better suited for insemination with sexed semen than lactating dairy cows. This research sought to identify when various sexed semen breeding strategies provided higher expected net present value (NPV) than conventional artificial insemination (AI) breeding schemes, indicating which breeding scheme is advisable under various scenarios. Budgets were developed to calculate the expected NPV of various AI breeding strategies incorporating conventional (non-sexed) and sexed semen. In the base budgets, heifer and bull calf values were held constant at $500 and $110, respectively. The percentage of heifers expected to be born after breeding with conventional and sexed semen used was 49.2 and 90%, respectively. Breeding costs per AI were held constant at $15.00 per AI for conventional semen and $45.00 per AI for sexed semen of approximately the same genetic value. Conventional semen CR of 58 and 65% were used, and an AI submission rate was set at 100%. Breeding strategies with sexed semen were assessed for breakeven heifer calf values and sexed semen costs to obtain a NPV equal to that achieved with conventional semen. Breakeven heifer calf values for pure sexed semen strategies with a constant 58 and 65% base CR in which sexed semen achieved 53% of the base CR are $732.11 and $664.26, respectively. Breakeven sexed semen costs per AI of $17.16 and $22.39, compared with $45.00 per AI, were obtained to obtain a NPV equal to that obtained with pure conventional semen for base CR of 58 and 65%, respectively. The strategy employing purely sexed semen, with base CR of both 58 and 65%, yielded a lower NPV than purely conventional semen in all but the best-case scenario in which sexed semen provides 90% of the CR of conventional semen. Other potential advantages of sexed semen that were not quantified in the scenarios include biosecurity-related concerns, decreased dystocia due to increased numbers of heifer calves, and implications for internal herd growth. 3adairy cows 3agenetic merit 3aheifers 3asemen 3apregnancy rate 3abulls 3abiosecurity 3adairy herds 3aconception rate 3aanimal breeding 3acost analysis 3alactation 3asex preselection 3adystocia 3afarm profitability 3acalves 3aartificial insemination 2aAnimals 2aBreedingxeconomicsxmethods. 2aCattle 2aCosts and Cost Analysis 2aDairyingxeconomicsxmethods. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aModels, Economic 2aSemenxphysiology 2aSex Preselectionxmethodsxveterinary. 0aeconomic analysis 0aconception1 aWolf, C.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 May, v. 90, no. 5 p.2569-2576dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20070719b20070802c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/06/12  aOther US 7aarticle01847naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245008400162300001600246520069200262650001300954650002000967650002300987650001301010653003501023653004201058653002401100653001801124653002001142700001701162700001601179700001501195700001701210773009601227852000901323856008501332930003301417946001101450655001201461IND4394597920221122013145.0070902e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439459792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-006-0451-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Q.

Many efforts have been made for synthesis of those intermediates, but there exist some flaws yet. We observed that dielectric constants of organic solvents drastically affected diazotization of O-benzyl-L-tyrosine. Optically pure (S)-3-p-benzyloxyphenyllactic acid was obtained by simple recrystallization when DMF or DMSO of higher dielectric constant was used as a co-solvent in diazotization of O-benzyl-L-tyrosine. It was easily turned into various optically pure (S)-3-p-hydroxyphenyllactic acid derivatives. 3aagonists 3acrystallization 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3asolvents 0a(S)-p-Hydroxyphenyllactic acid 0a(S)-3-p-Benzyloxyphenylpropionic acid 0aO-Benzyl-L-tyrosine 0aDiazotization 0aSolvent effects1 aWang, H.

These processes have promised advances towards SFM that the current property rights conveyed on the forest industry, through existing systems of tenures, may simply not allow. In general, the broad social welfare approach that current thinking in sustainable development supports, and that certification and criteria and indicators appear to employ, is not consistent with the incentives, rights, and responsibilities that private forestry firms currently hold. There is a fundamental mismatch between the property rights that have been conveyed to private firms operating on public forest lands and what the policy frameworks of certification and C&I are expected to deliver. The conclusion is that if the voids in forest policy are to be successfully filled by certification and C&I, the underlying property rights currently held by firms will need revision. 3aforest management 3aforest policy 3asustainable forestry 3aproperty rights 3aland tenure 3aprivate forestry 3apublic lands 3aCanada 0aliterature reviews 0aforest tenure1 aBoxall, Peter C.0 tForestry chronicle.g2009 , v. 85, no. 2 p.277-284x0015-75467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc85277-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20090622b20090703c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle01941naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155100001800172245009400190300001600284500002300300500001500323520077800338650001801116650002601134650002301160650002201183650001701205651002101222653003201243700001701275700002301292773007201315852000901387856007801396930003301474945002501507946001101532655001201543IND4419769620221121220251.0090430e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441976962DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc85293-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Stakeholder interviews, document review and visits to the case sites (Denman Island, Malcolm Island, Cortes Island and Creston) were used to collect data on events occurring between 1990 and 2005. In addition to case-specific challenges, our analysis confirmed common challenges related to a lack of support, consensus, and organizational resources as well as poor forest health and timber profiles, resistance from conventional forest management, and competition for land and tenures. Development pressure emerged as a challenge for communities without land use decisionmaking authority. The final section offers some lessons and recommendations. 3aforest policy 3acitizen participation 3acommunity forestry 3aforest management 3acase studies 3aBritish Columbia 0anatural resource management1 aHanna, Kevin1 aSlocombe, D.

Pancreatic fluid was continuously collected, measured, and reintroduced in catheterized calves. Blood samples were withdrawn for measurements of gut regulatory peptide concentrations in plasma. A slight increase in outflow of pancreatic fluid was observed 30 min before the milk diet was introduced but not before the soybean diet was fed. In contrast, concentrations and outflows of protein and trypsin immediately after feeding were higher when calves were fed the soybean diet. Overall, during the first 5 h postfeeding, the outflow of pancreatic fluid was 40% higher when the milk diet was fed than when the soybean diet was fed. No difference in outflow of protein was observed, but that of trypsin was 82% higher when the soybean diet was fed. This enhanced enzyme secretion could have been related to the increased plasma concentrations of gastrin and cholecystokinin after the soybean diet was fed. Secretin release was less in calves fed the milk diet that in calves fed the soybean diet during the first 2 h postfeeding, suggesting that this gut peptide along with gastrin and cholecystokinin, contributed to the stimulation of enzyme secretion. Plasma gut regulatory peptides could be influenced by the soybean diet, which does not coagulate in the stomach, inducing faster gastric emptying of protein and fat, and by the chemical form of protein from the soybean diet and the lower susceptibility of these proteins to protease compared with casein. However, the resulting enhancement of pancreatic trypsin secretion and activity seemed to be insufficient to increase the digestibility of soybean protein up to a level similar to that of milk. 3asomatostatin 3atrypsin 3asoy protein 3asecretion 3acalf feeding 3apancreatic juice 3aflow 3adried skim milk 3asecretin 3acalves 3acholecystokinin 3agastrins 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCholecystokininxblood 2aGastrinsxblood 2aGastrointestinal Hormonesxblood 2aKinetics 2aMale 2aMilk 2aPancreasxsecretion. 2aPancreatic Juicexsecretion. 2aSecretinxblood 2aSomatostatinxblood 2aSoybean Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aTrypsinxsecretion. 0adietary protein 0agut regulatory peptide 0aantitrypsin 0agastrointestinal hormones1 aLe Huerou-Luron, I.1 aGestin, M.1 aRome, V.1 aPlodari, M.1 aBernard, C.1 aChayvialle, J.A.1 aGuilloteau, P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 May, v. 81, no. 5 p.1313-1321x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02101naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245010300132300001800235520106200253650001001315650002701325650002301352650001201375650002301387650001301410650002101423650002101444650002101465650002501486653002801511653002001539700001701559773008301576852000901659930003301668945001301701946001301714655001201727IND2046966120221121220311.0950724e199411  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204696612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtega-Mora, L.M.10aAge-related resistance in ovine cryptosporidiosis: patterns of infection and humoral immune repair  ap. 5003-5009.  aThe phenomenon of age-related resistance to infection with Cryptosporidium parvum has been well characterized in rodent models, and its existence has been demonstrated in calves. To determine whether this is a genuine age effect in a fully susceptible animal model or the result of infection with related pathogens inducing a nonspecific immunity, and to examine several parameters associated with severity of clinical diseases, lambs maintained in a parasite-free environment were infected with C. parvum oocysts at increasing ages. A marked decrease in the severity of clinical symptoms was observed as the age at infection increased, though the kinetics of both fecal and serum antibody responses were similar in all age groups, suggesting that mechanisms other than humoral response may play an important role in the development of age-related resistance. This study demonstrates the first experimental evidence for age-related resistance to ovine cryptosporidiosis and examines parameters which may influence the acquisition of resistance to infection. 3alambs 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3adisease resistance 3aoocysts 3aantibody formation 3adiarrhea 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aprotozoal infections 0aexperimental infections 0aage differences1 aWright, S.E.0 tInfection and immunity.g1994 Nov., v. 62, no. 11 p.5003-5009x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle01520naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245009100161300001600252520040900268650001000677650001600687650001400703650001600717650001300733653002900746653002400775653002500799653003300824653003100857653002100888700002000909773009500929852000901024856006901033930003301102946001101135655001201146IND4390182920221121143853.0070408e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439018292DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-006-0384-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaputo, R. 10aEnantiopure β³-amino acids-2,2-d₂ via homologation of proteinogenic α-amino acids  ap. 401-404.  aA procedure for the synthesis of enantiopure β³-amino acids from proteinogenic α-amino acids, developed by our group a few years ago, has been modified to enable the production of C-2 fully deuterated, C-protected β³-amino acids and, even more important, the synthesis of valuable deuterium labelled N(Boc)-protected chiral synthons, such as 2-aminoalcohols, 2-aminoiodides, and β³-amino nitriles. 3aacids 3aamino acids 3adeuterium 3aenantiomers 3anitriles 0aβ³-amino nitriles-d₂ 0a2-aminoiodides-d₂ 0a2-aminoalcohols-d₂ 0aC-2-dideuterated amino acids 0aα-amino acid homologation 0aβ³-amino acids1 aLongobardo, L. 0 tAmino acids.g2007 Apr., v. 32, no. 3 p.401-404dVienna : Springer-Verlagx0939-44517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-006-0384-03electronic resource  a20070408b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02195naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164100001400173245012900187300001600316500002400332520100200356650002001358650001601378650001501394650001601409650001601425650001801441650001601459650002001475700002001495700001601515773010601531852000901637856007001646930003301716945002501749946001101774655001201785IND4388363620221121145124.0070301s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438836362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2005.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF851 0aL300 0aL0011 aCox, P.D.14aThe effects of temperature on flight initiation in a range of moths, beetles and parasitoids associated with stored products  ap. 111-117.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of temperature on flight initiation in a range of stored-product pests and their parasitoids have been studied in laboratory flight chambers.

Flight is discussed as a factor in sustainable pest management strategies for storage insects; its importance in the spread of infestation and the likely success of physical and biological control methods is highlighted. 3astorage insects 3aLepidoptera 3aColeoptera 3aHymenoptera 3aparasitoids 3ainsect flight 3atemperature 3astored products1 aWakefield, M.E.1 aJacob, T.A.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2007, v. 43, no. 2 p.111-117dElsevier Sciencex0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2005.11.0063electronic resource  a20070312b20070402c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02754naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100002000164245007800184300001800262500002400280500001500304520125300319650001801572650001201590650001201602650000901614650001101623650004801634650002201682650002401704650000901728650000701737650002701744650001101771650001001782650002201792650001301814653002101827653001201848700002101860700002101881700002001902773013501922852000902057856007702066930003302143945002502176946001102201655001202212IND4422533120140725000000.0090626e20090815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442253312DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.36362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ106 0aQ116 0aQ5061 aCardoso, Carlos10aEffect of dietary fibre and MTGase on the quality of mackerel surimi gels  ap. 1648-1658.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: The effects of microbial transglutaminase (MTGase; 5 g kg⁻¹) and dietary fibre (inner pea fibre and chicory root inulin, 20 and 40 g kg⁻¹) on gels from surimi made with Atlantic (Scomber scombrus) and chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) were studied with the purpose of achieving a better understanding of the underlying phenomena and improving gels.RESULTS: MTGase addition improved textural properties (namely, cohesiveness increased from 0.19-0.41 to 0.59-0.72) and increased pH and water-holding capacity (WHC). Moreover, MTGase reduced the elastic and viscous modules and darkened gels; protein solubility declined, meaning greater protein aggregation, according to electropherograms. MTGase had no unequivocal effect upon the gels' microstructure. Pea fibre increased hardness (an increase of almost 60% with 40 g kg⁻¹) and related parameters, the elastic and viscous modules and WHC. Pea fibre reduced extractable protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea (in the absence of MTGase) as well. Scanning electron microscopy revealed different structures for gels containing pea fibre. Regarding inulin, it worsened textural quality and WHC.CONCLUSION: A combination of MTGase and pea fibre can improve a poor quality surimi. 3adietary fiber 3achicory 3atexture 3apeas 3asurimi 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3aScomber japonicus 3aenzymatic treatment 3agels 3apH 3awater holding capacity 3ainulin 3aroots 3aCichorium intybus 3agelation 0aScomber scrombus 0aScomber1 aMendes, Rogério1 aVaz-Pires, Paulo1 aNunes, Maria L.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2009 Aug. 15, v. 89, no. 10 p.1648-1658dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.36363Available from publisher's Web site  a20090708b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/07/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02580naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002300154245006800177300001400245500002400259520125800283650001401541650001901555650002201574650002601596650002301622650001901645650001601664650001101680650001101691650000801702650000901710650002601719650001401745650001001759650001601769650001201785650000901797650001101806650001401817650001201831650001201843650001801855650001801873773012901891852000902020856005702029655001202086IND4456097820221121113628.0110408e197603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445609782DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1976.tb02582.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aROBERTSON, GILLIAN10aMarking aphids and their parasites with ¹⁴c in field studies  ap. 65-76.  aIncludes references  aAphids (Brevicoryne brassicae (L.) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer)) were marked with ¹⁴C by feeding them on host plants (rape, Brassica napus L. var. oleifera and kale, Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala (D.C.) Alef.) which had been exposed to ¹⁴CO₂. With concentrations of radioactivity in the leaves of 20-50 μCi per g wet weight, the adult aphids contained 5-10nCi* of ¹⁴C after 2 days' feeding. The concentration of activity in the leaves decreased with a half-life of 6-12 days depending on the age of the leaves. The aphids lost much of their activity after removal to an unlabelled plant, retaining 20% of the initial activity after 8 days. The first progeny born had an activity of 3% of the initial activity of the parents, and those born after 8 days, 0.08%. The progeny retained 70% of this activity as adults. Parasites (Diaeretiella rapae (M'Intosh)) contained 2-4 nCi after developing from egg to adult in aphids labelled with 4-30nCi. Adult parasites contained 0.3nCi after feeding on labelled honey dew. In a field trial, marked aphids and parasites were identified amongst insects caught at 0.6 m and 6 m from a labelled plant.

The major objective of this research was to use whey permeate as an alternative growth medium for the cultivation of mycelia of edible mushroom G. lucidum and to find an optimum condition for solid-state cultivation. Response surface analysis was applied to determine the combination of substrate concentration (25 to 45 g of lactose/L), pH (3.5 to 5.5), and temperature (25 to 35°C) resulting in a maximal mycelial growth. The radial extension rates, estimated by measuring the diameters of growing colonies on the Petri dishes, were used as the growth of the mycelia at different conditions. In the model, pH and temperature significantly affected mycelial growth, but lactose concentration did not. The condition predicted to maximize the radial extension rate of 17.6 ± 0.4 mm/d was determined to be pH 4.4 and temperature 29.4°C. Therefore, the results suggest that whey permeate could be utilized as a growth substrate for the cultivation of mycelia from the edible mushroom G. lucidum, enhancing the use of this by-product by the cheese manufacturing industry. 3aGanoderma lucidum 3amushrooms 3amushroom growing 3awhey 3apermeates 3agrowing media 3aresponse surface methodology 3alactose 3apH 3atemperature 3amycelium 3awaste utilization 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactosexanalysis 2aMilk Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMyceliumxgrowth & development 2aReishixgrowth & development 2aTemperature1 aKim, N.1 aLee, S.1 aHwang, S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 May, v. 90, no. 5 p.2141-2146dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20070719b20070802c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/06/12  aOther US 7aarticle04538naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179100002200196245011600218300001800334500001500352520198200367650002302349650002002372650002802392650003002420650001502450650002402465650001502489650001602504650001402520650002402534650001302558650002002571650001902591650002002610650001602630650002202646650004002668650001002708650002302718650003602741650006502777650002402842650002402866650001102890650001102901650002402912650000902936650001602945650002702961650004702988650001303035650001703048650003903065650005703104650004303161653001403204653002303218700001903241700002403260700002403284700002003308700001903328700001803347700002203365700002003387773013803407852000903545856008303554930003303637945002503670946001303695655001203708IND4419557020221121080657.0090424e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441955702DNAL7 a193215732pmid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.270042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZittermann, Armin10aVitamin D supplementation enhances the beneficial effects of weight loss on cardiovascular disease risk markers  ap. 1321-1327.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: High blood concentrations of parathyroid hormone and low concentrations of the vitamin D metabolites 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and calcitriol are considered new cardiovascular disease risk markers. However, there is also evidence that calcitriol increases lipogenesis and decreases lipolysis. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of vitamin D on weight loss and traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular disease risk markers in overweight subjects. DESIGN: Healthy overweight subjects (n = 200) with mean 25(OH)D concentrations of 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL) received vitamin D (83 μg/d) or placebo in a double-blind manner for 12 mo while participating in a weight-reduction program. RESULTS: Weight loss was not affected significantly by vitamin D supplementation (-5.7 ± 5.8 kg) or placebo (-6.4 ± 5.6 kg). However, mean 25(OH)D and calcitriol concentrations increased by 55.5 nmol/L and 40.0 pmol/L, respectively, in the vitamin D group but by only 11.8 nmol/L and 9.3 pmol/L, respectively, in the placebo group (P < 0.001), whereas a more pronounced decrease occurred in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group in blood concentrations of parathyroid hormone (-26.5% compared with -18.7%; P = 0.014), triglycerides (-13.5% compared with +3.0%; P < 0.001), and the inflammation marker tumor necrosis factor-α (-10.2% compared with -3.2%; P = 0.049). The beneficial biochemical effects were independent of the loss in body weight, fat mass, and sex. However, compared with placebo, vitamin D supplementation also increased LDL-cholesterol concentrations (+5.4% compared with -2.5%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that a vitamin D supplement of 83 μg/d does not adversely affect weight loss and is able to significantly improve several cardiovascular disease risk markers in overweight subjects with inadequate vitamin D status participating in a weight-reduction program. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00493012. 3anutritional status 3ablood chemistry 3acardiovascular diseases 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3abiomarkers 3aparathyroid hormone 3acalcitriol 3alipogenesis 3alipolysis 3avitamin supplements 3apatients 3ahuman nutrition 3arisk reduction 3aclinical trials 3aweight loss 3aprotective effect 2aAdipose Tissuexanatomy & histology 2aAdult 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aCalcifediolxbloodxdeficiency. 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aDietary Supplements 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInflammationxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxcomplications 2aOverweightxdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aPlacebos 2aRisk Factors 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxblood 2aVitamin Dxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aWeight Lossxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0avitamin D 0aventricular ectopy1 aFrisch, Sabine1 aBerthold, Heiner K.1 aGötting, Christian1 aKühn, Joachim.1 aKleesiek, Knut1 aStehle, Peter1 aKoertke, Heinrich1 aKoerfer, Reiner0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 May, v. 89, no. 5 p.1321-1327dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.270043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/02  aOther US 7aarticle03520naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100001700156245013700173300001800310500002400328500001500352520153200367650002401899650002901923650001801952650002701970650001501997650001802012650001002030650001702040650002202057650001102079650002102090650000702111650001102118650001602129650001902145650002402164650001002188650001702198650002602215650001202241650002102253650002102274650002702295650002602322650001002348650001102358650003102369650002002400650001402420650001702434653002302451653002102474700001502495700001602510700001502526700002102541700002502562773011902587852000902706930003302715945002502748946001302773655001202786IND4390439820221121080713.0070416e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439043982DNAL7 a174309162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL100 0aQ5011 aÁlvarez, S.10aAlternatives for Improving Physical, Chemical, and Sensory Characteristics of Goat Cheeses: The Use of Arid-Land Forages in the Diet  ap. 2181-2188.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo establish the effect of an alternative diet on the quality of Majorero cheese, the basic physicochemical parameters, fatty acid profile, and sensory characteristics were studied. Two groups of 20 Majorero goats were fed 2 different diets: a forage diet (DF), which had a high ratio of long fiber to concentrates (65:35), and a concentrate diet (DC), with a low ratio of long fiber to concentrates (35:65). The DF dietary fiber was supplied by native forages adapted to arid land. A total of 42 Majorero goat cheeses were used for this study: 21 in the DF group and 21 in the DC group. Seven cheeses from each group were tested after 2, 15, and 60 d of ripening. The milk produced by goats fed the DF diet had a higher fat concentration. No significant differences were observed in the milk fatty acid profile. The diet affected the chemical composition of the cheese in pH and fat content, and fat was significantly higher in cheeses made from DF milk than those from DC milk. Dietary characteristics had important effects on the medium-chain fatty acid composition (C₆ to C₁₄) of the cheese fat, giving DF cheeses the specific goat's milk flavor that is sought after for this type of cheese. The fatty acid composition (%) differed substantially among different ripening times. The DF cheeses were more appreciated by the panelists, as they had a greater variety of odors and flavors than the DC cheeses. The DF hard cheeses were described as having vegetable and fruity tones as well as tones of hay and dried fruit. 3aphysical properties 3amedium chain fatty acids 3adietary fiber 3afatty acid composition 3aarid lands 3adairy animals 3agoats 3afood quality 3afeed concentrates 3aforage 3aplant adaptation 3apH 3aflavor 3agoat cheese 3aanimal feeding 3amilk fat percentage 3aodors 3afeed rations 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCheesexanalysis 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Fatsxanalysis 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aGoats 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMilkxchemistry 2aSensation 2aTime Factors 0asensory properties 0afood composition1 aFresno, M.1 aMéndez, P.1 aCastro, N.1 aFernández, J.R.1 aSampelayo, M.R.

  1 aRowe, Sylvia10aFunding food science and nutrition research: financial conflicts and scientific integrity  ap. 1285-1291.  a2019-12-04  aThere has been significant public debate about the susceptibility of research to biases of various kinds. The dialogue has extended to the peer-reviewed literature, scientific conferences, the mass media, government advisory bodies, and beyond. Whereas biases can come from myriad sources, the overwhelming focus of the discussion to date has been on industry-funded science. Given the critical role that industry has played and will continue to play in the research process, the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) North America Working Group on Guiding Principles has, in this article, proposed conflict-of-interest guidelines regarding industry funding to protect the integrity and credibility of the scientific record, particularly with respect to health, nutrition, and food-safety science. Eight principles are enumerated, which specify the ground rules for industry-sponsored research. This article, which issues a challenge to the broader scientific community to address all bias issues, is only a first step; the document is intended to be dynamic, prompting ongoing discussion and refinement. In the conduct of public/private research relationships, all relevant parties shall 1) conduct or sponsor research that is factual, transparent, and designed objectively, and, according to accepted principles of scientific inquiry, the research design will generate an appropriately phrased hypothesis and the research will answer the appropriate questions, rather than favor a particular outcome; 2) require control of both study design and research itself to remain with scientific investigators; 3) not offer or accept remuneration geared to the outcome of a research project; 4) ensure, before the commencement of studies, that there is a written agreement that the investigative team has the freedom and obligation to attempt to publish the findings within some specified time frame; 5) require, in publications and conference presentations, full signed disclosure of all financial interests; 6) not participate in undisclosed paid authorship arrangements in industry-sponsored publications or presentations; 7) guarantee accessibility to all data and control of statistical analysis by investigators and appropriate auditors/reviewers; 8) require that academic researchers, when they work in contract research organizations (CRO) or act as contract researchers, make clear statements of their affiliation; and require that such researchers publish only under the auspices of the CRO. 3aresearchers 3adata analysis 3afood science 3ahuman nutrition 3ascientists 3anutrition research 3aresearch support 0aliterature reviews 0ascientific integrity 0acontract research organizations 0afinancial conflicts 0afinance1 aAlexander, Nick1 aClydesdale, F.

The study consisted of four experimental periods with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments to test the effects of dietary fat (saturated vs. unsaturated) and rumen fermentation (high fiber diets vs. low fiber diets) on milk fat depression. Dietary fiber concentration and type of fat had significant effects on milk fat. Effects were most pronounced when unsaturated fat was added to the low fiber diet. When the low fiber diet plus unsaturated fat was fed, milk fat percentage and yield were decreased by 30 and 35%, respectively, compared with the percentage and yield when the high fiber diet plus saturated fat was fed. Alterations in rumen fermentation caused by differences in dietary fiber concentrations had little effect on the amount of trans-octadecenoic acids in milk fat, and the total amount did not correlate with changes in milk fat percentage. Further examination of the isomeric profile of trans-octadecenoic acid revealed substantial differences among the dietary treatments. Although the addition of unsaturated fat resulted in marked increases in the milk fat content of trans-11-octadecenoic acid, regardless of dietary fiber concentration, the low fiber diet plus unsaturated fat increased the content of trans-10-octadecenoic acid. This combination was also associated with a significant decrease in milk fat content and yield. When the low fiber diets were fed, circulating insulin concentrations were elevated, regardless of the type of fat supplement. However, marked milk fat depression occurred only when the low fiber diet was supplemented with unsaturated fat. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3avolatile fatty acids 3adietary fat 3afiber content 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3amilk fat percentage 3amilk fat yield 3arumen fluids 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDiet 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aInsulinxblood 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMilkxmetabolism 2aOleic Acidsxmetabolism 2aRumenxmetabolism 0adiet 0amilk yield1 aDwyer, D.A.1 aMcGuire, M.A.1 aBauman, D.E.1 aPalmquist, D.L.1 aNurmela, K.V.V.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 May, v. 81, no. 5 p.1251-1261x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03125naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012400127300001800251500013200269500002400401520173400425650001902159650001802178650002202196650002002218650001302238650002102251650000702272650001502279650001602294650001902310650002302329650001502352650002002367650002702387650001202414650001102426700001402437700001702451773012502468852000902593856008902602655001202691IND4474662220221121062342.0131206s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447466222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaiputta, J.10aMicrobial reduction and quality of fresh-cut 'phulae' pineapple (Ananas comosus) treated with acidic electrolyzed water  ap. 1049-1055.  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Postharvest Symposium, held June 25, 2012 - June 29, 2012, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  aIncludes references  aElectrolyzed water (EW) is a promising alternative as a novel sanitizer and disinfectant due to its broad spectrum of microbial decontamination and environmentally friendly technology. In this study, the effects of acidic electrolyzed water (AEW) on microbial reduction and the quality of fresh-cut ‘Phulae’ pineapple (Ananas comosus) were investigated. Fresh-cut ‘Phulae’ pineapple was treated in AEW (66 mg/L, pH 2.36) for 1 and 2 min followed by washing with distilled water or 2% NaCl for 1 min. Sample treated in distilled water (DW) for 2 min followed by 2% NaCl for 1 min was used as a control. Washed sample was then packed into polypropylene bag and sealed. Total plate count (TPC), coliform, yeast and mold and the quality in terms of firmness, vitamin C content and sensory evaluation were determined during 14 days storage at 5°C, 95% RH. TPC was found in all treatments from 8 days storage while coliform and yeast and mold were not detected during the end of experiment. Fresh-cut sample treated in AEW for 2 min followed by 2% NaCl for 1 min obtained the lowest TPC of 6.79 log CFU/g at 14 days storage. In addition, firmness and vitamin C content in all treatments were significantly decreased during storage. Treated sample in AEW for 2 min followed by 2% NaCl for 1 min had the highest firmness of 9.11 N and vitamin C content of 7.40 mg/100 g fresh weight at 14 days storage. However, the acceptable storage life of fresh-cut ‘Phulae’ pineapple was only 10 days, limited by the overall acceptance score from the sensory evaluation. Therefore, the application of AEW could minimize the microbial growth and maintain the quality of fresh-cut ‘Phulae’ pineapple during storage at 5±1°C, 95% RH. 3aAnanas comosus 3aascorbic acid 3acoliform bacteria 3adecontamination 3afirmness 3amicrobial growth 3apH 3apineapples 3aplate count 3apolypropylenes 3asensory evaluation 3ashelf life 3asodium chloride 3asustainable technology 3awashing 3ayeasts1 aSetha, S.1 aSuthiluk, P.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Nov., , no. 1012 p.1049-1055dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1012/1012_142.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02484naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245009500168300001600263520107400279650001701353650001601370650002101386650001601407650001901423650001901442650002001461650001601481650001601497650001401513650001801527650001901545650001401564650001601578650001301594651001001607700002401617700002701641700001801668700002101686700002001707700001901727773010601746852000901852856008501861930003301946946001101979655001201990IND4427185820221121062246.0091012e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442718582DNAL7 a10.1007/s10532-009-9267-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolina, M.

The consortium C2PL05 was highly efficient degrading completely naphthalene, phenanthrene and anthracene in around 18 days of cultivation. The toxicity (Microtox™ method) generated by the PAH and by the intermediate metabolites was reduced to levels close to non-toxic in almost 40 days of cultivation. The identified bacteria from the contaminated soil belonged to γ-proteobacteria and could be include in Enterobacter and Pseudomonas genus. DGGE analysis revealed uncultured Stenotrophomonas ribotypes as a possible PAH degrader in the microbial consortium. The present work shows the potential use of these microorganisms and the total consortium for the bioremediation of PAH polluted areas since the biodegradation of these chemicals takes place along with a significant decrease in toxicity. 3aEnterobacter 3aPseudomonas 3aStenotrophomonas 3aanthracenes 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3agenetic testing 3ametabolites 3anaphthalene 3apetroleum 3aphenanthrenes 3apolluted soils 3aribotypes 3asandy soils 3atoxicity 3aSpain1 aGonzález, Natalia.1 aBautista, L.

  1 aCartier, Amélie10aSex differences in inflammatory markers: what is the contribution of visceral adiposity?  ap. 1307-1314.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations have been found to be higher in premenopausal women than in men, whereas interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) concentrations have been reported to be lower in women than in men. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether the sex difference in body fat distribution accounts for the observed sex differences in inflammatory markers. DESIGN: Plasma CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α concentrations were measured in 208 healthy men (age: 42.2 ± 15.2 y) and in 145 healthy women (age: 36.8 ± 11.1 y). RESULTS: Compared with men, premenopausal women had higher CRP concentrations [1.24 (25th percentile: 0.54; 75th percentile: 3.04) compared with 0.94 (0.51, 2.40) mg/L; P < 0.05] and lower plasma TNF-α concentrations [1.50 (25th percentile: 1.23; 75th percentile: 1.82) compared with 1.71 (1.40, 2.05) pg/mL; P < 0.001]. No sex difference in IL-6 concentrations was noted. Regression analyses indicated that the relation between CRP or IL-6 and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous AT (SAT) was sex-specific; a significantly steeper slope was observed in women than in men (P < 0.05). Sex differences in CRP concentrations were abolished after SAT was adjusted for. In a multivariate model of the whole sample, we found that both SAT and VAT and the sex x SAT interaction term were significant correlates of CRP and IL-6 concentrations. Finally, whereas CRP concentrations were largely influenced by visceral adiposity in men, subcutaneous adiposity was the key correlate of CRP in women. CONCLUSION: The higher CRP concentrations found in women appear to be due to their greater accumulation of subcutaneous fat than that observed in men. 3avisceral fat 3aC-reactive protein 3amen 3awomen 3abiomarkers 3aadipose tissue 3ainflammation 3agender differences 3ablood plasma 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3ahuman nutrition 2aAdipose Tissuexanatomy & histologyxradiography. 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aC-Reactive Proteinxmetabolism 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxepidemiology 2aDeveloped Countriesxstatistics & numerical data 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInflammationxdiagnosis 2aInterleukin-6xblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aPremenopause 2aRegression Analysis 2aSex Characteristics 2aTomography, X-Ray Computed 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxblood 2aUrban Populationxstatistics & numerical data 2aVisceraxradiography. 2aYoung Adult 0aQuebec 0ablood chemistry1 aCôté, Mélanie1 aLemieux, Isabelle1 aPérusse, Louis1 aTremblay, Angelo1 aBouchard, Claude1 aDesprés, Jean-Pierre.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 May, v. 89, no. 5 p.1307-1314dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.270303Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/02  aOther US 7aarticle02794naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245014100206300001600347520125700363650002101620650001201641650001901653650001201672650001401684650001701698650003001715650000901745650002601754650001101780650001501791650000901806650002501815650001601840700001901856700002001875700002101895700002001916700002101936700002401957700002701981700002402008773010602032852000902138856008502147930003302232946001102265655001202276IND4427185320221121052415.0091012e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442718532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10532-009-9261-32doi7 aPMC28471562pmcid7 a193814512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenndorf, Dirk 10aImproving protein extraction and separation methods for investigating the metaproteome of anaerobic benzene communities within sediments  ap. 737-750.  aBTEX compounds such as benzene are frequent soil and groundwater contaminants that are easily biodegraded under oxic conditions by bacteria. In contrast, benzene is rather recalcitrant under anaerobic conditions. The analysis of anoxic degradation is often hampered by difficult sampling conditions, limited amounts of biomass and interference of matrix compounds with proteomic approaches. In order to improve the procedure for protein extraction we established a scheme consisting of the following steps: dissociation of cells from lava granules, cell lysis by ultrasonication and purification of proteins by phenol extraction. The 2D-gels revealed a resolution of about 240 proteins spots and the spot patterns showed strong matrix dependence, but still differences were detectable between the metaproteomes obtained after growth on benzene and benzoate. Using direct data base search as well as de novo sequencing approaches we were able to identify several proteins. An enoyl-CoA hydratase with cross species homology to Azoarcus evansii, is known to be involved in the anoxic degradation of xenobiotics. Thereby the identification confirmed that this procedure has the capacity to analyse the metaproteome of an anoxic living microbial community. 3aAzoarcus evansii 3abenzene 3abiodegradation 3abiomass 3adatabases 3adissociation 3agroundwater contamination 3alava 3amicrobial communities 3aphenol 3aproteomics 3asoil 3aultrasonic treatment 3axenobiotics1 aVogt, Carsten 1 aJehmlich, Nico 1 aSchmidt, Yvonne 1 aThomas, Henrik 1 aWoffendin, Gary 1 aShevchenko, Andrej 1 aRichnow, Hans-Hermann 1 avon Bergen, Martin 0 tBiodegradation.g2009 Nov., v. 20, no. 6 p.737-750dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0923-98207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10532-009-9261-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20091012b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02378naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001900172245011000191300001400301500002400315500001500339520078400354650002601138650001501164650001501179650002301194650002101217650001801238650001601256650002601272650002101298650002701319650001801346650002701364650001801391650002301409651001101432653001601443700002901459700002201488700002001510700002201530773012101552852000901673856008501682930003301767945002501800946001101825655001201836IND4390407120221121041849.0070416e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439040712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-007-9216-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF110 0aP0001 aSteiner, Neusa10aPolyamine effects on growth and endogenous hormones levels in Araucaria angustifolia embryogenic cultures  ap. 55-62.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the present work was to determine the effects of exogenous polyamines (PAs) supplemented into a BM medium free of plant growth regulators (PGR), on the endogenous PAs, IAA and ABA contents and growth of A. angustifolia embryogenic cultures. The addition of PAs to the PGR-free BM medium, enhanced the growth of embryogenic cultures. PAs endogenous metabolism was significantly affected by exogenous PAs. PAs supplemented to a PGR-free BM medium, mainly Put and Spm, increased the endogenous IAA and ABA levels, showing a direct relationship -between PAs levels and ABA accumulation. These results direct new strategies to further improve A. angustifolia somatic embryogenesis, especially during the maturation phase, by culture medium manipulation using exogenous PAs. 3ain vitro regeneration 3apolyamines 3ametabolism 3aendangered species 3ain vitro culture 3adose response 3acell growth 3asomatic embryogenesis 3amicropropagation 3aAraucaria angustifolia 3aabscisic acid 3agermplasm conservation 3aculture media 3aindole acetic acid 3aBrazil 0amethodology1 aSanta-Catarina, Claudete1 aSilveira, Vanildo1 aFloh, Eny I.

A trained descriptive panel evaluated 27 commercial butters using a defined sensory language. Two focus groups were conducted with butter consumers to gain an understanding of consumer use and consumption habits. Six representative butters and 2 vegetable oil spreads were selected for consumer acceptance testing. Both internal and external preference mapping techniques were applied to interpret consumer data. Key discriminating sensory characteristics of butters included color intensity; diacetyl, cooked, grassy, and milk fat flavors; and salty taste. From focus groups and quantitative consumer testing, the key butter features were a desirable flavor and a natural image. Negative aspects included price and cholesterol. Five consumer clusters with distinct butter and spread flavor likes and dislikes were identified. Butter is a desirable product to consumers. Sensory expectations of butter vary among consumers, and butters with specific sensory characteristics could be marketed to specific target market segments. 3abutter 3asensory evaluation 3afood quality 3acholesterol 3aconsumer preferences 3aflavor 3acolor 3aflavor compounds 3afood consumption 3afood prices 2aAge Factors 2aButterxanalysis 2aConsumer Behavior 2aFocus Groups 2aHumans 2aLeast-Squares Analysis 2aMargarinexanalysis 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aSensation 2aSex Factors 2aTaste 0asensory properties 0avegetable oil spreads 0aconsumers 0aspreads1 aLopetcharat, K.1 aDrake, M.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 May, v. 90, no. 5 p.2091-2102dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20070719b20070802c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/06/11  aOther US 7aarticle02894naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001700163245011700180300001400297500002400311520134000335650001401675650002101689650001701710650001701727650001501744650002001759650001001779650002201789650002001811650002201831650002501853650002901878650002101907653002101928653002801949700001501977700002101992700001702013700001602030700001802046700001602064773012102080852000902201856008502210930003302295945002502328946001102353655001202364IND4390407520221121041834.0070416e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439040752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-007-9211-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aCheng, Liqin10aCharacterization of Anthocyanidin Synthase (ANS) Gene and anthocyanidin in rare medicinal plant-Saussurea medusa  ap. 63-73.  aIncludes references  aAnthocyanidin synthase (ANS, leucoanthocyanidin oxygenase), a 2-oxoglutarate iron-dependent oxygenase, catalyzes the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of the anthocyanin class of flavonoids, from the colorless leucoanthocyanidins to the colored anthocyanidins. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of an anthocyanidin Synthase gene (SmANS1) from a cDNA library derived from a red callus line of Saussurea medusa, a traditional Chinese medicinal plant. SmANS1 exhibits significant similarities in amino acid sequence with members of a family of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases. The deduced SmANS1 protein shared 83% and 79% identity with that of Callistephus chinensis and Gerbera hybrids, respectively. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses of SmANS1 transcripts showed that the SmANS1 was abundantly expressed in the cell cultures of red cell line and seedlings, and weakly expressed in the counterparts of yellow cell line, but was not expressed in the roots. Further more, the anthocyanins composition of cell cultures from Saussurea medusa was investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS). Major anthocyanins were identified as 3-O-glucosides cyanidin derivatives and minor peaks were identified as pelargonidin derivatives. 3aSaussurea 3amedicinal plants 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3aoxygenases 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3amolecular cloning 3aamino acid sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3ain vitro culture 0aSaussurea medusa 0amolecular sequence data1 aXu, Yanjun1 aGrotewold, Erich1 aJin, Zhiping1 aWu, Fengyan1 aFu, Chunxiang1 aZhao, Dexiu0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2007 Apr., v. 89, no. 1 p.63-73dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-007-9211-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070728b20070802c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/07/28  aNon-US 7aarticle04182naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179100002200196245016300218300001800381500001500399520177300414650001602187650002302203650002302226650001002249650001302259650001002272650002302282650002602305650000902331650001702340650001102357650002502368650002702393650002102420650002302441650001502464650001002479650004202489650003502531650001002566650002102576650001102597650002102608650001102629650001102640650003902651650001602690650000902706650001602715650002202731650001502753650001602768651001802784651003302802653006302835653002002898700002002918700002702938700001902965700002102984700001903005700001903024700003203043773013803075852000903213856008303222930003303305945002503338946001303363655001203376IND4419557220221121041905.0090424e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441955722DNAL7 a193572182pmid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.271512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCogswell, Mary E.10aAssessment of iron deficiency in US preschool children and nonpregnant females of childbearing age: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006  ap. 1334-1342.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: A new index to determine body iron promises a simpler approach to monitoring iron deficiency (ID) prevalence. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare ID defined as body iron <0 mg/kg and calculated from the log ratio of transferrin receptor to ferritin (the body iron model) to ID defined as greater-than-or-equal2 of 3 abnormal concentrations in ferritin, transferrin saturation, or erythrocyte protoporphyrin (the ferritin model). DESIGN: We used measures of iron status and inflammation from 486 children aged 1-2 y, 848 children aged 3-5 y, and 3742 nonpregnant females aged 12-49 y from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006. RESULTS: ID prevalences (±SE) based on the body iron model in children (1-2 and 3-5 y) and in females (12-19 and 20-49 y) were 14.4 ± 1.9%, 3.7 ± 0.8%, 9.3 ± 1.0%, and 9.2 ± 1.6%, respectively. ID prevalences based on the ferritin model in children (3-5 y) and females (12-19 and 20-49 y) were 4.5 ± 0.9%, 15.6 ± 1.2%, and 15.7 ± 0.8%, respectively. The κ statistics for agreement between the 2 models were 0.5-0.7. Among females (12-49 y) the positive predictive values of ID based on the body iron model and the ferritin model for identifying anemia were 43 ± 3% and 30 ± 2%, respectively, whereas negative predictive values did not differ. C-reactive protein was elevated in 28.8 ± 3.1% of females with ID by the ferritin model but not by the body iron model and in 0% of persons with ID by the body iron model but not by the ferritin model. CONCLUSIONS: The agreement between the 2 indexes was fair to good. Among females, the body iron model produced lower estimates of ID prevalence, better predicted anemia, and appeared to be less affected by inflammation than the ferritin model. 3atransferrin 3anutritional status 3aC-reactive protein 3agirls 3aferritin 3awomen 3adisease prevention 3anutrient deficiencies 3airon 3ainflammation 3amodels 3anutrition assessment 3airon deficiency anemia 3adietary minerals 3apreschool children 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAnemia, Iron-Deficiencyxepidemiology 2aC-Reactive Proteinxmetabolism 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aFemale 2aFerritinsxblood 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInflammationxbloodxepidemiology. 2aIronxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Surveys 2aPrevalence 2aYoung Adult 3aUnited States 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology. 0aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006 0ahuman nutrition1 aLooker, Anne C.1 aPfeiffer, Christine M.1 aCook, James D.1 aLacher, David A.1 aBeard, John L.1 aLynch, Sean R.1 aGrummer-Strawn, Laurence M.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 May, v. 89, no. 5 p.1334-1342dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.271513Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/02  aOther US 7aarticle03429naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245012800145300001800273520140600291650000901697650002001706650001601726650001001742650003001752650002501782650003101807650002801838650001101866650002101877650002001898650002001918650002301938650001001961650001201971650005101983650002002034650005402054650002402108650003602132650001102168650001702179650002802196650001102224650003102235650000902266650002302275650004302298650003002341650001502371650004802386650001802434650003302452653001602485700001202501700001802513700001902531700001502550700001502565773008302580852000902663930003302672945001302705946001302718655001202731IND2196092520221121041809.0981219e199805  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219609252DNAL7 a96212242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomond, M.B.10aCell-free whey from milk fermented with Bifidobacterium breve C50 used to modify the colonic microflora of healthy subjects  ap. 1229-1235.  aThe ingestion of viable bacteria is thought to be required to modify intestinal microflora. In the present study, the effects on fecal flora of consumption of cell-free concentrated whey from milk that had been fermented with Bifidobacterium breve C50 was tested using 10 healthy human volunteers. Results were compared with effects of a commercial milk formula that had been fermented with Streptococcus thermophilus and B. breve C50 and given to 10 control subjects. Nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase activities were assessed as risk indexes for colon carcinogenesis, and beta-galactosidase was measured as an indicator of the fermentation capacity of the colonic flora. Fecal excretion of Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and clostridial spores decreased after 7 d of consumption of either preparation; however, counts of bifidobacteria only increased after intake of B. breve whey. Fecal pH was reduced from 7.1 +/- 0.2 to 6.6 +/- 0.3 after intake of whey that had been fermented with Bif. breve. Fecal nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase significantly decreased, and beta-galactosidase activity increased, after consumption of either preparation. The results indicate that ingestion of viable bifidobacteria was not required to modify intestinal flora of humans. Repression of B. fragilis and clostridia seems to be independent of colonic bifidobacterial overgrowth in humans. 3awhey 3aBifidobacterium 3aplate count 3acolon 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aBacteroides fragilis 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3aClostridium perfringens 3ahumans 3abacterial spores 3aoxidoreductases 3aenzyme activity 3abeta-glucuronidase 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aBacteroides fragilisxisolation & purification 2aBifidobacterium 2aClostridium perfringensxisolation & purification 2aColonxmicrobiology 2aFecesxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aGlucuronidasexanalysis 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMale 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aMilk Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aNitroreductasesxanalysis 2aProbiotics 2aSpores, Bacterialxisolation & purification 2aStreptococcus 2abeta-Galactosidasexanalysis 0ahuman feces1 aAis, A.1 aGuillemot, F.1 aBounouader, R.1 aCortot, A.1 aRomond, C.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 May, v. 81, no. 5 p.1229-1235x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02627naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100003100172245007000203300001400273500002400287500001500311520105500326650001701381650002101398650001801419650001801437650001401455650002001469650002601489650002401515650001001539650002101549650002601570650001801596650002301614650002001637651001101657653001601668700002701684700003001711700002601741700003401767773012101801852000901922856008501931930003302016945002502049946001102074655001202085IND4390407820140723000000.0070416e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439040782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-007-9210-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK001 0aF1101 aMotoike, Sergio Yoshimitsu10aSomatic embryogenesis of Myrciaria aureana (Brazilian grape tree)  ap. 75-81.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this research was to establish a long-term somatic embryogenic cultures that could be used for cryopreservation. For the induction of somatic embryogenesis, different levels of 2,4-D as well as the combination of 2,4-D and indole-3-acetyl-l-aspartic acid (IASP) were tested on cotyledons of zygotic embryos. The somatic embryogenic cultures were established and maintained up to 2 years through frequent subculturing on a medium containing 2,4D + IASP. Light, activated charcoal, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were tested for the regeneration and maturation of somatic embryos, and the mature embryos were germinated in JADS medium. The combination of light and PEG provided the highest number of mature embryos. The somatic embryos obtained were smaller than zygotic embryos and lacked starch. There was an interaction between 2,4-D and IASP on the induction and regeneration of somatic embryo in Myrciaria aureana. The combination of light and PEG increased the number of mature embryos; however, charcoal was detrimental to the process. 3aforest trees 3ain vitro culture 3aaspartic acid 3adose response 3aMyrciaria 3alight intensity 3asomatic embryogenesis 3apolyethylene glycol 3a2,4-D 3amicropropagation 3ain vitro regeneration 3aculture media 3aindole acetic acid 3asomatic embryos 3aBrazil 0amethodology1 aSaraiva, Edson Santana1 aVentrella, Marilia Contin1 aSilva, Crislene Viana1 aSalomão, Luiz Carlos Chamhum0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2007 Apr., v. 89, no. 1 p.75-81dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-007-9210-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070730b20070802c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/07/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03714naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179072001700196100001900213245008600232300001800318520177700336650000802113650001202121650002002133650001502153650001102168650001202179650002302191650001202214650002202226650002202248650001302270650001002283650000902293650002202302650002502324650002302349650002802372650002702400650001102427650001802438650001902456650001102475650002302486650001902509650000902528650001602537650002502553650002202578650001402600650002402614653001202638700002302650700001802673700002402691773013802715852000902853856008302862930003302945945002502978946001303003655001203016IND4419558120221121020747.0090424e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441955812DNAL7 a193393942pmid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.270762doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSerra-Prat, M.10aEffect of age and frailty on ghrelin and cholecystokinin responses to a meal test  ap. 1410-1417.  aBACKGROUND: Ghrelin and cholecystokinin (CCK) are among the peripheral signals that regulate hunger and satiety. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess whether ghrelin and CCK responses to a standard nutritional load are related to age and frailty. DESIGN: Ghrelin, CCK, insulin, glucose, and 4-h visual analog hunger scale curves after a standard nutritional load test (380 kcal) were described and compared between 3 groups: old (>75 y) and frail persons (group A), old (>75 y) but nonfrail persons (group B), and young (25-65 y) adults (group C). RESULTS: Frail persons showed no postprandial ghrelin suppression, and old subjects, frail and nonfrail, showed no significant postprandial ghrelin recovery compared with young adults. Frailty was also associated with lower fasting ghrelin concentrations. No differences in fasting CCK were observed between young and old persons; however, postprandial CCK concentrations were enhanced in young persons, whereas no frailty effect on the CCK curve was observed in the old subjects. No correlations between mean ghrelin and hunger values over time were found, but strong negative correlations were shown between CCK and hunger (group A: rs = -0.88, P = 0.009; group B: rs = -0.86, P = 0.014; group C: rs = -0.71, P = 0.071) and insulin and hunger (group A: rs = -0.901, P = 0.006; group B: rs = -0.964, P < 0.001; group C: rs = -0.929, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age determines a poorer ghrelin postprandial recuperation phase, a reduced CCK postprandial response, and an exaggerated postprandial insulin release. A loss of ghrelin prandial rhythm is present in old frail persons. The impaired response of these hunger regulatory hormones with age might contribute to the mechanisms of anorexia associated with aging. 3aage 3aghrelin 3acholecystokinin 3atest meals 3ahunger 3asatiety 3apostprandial state 3aelderly 3aelderly nutrition 3ainsulin secretion 3aanorexia 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAppetitexphysiology 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aCholecystokininxblood 2aFemale 2aFrail Elderly 2aGhrelinxblood 2aHumans 2aHungerxphysiology 2aInsulinxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Assessment 2aPatient Selection 2aSatiation 2aWalkingxphysiology 0afrailty1 aPalomera, Elisabet1 aClavé, Pere.1 aPuig-Domingo, Manel0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 May, v. 89, no. 5 p.1410-1417dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.270763Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/02  aOther US 7aarticle01911naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245014100179300001600320520038600336650001500722650002700737650002300764650002400787650001500811650005800826650006200884650003100946650001400977650002500991650005301016653004301069653002601112653002901138700001701167700001601184700002001200700001601220773009501236852000901331856006901340930003301409946001101442655001201453IND4390182720221121020722.0070408e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439018272DNAL7 a170314802pmid7 a10.1007/s00726-006-0402-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotha, S. 10aSynthesis of bis-armed amino acid derivatives via the alkylation of ethyl isocyanoacetate and the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction  ap. 387-394.  aTwo synthetic routes to bis-armed-α-amino acid derivatives are described.

In order to commercialize fruit with crisp texture, ‘Rojo Brillante’ persimmons are routinely subjected to deastringency treatments with high concentrations of CO2 which leads to tannins insolubilization and loss of astringency. External flesh browning is one of the major disorders that limit the marketing of ‘Rojo Brillante’ persimmon. This alteration is mainly caused by the mechanical impacts received by the fruit throughout the packing process. The aim of this work was to study the influence of astringency level of the fruit in the manifestation of flesh browning in persimmon fruit. Fruit with four different levels of astringency were subjected to packing line operations; control fruit was manually packed to avoid mechanical damage. Only the fruit subjected to packing displayed flesh browning, which confirmed that mechanical damage is the trigger of browning disorder. A clear relation among astringency and browning incidence was observed; the lower the level of astringency at the moment of fruit mechanically impacted throughout the packing line the higher the incidence of browning disorder during the commercialization period. 3aastringency 3acarbon dioxide 3acommercialization 3amarketing 3amechanical damage 3apersimmons 3atannins 3atexture1 aGil, R.1 aSalvador, A.1 aBesada, C.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Nov., , no. 1012 p.1097-1102dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1012/1012_148.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03335naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024004100117040001800158100002400176245011300200300001300313500018500326520151800511650002402029650002302053650001102076650001502087650002102102650001602123650001302139650001102152650001602163650002302179650001902202650001702221650001702238650003002255650002102285650001902306650001502325650001302340650000902353650002202362650001602384650001302400650001502413651001502428700003102443773014202474856005402616856011402670852000902784655001202793IND60709154420201204000000.0200903e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070915442DNAL7 a10113/70915442hdl7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2020.1267.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRafalimanana, H.

Trapping surveillance to determine the spatial and temporal abundance of the population with respect to climatic factors (temperature, relative humidity and rainfall) was conducted in the citrus orchards at Ambohijafy - Antananarivo between May 2013 and November 2013. The traps used as baits are a sexual lure (methyl eugenol and Trimedlure) and food attractant trap (Biolure) all associated with an insecticide. The results show that the population of Bactrocera invadens (Diptera: Tephritidae), an invasive species recently introduced, stays generally low compared to the native Ceratitis malgassa (Diptera: Tephritidae), during the entire monitoring period. Interspecific competition between these species and the seasonal availability of host plants within the orchard would be the main cause. Increasing temperatures correlated with a decrease in humidity are favorable for fruit flies during availability and fruiting period of the host plants, from May until August. However, when hosts seem scarce, a significant decrease appears in the number of fruit flies captured reaching a minimum during the driest and hottest weeks of the study, during October and November, due to their migration to find more favorable conditions. This work contributes to the forecasting methods' improvement of fruits flies attacks of Ambohijafy's orchards, but monitoring on the long-term is still necessary to have an effective fruit flies management in Madagascar. 3aBactrocera invadens 3aCeratitis malgassa 3aCitrus 3abait traps 3aclimatic factors 3afruit flies 3afruiting 3afruits 3ahost plants 3aindigenous species 3ainsect control 3ainsect traps 3ainsecticides 3ainterspecific competition 3ainvasive species 3amethyl eugenol 3amonitoring 3aorchards 3arain 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3atrapping 3atrimedlure 3aMadagascar1 aRandriatsaramiafara, R.

The presentation on lipids focused mainly on the longer-chain products of the essential fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3), and cognitive development as among the most studied lipids and outcomes, respectively, in early human nutrition. Because there have been several recent reviews on this topic, the present review takes a broader perspective with respect to both early development and lipids: an expanded research agenda is plausible on the basis of observations from some human studies and from animal studies. Other lipids known to be provided in variable amounts to infants through human milk are cholesterol and gangliosides. Short sections address the current state of knowledge and some questions that could be pursued.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adietary fat 3acardiovascular diseases 3aessential fatty acids 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3acholesterol 3abreast milk 3ainfant nutrition 3afat intake 3ainfants 3apostnatal development 3aprotective effect 0aliterature reviews 0alipids0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 May, v. 89, no. 5 p.1523S-1529SdAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27113G3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/02  aOther US 7aarticle01539naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100001700128245009600145300001600241500002400257500002300281520028800304650002100592650001800613650001100631650002000642650002100662650001100683650001500694650001000709650001600719653002300735653002100758700001400779700001500793773012800808852000900936856009100945930003301036945002501069946001101094655001201105IND4390381920221120224914.0070416e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439038192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aLeeson, A.S.10aRole of serine in maintaining blood glucose levels of broilers fed all-vegetable diets (R3)  ap. 379-381.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aSupplementing an all-vegetable diet with milk-powder, casein or serine resulted in increased blood glucose.

Five half-sib families from the previous study and 7 new ones were genotyped for nine microsatellite markers spanning chromosome 4. AM1 was mapped between the microsatellite markers BMS648 and BR6303. In a granddaughter design, interval mapping based on multiple-marker regression was utilized for an analysis of five milk production traits: milk yield, fat percentage and yield, and protein percentage and yield. In the families reported on previously, significant effects for fat and protein percentages were detected. In the new families, an effect on milk and fat yields was found. The most likely positions of the quantitative trait locus in both groups of families were in the same area of chromosome 4 in the vicinity of the obese locus. Direct effects of the obese locus were tested for using polymorphism in two closely linked microsatellites located 2.5 and 3.6 top downstream of the coding sequence. No firm evidence was found for an association between the obese locus and the tested traits. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aalpha-amylase 3aloci 3ahaplotypes 3alinkage (genetics) 3adairy cattle 3achromosome mapping 3aSwedish Red-and-White 3amilk fat percentage 3amilk fat yield 3amilk protein percentage 3aquantitative traits 2aAmylasesxbloodxgenetics. 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgenetics 2aChromosome Mapping 2aFemale 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenotype 2aLactationxgenetics 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aMilkxchemistry 2aObesityxgenetics 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 0aobese locus 0amilk yield 0agene location1 aAndersson-Eklund, L.1 aKoning, D.J. de.1 aLunden, A.1 aMaki-Tanila, A.1 aAndersson, L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 May, v. 81, no. 5 p.1454-1461x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01970naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148072001700165100001700182245005100199300001400250500001500264520058100279650001400860650002200874650000800896650001800904650002100922650001000943650002300953650001200976650002900988650001401017650002201031650002801053650001601081651001101097653002001108700001901128700002201147700002401169773008001193852000901273856008801282930003301370945002501403946001301428990002301441655001201464IND4419761820221120224833.0090430e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441976182DNAL7 a10.1097/TIN.0b013e3181989b442doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

An interdisciplinary team of faculty created a nonresidential learning community (LC) for students with upper-class standing (nutrition, nursing, social work, and child and family studies). The LC included academic, social, cultural, interprofessional, and service-learning experiences. The LC discussions focused on cultural awareness/competence, policy advocacy, and global health and disparity issues. The service-learning experiences successfully challenged the students' interprofessional competencies and contributed to the goal of creating community partnerships. The development, implementation, and sustainability of an interprofessional LC are contingent upon a variety of administrative, cultural, and academic factors. 3anurses 3adietetic education 3aobjectives 3alearning 3anutrition 3adietitians 3aprofessional education 0alearning community 0ahealth care workers 0aservice learning1 aBrann, Lynn1 aErdman, Maria1 aMiddlemiss, Mary Ann1 aRaj, Sudha0 tTopics in clinical nutrition.g2009 , v. 24, no. 1 p.6-15x0883-56917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TIN.0b013e3181977fae3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090519b20090608c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/05/19  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03678naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100002300128245011800151300001600269500002400285500002300309500001500332520195000347650001302297650002202310650002102332650002702353650002402380650001502404650001002419650002002429650003102449650002502480650001602505650002302521650002002544650001002564650001102574650002002585650001602605653002902621653001702650653001902667653001002686700002402696700002402720700002602744700002102770773012802791852000902919856009102928930003303019945002503052946001103077655001203088IND4390381020221120224901.0070416e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439038102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL822 0aL2001 aMunoz-Guzman, M.A.10aCorrelation of parasitological and immunological parameters in sheep with high and low resistance to haemonchosis  ap. 363-371.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-06  aParasitological and immunological parameters of Blackbelly (Bb), a haemonchosis high-resistance sheep breed, and Columbia (Cb) a haemonchosis low-resistance breed were compared. Two experiments were performed: Bb and Cb lambs were infected weekly with 1000 third-stage larvae (L3) of Haemonchus contortus for 6 wk. In the first experiment, faecal egg counts (FEC) and blood eosinophils (BE) were determined for 15 wk. In the second experiment, the following parameters were measured weekly: FEC, plasma proteins, serum IgG to H. contortus L3 levels by ELISA and L3 antigens recognized by Western blot; animals were euthanized after 15 weeks and autopsies were performed to evaluate the total adult phases (AP), eosinophils and mast cells in the fundic abomasal region (FAR), pyloric abomasal region (PAR) and abomasal lymph node (ALN). Fecal egg counts and AP were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in Cb lambs. BE showed a significant increase (P < 0.05) in both breeds at week 9 and, subsequently, Cb lambs presented a sudden decrease in these levels. The Bb lambs revealed a higher amount (P < 0.05) of antibodies between weeks 9 and 15 of the experiment, and Cb lambs showed a reduction in antibody levels at week 9. The Western blot revealed 11 bands of H. contortus L3 antigens; no differences were observed between breeds. The number of tissue eosinophils per cm2 in PAR and ALN was higher (P < 0.05) in the Bb lambs. No differences were found (P > 0.05) in the number of mast cells per cm2 in the sampled regions of both infected groups. The increase and maintenance of serum antibodies and circulating and local eosinophils in resistant animals agrees with the development and maintenance of a Th2 type immune response. The initial increase and further reduction of serum antibodies and circulating and local eosinophils in the low-resistance lamb breed suggest an initial Th2 type response and a subsequent change to a Th1 type response. 3aabomasum 3abreed differences 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aColumbia (sheep breed) 3anematode infections 3aantibodies 3afeces 3afecal egg count 3aanimal parasitic nematodes 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aeosinophils 3adisease resistance 3aimmune response 3alambs 3alarvae 3apest resistance 3alymph nodes 0aBlackbelly (sheep breed) 0asheep breeds 0ablood proteins 0asheep1 aCuellar-Ordaz, J.A.1 aValdivia-Anda, A.G.1 aBuendia-Jimenez, J.A.1 aAlba-Hurtado, F.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2006 Sept., v. 86, no. 3 p.363-371dAgricultural Institute of Canada.x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/aic-journals/cjas.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070731b20070802c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/06/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03730naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179100002300196245010300219300001800322520158800340650002201928650001201950650002401962650002201986650002002008650001202028650000802040650002202048650002302070650002102093650001702114650002002131650002702151650000902178650003002187650002002217650002402237650003502261650001102296650001902307650005202326650000902378650004702387650004702434650007002481650002202551650001302573650003102586700002702617700002002644700001902664700002102683700001802704700002102722773013802743852000902881856008302890930003302973945002503006946001303031655001203044IND4419558820221120224733.0090424e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441955882DNAL7 a193215672pmid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.266682doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVerhoeven, Suzanne10aLong-term leucine supplementation does not increase muscle mass or strength in healthy elderly men  ap. 1468-1475.  aBACKGROUND: It has been reported that the blunted muscle protein synthetic response to food intake in the elderly can be normalized by increasing the leucine content of a meal. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the effect of 3 mo of leucine supplementation on muscle mass and strength in healthy elderly men. DESIGN: Thirty healthy elderly men with a mean (±SEM) age of 71 ± 4 y and body mass index (BMI; in kg/m²) of 26.1 ± 0.5 were randomly assigned to either a placebo-supplemented (n = 15) or leucine-supplemented (n = 15) group. Leucine or placebo (2.5 g) was administered with each main meal during a 3-mo intervention period. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, muscle strength (one-repetition maximum), muscle mass (measured by computed tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), myosin heavy chain isoform distribution, and plasma amino acid and lipid profiles were assessed before, during, and/or after the intervention period. RESULTS: No changes in skeletal muscle mass or strength were observed over time in either the leucine- or placebo-supplemented group. No improvements in indexes of whole-body insulin sensitivity (oral glucose insulin sensitivity index and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), blood glycated hemoglobin content, or the plasma lipid profile were observed. CONCLUSION:: Long-term leucine supplementation (7.5 g/d) does not augment skeletal muscle mass or strength and does not improve glycemic control or the blood lipid profile in healthy elderly men. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00807508. 3along term effects 3aleucine 3adietary supplements 3amuscle physiology 3askeletal muscle 3aelderly 3amen 3aelderly nutrition 3ainsulin resistance 3aglycemic control 3ablood lipids 3aclinical trials 2aAbsorptiometry, Photon 2aAged 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Mass Index 2aDietary Supplements 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxanalysis. 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aLeucinexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aMale 2aMuscle Proteinsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMuscle Strengthxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMuscle, Skeletalxanatomy & histologyxdrug effectsxradiography. 2aPatient Selection 2aPlacebos 2aTomography, X-Ray Computed1 aVanschoonbeek, Kristof1 aVerdijk, Lex B.1 aKoopman, René1 aWodzig, Will KWH1 aDendale, Paul1 avan Loon, Luc JC0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 May, v. 89, no. 5 p.1468-1475dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.266683Available from publisher's Web site  a20090624b20090703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/06/02  aOther US 7aarticle02006naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245006700165300001600232520087800248650002201126650002701148650001501175650001801190650001801208650001101226650002601237650001901263653001701282653000901299653001401308653001301322653002101335700001901356773009501375852000901470856008501479930003301564946001101597655001201608IND4397944620221120224855.0071118e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439794462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-006-0481-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScolari, M. J. 10aD-serine: a new word in the glutamatergic neuro-glial language  ap. 563-574.  aGliotransmission is a process in which astrocytes are dynamic elements that influence synaptic transmission and synaptogenesis. The best-known gliotransmitters are glutamate and ATP. However, in the past decade, it has been demonstrated that D-serine, a D-amino acid, acts as a gliotransmitter in glutamatergic synapses. The physiological relevance of D-serine is sustained by the way in which it modulates the action of glutamatergic neurotransmission, neuronal migration and long-term potentiation (LTP). In addition, the synthesis and degradation mechanisms of D-serine have been proposed as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and related disorders. In the present review, detailed information is provided about the physiological and physiopathological relevance of D-serine, including metabolic and regulation aspects. 3aAlzheimer disease 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aastrocytes 3aglutamic acid 3aschizophrenia 3aserine 3asynaptic transmission 3asynaptogenesis 0aGlycine site 0aNMDA 0aGlutamate 0aD-serine 0aGliotransmission1 aAcosta, G.

Sex-sorted semen from 4 proven Holstein-Friesian bulls and available under commercial conditions was used on nulliparous Holstein heifers reared on 61 dairy farms of northern Italy. Data from 536 artificial inseminations with pregnancy diagnosis and 258 calvings were analyzed using the logistic regression procedure. The effects of year and season of insemination or calving, age at insemination or calving, heifer inbreeding, and the sperm dose used for insemination on the probability of a positive pregnancy diagnosis or of the birth of a female calf, respectively, were studied. The overall pregnancy rate for sexed semen was 51% and was affected by year of insemination and bull. Heifers inseminated with sexed semen from 2 bulls had lower pregnancy rates than heifers inseminated with sexed semen from other bulls. Purity of the sexed sperm, based on the proportion of female calves, was 87% and this percentage was not affected by explanatory variables included in the logistic regression. The results demonstrate that bulls differ in terms of fertility of their sexed semen. Careful selection of the insemination sires used for sorted semen is advisable for avoiding low fertility inseminations. 3adairy herds 3adairy bulls 3aspermatozoa 3asex preselection 3amale fertility 3asemen 3aheifers 3adairy cows 3aHolstein 3aartificial insemination 3acalves 3acalving 3aregression analysis 3aseasonal variation 3aanimal age 3ainbreeding coefficient 3apregnancy rate 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDairyingxmethods 2aFemale 2aFertilityxphysiology 2aInsemination, Artificialxmethodsxveterinary. 2aMale 2aOdds Ratio 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Rate 2aSemenxphysiology 2aSex Preselectionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSex Ratio 3aItaly 0asex-sorted spermatozoa 0asperm dose1 aCassandro, M.1 aDal Zotto, R.1 aCarnier, P.1 aGallo, L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 May, v. 90, no. 5 p.2538-2542dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20070719b20070802c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/06/12  aOther US 7aarticle02333naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245013300161300001600294500001500310520107000325650002201395650001301417650001101430650002201441650001501463650001301478650002101491650001301512650002101525651001901546653002101565653002201586653001701608653002001625653002101645653001801666700001801684773009301702852000901795930003301804945002501837946001301862655001201875IND4384574220221120203517.0061020e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438457422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSnider, A.G.10aEconomic Analyses of Wood Chip Mill Expansion in North Carolina: Implications for Nonindustrial Private Forest (NIPF) Management  ap. 102-108.  a2019-12-05  aPotential economic benefits of wood chip mills in North Carolina and likely forest management changes for nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) landowners were analyzed. The net effects of wood chip mills provided a small net stumpage price increase (1.9%) benefit to forest landowners, had very small economic welfare effects on total economic returns to timber producers and consumers (<0.1%), and had a moderate impact on reducing aggregate site preparation costs (11.6%). Discounted cash-flow analyses indicated that wood chip markets would increase returns somewhat more for pine management than for hardwood management, but the much greater sawtimber prices, especially for pines, still would favor long rotations and pine management. These analyses indicate that markets provided by wood chip mills would tend to create more harvest of pulpwood as part of existing harvests or in new timber harvests of small stands, but would not be likely to encourage clearcutting of much more valuable sawtimber stands or large-scale changes in forest management practices. 3atimber management 3ahardwood 3aprices 3acosts and returns 3awood chips 3asoftwood 3aprivate forestry 3astumpage 3asite preparation 3aNorth Carolina 0aforest economics 0aeconomic analysis 0acost savings 0awood chip mills 0awelfare analysis 0awood products1 aCubbage, F.W.0 tSouthern journal of applied forestry.g2006 May, v. 30, no. 2 p.102-108x0148-44197nnas  aDNAL  a20061229b20070102c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/12/29  aOther US 7aarticle04421naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100001300156245011800169300001800287500002400305500001500329520220400344650001602548650001402564650001302578650002802591650001802619650001802637650002702655650002702682650002302709650003102732650002202763650002402785650001902809650001302828650001002841650002302851650002502874650001902899650001202918650002402930650003102954650001102985650003502996650004003031650010203071650005703173650002503230650001503255650001203270650001003282650006203292650001703354653001203371653002203383653002203405653001603427700001603443700001703459773011903476852000903595930003303604945002503637946001303662655001203675IND4390447820221120203522.0070416e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439044782DNAL7 a174309562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ201 0aL100 0aL8321 aHo, A.J.10aLongitudinal Monitoring of Listeria monocytogenes Contamination Patterns in a Farmstead Dairy Processing Facility  ap. 2517-2524.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aContamination of dairy products with Listeria monocytogenes is a concern because multiple human listeriosis outbreaks have been linked to contaminated cheese and dairy products. Dairy production on farmstead operations may be a particular concern because L. monocytogenes is also an animal pathogen that can be shed by ruminants with and without clinical symptoms; physical proximity between production animal and dairy processing facilities may thus provide a higher risk for introduction of L. monocytogenes into the dairy production process. To better understand the risks of L. monocytogenes contamination associated with farmstead dairy production, samples from a farmstead dairy processing operation and the milking barn of the directly adjacent dairy sheep operation were tested for L. monocytogenes over a 3-yr period. Prevalence of L. monocytogenes for samples collected on the farm (n = 85) and the dairy production facility (n = 674) was 9.4 and 2.7%, respectively. Molecular subtyping using automated EcoRI ribotyping of L. monocytogenes isolates revealed that distinct subtypes were associated with the dairy production facility and the farm's milking parlor. Although a total of 5 and 4 different ribotypes were identified among isolates obtained from the dairy production facility and the milking parlor, respectively, only 1 ribotype (DUP-1030A) was isolated from both. Different ribotypes were predominant among isolates from the dairy production facility (ribotype DUP-1052A, representing 15 of 18 isolates) and the farm's milking parlor (ribotype DUP-1039A, representing 4 of 8 isolates); each of these ribotypes appeared to persist over time in the respective area. Our data support that i) in farmstead dairy processing facilities, L. monocytogenes present on the farm can largely be prevented from being introduced into the processing facility; and ii) L. monocytogenes can persist on farm and in processing areas, providing a potential high-risk source for contamination. Preventing cross contamination between dairy production and processing facilities and control of persistent L. monocytogenes are thus critical to assuring the microbial safety of farmstead dairy products. 3alisteriosis 3aribotypes 3aewe milk 3abacterial contamination 3adairy animals 3adairy farming 3aListeria monocytogenes 3afood processing plants 3astrain differences 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3adisease outbreaks 3across contamination 3adairy products 3azoonoses 3asheep 3afood contamination 3adisease transmission 3afood pathogens 2aAnimals 2aDairyingxstandards 2aEnvironmental Microbiology 2aFemale 2aFood Handlingxinstrumentation 2aFood-Processing Industryxstandards 2aListeria monocytogenesxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aListeriosisxepidemiologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aRibotyping 2aSeasons 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxtransmission. 2aTime Factors 0astrains 0afood microbiology 0apathogen shedding 0afood safety1 aLappi, V.R.1 aWiedmann, M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 May, v. 90, no. 5 p.2517-2524dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20070719b20070802c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/06/12  aOther US 7aarticle02881naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001600178245006500194300001500259500001500274520150600289650001601795650001701811650002601828650001001854650002301864650001201887650001201899650002001911650002301931650001601954650001701970650001601987650001302003650002102016650001502037651001402052651001202066651001902078653001502097653000902112653002902121700001702150773009202167852000902259930003302268945002502301946001302326655001202339IND4384573820221120203606.0061020e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438457382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Two bedding regimes, midseason and late-season, were examined at each location. Midseason bedding occurred between May and July and late-season bedding occurred between September and November. Results indicate that many of the historical application timing limitations placed on imazapyr are not necessary. Chopper herbicide in combination with methylated seed oil can be applied as early as February and as late as November, up to the day before bedding and immediately after bedding. Seasonal timing of application also was found to have a major impact on pine growth. For those treatments that provided good vegetation control, earlier season treatments resulted in the best pine growth. Optimal application timings were (1) June through September at least 3 weeks after midseason bedding, (2) February to the day before midseason bedding, and (3) February through July followed by late-season bedding. An exception is that if deciduous woody species such as hardwood or blackberry are targeted, early season applications (February-April) should not occur until these species have leafed out. The optimal timing windows are wide, allowing forest managers plenty of flexibility in scheduling operations. Use of optimal timing windows has the potential to substantially increase productivity without increasing costs. 3atree growth 3aweed control 3apesticide application 3astems 3asoil water content 3ahilling 3aseasons 3aPinus elliottii 3aseasonal variation 3awoody weeds 3asoil texture 3aPinus taeda 3aimazapyr 3asite preparation 3avegetation 3aLouisiana 3aFlorida 3aNorth Carolina 0aherbicides 0asoil 0aoptimal application time1 aQuicke, H.E.0 tSouthern journal of applied forestry.g2006 May, v. 30, no. 2 p.92-101x0148-44197nnas  aDNAL  a20070103b20070202c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/12/29  aOther US 7aarticle01691naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245006900182300001400251520039800265650001600663650002300679650002000702650002100722650003600743650001300779650002400792650002100816650004300837650003700880653002200917653001800939653004700957700001801004700001601022773009301038852000901131856008501140930003301225946001101258655001201269IND4393299420221120203617.0070722e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439329942DNAL7 a170216552pmid7 a10.1007/s00726-006-0410-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGianazza, E. 10aDetecting oxidative post-translational modifications in proteins  ap. 51-56.  aOxidative stress induces various post-translational modifications (PTM); some are reversible in vivo via enzymatic catalysis.

In contrast to conventional single biomarker studies, comprehensive analysis of biomarkers offers an unbiased strategy for global assessment of modified amino acid metabolism due to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. This review examines recent analytical techniques amenable for analysis of modified amino acids in biological samples reported during 2003-2007. Particular attention is devoted to the need for validated methods applicable to high-throughput analysis of multiple amino acid biomarkers, as well as consideration of sample pretreatment protocols on artifact formation for improved clinical relevance. 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acid metabolism 3aamino acids 3aanalytical methods 3abiomarkers 3anitrogen 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aBiomarkersxanalysis. 2aHumans 2aOxidative Stress 2aPrimary Prevention 2aReactive Nitrogen Speciesxanalysis 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxanalysis 0aMultiple biomarkers 0aComprehensive analysis 0aModified amino acids1 aLee, R. 1 aBritz-McKibbin, P. 0 tAmino acids.g2007 July, v. 33, no. 1 p.3-18dVienna : Springer-Verlagx0939-44517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-007-0542-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070722b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02532naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245013200179300001400311520119400325650001801519650001301537650001601550650002101566650001401587650002301601650001001624650002501634650002301659650002101682650001001703650001101713650001101724650001301735650002401748650001101772650003201783651001301815653001901828700002001847773009101867852000901958930003301967945002502000946001302025655001202038IND4384572520221120182754.0061020e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438457252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Trees were sampled from the same eight stands over the four seasons of the year; therefore, stand-to-stand variation did not impact results. Specific gravity did not differ within stem position across seasons. However, seasonal differences in moisture content led to different weight scaling factors by season, the largest weight scaling factor occurring in spring. As a result, the weight equation is parameterized differently based on season of the year. Stand origin (natural regeneration versus plantation) did not significantly impact weight scaling factor. The fitted equation explained 97% of the variation present in the data and possessed a mean absolute error of 24.1 lb per tree.

Hepatotoxicity of CCl₄ in mice fed with β-alanine was decreased as determined by changes in serum enzyme activities. Hepatic glutathione and taurine concentrations after CCl₄ challenge were increased markedly by β-alanine intake. The enhanced availability of cysteine for synthesis of glutathione and/or taurine appears to account for the hepatoprotective effects of β-alanine against CCl₄-induced liver injury. 3ablood serum 3acarbon 3acarbon tetrachloride 3acysteine 3adrinking water 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahepatotoxicity 3aliver 3amice 3ataurine 0aβ-Alanine1 aKim, Y.

Data comprised stallions with an estimated breeding value (EBV) from the national genetic evaluations (NGE) based on at least 10 progeny tested in performance tests, and the ancestors of those stallions in two generations. The DWB data included 349 stallions and the SWB data 426 stallions. Of these, 28 had EBVs in both DWB and SWB. Additionally 151 pedigree animals were common between DWB and SWB. The dependent variables used were NGE results of stallions born 1980 and later, which reduced the number of common stallions with EBVs to 23. The genetic correlations were very high for jumping traits (0.99) and dressage related traits (0.89-0.97). For conformation traits correlations varied between 0.10 and 0.98. Because of the high genetic correlations and frequent use of same or closely related foreign stallions, breeders of both DWB and SWB would benefit from using the NGEs for performance traits across countries, although the genetic correlations do not consider differences in genetic merit levels between the populations. It would be feasible to perform a joint genetic evaluation using MACE, which would improve the reliability of estimated breeding values, and enable ranking of all stallions according to the national scale of each country. 3abreed differences 3agenetic merit 3aphenotype 3abody conformation 3apedigree 3agenetic correlation 3aprogeny 3agenetic variation 3astallions 3aanimal performance 3abreeding value 3ahorse breeds 3aSweden 3aDenmark 0aMulti-trait Across Country Evaluation 0aDanish Warmblood (horse breed) 0aSwedish Warmblood (horse breed) 0ahorses1 aJorjani, H.1 aPhilipsson, J.0 tLivestock science.g2009 Sept., v. 124, no. 1-3 p.15-20dElsevierx1871-14137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2008.11.0213Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02742naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007600128300001600204500013200220500002400352520153700376650001901913650000801932650001101940650001101951650001201962650001501974650001201989650001402001650001702015650001802032650000702050650001502057700001402072700001902086700001802105773012302123852000902246856008902255655001202344IND4474658220221120173411.0131206s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447465822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolding, J.B.10aEfficacy of no treatment to inhibit browning on fresh cut lettuce types  ap. 933-938.  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Postharvest Symposium, held June 25, 2012 - June 29, 2012, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  aIncludes references  aBrowning of the cut surfaces of minimally processed fruit and vegetables, including on pre-cut slices of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), is a limiting quality factor during storage and marketing. ‘Iceberg’ lettuce slices were fumigated with nitric oxide (NO) gas at concentrations between 5 and 1000 µl L(-1) in air at 20°C for 1 to 4 h or dipped in an aqueous solution of the NO-donor compound, 2,2’- (hydroxynitrosohydrazino)-bis-ethanamine (diethylene triamine-nitric oxide; DETANO) at concentrations between 10 and 1000 mg L(-1) for 15 s to 60 min, followed by storage at 0°C in air. The most effective treatments were fumigation with 500 µl L(-1) NO for 1 h, and dipping in 500 mg L(-1) DETANO for 5 min. The ability of NO to inhibit the development of browning of different types of lettuces was further investigated on the cut surfaces of four fresh-cut lettuce types (‘Green Oak’, ‘Green Coral’, ‘Baby Cos’, and ‘Butter’) during storage at 5°C. The NO was applied to lettuce strips (i) by fumigation with NO gas for 2 h, (ii) by dipping in DETANO solution dissolved in 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 6.5, or (iii) by dipping in an aqueous solution of the NO-donor compound, sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Treatment with NO gas, DETANO, or SNP inhibited the development of browning and extended the postharvest life of all four lettuce types. The optimum treatments were dipping in 500 mg L(-1) DETANO or SNP, which resulted in an approximately 60% increase in postharvest life over untreated lettuce slices. 3aLactuca sativa 3aair 3abutter 3acorals 3adipping 3afumigation 3alettuce 3amarketing 3anitric oxide 3anitroprusside 3apH 3ashelf life1 aHuque, R.1 aPristijono, P.1 aWills, R.B.H.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Nov., , no. 1012 p.933-938dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1012/1012_125.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04880naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100002000156245011400176300001800290500002400308500001500332520248300347650001802830650002102848650000802869650001602877650002202893650001702915650002002932650000802952650002002960650001202980650001702992650002003009650001103029650002203040650002003062650001703082650001603099650002603115650000903141650002003150650005203170650002603222650001203248650002403260650001603284650002103300650004403321650001103365650001903376650002203395650005803417650003303475650000903508650004503517650003303562650003103595650004403626653002003670653001803690653000903708653002203717700001403739700001503753700001703768700001403785700001403799700001403813773011903827852000903946930003303955945002503988946001304013655001204026IND4390445420221120173357.0070416e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439044542DNAL7 a174309442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL500 0aL2001 aSchönhusen, U.10aEffect of a Soy Protein-Based Diet on Ribonucleic Acid Metabolism in the Small Intestinal Mucosa of Goat Kids  ap. 2404-2412.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study was designed to investigate the effect of soy protein inclusion in milk replacer diets for goat kids on protein, RNA, and DNA contents in small intestinal mucosa, on the importance of RNA biosynthesis from dietary RNA precursors for mucosal RNA synthesis, and on the activities of enzymes involved in nucleotide degradation in small intestinal mucosa. Diets were based on cow's milk. In the control group, 35% of the milk protein was replaced by casein (CN) protein, and in the soy group (SPAA), the same amount of milk protein was replaced by soy protein supplemented with essential AA known to be at lower concentrations in soy than in CN (Thr, Val, Ile, Leu, His, Lys, Met). Diets were isonitrogenous and isoenergetic. At 47 d of age, goats were harvested and samples of proximal, middle, and distal jejunal mucosa were collected 5 h after feeding ¹⁵N-labeled RNA from yeast (13 mg/kg of body weight). Growth and feed conversion did not differ between the control and SPAA kids. Mucosal protein concentrations were lower in the SPAA than the control kids. Concentrations of RNA and DNA did not differ between feeding groups, but in all kids mucosal RNA concentrations were higher in proximal than in middle and distal jejunum. Protein:RNA ratios were higher in the control than the SPAA kids and were lowest in proximal jejunum. Activities of alkaline phosphatase in enterocytes were higher in proximal than in middle and distal jejunum. Activities of mucosal xanthine oxidase were highest in distal jejunum and were higher in the SPAA than the control kids, especially in the middle and distal sites. The ¹⁵N-enrichment of mucosal RNA was higher in the control than the SPAA kids, especially in distal jejunum, and was lowest in distal jejunum. In contrast, ¹⁵N-enrichment of urea in plasma tended to be higher and Gly concentration in plasma was lower in the SPAA than the control kids. Data indicate that protein content and the protein:RNA ratio were lower in jejunal mucosa of goat kids fed milk replacer with partial replacement of CN protein by soy protein. These findings were accompanied by a lower level of reutilization of preformed dietary RNA precursors for RNA biosynthesis in jejunal mucosa and a higher activity of xanthine oxidase. Thus, feeding soy protein instead of CN protein reduced the incorporation of preformed dietary RNA precursors for RNA biosynthesis in the mucosa and activated key enzymes involved in nucleic acid breakdown. 3amilk replacer 3axanthine oxidase 3aRNA 3anucleotides 3aintestinal mucosa 3afeed rations 3ablood chemistry 3aDNA 3aliveweight gain 3ajejunum 3ablood plasma 3afeed conversion 3acasein 3aspatial variation 3aenzyme activity 3abiosynthesis 3asoy protein 3aessential amino acids 3aurea 3aprotein content 2aAmino Acidsxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aBody Weight 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Proteinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aEating 2aGlycinexblood 2aGoatsxmetabolism 2aIntestinal Mucosaxchemistryxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aIntestine, Smallxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMilk Substitutesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aNitrogenxbloodxmetabolism. 2aRNAxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSoybean Proteinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 0asmall intestine 0adairy protein 0akids 0aprotein RNA ratio1 aKuhla, S.1 aZitnan, R.1 aWutzke, K.D.1 aHuber, K.1 aMoors, S.1 aVoigt, J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 May, v. 90, no. 5 p.2404-2412dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20070719b20070802c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/06/12  aOther US 7aarticle03102naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245009300165300001800258500001500276520153000291650001501821650002201836650001901858650001501877650001301892650001201905650001701917650001501934650002601949650003001975650002302005650001702028650002202045650001302067650003202080650006102112650002302173650006802196650001502264653002502279653002402304653003902328700002102367700001602388700001702404773008402421852000902505939003302514946001302547655001202560IND8903486020221120173923.0890630e198906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890348602DNAL7 a27227542pmid7 aPMC2100642pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitts, C.L.10aIdentification of cyclic intermediates in Azorhizobium caulinodans nicotinate catabolism  ap. 3406-3411.  a2019-12-05  aIn wild-type Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571, nicotinate served both as anabolic substrate for NAD+ production and as catabolic substrate for use as the N source. Catabolic enzyme activities were greatest from cultures grown with nicotinate as the N source and least when cultures were grown with ammonium as the N source. Vector insertion mutants unable to catabolize nicotinate (nic::Vi mutants) still required micromolar quantities of this compound for growth. Therefore, A. caulinodans wild type is NAD+ auxotrophic. As the first two intermediates in A. caulinodans nicotinate catabolism, two cyclic compounds, 6-hydroxynicotinate and 1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxonicotinate, were identified. These compounds were purified from the growth medium of strain 61009 (a nic::Vi mutant) by high-performance liquid chromatography; their identities were subsequently confirmed by UV absorbance, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectra. The conversion of 1 mol of nicotinate to 6-hydroxynicotinate consumed 0.5 mol of O2. From 18O isotopic incorporation experiments, water was the hydroxyl-equivalent source. A nicotinate hydroxylase activity proved to be cell wall-membrane associated; this activity served as direct electron donor (not indirect via NADP+) to O2 via membrane electron transport. These catabolic reactions have not previously been witnessed together in the same organism. A. caulinodans nicotinate catabolism seems coupled to N2 fixation, although the explicit mechanism of this coupling remains to be determined. 3ametabolism 3anitrogen fixation 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aauxotrophs 3anicotine 3aenzymes 3aRhizobiaceae 2aAerobiosis 2aCell Compartmentation 2aCell Membranexenzymology 2aElectron Transport 2aFermentation 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMutation 2aNicotinic Acidsxmetabolism 2aOxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donorsxmetabolism 2aOxygen Consumption 2aRhizobiaceaexgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aSolubility 0abiochemical pathways 0ab-hydroxynicotinate 0a1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxonicotinate1 aSchaechter, L.E.1 aRabin, R.S.1 aLudwig, R.A.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1989 June, v. 171, no. 6 p.3406-3411x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03112naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100001900154245010000173300001600273500002400289520176700313650001702080650000902097650002702106650002002133650001202153650000802165650001602173650002502189650001402214650002502228650002102253653002802274700002502302700001302327700001802340700001602358773011702374852000902491856008502500930003302585945002502618946001102643655001202654IND4422454220221120162932.0090626e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442245422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-009-9551-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aGao, Dong-Ying10aDetection of DNA changes in somaclonal mutants of rice using SSR markers and transposon display  ap. 187-196.  aIncludes references  aSomaclonal variation detected in plant tissues grown in vitro can be heritable, and thus provides an opportunity for plant breeders and geneticists to generate novel variants.

In this study, 120 SSR markers, distributed across all 12 chromosomes of rice, have been used to analyze eight somaclonal mutants derived from seven different cultivars. Of these, 13 SSRs have detected polymorphisms between the bacterial blight resistant mutant HX-3 and its wild-type Minghui 63. While, ten SSRs have revealed differences between a purple sheath mutant, Z418, and the wild-type C418. None of the SSRs have been able to distinguish between tall and dwarf mutants, 02428h and A418, and their wild-type counterparts, respectively. Interestingly, six SSRs have identified differences in at least three mutant lines and their corresponding wild-type genotypes. These results have suggested that some SSR markers in the rice genome may detect higher numbers of polymorphisms than others. In addition, a transposon display (TD) of five active rice transposons, Tos17, Karma, mPing, nDart and dTok, has been conducted to evaluate DNA changes of eight mutants. Some mutant lines, such as HX-3 and Z418, have exhibited differences from their corresponding wild-type genotypes in TDs with two transposons. This has indicated that new insertions of transposons are involved in somaclonal variation derived from tissue culture. Taken together, these results suggest that multiple molecular mechanisms are responsible for somaclonal variation detected in tissue culture of rice. 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3amicrosatellite repeats 3agenetic markers 3amutants 3aDNA 3atransposons 3asomaclonal variation 3acultivars 3agenetic polymorphism 3amicropropagation 0amolecular sequence data1 aVallejo, Veronica A.1 aHe, Bing1 aGai, Yun-Chao1 aSun, Li-Hua0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2009 Aug., v. 98, no. 2 p.187-196dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-009-9551-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20090914b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/08/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03491naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003700133040001800170072000900188072000900197100002500206245011800231300001400349500002400363506007600387520151000463506003701973650001202010650001402022650002302036650002002059650001302079650000902092650001002101650001802111650001702129650001002146650002102156650003002177650002702207650001802234650002402252650002102276650001102297650001102308650000902319650002402328650002702352650001402379650001602393650001702409650002302426650001502449700001502464700002002479700001602499700001702515700001602532773008002548852000902628856008702637930003302724945002502757946001102782655001202793IND4388346620221207081624.0070301e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438834662DNAL7 a170000282pmid7 aPMC20456502pmcid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2006.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT2001 aOrrell-Valente, J.K.10a“Just three more bites”: An observational analysis of parents' socialization of children's eating at mealtime  ap. 37-45.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe objective of this study was to describe comprehensively the structure and process of the childhood mealtime environment. A socioeconomically diverse sample of 142 families of kindergarteners (52% females) was observed at dinnertime using a focused-narrative observational system. Eighty-five percent of parents tried to get children to eat more, 83% of children ate more than they might otherwise have, with 38% eating moderately to substantially more. Boys were prompted to eat as often as girls and children were prompted to eat as many times in single- as in two-parent households. Children were very rarely restricted in their mealtime intake. High-SES parents used reasoning, praise, and food rewards significantly more often than low-SES families. Mothers used different strategies than fathers: fathers used pressure tactics with boys and mothers praised girls for eating. Future research should examine the meanings children ascribe to their parents' communications about food intake and how perceived parental messages influence the development of long-term dietary patterns. Interpreted alongside the evidence for children's energy self-regulation and the risk of disruption of these innate processes, it may be that parents are inadvertently socializing their children to eat past their internal hunger/satiety cues. These data reinforce current recommendations that parents should provide nutritious foods and children, not parents, should decide what and how much of these foods they eat.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aparents 3aparenting 3asocial environment 3achild nutrition 3achildren 3aboys 3agirls 3aeating habits 3ameals (menu) 2aAdult 2aChild, Preschool 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aFamily Characteristics 2aFamily Health 2aFathersxpsychology 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMothersxpsychology 2aParent-Child Relations 2aParenting 2aSex Factors 2aSocial Class 2aSocial Environment 2aTelevision1 aHill, L.G.1 aBrechwald, W.A.1 aDodge, K.A.1 aPettit, G.S.1 aBates, J.E.0 tAppetite.g2007 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.37-45dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2006.06.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20070808b20070902c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/07/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03206naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002000172245015300192300001600345500002400361500001500385520124800400650002701648650001701675650003001692650000801722650002001730650002101750650002601771650001701797650003001814650001301844650001501857650005201872650003201924650001901956650002401975650001801999650002302017650001102040653003002051653003002081700001902111700001602130700001702146700001702163700001902180700001902199700001802218700002102236700001902257773011702276852000902393856008502402930003302487945002502520946001102545655001202556IND4422454620221120142319.0090626e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442245462DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-009-9556-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF822 0aF1101 aPak, Hyo-Kyung 10aHairy root induction in Oriental melon (Cucumis melo) by Agrobacterium rhizogenes and reproduction of the root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita)  ap. 219-228.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCotyledon explants of two Oriental melons produced hairy roots when cultured on Murashige and Skoog basal medium after infection by the Agrobacterium rhizogenes. Hairy roots were produced from the wounded surface of the cotyledon explants of Cucumis melo L. cv. Geumssaragi-euncheon on Murashige and Skoog selective medium and 86% of the GUS stained hairy roots were positive for the expression of beta-glucuronidase. The insertion of the gfp-gus fusion gene in the genomic DNA and the presence of the gfp-gus-specific transcript in the total RNAs of transgenic hairy roots were confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR, respectively. An immunoblot analysis of the transgenic hairy root extract revealed 97 kDa single bands coincident with the molecular weight of the GFP-GUS fusion proteins. ELISA demonstrated that the highest level of GFP-GUS fusion protein expression was 0.47% of the total soluble protein in a transgenic hairy root. The MS medium showed the fastest growth among three media types tested. Infection of the hairy roots with a root-knot nematode resulted in the development of a mature egg mass about 4-5 weeks after inoculation. The highest number of egg mass was obtained on the hairy roots cultured in SH medium containing 0.3% agar. 3agenetic transformation 3aplant growth 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aova 3agenetic vectors 3amolecular weight 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aCucumis melo 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aexplants 3acotyledons 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3areporter genes 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aculture media 3abeta-glucuronidase 3amelons 0apolymerase chain reaction 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aSim, Joon-Soo 1 aRhee, Yong 1 aKo, Hyo-Rim 1 aHa, Sun-Hwa 1 aYoon, Mun-Sup 1 aKang, Chan-Ho 1 aLee, Sukchan 1 aKim, Yŏng-hwan.1 aHahn, Bum-Soo 0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2009 Aug., v. 98, no. 2 p.219-228dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-009-9556-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/08/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03337naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100001900164245014000183300001800323500002400341500001500365520159500380650002701975650001702002650002102019650001702040650002602057650001902083650002002102650001202122650002102134650001402155650001402169650002302183650002202206650002102228650001402249650001602263650001502279653002102294653002602315653003302341700002202374700001602396700002502412700002002437773013502457852000902592856007702601930003302678945002502711946001102736655001202747IND4422533520221120121958.0090626e20090815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442253352DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.36412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aJ700 0aF5001 aFallovo, Carlo10aNutrient solution concentration and growing season affect yield and quality of Lactuca sativa L. var. acephala in floating raft culture  ap. 1682-1689.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: There is growing interest among consumers in baby leaf vegetables, mostly requested for mixed salads, both as fresh market products and ready-to-use vegetables. Fertilisation is one of the most practical and effective ways of controlling and improving the yield and nutritional quality of crops for human consumption. The optimal fertiliser concentration for baby leaf vegetables depends on the environmental conditions. The aim of the present work was to determine the effects of nutrient solution concentration (2, 18, 34, 50 or 66 mequiv L⁻¹) during two consecutive growing seasons (spring and summer) on the yield and leaf quality of Lactuca sativa L. var. acephala grown in a floating system.RESULTS: Marketable fresh yield, total dry biomass, leaf area index, macroelement (N, P, K and Mg) concentrations and nitrate and total chlorophyll contents increased in response to an increase in nutrient solution concentration, while the opposite trend was observed for root/shoot ratio and glucose, fructose, starch, total carbohydrate and protein contents. Plants grown in the spring season exhibited lower yield and growth (total dry biomass and leaf area index) but higher leaf quality (higher carbohydrate content and lower nitrate content) than those grown in the summer season.CONCLUSION: The use of nutrient solution concentrations of 37 and 44 mequiv L⁻¹ for the spring and summer seasons respectively could be adopted in the present conditions to improve marketable fresh yield and leaf mineral content, but with a slight reduction in some nutritional parameters. 3achemical concentration 3aplant growth 3anutrient content 3acrop quality 3anutrient availability 3aLactuca sativa 3aleaf area index 3alettuce 3anitrate nitrogen 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3anutrient solutions 3avegetable growing 3asoilless culture 3anutrients 3achlorophyll 3aphosphorus 0anitrogen content 0afloating raft culture 0aLactuca sativa var. acephala1 aRouphael, Youssef1 aRea, Elvira1 aBattistelli, Alberto1 aColla, Giuseppe0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2009 Aug. 15, v. 89, no. 10 p.1682-1689dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.36413Available from publisher's Web site  a20090707b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/07/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02940naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100002000175245006500195300001600260500002400276500001500300520141500315650001201730650002001742650001901762650001601781650002101797650002201818650001901840650000901859650001401868650001701882650001401899653001801913700001801931700002001949700002201969700002301991700002102014700002902035700001802064700002602082700002302108773008902131852000902220856008802229930003302317945002502350946001102375655001202386IND4422376820221120081101.0090626e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442237682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2009.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL300 0aL2101 aBaxter, Emma M.10aIndicators of piglet survival in an outdoor farrowing system  ap. 266-276.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPre-weaning piglet mortality continues to be a major welfare and economic concern. In outdoor farrowing systems, there is a particular need to broaden breeding goals by incorporating selection for piglet survival to improve both productivity and welfare. This study aimed to identify behavioural and physiological survival indicators that are influential in outdoor systems and that could provide additional information for use when selecting for piglet survival. Data were collected from 511 piglets from Large WhitexLandracexDuroc sows and Generalised Linear Mixed Models determined which indicators were most important for piglet survival in an outdoor system. With respect to prenatal mortality (surviving vs. stillborn piglets) high ponderal index (P <0.001) or body mass index (P <0.001) in conjunction with being born earlier in the farrowing birth order (P <0.001) were the most important survival indicators. Birth weight (P <0.001) and rectal temperature 1 h after birth (P =0.032) were the most significant postnatal survival indicators. However survival indicators identified as important in indoor, conventional farrowing crates, such as landmark behaviours (latency to reach the udder, a teat and to suckle colostrum), were not influential in this system. These results highlight the importance of studying potential indicators of survival in alternative farrowing systems to the farrowing crate. 3apiglets 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal welfare 3afetal death 3abody temperature 3abody measurements 3afarrowing pens 3asows 3amortality 3abirth weight 3afarrowing 0aswine housing1 aJarvis, Susan1 aSherwood, Lorna1 aRobson, Sheena K.1 aOrmandy, Elisabeth1 aFarish, Marianne1 aSmurthwaite, Kathleen M.1 aRoehe, Rainer1 aLawrence, Alistair B.1 aEdwards, Sandra A.0 tLivestock science.g2009 Sept., v. 124, no. 1-3 p.266-276dElsevierx1871-14137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2009.02.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090824b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02867naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245007900135300001800214520122700232650002501459650002201484650002001506650001401526650001901540650001101559650001801570650001301588700001601601700002201617700002101639700002401660700002501684700002101709700001901730700002001749700002401769700001601793700002201809700002101831700001501852700003001867700001101897700002601908700002501934700002601959700002601985700001902011700002002030700002602050700001902076700001902095700002002114700002302134773008802157852000902245946001102254655001202265IND4448265320221120081142.0110126e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444826532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchler-Bauer, Aron10aCDD: a Conserved Domain Database for the functional annotation of proteins  ap. D225-D229.  aNCBI's Conserved Domain Database (CDD) is a resource for the annotation of protein sequences with the location of conserved domain footprints, and functional sites inferred from these footprints. CDD includes manually curated domain models that make use of protein 3D structure to refine domain models and provide insights into sequence/structure/function relationships. Manually curated models are organized hierarchically if they describe domain families that are clearly related by common descent. As CDD also imports domain family models from a variety of external sources, it is a partially redundant collection. To simplify protein annotation, redundant models and models describing homologous families are clustered into superfamilies. By default, domain footprints are annotated with the corresponding superfamily designation, on top of which specific annotation may indicate high-confidence assignment of family membership. Pre-computed domain annotation is available for proteins in the Entrez/Protein dataset, and a novel interface, Batch CD-Search, allows the computation and download of annotation for large sets of protein queries.

Hence, applications of only fertilizer N and P were recommended. This has resulted in soil K mining in intensive cropping systems in China, India and other Asian countries. Prediction of possible K deficiency in the future requires knowledge of K budgets and an understanding of the mechanisms of K supply to crops in soils and sediments. This paper presents the results of a case study in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Detailed K budgets of cropping systems with two and three rice crops per year were made, and compared with partial K budgets with fertilizer K as input, and K removed with harvested grain and straw as outputs. The results of the budgets were combined with data on soil K pools in model calculations. A simple model comprising two soil K pools, labile K (LK) and recalcitrant K (RK) and applying first-order equations for the relative rates of transformation was used to predict various K management scenarios. Potassium balances were always positive for recalcitrant K, and negative for labile K unless about 80 kg ha-1 yr-1 of fertilizer K was applied. Partial K budgets resulted in K balance estimates that were too negative because of neglected K inputs via rain, irrigation water and sediments. Complete K budgets are needed for a realistic judgment. The differentiation between labile and recalcitrant K and their incorporation in the model made it possible to show the effects of various K management options on future K uptake in rice cropping systems. 3asoil nutrient balance 3asoil nutrients 3apotassium 3aintensive cropping 3arice 3aOryza sativa 3aVietnam1 aJanssen, B.H.1 aOenema, O.1 aDobermann, A.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2006 Aug., v. 116, no. 1-2 p.121-131dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2006.03.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20070720b20070802c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/06/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02601naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007900129300001600208500013700224500002400361520149400385650000801879650001301887650001101900650001001911650001601921650001401937650001101951650001801962650001701980650001501997650001902012773012302031852000902154856008802163655001202251IND4474660220221120070748.0131206s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447466022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuroyanagi, T.10aValidation of CFD simulation of airflow from an air circulator above crops  ap. 213-220.  aPaper presented at the 1st International Symposium on CFD Applications in Agriculture, held July 9 - July 12, 2012, Valencia, Spain.  aIncludes references  aComputational fluid dynamics is a useful tool for investigating the effects of positioning of air circulators relative to the profile of airflow in a greenhouse. This study investigates the influence of crop rows on the air circulation, and examines the relevant settings, including the heterogeneous distribution of the leaf area density of a crop, to predict of the airflow generated by an air circulator. Measurements showed that in the absence of crop rows, the air velocity exceeded 0.15 m s-1 in 73.4% of the grids, but in the presence of crop rows, the percentage decreased to 53.5-61.2%. The airflow from the air circulator was slightly stagnant between crop rows, though the profiles of the air velocity above the canopy were indistinguishable from those where there was no crop canopy. Results of the validation indicated that the grid size was the most significant factor for predicting the airflow generated by an air circulator, as compared to the time-step size and turbulence model used. There was no disparity between the calculated air velocity profiles when the crop rows were treated as a porous medium with a uniform versus a heterogeneous leaf area density. The distribution of the simulated air velocity was in qualitative agreement with the measurements, when proper settings were used. The relative stagnancy of the airflow due to the crop rows agreed with the measurements in terms of the percentage of grids in which an air velocity above 0.15 m s-1 was measured. 3aair 3aair flow 3acanopy 3acrops 3agreenhouses 3aleaf area 3amodels 3aplant density 3aporous media 3aprediction 3aturbulent flow0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Oct., , no. 1008 p.213-220dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1008/1008_28.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03173naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155100001700164245007300181300001400254500013500268500002400403520178000427650001902207650001202226650002302238650002002261650002402281650002002305650001602325650001902341650001202360650002202372651002302394653002302417700001702440773010602457852000902563856008602572930003302658945002502691946001102716655001202727IND4388351120221120060210.0070301e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438835112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2006.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aJ7001 aVanlauwe, B.10aPopular myths around soil fertility management in sub-Saharan Africa  ap. 34-46.  aIn the special issue: Nutrient management in tropical ecosystems / edited by O. Oenema, B.H. Janssen, E. Smaling, and E. Hoffland.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this paper is to demystify some of the popular myths related to tropical soil fertility management that have gained hold in the development community and are often being promulgated by NGO's and development agencies in the tropics. Negative nutrient balances at farm scale or at larger scales are very often presented as proof that soil fertility is at stake in SSA. However, nutrient balances at plot and farm section scale are not always negative. In areas with large nutrient stocks, short-term nutrient mining is fully acceptable. Fertilizer use continues to face considerable controversy in SSA. In this paper, we demonstrate that fertilizers rarely damage the soil; that fertilizers are being used in SSA, often with favourable value-to-cost ratios; and that fertilizers do not cause eutrophication in SSA. Rock phosphates are abundantly present in SSA but most are poorly soluble. Adding these phosphates to compost heaps does not enhance the short-term availability of their P. Although organic inputs are essential soil amendments besides fertilizer, organic inputs alone cannot sustain crop production due to limitations in their quality and availability. Organic resources can also potentially stimulate harmful pests and diseases. Legumes are often advocated as important sources of organic matter but not all legumes fix nitrogen, require inoculation, or are a source of free nitrogen, as even green manures require land and labour. Certain grain legumes with high N harvest indices do not improve soil fertility, but remove net amounts of N from the soil. These myths need correction if we are to harness the role of science in the overall goal of assisting farmers to address the acute problems of poor soil fertility for smallholder farmers in SSA. 3asoil fertility 3afarmers 3afarmers' attitudes 3acrop production 3anutrient management 3afarming systems 3afertilizers 3arock phosphate 3alegumes 3anitrogen fixation 3aSub-Saharan Africa 0aliterature reviews1 aGiller, K.E.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2006 Aug., v. 116, no. 1-2 p.34-46dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2006.03.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20070720b20070802c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/06/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03543naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184100001500193245012100208300001400329500002400343500001500367520184700382650001602229650001802245650001902263650001502282650002002297650002302317650001802340650001202358650002002370650002202390650002102412650001802433650002102451650001802472650001602490650002802506650001802534650002402552653002102576653001602597653001502613700001702628700001402645700001702659773008702676852000902763856008802772930003302860945002502893946001102918655001202929IND4422377520221120060317.0090626e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442237752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2008.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL100 0aL600 0aL300 0aQ5011 aZebeli, Q.10aMaize silage particle length modulates feeding patterns and milk composition in loose-housed lactating Holstein cows  ap. 33-40.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study analysed feeding patterns and feed selective consumption by loose-housed lactating dairy cows fed diets based on maize silage (MS) with different particle length (PL) to establish its effects on overall dry matter intake (DMI) and productive performance. Twelve multiparous Holstein cows were offered a total mixed ration (TMR) with three different PL of MS at harvesting (i.e., long, medium, and short). Results demonstrated greater numbers of day-time meals (i.e., 07:30-19:00 h) when PL was decreased from long to medium (P <0.05). Night-time (i.e., 19:00-06:30 h) changes in the feeding pattern included an increased amount of feed per meal (P <0.05) and a tendency to increase eating time per meal (P <0.10) in cows fed the short-PL diet. Lowering the PL of MS also lowered the selective consumption against physically effective fibre larger than 1.18 mm (peNDF>₁.₁₈; P <0.05) and in favour of fine particles (i.e., particles passing through 1.18 mm screen; P <0.01). Decreasing PL of MS from long to medium and short increased daily DMI as well as the intake of energy and other nutrients contained in the diet including the amount of peNDF>₁.₁₈ (P <0.01). The decrease in the PL of the diet also was associated with increased milk protein and lactose yield and milk urea nitrogen (P <0.05). The actual milk yield and fat-corrected milk were not affected by the diet (P >0.10). Although lowering of the PL tended to increase daily milk energy output (P <0.10), the ratio between energy milk output and the energy intake was linearly decreased (P <0.01), indicating a lower milk efficiency for the lower-PL diets. In conclusion, particle length of MS in a TMR has the potential to modulate circadian feeding patterns, selective consumption of the feed, daily DMI, and milk composition in high-producing dairy cows. 3acow feeding 3aenergy intake 3amilk fat yield 3adairy cows 3anutrient intake 3amilk protein yield 3adietary fiber 3alactose 3afeed conversion 3adry matter intake 3acircadian rhythm 3aloose housing 3amilk composition 3aparticle size 3acorn silage 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aurea nitrogen 3afeeding preferences 0afeeding behavior 0afeed intake 0amilk yield1 aAmetaj, B.N.1 aJunck, B.1 aDrochner, W.0 tLivestock science.g2009 Sept., v. 124, no. 1-3 p.33-40dElsevierx1871-14137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2008.12.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/23  aNon-US 7aarticle04234naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001500166245020400181300001600385500002400401500001500425520265000440650002303090650001503113650002003128650002003148650001203168650001203180650002703192650002603219650001303245650002603258650001503284650002203299650001503321651001303336653001703349653001103366653002403377700001703401700001503418700001603433773008903449852000903538856008803547930003303635945002503668946001103693655001203704IND4422377420221120060120.0090626e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442237742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2009.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL1001 aGradiz, L.10aFit of Wood's function to daily milk records and estimation of environmental and additive and non-additive genetic effects on lactation curve and lactation parameters of crossbred dual purpose cattle  ap. 321-329.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objectives of this study were to estimate the environmental and additive and non-additive genetic effects on lactation curve and lactation parameters of crosses of Holstein (H), Brahman (B) and Brown Swiss (BS) in Olancho region in Honduras. The data consisted of 54,517 milk yield records from 192 dual-purpose crossbred cows lactating from 2000 to 2005 at the Universidad Nacional de Agricultura de Honduras (UNA). The lactation curve and lactation parameters of interest were the scaling factor to represent yield at the beginning of lactation (a), the factor associated with the inclining (b) and declining (c) slopes of the lactation curves, and the milk yield at initial day of lactation (MY ₂₀), peak milk yield (MY max), day at peak milk yield (t max), and the total milk yield (TM) per lactation, respectively. The incomplete gamma function (Wood function) was used to estimate lactation curve and lactation parameters from daily milk records of HxB, HxBS and BSxB crossbred cows. The environmental, additive and non-additive genetic effects on lactation curve and lactation parameters were estimated using Dickerson and Kinghorn models. The coefficients of determination of fitness of Wood's function (R ²) ranged from 80% to 97% with an average of 93%. The lactation curve of the crossbred cows was similar to those reported for dairy cows grazing in the tropics. Lactation parameters such as MY max, t max and TM were significantly (P <0.05) influenced by environmental sources of variation suggesting the necessity of differential management strategies. The moderate to large positive phenotypic correlation of MY max and TM indicate that one of the milk yield parameters could be used as a selection criterion to improve either one or both traits. Despite the fact that both genetic models showed similar patterns, the absolute value of the parameters varied. For both models, individual additive genetic breed effect for H breed were significant (P <0.05) and contributed more to TM than the BS breed. In the Dickerson model, highly positive significant (P <0.01) effect on TM for HxBS and BSxB crosses was found. The Kinghorn model did not show significant effects of dominance on this parameter. The estimate of recombination effect for all crosses involving B breed were negative and significant (P <0.05) for positive correlated lactation curve parameters. Although the inclusion of non-additive effects on crossbreeding genetic effects were not all significant for lactation curve and lactation parameters, non-additive effects should be taken into account to improve the Honduran dairy cattle production management. 3atemporal variation 3adairy cows 3alactation stage 3alactation curve 3agrazing 3atropics 3aphenotypic correlation 3aenvironmental factors 3agenotype 3aadditive gene effects 3acrossbreds 3agenetic variation 3amilk yield 3aHonduras 0afood animals 0acattle 0adual-purpose cattle1 aAlvarado, L.1 aKahi, A.K.1 aHirooka, H.0 tLivestock science.g2009 Sept., v. 124, no. 1-3 p.321-329dElsevierx1871-14137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2009.02.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02136naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245009400166300001600260520083800276650001301114650002101127650000701148650001201155650001801167650002101185650002501206650003501231650001801266650007001284650002401354650003101378650001301409650004001422653001401462653001101476653001401487700001801501700002201519773008201541852000901623939003301632946001301665655001201678IND9001161220221120034915.0900326e199002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900116122DNAL7 a24049522pmid7 aPMC2084942pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinakami, H.10aEffects of pH, glucose, and chelating agents on lethality of paraquat to Escherichia coli  ap. 691-695.  aRetention of paraquat by Escherichia coli B was greatest after exposure at pH 9.0 and was progressively less after exposure at pH 7.0 and 5.0, respectively. This retained paraquat was capable of persistent growth inhibition. Uptake and retention of paraquat by E. coli B was dependent upon a carbon source, such as glucose. Under comparable conditions E. coli K-12 did not retain paraquat. The lethality of paraquat was seen in TSY medium but not in VB medium. The addition of Soytone, tryptone, or yeast extract, to the VB medium allowed the lethality of paraquat to be seen. A variety of chelating agents, including EDTA, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and o-phenanthroline, prevented the lethal effect of paraquat in TSY medium. Although EDTA protected against the lethality of paraquat, it did not protect against its bacteriostatic effect. 3aparaquat 3aEscherichia coli 3apH 3aglucose 3aculture media 3achelating agents 2aBiological Transport 2aChelating Agentsxpharmacology 2aCulture Media 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aParaquatxmetabolismxpharmacology. 0aretention 0auptake 0alethality1 aKitzler, J.W.1 aFridovich, Irwin.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1990 Feb., v. 172, no. 2 p.691-695x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02541naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245007800178300001400256500001500270520140800285650002101693650002501714650001301739650001101752650001801763650002101781650001001802651001801812653001701830653001501847653001301862653002401875653001901899700001701918773009201935852000902027930003302036945002502069946001302094655001202107IND4391610420221123043546.0070523e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439161042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Owners can now deduct outright reforestation costs up to $10,000 per year for each qualifying timber property and amortize any additional amount over 8 tax years. To assess the financial benefit the new incentives provide to forest owners, the authors developed spreadsheets that calculate after-tax Bare Land Value (BLV) for a representative southern pine management plan under three tax situations: no reforestation incentives, the incentives under previous law, and the incentives under the current law. They found that compared to no tax incentive, the current law chiefly benefits owners with high non-timber income, increasing BLV by an amount equivalent to a reforestation cost share of roughly 25 to 30% as opposed to 5 to 15% for owners with low or median income. Compared to previous law, the current law chiefly benefits owners of large forest holdings, increasing BLV by an amount equivalent to a reforestation cost share of roughly 10 to 20%. For owners of small forest holdings, however, BLV decreased by an amount equivalent to a 5 to 10% increase in reforestation costs. These findings are significant as Congress likely intended that the new incentives continue to benefit primarly “small woodland owners” with modest incomes and forest holdings. 3aforest economics 3alaws and regulations 3aplanning 3aincome 3areforestation 3aprivate forestry 3ataxes 3aUnited States 0aspreadsheets 0acost share 0atax laws 0afinancial economics 0atax deductions1 aGreene, J.L.0 tSouthern journal of applied forestry.g2007 Feb., v. 31, no. 1 p.23-27x0148-44197nnas  aDNAL  a20070525b20070602c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/05/25  aOther US 7aarticle01663naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245008300161300001600244520075200260650001501012650001601027650001101043650001201054650001401066650001501080700001801095773020301113856004801316852000901364655001201373IND60628770420221123042739.0190130s1981    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062877042DNAL7 a10.1080/026266681094909022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGATTO, P.14aThe Lagoon of Venice: natural environmental trend and man-induced modification  ap. 379-391.  aThis paper describes factors which have modified the original equilibrium of the Venetian Lagoon ecosystem. Human intervention started in 1400 AD. During the last two centuries man's activity upset the hydraulic and physical-biological balance of the lagoon by digging canals, modifying port entrances, filling-in marsh areas and more recently withdrawing groundwater resources. This last occurrence has induced a serious land subsidence all over the territory which, coupled with the natural subsidence and a eustatic rising of sea level, has reduced the average height of the city above mean sea level by about 20%. This loss in elevation, equal to 22 cm, is the most responsible factor of the more and more frequent “acque alte” (flooding). 3aecosystems 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3amarshes 3asea level 3asubsidence1 aCARBOGNIN, L.0 tHydrological sciences journal.g1981, v. 26, no. 4 p.379-391dPublished for the International Association of Hydrological Sciences by Blackwell Scientific PublicationswJournal:2013x0262-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626668109490902  aDNAL 7aarticle02033naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245011100166300001800277520051700295650002900812650001800841650001700859650001500876650001200891650002000903650006700923650002900990650001601019650001301035650001301048650003801061650003801099650003201137650002001169650003201189650006601221653001501287700001601302700001901318700001701337700001701354700001701371773008401388852000901472939003301481946001301514655001201527IND9001161620221123042701.0900326e199002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900116162DNAL7 a21536542pmid7 aPMC2085472pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinney, A.J.10aRegulation of phospholipid biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase  ap. 1133-1136.  aThe addition of cyclic AMP (cAMP) to Saccharomyces cerevisiae cyr1 mutant cells resulted in an increase in the rate of phosphatidylinositol synthesis at the expense of phosphatidylserine synthesis.

The design and fabrication of a PMMS system are presented and the microfluidic separation system is characterized experimentally using human whole blood as the case study. The PMMS system can separate blood cells types continuously using the magnetophoretic force produced from a high magnetic field gradient without magnetic or fluorescent tagging. Experimental results demonstrated that red blood cell separation in the PMMS system at a volumetric flow rate of 28.8 μL / hr, resulting in a separation time of 10.4 min for a 5.0 μL blood sample with a separation efficiency of 89.5 ± 0.20%. The PMMS system was tested at higher volumetric flow rates of 50.4 μL / hr and 72.0 μL / hr. The measured separation efficiencies were 86.2 ± 1.60% and 59.9 ± 6.06% respectively. 0aHuman whole blood 0aCell separator 0aHigh Gradient Magnetic Field Separation (HGMS) 0aMagnetophoresis 0aMicrofluidic system1 aChoi, Yoonsu 1 aHan, Ki-ho.1 aFrazier, A.

Asgrow 3237, Pioneer 9273, and Pioneer 9342 soybean cultivars were planted into corn stubble at Urbana, Illinois in 1995 and 1996. Fungicide seed protectants increased soybean population density and reduced time to canopy closure in 1995, but had no effect in 1996. As seeding rates increased from 34.6 to 54.3 seeds m(-2), yields increased, and time to row canopy closure was decreased. In general, adequate weed control and soybean yields were maintained using reduced rates (greater than or equal to 0.5X) of herbicides. In 1996, the purple seed stain fungus, Cercospora kikuchii, was isolated more often from Pioneer 9273 seed and Asgrow 3237 seed harvested from the no-herbicide, weedy control plots compared to plots treated with herbicides. 3aGlycine max 3avarieties 3afungicides 3aherbicides 3ano-tillage 3aAbutilon theophrasti 3aAmaranthus 3aChenopodium 3aweed control 3aCercospora kikuchii 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3acrop management 3aapplication rate 3adisease control 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aIllinois 0aapplications 0atiming1 aWax, L.M.1 aEbelhar, S.A.1 aBollero, G.A.1 aPedersen, W.L.0 tCrop protection.g2001 Aug., v. 20, no. 7 p.615-622aCrop protection (Guildford, Surrey)x0261-21947nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02553naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100003000171245009400201300001600295520088800311650001901199650001801218650001501236650001201251650002001263650003101283650001801314650001501332650001301347650001901360650002001379650001301399650002001412650001301432650003801445650002601483650003401509650004101543650001301584650003201597653001601629653001701645653001101662653001901673653001801692700002001710773012401730852000901854856009201863930003301955946001101988655001201999IND4433504120221121082613.0100305e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443350412DNAL7 a197810082pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.02048.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCOVARRUBIAS, ALEJANDRA A.10aPost-transcriptional gene regulation of salinity and drought responses by plant microRNAs  ap. 481-489.  aIn the past few years, factors involved in abscisic acid signalling have been isolated and recognized as elements related to RNA metabolism, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is required for abiotic stress responses. Some of these factors can be linked to the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNA molecules that are important regulators of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by repressing mRNA expression. Here, we review the role of miRNAs in stress responses, highlighting recent advances in elucidating the role of individual miRNAs and efforts to identify stress-responsive miRNAs at a genome-wide level in different model plants. Complete understanding of miRNA action depends on the identification of its target transcripts, and recent developments in miRNA research indicate that they will be uncovered in the near future. 3aabiotic stress 3aabscisic acid 3abiogenesis 3adrought 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3amicroRNA 3aplant response 3aregulator genes 3asalinity 3astress response 2aDroughts 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMicroRNAsxmetabolism 2aPlantsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional 2aSalinity 2aSodium Chloridexmetabolism 0adehydration 0aDicer-like 1 0amiRNAs 0aRNA metabolism 0awater deficit1 aREYES, JOSÉ L.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2010 Apr., v. 33, no. 4 p.481-489dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.02048.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100305b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01489naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008000128300001600208520052000224650002000744650001500764650002500779650001800804650001500822650001700837651001000854700001700864700001700881700001700898700001900915700001600934773011100950852000901061930003301070945001301103946001101116655001201127IND2324931120221121082703.0020122e200109  xxk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232493112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrichar, W.J.10aSesame (Sesamum indicum L.) tolerance with various postemergence herbicides  ap. 685-689.  aField studies were conducted in weed free areas of south Texas from 1994 to 1997 to evaluate various postemergence (POST) herbicides for sesame tolerance and effects on yield.

Bromoxynil and bentazon reduced sesame plant height at two locations but has no effect on yield. 3aSesamum indicum 3aherbicides 3aherbicide resistance 3aphytotoxicity 3acrop yield 3aweed control 3aTexas1 aSestak, D.C.1 aBrewer, K.D.1 aBesler, B.A.1 aStichler, C.R.1 aSmith, D.T.0 tCrop protection.g2001 Sept., v. 20, no. 8 p.685-689aCrop protection (Guildford, Surrey)x0261-21947nnas  aDNAL  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02552naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245017200172300001600344520137000360650001501730650001901745650002301764650001801787650001401805650002201819653001601841653001501857653001101872700001501883700001801898700001401916773007801930852000902008856009202017930003302109945001302142946001102155655001202166IND2200918320221121062142.0991004e199902  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220091832DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.1999.00309.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomingues, P.M.10aCulture of the mysid, Mysidopsis almyra (Bowman), (Crustacea:Mysidacea) in a static water system: effects of density and temperature on production, survival and growth  ap. 135-143.  aThe effects of animal density and water temperature on the culture of the mysid, Mysidopsis almyra (Bowman), in a static water system were evaluated. An initial set of experiments tested the effects of mysid density on production. Densities of 25, 37.5, 50, 100 and 200 mysids L-1 were placed in trays with 20 L of sea water. Temperatures were maintained at 26 +/- 2 degrees C. A second set of experiments was conducted in the same system at three different temperatures (18 +/- 1, 22 +/- 1 and 26 +/- 2 degrees C) using a mysid density of 50 mysids L-1 (1000 mysids tray-1). All experiments had a duration of 30 days. The mysids in all trials were cultured at 20 +/- 2 per thousand salinity and fed Artemia nauplii enriched with marine fatty acids. There was a positive correlation between production and mysid densities up to populations of 100 mysids L-1; maximum production was 273 +/- 99 hatchlings day-1. At a population density of 200 mysids L-1, high mortality and low production were recorded 4 days after the start of the experiment. The experiments testing different temperatures showed that mysid production was higher at 22 +/- 1 degrees C, although this result was not significant (P>0.05). Growth rates and hatchling survival after 7 days were significantly higher (P<0.05) at 26 +/- 2 degrees C compared to survival and growth at 18 or 22 degrees C. 3aMysidopsis 3ashrimp culture 3apopulation density 3astocking rate 3amortality 3awater temperature 0agrowth rate 0aproduction 0agrowth1 aTurk, P.E.1 aAndrade, J.P.1 aLee, P.G.0 tAquaculture research.g1999 Feb., v. 30, no. 2 p.135-143x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.1999.00309.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03129naa a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245007000152300001600222520177600238650001602014650002302030650002002053650002402073650001402097650002202111650001002133650001202143650001002155650002502165650000902190650001102199650001102210650001102221650002502232650002702257650002402284650005202308700001602360700001502376700001602391700001402407700001602421700001702437773009602454852000902550939003302559945000802592946001102600655001202611991572346190742620221121062212.0930430e199303  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930014722DNAL7 a84583172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPietschnig, B.10aVitamin K in breast milk: no influence of maternal dietary intake  ap. 209-215.  aThere is limited information available on the vitamin K intake of lactating mothers, concentration of vitamin K1 in breast milk, and the effect of long-term vitamin K1 supplementation of lactating mothers on the vitamin K1 concentration in breast milk. In a randomized study, we followed 20 mothers who received a daily oral vitamin K1 supplement (average 88 micrograms, supplemented group) and 16 mothers receiving no supplement (control group) from 4 throughout 91 days postpartum. Maternal vitamin K intakes (weighed dietary intake) at 4-6, 25-29 and 87-91 days postpartum ranged between 73 and 1735 micrograms/day. Differences between the groups were statistically not significant. Average intake exceeded the recommended dietary intake for lactating women of 55 micrograms/day by 670%. In the supplemented group, mean breast-milk vitamin K1 concentrations (HPLC) at 5, 26 and 88 days postpartum were 1.73 (SD 0.74), 1.36 (SD 0.81) and 1.67 (SD 2.01) ng/ml, respectively. Corresponding values in the control group were 1.44 (SD 0.57), 1.68 (SD 0.70) and 1.78 (SD 1.05) ng/ml. The latter were not statistically different from values in the supplemented group. Mean daily vitamin K1 intakes of infants breast-fed by supplemented mothers were 0.69 (SD 0.42), 0.93 (SD 0.51) and 1.25 (1.53) micrograms, respectively on days 5, 26 and 88. Corresponding values in the control group were 0.69 (SD 0.30). 1.07 (SD 0.58) and 1.31 (SD 0.95) micrograms and were statistically not different from values in the supplemented group. Average vitamin K1 intakes corresponded to 7-13% of the recommended dietary intake of 10 micrograms/d for infants. We conclude that low-dose maternal vitamin K1 supplementation does not secure an adequate vitamin K1 intake for the breast-fed infant. 3abreast milk 3amaternal nutrition 3anutrient intake 3avitamin supplements 3avitamin K 3apostpartum period 3awomen 3ainfants 2aAdult 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMilk, Humanxchemistry 2aVitamin Kxanalysis 2aVitamin K 1xadministration & dosagexanalysis.1 aHaschke, F.1 aVanura, H.1 aShearer, M.1 aVeitl, V.1 aKellner, S.1 aSchuster, E.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1993 Mar., v. 47, no. 3 p.209-215x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01411naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245002600115300001600141520069900157650001700856650001900873650001200892650001100904650000900915650001700924650001200941653002300953773007000976852000901046939003301055945000801088946001301096655001201109991572345770742620221121062200.0850125e19840922xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850065482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aDiet and hypertension  ap. 671-673.  aRecent research findings concerning the association of dietary factors with hypertension are reviewed and discussed. Different studies have indicated that vegetarians have a lower blood pressure (BP) than omnivores. Higher BP has been associated with a lower Ca intake, while lower systolic BP (and systolic hypertension risk) has been associated with higher K and Na intakes; however, K intake does not seem to be a significant factor, while the negative Na (salt) intake-BP relation was explained by age (i.e., younger subjects with lower BP had a higher salt intake). Metabolic, epidemiological, and experimental animal data are considered with respect to the effect of Ca intake on BP.

The molecule crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with a = 10.441(2), b = 10.894(2), c = 24.686(4) angstroms, Z = 4. The molecule is flexible even in solid state; at 100 K two orientations of the benzyloxy group are present in the unit cell. Therefore, molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations were used to study its conformational changes. The results obtained were compared with experimental observations. The comparative analysis revealed that the two conformers detected in the crystal are different from the energetically favourable conformations in Me2SO solutions. Rotations about both C-N bonds affect the global molecular conformation. The beta-D-fuctopyranose moiety blocked with two dioxolane rings is the less flexible part of the molecule; in the solid state and in Me2SO-d6 it is in the skew conformation. 3aX-ray diffraction 3aMaillard reaction products 3asynthesis 3amolecular conformation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aspectral analysis1 aMilinkovic, V.1 aKidric, J.1 aPristovsek, P.1 aHorvat, S.1 aJakas, A.0 tCarbohydrate research.g1995 Dec. 27, v. 279 p.21-39x0008-62157nnas  aDNAL  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01345naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245003100115300001200146520046700158650001800625650001500643650001400658650001400672650001200686650001300698650001100711650001100722650001100733653001800744653001100762653001900773653001500792773008800807852001300895939003300908945000800941946001300949852000900962655001200971991572345560742620221121062109.0850807e198411  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850076432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aTooth decay is preventable  ap.

In northern Britain, the tephritid fly Tephritis conura has experienced a unique host-plant expansion, from the melancholy thistle Cirsium heterophyllum to the marsh thistle C. palustre. Here, we examine whether the incorporation of C. palustre in the repertoire of British T. conura flies has caused genetic divergence between populations infesting the old host and the novel host, and how British populations differ from populations infesting C. heterophyllum in continental Europe where C. palustre is not infested. No evidence for restricted gene flow among British C. palustre and C. heterophyllum flies was found. Significant differentiation between British and continental T. conura was found at only one allozyme locus, hexokinase, and caused by a new allele, Hex_95. Hexokinase is related to host-race formation in continental European flies infesting C. heterophyllum and C. oleraceum, and might be linked to loci determining host choice. Based on morphological and phenological data from previous studies, we suggest that T. conura in Britain has adapted to the novel host but that host-race formation is impeded by similar plant phenologies. 3aCirsium 3aTephritis 3adiet 3agene flow 3ahexokinase 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3aloci 3aphytophagous insects 2aAnimals 2aCirsiumxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aDipteraxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aIsoenzymesxgenetics 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aMale 3aUnited Kingdom 0aEngland1 aTritsch, Christian1 aSeitz, Alfred1 aJohannesen, Jes0 tGenetica.g2009 Sept., v. 137, no. 1 p.87-97dSpringer Netherlandsx0016-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-009-9353-3 7aarticle02645naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245014500134300001600279520156900295650002401864650002701888650001501915650001301930650003401943650002101977650002001998650003302018653001902051700002002070700002802090773011102118852000902229930003302238945001302271946001102284655001202295IND2325509520221121041409.0020220e200112  xxk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232550952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaraoglanidis, G.S.10aInfluence of fungicide spray schedules on the sensitivity of Cercospora beticola to the sterol demethylation-inhibiting fungicide flutriafol  ap. 941-947.  aA field experiment was conducted over a three-year period (1997-1999) to study the efficacy of several fungicide spray-schedules and their effects on the sensitivity of Cercospora beticola populations to the DMI fungicide flutriafol. Spray applications of flutriafol, either alone at the recommended dose, or at a reduced dose in mixtures with maneb, or in alternation with tank mixed fentin-acetate and maneb, were included in the spray programs. Applications of flutriafol at the recommended dose showed a significantly greater control efficacy in comparison with the other treatments, while applications of flutriafol alternated with tank mixed fentin-acetate and maneb showed lower efficacy in comparison with the remaining flutriafol treatments. Fungal populations from plots continuously treated with flutriafol, either alone at the full dose or at reduced dose with maneb, had lower sensitivity to flutriafol in comparison with populations from plots treated alternatively with flutriafol and tank mixed fentin-acetate and maneb. Repeated applications of flutriafol, at full or reduced doses, favoured the selection of highly resistant strains. Since applications of flutriafol in alternation with tank mixed fentin-acetate and maneb do not maintain a high level of disease control, the only available anti-resistance strategy would be the restriction of the number of flutriafol treatments, by applying them only when environmental conditions are favourable for disease development and by using alternative fungicides during the rest of the growing season. 3aCercospora beticola 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afungicides 3aspraying 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris 3aapplication rate 3adisease control 3aplant diseases and disorders 0afungus control1 aIoannidis, P.M.1 aThanassoulopoulos, C.C.0 tCrop protection.g2001 Dec., v. 20, no. 10 p.941-947aCrop protection (Guildford, Surrey)x0261-21947nnas  aDNAL  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle01895naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008900125300001600214520090800230650001701138650001001155650001001165650001301175650001701188650002101205650000901226650002301235650002301258651001801281653001101299653001601310700001801326773011101344852000901455930003301464945001301497946001101510655001201521IND2324931220221121041145.0020122e200109  xxk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232493122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKent, R.J.10aInfluence of flood depth and duration on growth of lowland rice weeds, Cote d'Ivoire  ap. 691-694.  aThe growth of weeds from the soil seedbank and sown Echinochloa colona and E. crus-pavonis was studied in relation to different water depths (0, 2 4 and 8 cm) and flood durations (2, 4 and 7 days in 7).

Microscopic and molecular (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis and Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization) techniques were used to determine which filamentous bacteria became dominant in lab scale reactors treating wastewater composed of different carbon sources. Molecular analysis indicated the presence of Sphaerotilus natans and Thiothrix-related organisms. Microscopy indicated the presence of Nostocoida limicola in some reactors. Sludge volume index increased as filament abundance increased. The detection level of DGGE analysis increased when the abundance levels of the filaments were high. Simultaneous application of traditional and molecular methods was effective, and highlighted the advantages and limitations of each method. Readily biodegradable substances favoured the growth of specific filaments in a mixed liquor environment. The origin of inoculum influenced which specific filamentous bacteria grew. The study shows the potential problems when using particular techniques, and highlights the need for multiple approaches when studying filaments. The study also provides more information on which filaments will grow under different carbon source conditions for a given inoculum. 3aSphaerotilus natans 3aactivated sludge 3abacteria 3abiodegradability 3acarbon 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3afluorescence 3ahybridization 3ainoculum 3amicrobial growth 3amicroscopy 3awastewater 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 0acarbon source 0aDGGE 0afilamentous bulking1 ade los Reyes III, F.L.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2009 Feb., v. 106, no. 2 p.682-691dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.04049.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090123b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02614naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009800126300001400224520159900238650002201837650001401859650002201873650002201895650002701917650002301944650001501967650002501982650002402007651001102031653001602042653002002058773010802078852000902186930003302195945001302228946001102241655001202252IND2327703620221121041154.0020625e200203  xxk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232770362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMundt, C.C.10aPerformance of wheat cultivars and cultivar mixtures in the presence of Cephalosporium stripe  ap. 93-99.  aWheat cultivars and cultivar mixtures were grown in commercial fields naturally infested with Cephalosporium gramanium. Thirteen treatments, including nine cultivars and four two-way cultivar mixtures, were replicated four times in 3 x 30 m plots in each of six experiments (two locations x three winter wheat seasons). Cephalosporium stripe was quantified by estimating the percentage of prematurely ripening heads (whiteheads) in each plot. There was little variation in percentage of whiteheads among club wheat entries, which were less susceptible than the common soft white winter wheats. Common wheat entries varied from highly susceptible to moderately resistant. One cultivar mixture significantly (P < 0.01) increased the percentage of whiteheads as compared to the mean of its component cultivars grown in pure stand in four of the six experiments; mixtures never significantly decreased the percentage of whiteheads. All four cultivar mixtures significantly reduced lodging in the one experiment where there was sufficient eyespot (caused by Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides) to cause lodging. Averaged over the six experiments, the four cultivar mixtures yielded 7.5, 6.9, 3.4, and -1.7% more than the means of their component cultivars grown in pure stand; the highest yielding club wheat and the highest yielding common wheat treatment were both cultivar mixtures. Cultivars varied in parameters of yield stability, with no obvious difference between susceptible and resistant cultivars. Cultivar mixtures demonstrated greater yield stability than did the individual cultivars. 3aTriticum aestivum 3acultivars 3agenotype mixtures 3aHymenula cerealis 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3acrop yield 3aconservation tillage 3avarietal resistance 3aOregon 0ainfestation 0ayield stability0 tCrop protection.g2002 Mar., v. 21, no. 2 p.93-99aCrop protection (Guildford, Surrey)x0261-21947nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02571naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002200167245008100189300001600270500002400286520111500310650001201425650001501437650001901452650001401471650001401485650002101499650002601520650002901546650001501575650001601590650002101606650002101627653001801648700002001666700002101686700002001707700002001727700002301747700001801770773011001788852000901898856008901907930003301996945002502029946001102054655001202065IND4432820620221121025832.0100216e20100211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443282062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2009.08.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3401 aMihailovic, Darka10aFunctionalization of polyester fabrics with alginates and TiO2 nanoparticles  ap. 526-532.  aIncludes references  aThis study was aimed to investigate the possibility of engineering the multifunctional textile nanocomposite material based on the polyester fabric modified with natural polysaccharide alginate and colloidal TiO2 nanoparticles. The multifunctionality of such nanocomposite material was evaluated by analyzing its UV protection efficiency, antibacterial and photocatalytic activity. The level of UV protection was verified by the UV protection factor (UPF) of polyester fabrics. Antibacterial activity of modified polyester fabrics was tested against Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanoparticles deposited on the polyester fabrics was followed by degradation of methylene blue as a model compound in aqueous solution. Modified polyester fabrics exhibited outstanding antibacterial activity and UV protection efficiency even after five washing cycles, indicating the excellent laundering durability. The total photodegradation of methylene blue was reached after 24 h of UV illumination and this ability was preserved and even enhanced after two consecutive cycles. 3afabrics 3apolyesters 3ananotechnology 3aparticles 3aalginates 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 3aantibacterial properties 3aphotolysis 3abiopolymers 3aEscherichia coli 3atextile finishes 0aUV protection1 aSaponjic, Zoran1 aRadoicic, Marija1 aRadetic, Tamara1 aJovancic, Petar1 aNedeljkovic, Jovan1 aRadetic, Maja0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2010 Feb. 11, v. 79, no. 3 p.526-532dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2009.08.0363Available from publisher's Web site  a20100305b20100403c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/03/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02939naa a2200529 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245009400152300001600246500002300262520137500285650001701660650001801677650002001695650002401715650002501739650001701764650000901781650001001790650002801800650001201828650001101840650002801851650004201879650002301921650005101944650001101995650004302006650002002049650002002069650005702089650001002146653002302156700002402179700001602203773010202219852001302321939003302334945000802367946001302375852000902388655001202397991572343970742620221121025849.0930419e199302  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930013652DNAL7 a84232832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEtherton, T.D.10aRecombinant bovine and porcine somatotropin: Safety and benefits of these biotechnologies  ap. 177-180.  aLiterature review.  aThis article reviews the literature about the safety and benefits of two recombinantly derived proteins, bovine somatotropin (bST) and porcine somatotropin (pST), that likely will be used in animal agriculture in the future. When administered to dairy cows, bST increases milk production per cow approximately 15% to 20% and improves productive efficiency approximately 10%. Administration of pST to growing pigs reduces carcass fat content by as much as 70% to 80% and improves productive efficiency 15% to 35%. Because meat is a major source of total fat and saturated fatty acids in the diets of human beings, pST will allow consumers to include leaner, more nutrient-dense pork in their diets and still meet current dietary guidelines. Although these biotechnologies have not yet received regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for commercial use, information published by the FDA, the National Institutes of Health, the US Congress Office of Technology Assessment, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, as well as an extensive body of scientific evidence, indicate that these products are safe for the consumer. Nonetheless, it is important that consumers understand the benefits and safety of these biotechnologies. Dietitians can play an important role in providing information to consumers about the safety and benefits of bST and pST. 3asomatotropin 3abiotechnology 3amilk production 3acarcass composition 3aanimal fats and oils 3ameat quality 3acows 3aswine 3ahuman health and safety 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aFood Contamination 2aGrowth Hormonexadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aHumans 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixanalysis 2aMeatxstandards 2aMilkxstandards 2aRecombinant Proteinsxadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aSwine 0aliterature reviews1 aKris-Etherton, P.M.1 aMills, E.W.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1993 Feb., v. 93, no. 2 p.177-180x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245007700170300001600247520126600263650001901529650002101548650002501569650002201594650001501616650001801631650001401649650001601663650001201679650000701691650001801698653002801716653001101744700001701755700001801772773007701790852000901867856009201876930003301968945001302001946001102014655001202025IND2201963820221121025854.0991214e199905  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220196382DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.1999.00332.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaguire, J.A.14aThe effect of transportation on the juvenile scallop Pecten maximus (L.)  ap. 325-333.  aAt the present time, there is little information concerning the effect of transport on the physiology of scallops. Therefore, the overall objective of this study was to use the adenylic energetic charge (AEC) as an indicator of stress in scallops. Three transport trials were carried out: dry transport in polystyrene boxes containing seaweed and transport by vivier lorry at various densities. Post-transport scallop mortality was low for all trials, but the AEC results showed that scallop stress was reduced when animals were transported by vivier truck compared with dry transport. AEC levels in scallops remained high after 24.75 h of vivier transport in trial 2 (0.54-0.69) and after 17 h of vivier transport in trial 3 (0.79-0.82), whereas after 12 h of dry transport in trial 1, AEC levels in the striated muscle had decreased to 0.42. Ammonia concentration increased throughout the trials but did not appear to affect scallop survival in the short term. In general, the results indicate that greater survival can be achieved over longer distances (greater than 17 h) and at higher densities by vivier truck. However, better stability of holding units within tanks and a method to regulate ammonia and pH levels are needed if greater densities are used. 3aPecten maximus 3aanimal transport 3adevelopmental stages 3aanimal physiology 3ametabolism 3astocking rate 3amortality 3amethodology 3aammonia 3apH 3awater quality 0along distance transport 0astress1 aCashmore, D.1 aBurnell, G.M.0 tAquaculture research.g1999 May, v. 30, no. 5 p.325-333x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.1999.00332.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02538naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011500129300001800244500002300262520159600285650002001881650001401901650001001915650001801925650001001943650002001953653001101973700001801984700001702002700001602019773011202035852000902147939003302156946001102189655001202200IND9201145220221121015937.0920227e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920114522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersen, C.P.10aOzone decreases spring root growth and root carbohydrate content in ponderosa pine the year following exposure  ap. 1288-1291.  aSummary in French.  aStorage carbohydrates are extremely important for new shoot and root development following dormancy or during periods of high stress. The hypothesis that ozone decreases carbohydrate storage and decreases new root growth during the year following exposure was investigated. Ponderosa pine seedlings (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) exposed to ozone in 1989 were harvested prior to shoot elongation (nongrowing seedlings) and following a root growth test (growing seedlings) in the spring of 1990 to evaluate starch and soluble sugar concentrations. Seedlings exposed to the highest ozone level had 34% less lateral root biomass and 65% less new root biomass the following spring. Exposure to 122 and 169 ppm-h (sum of hourly means, 24 h/day, over the exposure period) during the 1989 growing season resulted in significant decreases of carbohydrate pools examined in both nongrowing and growing seedlings the following spring. Starch concentrations were most affected: at the highest ozone level, there were decreases of 43 and 44% in coarse and fine roots, respectively, of nongrowing seedlings, and 50, 65, and 62% in coarse, fine, and new roots, respectively, of growing seedlings. The results suggest that (i) ponderosa pine seedlings exposed to 122 and 169 ppm-h ozone for one season have significantly less root starch reserves available just prior to and during bud break the following year and (ii) spring root growth is decreased following ozone exposure. The carry-over effects of ozone stress may be important in long-lived perennial species that are annually subjected to ozone. 3aPinus ponderosa 3aseedlings 3aroots 3acarbohydrates 3aozone 3astress response 0agrowth1 aHogsett, W.E.1 aWessling, R.1 aPlocher, M.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g1991 Aug., v. 21, no. 8 p.1288-1291wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03082naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245010700161300001600268500001500284520157100299650001901870650001801889650001001907650002301917650001401940650002101954650002001975650001901995650001702014650002002031650002102051650001102072650001802083650001502101653003302116653001302149653002402162653002802186700001702214700001802231700001602249700001702265773006802282852000902350856012202359930003302481945002502514946001302539655001202552IND4426421420221121015919.0090924e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442642142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHansen, N.E.10aRunoff Water Quality from Constructed Roadside Soils Receiving Large Volume-Based Compost Applications  ap. 793-800.  a2019-12-05  aRapid soil stabilization after construction in highway right-of-ways is important to limit erosion. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) developed methods for stabilizing constructed soils utilizing compost. Three of the methods are: compost manufactured topsoil (CMT), general-use compost (GUC), and erosion control compost (ECC). Volume- or depth-based compost amendments may promote stabilization by revegetation and thereby reduce runoff and sediment losses. The quantity of compost associated with the application rates may be a potential nonpoint source of dissolved and particulate nutrients. Runoff losses of dissolved and particulate-bound nutrients and particulate matter were observed during eight natural runoff events from soils on an 8.5% slope amended according to TxDOT specifications for CMT, GUC, and ECC. Composted dairy manure (CDM) was used to meet the specifications for the soil amendments. The addition of CDM increased soil test phosphorus (STP) and NO 3 -N concentrations above the critical nutrient level for Princess bermudagrass ( Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers). Although the STP and NO 3 -N concentration in soil was greatest in the ECC, the ECC was most effective at reducing both runoff and particulate mass loss. The reduced runoff volume from ECC kept total mass loses similar among ECC and CMT and GUC. The benefit of using the ECC was a reduction in runoff depth and particulate loss without greater overall nutrient losses, even though the ECC utilized 262% and 584% more CDM than the CMT and GUC amendments, respectively. 3asediment yield 3awater quality 3aroads 3asoil stabilization 3anutrients 3anitrate nitrogen 3asoil amendments 3aroadside soils 3adairy manure 3aerosion control 3acomposted manure 3arunoff 3awater erosion 3aphosphorus 0acompost manufactured topsoil 0acomposts 0ageneral use compost 0aerosion control compost1 aVietor, D.M.1 aMunster, C.L.1 aWhite, R.H.1 aProvin, T.L.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2009 , v. 52, no. 3 p.793-8007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=52&issue=3&conf=t&orgconf=t20093Available from publisher's Web site  a20091006b20091106c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/10/06  aOther US 7aarticle02864naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245008100142300001600223500001500239520158000254650001101834650002801845650002201873650000901895650001901904650003001923650001301953650001701966650001001983650002401993650001302017650002102030653002402051653001002075700001502085700001302100700002302113773006802136852000902204856012202213930003302335945002502368946001302393655001202406IND4426421320221121015908.0090924e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442642132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLing, T.Y.10aQuantifying Escherichia coli Release from Soil under High-Intensity Rainfall  ap. 785-792.  a2019-12-05  aBacterial loading in surface runoff can only be reasonably assessed or predicted with quantitative knowledge of the release of bacteria from the soil under different rainfall conditions. Most studies of bacterial movement were conducted under rainfall intensities of less than 44 mm h -1 . However, in the tropics, intensities higher than 44 mm h -1 are frequent. In this study, Escherichia coli release from the soil into surface runoff and its distribution in the soil under the impact of heavy rainfall (95 mm h -1 ) of different durations were investigated. Results of simulated heavy rainfall of different durations on gently sloping grass plots with spray-applied E. coli indicated that E. coli was released with relative ease, resulting in contaminated runoff. Runoff E. coli concentrations ranged from 2.09 log(CFU) mL -1 in 5 min simulated rainfall events to 4.45 log(CFU) mL -1 in 15 min simulated rainfall events. The first simulated rainfall events after spray applications produced the highest concentration of E. coli in the runoff. Runoff loss accounted for 0.001% of the total applied E. coli in 5 min rainfall events and 2.1% in 15 min rainfall events. Total solids explained 28% of the variation in the concentrations and 14% of the total loadings. E. coli concentration in the surface centimeter of the soil explained 80% to 89% of the variations in runoff concentrations and loadings with regression slope of less than unity. Such quantitative relationships have the potential to predict runoff E. coli concentrations under high-intensity rainfall events. 3arunoff 3abacterial contamination 3arainfall duration 3arain 3arain intensity 3anonpoint source pollution 3aspraying 3aturf grasses 3ahills 3arainfall simulation 3aAxonopus 3aEscherichia coli 0aAxonopus compressus 0aslope1 aJong, H.J.1 aApun, K.1 aWan Sulaiman, W.H.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2009 , v. 52, no. 3 p.785-7927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=52&issue=3&conf=t&orgconf=t20093Available from publisher's Web site  a20091005b20091106c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/10/05  aOther US 7aarticle02259naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001500142245007400157300001800231520108100249650001201330650001301342650001001355650001901365650002101384650001501405650002001420650002001440650001801460650002101478650001001499650000901509650002001518700002001538700001601558700001501574700002301589700001601612773009501628852000901723856008201732946001101814655001201825IND4442989320221121020954.0100924e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444298932DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2010001552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Kang10aElectroporation of micro-droplet encapsulated HeLa cells in oil phase  ap. 3175-3180.  aElectroporation (EP) is a method widely used to introduce foreign genes, drugs or dyes into cells by permeabilizing the plasma membrane with an external electric field. A variety of microfluidic EP devices have been reported so far. However, further integration of prior and posterior EP processes turns out to be very complicated, mainly due to the difficulty of developing an efficient method for precise manipulation of cells in microfluidics. In this study, by means of a T-junction structure within a delicate microfluidic device, we encapsulated HeLa cells in micro-droplet of poration medium in oil phase before EP, which has two advantages: (i) precise control of cell-encapsulating droplets in oil phase is much easier than the control of cell populations or individuals in aqueous buffers; (ii) this can minimize the electrochemical reactions on the electrodes. Finally, we successfully introduced fluorescent dyes into the micro-droplet encapsulated HeLa cells in oil phase. Our results reflected a novel way to realize the integrated biomicrofluidic system for EP. 3abuffers 3adroplets 3adrugs 3aelectric field 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrophoresis 3aelectroporation 3aencapsulation 3afluorescent dyes 3agenes 3aoils 3aplasma membrane1 aZhang, Mengying1 aChen, Shuyu1 aWang, Limu1 aChang, Donald Choy1 aWen, Weijia0 tElectrophoresis.g2010 Sept., v. 31, no. 18 p.3175-3180dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2010001553Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle01587naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245011500162300001800277500002400295520055100319650001800870650002400888650001200912650001000924650003700934650000900971650002700980650001401007700002001021700001801041700001801059773010301077852000901180856004801189655001201237IND4429682020221120173248.0091207e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442968202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-009-9843-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiao-Jun10aIsolation and characterization of ten new polymorphic microsatellite loci in the mud crab, Scylla paramamosain  ap. 1877-1878.  aIncludes references  aWe developed polymerase chain primers for ten microsatellite loci in the mud crab, Scylla paramamosain.

In order to utilize some of these resources, a method for preparing wet feed for Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., using a binder produced from seaweed, Ascophyllum nodosum L, was developed. The feed was formulated with offal from lean fish (haddock, Melanogrammus aeglefinus L., saithe, Pollachius virens L., pollack, Pollachius pollachius L., and cod, Gadus morhua L.) and fatty fish [mackerel, Scomber scombrus L., and argentine, Argentina silus (Ascanius)], fish meal extruded wheat, capelin oil, vitamin and mineral premix, astaxanthin, and seaweed binder. The feed was gellified in a solution of calcium chloride. Equipment for the production of such feed was developed and the feed tested on a large scale at a commercial salmon farm. As control, a high-fat, extruded, commercial dry feed was used. On a dry matter basis, the two feeds were comparable with respect to protein, fat and carbohydrate. Growth rates, appetite and feed conversion were similar for the two experimental groups. Fish fed dry feed seemed to be more active when handled before slaughter and had a higher incidence of skin damage than fish given wet feed. Chemical and sensory analyses of the fish showed no difference (P > 0.05) between the two groups. Fifty fish from each group were analysed for haemoglobin, protein, lysozyme, complement and haemolytic activity in the blood. There was a significantly higher level of lysozyme in the wet feed group than in the dry feed group, implying an immunostimulating effect of alginate. It was clearly shown that producers have an excellent opportunity to improve the utilization of the resources and decrease feed production costs in places where the natural conditions are favourable, i.e. locations where there is an integrated production of fish farming and processing of wild catch. 3aSalmo salar 3aimmunity 3alysozyme 3asensory evaluation 3afeeds 3acomplement 3afeed conversion 3aalginates 3ahemoglobin 3afood quality 3afeed intake 3afish 3ahemolysis 3aprotein content 3afish feeding 0askin 0adry matter 0agrowth 0afat 0ablood chemistry 0agrowth rate 0acarbohydrates 0aimmunostimulation 0alesions 0achemical composition1 aAustreng, E.0 tAquaculture research.g1998 June, v. 29, no. 6 p.397-401x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.1998.tb01146.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990503b19990512c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01963naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002600154245009100180300001600271500002400287520091100311650001101222650001201233650001301245650001201258650001401270650001101284650002301295650001201318650002301330650001301353650001101366650001101377773014701388852000901535856005701544655001201601IND4456231020221120162901.0110408e198805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445623102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1988.tb01130.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanard, M.q(Michel),10aSeasonal change in photoperiodic response of the larvae of the lacewing Nineta pallida  ap. 153-159.  aIncludes references  aLarvae of the lacewing Nineta pallida (Schneider), collected in the field during two seasons, from September to July, were reared in the laboratory under short-or long-day light conditions at 21 °C. In autumn and winter, artificial short days delayed the first ecdysis. The influence on the duration of the first instar was maximal (3.4 times longer) when the short days began at hatching time, and later regularly diminished. In spring, the second and third instars showed a reversed response so that the long days now increased the duration of development, although development took no more than 1.4 time as long as in short days. A similar effect appeared in field-collected third instars on and after mid June, reaching its maximum (1.8 time until the cocoon spinning) in July. This sort of photoperiodic effect on the larval development is new to the seasonal adaptation of the life cycle in insects. 3aautumn 3aecdysis 3ahatching 3ainstars 3alacewings 3alarvae 3alarval development 3arearing 3aseasonal variation 3aspinning 3aspring 3awinter0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1988 May, v. 47, no. 2 p.153-159dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw25849wJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1988.tb01130.x 7aarticle02743naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245011700148300001500265520145800280650001201738650001601750650002001766650002601786650000801812650001001820650001001830650002001840650001501860650001901875650001101894650001101905650000901916650001601925650002601941650001701967650001601984653001602000653002602016653002102042700001902063700001702082773008902099852000902188939003302197945000802230946001102238655001202249991572339600742620221120162944.0930430e199302  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930014642DNAL7 a83841712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHakala, P.10aGroup vs. individual weight reduction programmes in the treatment of severe obesity--a five year follow-up study  ap. 97-102.  aThe aim of the study was to compare group and individual weight reduction programmes in the treatment of severe obesity. The study population included 40 women and 20 men, mean age 41 years. The mean body mass index was 43.5 kg/m2 in women and 42.2 kg/ m2 in men. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups, one with group counselling (GC group) and the other with individual counselling (IC group). The treatment programme of the GC group consisted of a two-week weight reduction period in a rehabilitation centre followed by group sessions for two years. The programme of the IC group consisted of individual counselling and follow-up by a physician. The adherence rate of the follow-up examinations was 97% at two years and 88% at five years. In the GC group the mean weight reduction in women at three months and at one, two and five years was 15.6, 15.7, 5.4 and 2.1 kg and in men 14.9, 13.1, 1.8 and 3.0 kg, respectively. In the IC group the corresponding values for women were 8.4, 11.9, 10.4 and 3.4 kg and for men 17.0, 26.2, 15.6 and 12.9 kg. Self-reported and measured weights at the five-year follow-up were closely correlated (r = 0.99). Weight loss during the first three months predicted a good result at two and five years. The results showed that group counselling starting with an in-patient period led to rapid weight reduction, but a better and more sustained effect was achieved by individual counselling, especially in men. 3aobesity 3aweight loss 3adiet counseling 3along term experiments 3amen 3awomen 2aAdult 2aBody Mass Index 2aCounseling 2aDiet, Reducing 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxdiet therapy 2aTime Factors 2aWeight Loss 0acomparisons 0aindividual counseling 0agroup counseling1 aKarvetti, R.L.1 aRonnemaa, T.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g1993 Feb., v. 17, no. 2 p.97-102x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle04435naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245011800184300001600302500002400318520224800342650002202590650002302612650001302635650001002648650002502658650002602683650002102709650002102730650001602751650001802767650001302785650002202798650001602820650001202836650002202848650002502870650001202895650005002907650004602957650001203003650002703015650004403042650003803086650004403124650000903168650007803177650004803255650001603303650005703319700002903376700001803405700001803423700002403441700001903465700002203484700001703506700001603523700002203539700002003561773009903581852000903680856004803689655001203737IND4433065420221120152945.0100220e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443306542DNAL7 a195882642pmid7 a10.1007/s11248-009-9303-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColgan, Richard10aOptimisation of contained Nicotiana tabacum cultivation for the production of recombinant protein pharmaceuticals  ap. 241-256.  aIncludes references  aNicotiana tabacum is emerging as a crop of choice for production of recombinant protein pharmaceuticals. Although there is significant commercial expertise in tobacco farming, different cultivation practices are likely to be needed when the objective is to optimise protein expression, yield and extraction, rather than the traditional focus on biomass and alkaloid production. Moreover, pharmaceutical transgenic tobacco plants are likely to be grown initially within a controlled environment, the parameters for which have yet to be established. Here, the growth characteristics and functional recombinant protein yields for two separate transgenic tobacco plant lines were investigated. The impacts of temperature, day-length, compost nitrogen content, radiation and plant density were examined. Temperature was the only environmental variable to affect IgG concentration in the plants, with higher yields observed in plants grown at lower temperature. In contrast, temperature, supplementary radiation and plant density all affected the total soluble protein yield in the same plants. Transgenic plants expressing a second recombinant protein (cyanovirin-N) responded differently to IgG transgenic plants to elevated temperature, with an increase in cyanovirin-N concentration, although the effect of the environmental variables on total soluble protein yields was the same as the IgG plants. Planting density and radiation levels were important factors affecting variability of the two recombinant protein yields in transgenic plants. Phenotypic differences were observed between the two transgenic plant lines and non-transformed N. tabacum, but the effect of different growing conditions was consistent between the three lines. Temperature, day length, radiation intensity and planting density all had a significant impact on biomass production. Taken together, the data suggest that recombinant protein yield is not affected substantially by environmental factors other than growth temperature. Overall productivity is therefore correlated to biomass production, although other factors such as purification burden, extractability protein stability and quality also need to be considered in the optimal design of cultivation conditions. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3abiomass production 3acomposts 3adrugs 3aenvironmental impact 3afunctional properties 3aimmunoglobulin G 3anitrogen content 3aphotoperiod 3aplant density 3aplanting 3aprotein synthesis 3atemperature 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiomass 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aImmunoglobulin Gxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTemperature 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aAtkinson, Christopher J.1 aPaul, Matthew1 aHassan, Sally1 aDrake, Pascal M.

Four treatments contained 2.5 mg L(-1) cadmium (Cd): Cd alone;: Cd with 6.7 g L(-1) of compost manure made from the freshwater macrophyte Pistia stratiotes (L.); Cd with 1.0 g L(-1) of the same manure; and Cd with a cumulative treatment of the manure (1.0 g L(-1) month(-1)). Four treatments contained no Cd: the control (without manure); and treatments with only manure (6.7 g L(-1), 1.0 g L(-1) and 1.0 g L(-1) month(-1)). The concentration of dissolved (filterable) Cd in water ranged from 0.74 to 0.89 mg L(-1) after 24 h (one day) of treatment. The addition of manure significantly reduced the Cd concentration of the water and induced a quicker removal of Cd from the water. The quickest removal of Cd from water (60 days) was found when a high dose of compost manure (6.7 g L(-1)) was added. The cumulative (monthly) treatment and the one-time treatment of the manure at a low dose (1.0 g L(-1)) required 75 and 90 days, respectively, for removal of Cd, while the metal persisted for up to 120 days in water when no manure was added. All doses of compost manure significantly reduced the bioaccumulation of Cd in plankton, but maximum reduction was found under cumulative treatment at a low dose of the manure. A single treatment at a high dose or cumulative treatment at a low dose of the manure helped in reducing the total body burden of Cd. A dose of 2.5 mg L(-1) Cd did not show any adverse effect on the growth of fish, but compost manure, irrespective of its dose and combination with Cd, markedly increased the growth of fish and primary productivity of water. On the other hand, a high dose of manure resulted in much higher levels of NH3-N, NO2-N and PO4-P in the water in comparison with other treatments. 3awater pollution 3aplankton 3awater quality 3apollution control 3aapplication rate 3acomposts 3acarp 3acadmium 3abioassays 3anitrites 3aPistia stratiotes 3aphosphates 3abiomass production 3aammonium nitrogen 0achemical composition 0agrowth 0auptake1 aGhosal, T.K.0 tAquaculture research.g1998 Aug., v. 29, no. 8 p.555-561x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.1998.tb01167.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02883naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002700154245014600181300001600327500001500343520133800358650001201696650001801708650001901726650001101745650001601756650002001772650001001792650001601802650002001818650003001838650001401868650001101882650002401893650001101917650001901928650001201947651001101959653001501970653001201985653001401997653001102011700002602022700003002048700002502078773007802103852000902181856009402190930003302284945001302317946001102330655001202341IND2198171420221120131721.0990416e199808  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219817142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.1998.tb01170.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Cordova, L.R.10aEvaluation of three feeding practices on the winter culture of yellowleg shrimp, Penaeus californiensis (Holmes), in low water exchange ponds  ap. 573-578.  a2019-12-04  aThree different feeding practices, feeding tables (FTAs), feeding trays (FTs) and complementation of natural food (CNF), for the culture of yellowleg shrimp, Penaeus californiensis (Holmes), were evaluated in an experimental study conducted for 23 weeks in the winter season in Bahia Kino, Sonora, Mexico. Significant differences in growth, yield and feed conversion ratio were observed among treatments. The best individual weight gain (10.05 g) was obtained in the CNF treatment, followed by the FT (8.03 g) and FTA treatments (6.02 g). The mean survivals in the FT, CNF and FTA treatments were 56.3%, 60.4% and 62.6%, respectively. Yield was greatest in the CNF treatment, with a mean of 1415 kg ha(-1). The FT and FTA treatments had mean yields of 1212 and 1130 kg ha(-1) respectively. Feed conversion ratio was significantly better (P < 0.05) in the CNF (2.1:1) and FT treatments (2.3:1) than in the FTA treatment (2.9:1). Total food supply was greater in the FTA treatment (3288.3 kg ha(-1)) than in the CNF (3028.1 kg ha(-1)) and FT treatments (2811.8 kg ha(-1)). Significant differences in some of the water-quality parameters, such as morning dissolved oxygen, ammonia, biochemical oxygen demand, and organic matter in water and sediment, were observed between treatments. The FTA treatment showed the poorest water quality. 3aammonia 3awater quality 3aorganic matter 3awinter 3abody weight 3afeed conversion 3aponds 3amethodology 3aliveweight gain 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3amortality 3ayields 3adietary supplements 3aoxygen 3ashrimp culture 3aPenaeus 3aMexico 0aevaluation 0afeeders 0anutrition 0agrowth1 aPorchas-Cornejo, M.A.1 aVillarreal-Colmenares, H.1 aCalderon-Perez, J.A.0 tAquaculture research.g1998 Aug., v. 29, no. 8 p.573-578x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.1998.tb01170.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03335naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245021400173300001600387500001500403520197200418650002602390650000802416650001902424650002602443650001802469650001102487650002002498650002702518653002502545653002502570653002902595700002102624700001702645700001302662773007802675852000902753856009402762930003302856945001302889946001102902655001202913IND2198179720221120131711.0990416e199807  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219817972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.1998.tb01155.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Silva, S.S.10aChanges in proximate and amino acid composition during early development of two Australian Percichthyid fish, Macquarie perch, Macquaria australasica Cuvier, and trout cod, Maccullochella macquarensis (Cuvier)  ap. 459-467.  a2019-12-04  aIn the present paper, the results of a study on changes in the proximate and amino acid composition of the eggs and larvae of two Australian native Percichthyid fish, Macquarie perch, Macquaria australasica Cuvier, and trout cod, Maccullochella macquarensis (Cuvier), are presented. The stages of development studied were unfertilized and fertilized eggs, newly hatched larvae, and post-yolk-sac larvae (in Macquarie perch only). In Macquarie perch, significant changes in moisture content occurred throughout development, but this was not so in trout cod. The protein content (per cent dry weight) in Macquarie perch larvae only decreased significantly after hatching (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the total lipid (by dry weight) increased significantly during this transformation (P < 0.05), and decreased significantly in yolk-sac-resorbed larvae. In trout cod, the protein and lipid content did not change significantly up to hatching. The ash content increased significantly in newly hatched and yolk-sac-resorbed larvae of both species. The total amino acid contents of unfertilized eggs, fertilized eggs, newly hatched larvae and yolk-sac-resorbed larvae of Macquarie perch and trout cod were 5752, 4652, 3696 and 2723 micromole g-1 (dry weight), and 4688, 3448 and 2329 micromole g-1, respectively. In the amino acid pool in Macquarie perch, the essential amino acids (EAAs) leucine. isoleucine and valine, and the non-essential amino acids (NEAAs) alanine, aspargine and glutamate occurred in the greatest quantities in non-fertilized eggs, and the cysteine content was the smallest. In Macquarie perch, five out of nine EAAs (i.e. isoleucine, leucine, lysine, threonine and valine) and six out of eight NEAAs (i.e. alanine, asparagine, glutamate, glycine, proline and serine) decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from one developmental stage to the other. In trout cod, all the EAAs, barring lysine and all the NEAAs decreased significantly with development. 3aquantitative analysis 3aova 3aPercichthyidae 3aessential amino acids 3awater content 3alarvae 3aprotein content 3abiological development 0achemical composition 0adevelopmental stages 0anonessential amino acids1 aSheikh-Eldin, M.1 aIngram, B.A.1 aAn, H.P.0 tAquaculture research.g1998 July, v. 29, no. 7 p.459-467x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.1998.tb01155.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02402naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010200171300001600273520149400289650001201783650002201795650001701817650001601834650001901850650001501869650001301884773015601897856005002053852000902103655001202112IND60313041020221120132258.0150716s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031304102DNAL7 a10.5304/jafscd.2013.034.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorn, Branden M.,12aA Research Agenda for Food System Transformation Through Autonomous Community-based Food Projects  ap. 213-217.  aThe focus of much of the research that examines the food system coming from the planning and policy fields is empirical and reductionist, following a rational technocratic planning epistemology. One critical failing in this approach is a general reliance on the state and its close ties to capital through a global neoliberal economic philosophy that is entirely enmeshed with the food system. This research thus examines methodological approaches to identifying and measuring food deserts, "obesegenic" environments, and the like, and proposes solutions that tinker with the current system, such as the inclusion of grocery stores in food deserts. Such a research approach will not lead to a radical transformation of the food system. Those who seek a fundamentally different food system based on democratic and ecological principles need to look elsewhere for solutions. Fortunately, examples to study are everywhere once one knows what to look for. Following the theoretical work of Deleuze and Guattari, Virno, Graeber, and Holland, a five-year research design would begin to identify, understand, and determine how to assist and connect examples of community-based programs that collectively represent an exodus from the current food system. Such a program would need to recognize reformist ideas and research agendas while clearly delineating an alternative long-term strategy based in a distinctly oppositional, nonstate, radically democratic approach to building a new food system. 3acapital 3afood availability 3afood deserts 3afood policy 3agrocery stores 3aphilosophy 3aplanning0 tJournal of agriculture, food systems, and community development.g2013, v. 3, no. 4 p.213-217dNew Leaf Associates, Inc.wJournal:6226x2152-08017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5304/jafscd.2013.034.026  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008000129300001800209500002300227500001500250520149300265650002201758650002101780650001001801650002101811650001601832651001201848653001801860700001801878773011201896852000902008939003302017946001102050655001202061IND9201144420221120122559.0920227e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920114442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColenutt, M.E.10aDendrochronological investigation of Larix lyallii at Larch Valley, Alberta  ap. 1222-1233.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aTree-ring chronologies have been developed for alpine larch (Larix lyallii Parl.), alpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.), and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry) for a tree-line site at Larch Valley in Banff National Park. The alpine larch and alpine fir chronologies are the first published chronologies developed for these species in the Canadian Cordillera. Alpine larch, a deciduous conifer, has many very narrow and missing rings, making chronology development difficult. These problems were resolved by identifying common marker rings among species growing at the same site. Chronologies for all three species show suppressed growth in the early to mid 1800s followed by a period of higher growth that peaked in the early to mid 20th century and has since declined. The exact timing and nature of response to favourable and unfavourable growth conditions vary with species. Alpine larch exhibits the highest sensitivity, lowest first-order autocorrelation, and greatest common variance, suggesting it has excellent potential as a source of proxy climate data for tree-line sites in this area. Preliminary correlations between Lake Louise climate data and larch ring-width and maximum latewood density chronologies show that there are significant correlations with summer temperature variables. Engelmann spruce and alpine fir growing at the same site show a similar response but are more strongly influenced by precipitation and growing conditions of the previous year. 3aPicea engelmannii 3aAbies lasiocarpa 3aLarix 3adendrochronology 3atemperature 3aAlberta 0aprecipitation1 aLuckman, B.H.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g1991 Aug., v. 21, no. 8 p.1222-1233wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02216naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245010700172300001400279500001500293520086500308650001701173650001701190650002301207650001601230650002001246650001201266650001701278650001501295650001001310650002601320650002101346650001501367651001201382653002201394653001901416653001101435700001501446700002001461700001701481773007601498852000901574856009401583930003301677945001301710946001101723655001201734IND2198314220221120122611.0990423e199801  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219831422DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.1998.tb01099.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRothuis, A.J.10aRice with fish culture in the semi-deep waters of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam: a socio-economical survey  ap. 47-57.  a2019-12-04  aThe results of a socio-economical survey of farming systems practising rice culture with introduced fish, rice culture with indigenous fish and rice monoculture in the semi-deep waters of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, are presented. Rice and fish yields, inputs, and cost-benefits were computed to evaluate the agricultural effects of rice with fish culture. Household size, labour availability and educational level were not significantly different among the three farming systems. Rice-fish farming systems differed mainly from rice monoculture by a higher fertilizer/water requirement and less pesticide use. The total farm cash and net return did not differ among the farming systems. The main beneficial effects of rice-fish culture are thought to be related to environmental sustainability, system biodiversity, farm diversification and household nutrition. 3afish culture 3aOryza sativa 3aintroduced species 3afertilizers 3afarming systems 3asurveys 3abiodiversity 3acrop yield 3awater 3acost benefit analysis 3aapplication rate 3apesticides 3aVietnam 0aeconomic analysis 0asustainability 0ayields1 aNhan, D.K.1 aRichter, C.J.J.1 aOllevier, F.0 tAquaculture research.g1998 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.47-57x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.1998.tb01099.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02379naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004500092040001800137100001500155245013200170300001600302520117300318650002101491650001101512650001801523650001701541650001001558650002001568650001801588650002001606650001101626650002101637650001101658650001701669653002901686700001401715773007901729852000901808856009501817930003301912945001301945946001101958655001201969IND2198475520221120112828.0990503e199810  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219847552DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.1998.29100761.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, A.K.10aEvaluation of Chuni, a commercially available low-cost cattle fodder, in the diet for rohu, Labeo rohita (Hamilton, fingerlings  ap. 761-768.  aAn 80-day feeding experiment was conducted to evaluate the suitability of incorporation of Chuni, a commercially available low-cost cattle fodder, comprising cereal grains and leguminous seeds, into the practical diets for rohu, Labeo rohita (Hamilton), an Indian major carp, fingerlings (average weight = 6. 23 +/- 0.15 g). Four experimental diets, incorporating Chuni at levels of 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% into a fish-meal-based control diet (35% protein) were formulated, in terms of fish growth, feed conversion, protein efficiency ratio, apparent nutrient digestibility, and protein and lipid deposition in fish muscle, 10% Chuni incorporated diet showed the best performance of fish and was comparable to those with the control diet. However, the growth of fish was lower with higher levels of Chuni incorporation (20% or more), which resulted in poor nutrient digestibility. The present results indicate that Chuni could be used as a component in the supplementary diet for L. rohita fingerlings, partially substituting the fish-meal-based diet up to the extent of 10%, and it this is the first report on the use of Chuni as a dietary ingredient in diets for carp. 3afeed supplements 3aforage 3acost analysis 3afish feeding 3aseeds 3afeed conversion 3adigestibility 3aprotein content 3alipids 3abody composition 3agrains 3aLabeo rohita 0aprotein efficiency ratio1 aRay, A.K.0 tAquaculture research.g1998 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.761-768x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.1998.29100761.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02610naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004500092040001800137100002300155245014100178300001600319520124000335650001401575650002801589650001401617650002001631650001501651650002601666650002101692650001601713650002401729650001701753653001601770653002401786653001601810653002101826700002401847700002501871700002801896773007901924852000902003856009502012930003302107945001302140946001102153655001202164IND2198474220221120102157.0990503e199810  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219847422DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.1998.29100709.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlvera-Novoa, M.A.10aEffect of the use of the microalga Spirulina maxima as fish meal replacement in diets for tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters), fry  ap. 709-715.  aThe present study addresses the use of the microalga Spirulina maxima as a protein source in diets for tilapia. Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters), fry. Animal protein was replaced with algae protein at ratios of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%, and the substitution effect was compared with a control diet in which fish meal was the sole protein. An additional 100% spirulina protein diet was supplemented with phosphorous to test for possible mineral deficiency in the plant-protein-based diet. The six treatments were tested in triplicate in a closed-recirculating system where the fish were fed by hand at 6% of their body weight. Alter a 9-week feeding period, the growth rate and protein utilization of fish fed the diet with 20% and 40% Spirulina were elevated and not significantly different (P>0.05) from those fed the control diet. Further increases in the alga protein content significantly decreased the growth and feeding performance. The addition of P to the 100% Spirulina diet slightly improved performance in comparison to the same diet without P. None of the treatments produced any clear adverse effects on carcass composition. It is observed that Spirulina can replace up to 40% of the fish meal protein in tilapia diets. 3aSpirulina 3aOreochromis mossambicus 3afish meal 3adietary protein 3aphosphorus 3anutrient deficiencies 3afeed supplements 3afeed intake 3acarcass composition 3afish feeding 0aperformance 0aprotein utilization 0agrowth rate 0anutrient sources1 aDominguez-Cen, L.J.1 aOlivera-Castillo, L.1 aMartinez-Palacios, C.A.0 tAquaculture research.g1998 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.709-715x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.1998.29100709.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01970naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100004100110245013700151300001400288520091100302650002201213650001401235650002701249650001501276650001301291650002101304650003001325653001301355653001901368653001501387653001101402700002101413773010801434852000901542930003301551945001301584946001101597655001201608IND2328336920221120102219.0020802e200202  xxk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232833692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos Garcia de Paredes, B. de los.10aEffect of different fungicides in the control of Colletotrichum acutatum, causal agent of anthracnose crown rot in strawberry plants  ap. 11-15.  aColletotrichum acutatum, a causal agent of anthracnose of strawberry, produces wilting and plant death when it infects the crown. Symptoms of the disease appear after transplanting. Various fungicides were assessed for their ability to control this disease, under laboratory, greenhouse and field conditions. The effective dose causing 50% inhibition of mycelial growth (ED50) was 0.5, 1, 1 and 2 ppm for the fungicides propiconazole, bitertanole, imazalil and hexaconazole, respectively. In the greenhouse, disease incidence, tested on three strawberry cultivars, showed that propiconazole treatment reduced mortality (32-54%) but caused slight phytotoxicity in treated plants resulting in an abnormal plant growth. In field experiments over three years, dipping plants in aqueous fungicides suspension, carbendazim, bitertanole and thiabendazole, at transplanting reduced significantly disease incidence. 3aFragaria ananassa 3acultivars 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afungicides 3amycelium 3achemical control 3afungal diseases of plants 0aefficacy 0afungus control 0ainhibition 0agrowth1 aRomero Munoz, F.0 tCrop protection.g2002 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.11-15aCrop protection (Guildford, Surrey)x0261-21947nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02285naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014100126300001600267520109300283650002401376650001101400650002301411650002701434650001401461650002301475650001901498650003101517653001101548653001701559653002901576653002301605653002601628700001401654700001501668700001601683773011001699852000901809930003301818945001301851946001101864655001201875IND2327703820221120102158.0020625e200203  xxk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232770382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMancebo, F.10aBiological activity of two neem (Azadirachta indica A.

A randomized complete block design, with four replications, was used. H. grandella third instar larvae were exposed for 24 h to Cedrela odorata leaf discs dipped in several treatment dissolutions of each formulated product (0.1, 0.32, 1.0, 3.20, and 10%); afterwards, each larva was transferred to a flask containing artificial diet, where it was allowed to complete its development. Variables measured included food consumption (foliar area eaten in 24 h), mortality, and developmental effects (developmental time for each larval instar and the pupa, and pupal weight). No one of the substances present in both products showed antifeedant activity on H. grandella larvae. Instead, Azatin caused quick direct toxicity and Nim 80 acted as a growth disruptant, especially at the three highest concentrations (1.0, 3.20, and 10%) in both cases. In the case of Nim 80, larvae died because they were unable to get rid of their exuviae, when molting to the 4th instar. 3aHypsipyla grandella 3alarvae 3aAzadirachta indica 3abiological development 3amortality 3abiological control 3ainsect control 3aintegrated pest management 0aintake 0aformulations 0acommerical neem products 0adevelopmental time 0aleaf disk consumption1 aHilje, L.1 aMora, G.A.1 aSalazar, R.0 tCrop protection.g2002 Mar., v. 21, no. 2 p.107-112aCrop protection (Guildford, Surrey)x0261-21947nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle03916naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009500128300001600223500001500239520251800254650001802772650001202790650002402802650002302826650001702849650001802866650001802884650002102902650001702923650003702940650002402977650002803001650002003029650001503049651001003064651002503074653002103099653002103120653001903141653001603160700001503176700002403191700001703215700001503232773008503247852000903332930003303341945001303374946001103387655001203398IND2229523420221120081119.0010123e200006  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222952342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmendros, G.10a13C NMR assessment of decomposition patterns during composting of forest and shrub biomass  ap. 793-804.  a2019-12-05  aA laboratory experiment was designed to investigate the degradation patterns of leaves from 12 forest and shrub species typical of Mediterranean ecosystems by solid-state 13C NMR. The spectral data have been compared with those for the major organic fractions, and elementary composition in three transformation stages (zero time, intermediated and advanced (168 d)). The plant material in general showed a selective depletion of lipid and water-soluble products and a concentration in acid-insoluble residue (Klason lignin fraction), but the increasing percentage of total alkyl carbons (not observed in pine leaves) suggests that recalcitrant aliphatic material accumulates in the course of the 168 d incubation, when the total weight losses were up to 660 g kg-1. This contrasts with the fact that the concentration of extractable alkyl C (i.e. the lipid fraction) decreased in all cases. The results for the different plants suggested some general transformation trends simultaneous to specific biodegradation patterns. The non-ameliorant, soil acidifying species (i.e. those a priori considered to favor the accumulation of humus with low biological activity) have high initial concentrations of extractives, alkyl structures and comparatively lower percentages of O-alkyl structures. The decay process in these species is not associated to the increase of the alkyl-to-O-alkyl ratio, which is shown by the ameliorant species. Superimposed on these major trends, the biomass of the different plants underwent divergent paths in the course of composting, leading to, for example, (i) accumulation of recalcitrant, nonhydrolyzable alkyl and aromatic structures (Retama, Genista); (ii) enrichment of resistant O-alkyl structures such are stable fractions of carbohydrate and tannins (Pinus, Calluna); and (iii) accumulation of aliphatic extractives with the lowest stabilization of protein in resistant forms (Arctostaphylos, Ilex). In particular, in the acidifying species, the spectral patterns suggest that the apparent stability of the aromatic domain is compatible with selective preservation of tannins together with aliphatic structures. Such specific tendencies are also illustrated by the difference spectra (0 vs 168 d) which suggest that early humification processes are highly heterogeneous and distinct rather than the selective degradation of lipid and water-soluble fractions and carbohydrates, and they may include stabilization of tannins and aliphatic (cutin- and protein-like) macromolecules. 3aErica arborea 3aGenista 3aRetama sphaerocarpa 3aJuniperus communis 3ahumification 3aJuglans regia 3aPinus radiata 3aCalluna vulgaris 3aplant litter 3aQuercus ilex subsp. rotundifolia 3aJuniperus thurifera 3aArctostaphylos uva-ursi 3aIlex aquifolium 3acomposting 3aSpain 3aMediterranean region 0agenista scorpius 0acharacterization 0abiodegradation 0adegradation1 aDorado, J.1 aGonzalez-Vila, F.J.1 aBlanco, M.J.1 aLankes, U.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2000 June, v. 32, no. 6 p.793-804x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle02682naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011600168300001400284520155500298650002001853650001201873650002101885650001801906650001101924650001701935650002201952650001301974650001401987650001902001650001202020650001502032651001402047700003402061773015402095856005002249852000902299655001202308IND60313042920221120055727.0150716s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031304292DNAL7 a10.5304/jafscd.2014.042.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHicks, Kathryn10aEvaluating the South Memphis Farmers Market as a Strategy to Improve Access to Healthy Foods: Lessons from 2011  ap. 45-59.  aLimited access to fruits and vegetables is an issue for many low-income and minority neighborhoods and likely plays an important role in the development of health disparities. Local farmers' markets are a growing response to low-quality food environments, but can improve food security only if they are sustainable over the long term and broadly accessible to residents. The South Memphis Farmers Market emerged as one of the first actions from a participatory neighborhood planning and revitalization effort involving local nonprofits, neighborhood residents, and faculty and students from the University of Memphis in 2010, and maintains a local advisory committee to help tailor operational decisions to the neighborhood context. This paper is based on 2011 data from an ongoing mixed-methods evaluation of the market, designed to assess whether it is meeting the goals outlined in the neighborhood plan in terms of serving as an accessible source of fresh fruits and vegetables, and whether any changes to market policies are necessary to ensure its sustainability. This paper examines ethnographic data collected during participant observation in advisory committee meetings and during market hours, and quantitative data from an end-of-season survey of market shoppers. The analysis suggests that the market is expanding neighborhood access to produce, and that the guidance provided by the advisory committee has been essential to this success. It also highlights possible barriers to access and potential policy interventions to address them. 3adata collection 3afarmers 3afarmers' markets 3afood security 3afruits 3ahealthy diet 3aissues and policy 3aplanning 3araw fruit 3araw vegetables 3asurveys 3avegetables 3aTennessee1 aLambert-Pennington, Katherine0 tJournal of agriculture, food systems, and community development.g2014, v. 4, no. 2 p.45-59dNew Leaf Associates, Inc.wJournal:6226x2152-08017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5304/jafscd.2014.042.014  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008700127300001800214500001500232520165200247650001901899650002301918650001801941650002101959650001301980650002401993650003102017650002402048650001702072650002902089650002002118650002102138650001502159650001202174650002002186651001502206653003102221653002202252653001102274653003202285700002002317700001702337773008902354852000902443930003302452945001302485946001102498655001202509IND2243607120221120051101.0010312e200009  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND224360712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhalen, J.K.10aCarbon and nitrogen mineralization from light- and heavy-fration additions to soil  ap. 1345-1352.  a2019-12-05  aMineralization of C and N from soil organic matter (SOM) can be altered when natural ecosystems are transformed for food and fiber production. We examined C and N dynamics in adjacent long-term minimally disturbed and disturbed soils from agricultural and forest sites. Light and heavy fractions (LF and HF, respectively) of SOM were collected by physical density separation using sodium polytungstate. Aerobic C and N mineralization of soil (WS), soil plus HF (S + HF) and soil plus LF (S + LF) mixtures were determined. Between 0.8% and 1.7% of C and 0.3% and 1.2% of N from WS was mineralized after 28 days. The proportion of C mineralized from HF was negligible in all sites, suggesting that the HF component of soils could be a major sink for C storage in soils. Larger proportions of N from HF were mineralized in disturbed than minimally-disturbed soils, suggesting greater protection of N in the HF of disturbed soils. The proportion of C mineralized from LF ranged from -0.3% to 3.2%, and was not consistent with C mineralization dynamics from the HF component of soils. It appeared that, while the LF component of soil contained C that was chemically and, to a lesser extent, physically protected from decomposition, more C was potentially mineralizable from the LF than the HF component of the agricultural and forest soils examined. In most soils, LF additions resulted in N immobilization rather than N mineralization. Our results indicate that HF is the main source of potentially mineralizable N whereas LF is a potential sink for mineral N, regardless of land management practices, in the agricultural and forest soils we examined. 3amineralization 3aagricultural soils 3afractionation 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen 3asoil organic matter 3aorganic nitrogen compounds 3asoil microorganisms 3aforest soils 3adissolved organic carbon 3asilt loam soils 3asandy loam soils 3aseparation 3abiomass 3adisturbed soils 0aWashington 0adissolved organic nitrogen 0aorganic compounds 0acarbon 0aphysical density separation1 aBottomley, P.J.1 aMyrold, D.D.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2000 Sept., v. 32, no. 10 p.1345-1352x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20010501b20010507c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle01736naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011100168300001600279520083700295650001501132650001201147650001501159650001701174700002501191700002701216773015601243856005001399852000901449655001201458IND60313043620221120051210.0150716s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031304362DNAL7 a10.5304/jafscd.2014.042.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCallum, Doug10aCan Large Retailers Localize Supply Chains? A Case Analysis of the Challenges Facing One Canadian Retailer  ap. 163-176.  aExtensive access to a major Canadian retailer (referred to as the Company) provided an opportunity to understand more fully its challenges when buying local food. Many of the Company volume and quality requirements of vendors are difficult to meet because they require a scale sophistication that is typically absent for local growers. Particularly challenging are the needs to lengthen product life, coordinate transport, and aggregate supply. Liability associated with spoiled product is especially onerous for small growers. Using a value supply-chain framework (Stevenson & Pirog, 2008), we conclude that the steps taken by the retailer toward localization will not be successful without significant investments in product differentiation, the financial health of their supplier base, strategic alliances, and shared governance. 3agovernance 3agrowers 3apurchasing 3asupply chain1 aCampbell, Alissa Mae1 aMacRae, Roderick John,0 tJournal of agriculture, food systems, and community development.g2014, v. 4, no. 2 p.163-176dNew Leaf Associates, Inc.wJournal:6226x2152-08017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5304/jafscd.2014.042.015  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124072001700142072001700159100002200176245008300198300001400281500001500295520130500310650001301615650001501628650002701643650002301670650002101693650002201714650002701736650001501763650001701778650001301795650002801808650002201836650001001858650002301868650002201891650001801913650002501931650002201956650002201978650001602000650001402016651001002030653001902040653002502059700002302084700002902107700002402136773009302160852000902253856008202262930003302344945002502377946001102402655001202413IND4425920220221120034656.0090917s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442592022DNAL7 a10.3923/ppj.2009.32.412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The detailed description and taxonomic studies (using light and scanning electron microscopy) show that such an obligate parasite fungus (Puccinia pimpinellae) is autoecious microcyclic (uredinial-telial stage only). Among tested Apiaceae plants, the host range test proved the specificity of the rust fungus to anise. To the researcher's knowledge, this is the first investigated record of a rust fungus on Pimpinella anisum plants in Egypt. The effectiveness of some plant resistance elicitors and two active chitinase producers; Bacillus subtilis Bio4 and isolated Trichoderma harizianum CH4 (both of them recorded the highest clear zone/colony size ratio on chitin agar plates) in controlling anise rust disease and on growth and yield of anise were evaluated in two successive growing seasons. Spraying chitosan at 1000 ppm was the most potent in reducing Disease Severity (DS) and Incidence (DI) as well as improving plant height, chlorophyll content, inflorescence No. plant-1 (74.2 and 76), 1000-fruit weight (2.94 and 2.83 g) and anise yield (646.8 and 670.0 kg fed-1), during both seasons.

  1 aArafat, H.H.10aVariation of Lipopolysaccharide among the Three Major Agrobacterium Species and the Effect of Environmental Stress on the Lipopolysaccharide Profile  ap. 1-8.  a2019-12-05  aLipopplysaccharide (LPS) is a variable component among the bacterial species as wall as strains of a single species and this characteristic is helpful for discrimination between strains. However, we have only limited information about LPS variation and influence by environment in Agrobacterium strains. In this study, we analyzed variation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) among 34 Agrobacterium strains; 9 strains of A. tumefaciens, 15 strains of A. rhizogenes, 9 strains of A. vitis and one A. rubi strain. Most of the A. tumefaciens strains and every A. rhizogenes strains had high and low molecular weight LPS molecules (LPS I and LPS II, respectively). On the contrary, every A. vitis strains and two exceptional A. tumefaciens strains lacked LPS I but had a single LPS II band. The LPS profiles were stable phenotype in the Agrobacterium strains. Abiotic stresses such as high salinity, high and low pH and high and low temperature were given to representative strains in each species. Only a little alternation in the LPS profiles was observed under the stress conditions except the high temperature to LPS I. Cultivation at 35°C or higher resulted in a significant size reduction of LPS I in A. tumefaciens C58 strain down to the size similar to that of LPS II which attenuated the tumor formation. On the contrary, cultivation at the high temperature induced the exceptional A. tumefaciens strain MAFF 03-01001 to synthesize LPS I, which was absent at lower temperature in the strain. This phenomenon has never been observed so far at least in the family Rhizobiaceae. 3ainterspecific variation 3aacidity 3alipopolysaccharides 3aphenotype 3amolecular weight 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3astrain differences 3aambient temperature 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3aheat stress 3aalkalinity 3acold stress 3apathogen identification 3abiochemical pathways 3aphenotypic variation 3aRhizobium vitis 3asalt stress 0aspecies differences 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0aabiotic stress1 aTanaka, K.1 aSawada, H.1 aSuzuki, K.0 tPlant pathology journal.g2009, v. 8, no. 1 p.1-8wJournal:jnl4250891x1812-54257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3923/ppj.2009.1.83Available from publisher's Web site  a20091120b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/10/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02843naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245015200174300001400326520156500340650000901905650001101914650001601925650001201941650001901953650001601972650002401988650002302012650001002035650001202045650001302057650001302070650002002083650001302103650001202116651001002128700001602138700002402154700001802178773015402196856005002350852000902400655001202409IND60313045120221123043922.0150716s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031304512DNAL7 a10.5304/jafscd.2014.044.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJemison, John M. Jr.10aHow to Communicate with Farmers about Climate Change: Farmers' Perceptions and Adaptations to Increasingly Variable Weather Patterns in Maine (USA)  ap. 57-70.  aWhile dealing with weather variability has always been a source of stress for farmers, a generally warmer, wetter climate with the potential for increasingly intensive precipitation poses a threat to long-term farm viability. Knowing how farmers think about increasingly variable weather patterns (IVWP) is important for educators, agency staff, and others to learn how to work with producers on adaptation strategies to protect natural resources and prevent crop failure. In 2011, the University of Maine Cooperative Extension conducted focus group sessions with farmers from seven different commodity groups, five mixed farmer sessions, and two sessions with consultants, educators, and agency staff who work with growers to learn about grower perceptions of environmental changes, and to learn about changes they may be making to their farming operations to protect their operations from IVWP. Farmers discussed over 40 practices that could be construed as adaptation measures to buffer against IVWP. Fruit (apple and blueberry) growers spent the most time on the subject and expressed the most concern about the effects of IVWP, while dairy and potato growers spent the least. Given the divergence of opinion on the subject of climate change that Maine growers expressed, successful outreach education through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Cooperative Extension should likely emphasize short-term risk management, resilience, and stability of farm operations as opposed to communicating the need to adopt strategies based on climate change. 3aUSDA 3aapples 3ablueberries 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconsultants 3aextension education 3afarmers' attitudes 3afarms 3agrowers 3aoutreach 3apotatoes 3arisk management 3ateachers 3aweather 3aMaine1 aHall, Damon1 aWelcomer, Stephanie1 aHaskall, Jane0 tJournal of agriculture, food systems, and community development.g2014, v. 4, no. 4 p.57-70dNew Leaf Associates, Inc.wJournal:6226x2152-08017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5304/jafscd.2014.044.001  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008600125300001800211500001500229520147500244650002901719650002501748650001601773650002001789650002701809650002501836650002401861650001801885650001001903651001101913653001801924653001601942700001601958773008901974852000902063930003302072945001302105946001102118655001202129IND2243612420221123042224.0010312e200009  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND224361242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlsson, S.10aCharacterisation of bacteria in soils under barley monoculature and crop rotation  ap. 1443-1451.  a2019-12-05  aRhizobacterial populations on barley roots, originating from experimental fields with barley monoculture (MC) and crop rotation (CR), were analyzed for their fatty profiles. In the first part of the study, the profiles of 1188 isolates were statistically analyzed to identify clusters of bacteria with a possible high prevalence in MC or CR soil. One such cluster was found, termed Ps4-C4, with characteristically high contents of C12:1 3OH (9.8%) and an unidentified fatty acid with the equivalent chain length (ECL) of 12.35, which was provisionally named ECL12.35 (4.5%). Bacteria in Ps4-C4 were also rich in C10:0 3OH (8.3%) and C12:0 3OH (8.1%). The cluster consisted of 109 isolates, 86 from MC populations and 23 from CR, none of which could be identified by means of fatty acid analysis. In the second part of the study, fatty acid profiles of 240 microbial populations from the same fields were analyzed. Results showed higher relative contents of C12:1 3OH, ECL12.35, C10:0 3OH and C12:0 3OH in MC populations, which also had a high proportion of C12:0 2OH and C16:0. A detailed statistical analysis of the correlations between the fatty acids indicated that Ps4-C4 alone explained the higher portions of C12:1 3OH and ECL12.35 in populations from MC soil, while other bacterial groups are seem to have contributed to the elevated contents of C10:0 3OH and C12:0 3OH. Some common functional characteristics of bacteria in the Ps4-C4 cluster are also described. 3amedium chain fatty acids 3achemical composition 3arhizosphere 3aHordeum vulgare 3along chain fatty acids 3arhizosphere bacteria 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop rotation 3aroots 3aSweden 0asoil bacteria 0acommunities1 aAlstrom, S.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2000 Sept., v. 32, no. 10 p.1443-1451x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20010501b20010507c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle02741naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124072001700142072001700159100004700176245008100223300001400304500001500318520121800333650001801551650002701569650003301596650003201629650002201661650005201683650002201735650002301757650001201780650000801792650002601800650002301826650002201849650001201871653002201883653002701905653001901932700001701951700001401968773009301982852000902075856008202084930003302166945002502199946001102224655001202235IND4425920320221123042354.0090917s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442592032DNAL7 a10.3923/ppj.2009.42.522doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Out of the thirty six independently transformed lines developed from the three different genes and the mutants of MP and OVG, five lines were tested for resistance against CMV by challenge inoculations using three different concentrations (1:10, 3:10 and 5:10) of CMV macerated in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The transgenic lines exhibiting complete resistance remained symptomless even when re-inoculated with 1:10 concentration of virus. The level of viral RNA accumulation in inoculated leaves was significantly (at least 2-3 times) lower compared to the control untransformed plants. The upper leaves which were analysed for systemic spread of the infection had much lower levels of viral RNA accumulation compared to the inoculated leaves. Amongst the three genes and two mutant lines that were generated in this study, we found that the CP and MP genes were able to provide a better level of resistance to the plants compared to the overlapping gene. 3acoat proteins 3agenetic transformation 3aplant diseases and disorders 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3atransgenic plants 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aNicotiana tabacum 3adisease resistance 3amutants 3aRNA 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3amicrobial genetics 3avirus replication 3atobacco 0aoverlapping genes 0aviral movement protein 0aviral proteins1 aHanafi, N.M.1 aTan, S.L.0 tPlant pathology journal.g2009, v. 8, no. 2 p.42-52wJournal:jnl4250891x1812-54257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3923/ppj.2009.42.523Available from publisher's Web site  a20091125b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/11/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02933naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186100002700203245017600230300001800406520169700424650002502121650002902146650001102175650002102186650001902207650001602226650001602242650001402258700002102272773008402293852000902377856009202386930003302478945002502511946001102536655001202547IND4373576620221123020743.0050824e20050815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437357662DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2005.01323.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Zooplankton was more abundant in monoculture of L. stylirostris (1002 +/- 670 organisms (org.) L(-1)) than in monoculture of L. vannamei (470 +/- 37 org. L(-1)), and polyculture (321 +/- 188 org. L(-1)). The main zooplanktonic groups were polychaeta larvae, nauplii, copepods and polychaeta. Macrozoobenthos was more abundant in polyculture (6898 +/- 11 137 org. m(-2)) compared with monoculture of L. stylirostris (3201 +/- 350 org. m(-2)) and L. vannamei (2384 +/- 3752 org. m(-2)). The main benthic groups were copepods, polychaeta, ostracods, nematodes and insects. Differences in feeding habits were found between species and regimes. Litopenaeus vannamei showed to be a more voracious species and fed mostly on organic detritus and benthos in both culture regimes. Litopenaeus stylirostris had a more restricted sources of feed in the ponds. The major component in the stomach content of both species was detritus. Macroalgae, sand, exuvia, formulated feed, prey and microalgae were minor components for both species (<7%). Ingestion of formulated feed was <4% for L. stylirostris and was not detected for L. vannamei. The stomach repletion rates were larger for L. vannamei (55.6% and 48.8%) than for L. stylirostris (43.75% and 44.89%). Litopenaeus stylirostris grew better in polyculture (10.3 +/- 3.4 g) that in monoculture (9.0 +/- 3.8 g). Litopenaeus vannamei grew better in monoculture (16.1 +/- 4.8 g) than in polyculture (13.4 +/- 4.5 g). For both species, feed conversion ratio was lower in polyculture. 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aLitopenaeus stylirostris 3ashrimp 3afeeding behavior 3ashrimp culture 3azooplankton 3abody weight 3amortality1 aPena-Messina, E.0 tAquaculture research.g2005 Aug. 15, v. 36, no. 11 p.1075-1084x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2005.01323.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/09/01  aNon-US 7aarticle01838naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010900129300001800238500001500256520058100271650002100852650000900873650001600882650002800898650002100926650001500947650002300962650001700985650001601002650002301018650001201041650001501053650002701068653001701095653001401112653002301126653001201149700001701161700001901178700001601197773008901213852000901302930003301311945001301344946001101357655001201368IND2243610920221123020838.0010312e200009  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND224361092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatkin, E.L.J.10aIdentification of tolerance to soil acidity in inoculant strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii  ap. 1393-1403.  a2019-12-05  aThe acid-soil tolerance of six strains (WU95, NA3001, WSM409, TA1, NA3025 and NA3039) of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv.

The data from this study clearly identified strain WSM409 as a strain with outstanding potential for improving the production of clovers on acid soils. 3asoil inoculation 3apeat 3asandy soils 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3aseed inoculation 3aacid soils 3astrain differences 3aroot nodules 3aplate count 3apopulation density 3asoil pH 3anodulation 3aTrifolium subterraneum 0acolonization 0atolerance 0ainoculant carriers 0astrains1 aO'Hara, G.W.1 aHowieson, J.G.1 aGlenn, A.R.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2000 Sept., v. 32, no. 10 p.1393-1403x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20010501b20010507c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle03044naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126072001700144072001700161100001800178245010300196300001600299500001500315520125800330650002101588650001601609650002701625650001001652650002001662650003201682650002301714650003001737650002001767650001301787650002301800650003101823650001801854650003301872650001401905650002101919650005201940650002501992650002602017650002002043653002802063653002502091653003002116700001602146700001702162700001802179773009502197852000902292856008402301930003302385945002502418946001102443655001202454IND4426413620221123020804.0090924s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442641362DNAL7 a10.3923/ppj.2009.127.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKavousi, H.R.10aExpression of Phenylpropanoid Pathway Genes in Chickpea Defense Against Race 3 of Ascochyta rabiei  ap. 127-132.  a2019-12-05  aThe fungal disease, ascochyta blight, caused by Ascochyta rabiei is a major yield limiting factor of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) around the world. Expression analysis of genes induced in general defense response can provide clues to elucidate major defense mechanisms against pathogen infection in chickpea plants. The role of key phenylpropanoid pathway enzymes response to Ascochyta rabiei in chickpea was studied under greenhouse conditions using a reverse transcription and semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (SQ-PCR). Transcript accumulation of four genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), chalcon synthase (CHS), isoflavone reductase (IFR) and Flavanone 3-Hydroxylase (F3H) induced in response to race 3 of A. rabiei was compared in resistant and susceptible genotypes. Results obtained in this study showed that in resistant genotype all 4 phenylpropanoid pathway genes: PAL, CHS, IFR and F3H were rapidly up regulated 6 h after inoculation with race 3 of A. rabiei. However, transcripts of PAL and IFR genes were rapidly accumulated in both resistant and susceptible cultivars. Therefore, induction of key enzymes of phenylpropanoid pathway appeared to be an important defense mechanism of chickpea plants against A. rabiei. 3aphenylpropanoids 3afield crops 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3agenes 3aCicer arietinum 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3agenetic resistance 3afungal diseases of plants 3agene expression 3agenotype 3adisease resistance 3agene expression regulation 3amessenger RNA 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3achickpeas 3aAscochyta rabiei 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3abiochemical pathways 3aquantitative genetics 3aoxidoreductases 0aflavanone 3-hydroxylase 0aisoflavone reductase 0apolymerase chain reaction1 aMarashi, H.1 aMozafari, J.1 aBagheri, A.R.0 tPlant pathology journal.g2009, v. 8, no. 3 p.127-132wJournal:jnl4250891x1812-54257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3923/ppj.2009.127.1323Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/10/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03089naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100001900189245015900208300001600367500002400383520171700407650002402124650001002148650001602158650001502174650001002189650001402199650001702213650002102230650001402251650001602265650002502281650001702306700001602323700001702339773009202356852000902448856009302457930003302550945002502583946001102608655001202619IND4398423620221123004224.0071205e20071130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439842362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.09.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL400 0aM001 0aM1201 aEscaffre, A.M.10aMorphometric evaluation of changes in the digestive tract of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) due to fish meal replacement with soy protein concentrate  ap. 127-138.  aIncludes references  aEffects of the complete replacement of fish meal (FM) by soy protein concentrate (SPC) in high-energy diets (23 MJ kg- 1 gross energy) on intestinal and liver histology were investigated in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). We developed a novel morphometric method to quantify the changes at the macro- and micromorphology level. Fish were acclimatized to the diet for 90 d and were then fed 1.0 g kg BW- 1 d- 1 once per day for 14 d before 10 fish per diet were randomly sampled, 6 h after their last meal. Fold height, epithelium length, stroma proportion of the proximal and distal intestines were not affected by the diet. No significant diet effect was detected on the features of the valve in the distal intestine. Fold height was linked to epithelium length in the proximal and distal intestines and this relationship was not modified by FM replacement. Enterocyte height and width were lower in SPC-fed fish in the distal intestine, but in the proximal intestine their morphology was not affected by the diet. There was no diet effect on the number of cells infiltered between the enterocytes in the proximal and distal intestines. The enterocyte nucleus was closer to the apex in the proximal and distal intestines in SPC-fed fish, but the features of the nucleus were not affected by the diet. The mean hepatocyte volume was on an average 36% lower in SPC-fed fish and was positively correlated to the hepatosomatic index for fish fed this diet only. In conclusion, SPC used in the present study did not either cause inflammatory reaction of the gut nor affected the epithelium surface. We suggest that the modifications due to SPC are linked to variations in the metabolic status of the enterocyte. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3atrout 3amorphometry 3aintestines 3aliver 3ahistology 3afish feeding 3afeed composition 3afish meal 3asoy protein 3aprotein concentrates 3afish culture1 aKaushik, S.1 aMambrini, M.0 tAquaculture.g2007 Nov. 30, v. 273, no. 1 p.127-138dElsevier Pub.

The design of the device and its fabrication by a low cost CO₂ laser are discussed for intended applications. Under optimized conditions, the total binding capacity of HSA for bilirubin was determined as 16.3±1.4 mg/l00 mL human serum (n=3) and residual binding capacity for bilirubin 9.8 mg/l00 mL (n=3) in normal infants. To assess risk of hyperbilirubinemia, free bilirubin and residual binding capacity by HSA provide a better indicator than total bilirubin, as neonates with impaired bilirubin binding capacity could be detected. In addition, residual binding capacity provides an advanced indicator to predict the onset of hyperbilirubinemia before the appearance of free bilirubin. HSA down to 94 nL is used in each titration and a full assay of four titrations takes up 376 nL HSA, sufficient for newborns with HSA in microliter range. The device has shown capable to provide adequate margin of protection to detect an early rising level of bilirubin and impaired binding capacity prior to the onset of jaundice condition. 3abilirubin 3abinding capacity 3ablood serum 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectrophoresis 3ahumans 3ajaundice 3aneonates 3arisk 3atitration1 aNie, Zhou1 aFung, Ying Sing0 tElectrophoresis.g2010 Sept., v. 31, no. 18 p.3061-3069dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2009007493Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02248naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245010200162300001400264500002400278520110500302650001701407650002501424650001801449650002401467650002801491700001601519700001701535700001601552700001201568700001401580700001801594700001801612700001801630700001501648700001201663700001401675773009201689852000901781856004801790655001201838IND4432427020221123004319.0100205e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443242702DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-009-0052-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamasaki, Y.14aThe role of interactions between Prorocentrum minimum and Heterosigma akashiwo in bloom formation  ap. 33-44.  aIncludes references  aWe examined the growth and interactions between the bloom-forming flagellates Prorocentrum minimum and Heterosigma akashiwo using bi-algal culture experiments. When both species were inoculated at high cell densities, growth of H. akashiwo was inhibited by P. minimum. In other combinations of inoculation densities, the species first reaching the stationary phase substantially suppressed maximum cell densities of the other species, but the growth inhibition effect of P. minimum was stronger than that of H. akashiwo. We used a mathematical model to simulate growth and interactions of P. minimum and H. akashiwo in bi-algal cultures. The model indicated that P. minimum always out-competed H. akashiwo over time. Additional experiments showed that crude extracts from P. minimum and H. akashiwo cultures did not affect the growth of either species, but both strongly inhibited the growth of the bloom-forming diatom Skeletonema costatum. Further experiments showed that it was unlikely that reactive oxygen species produced by H. akashiwo were responsible for the inhibition of P. minimum growth. 3aProrocentrum 3aSkeletonema costatum 3agrowth models 3amathematical models 3areactive oxygen species1 aNagasoe, S.1 aTameishi, M.1 aShikata, T.1 aZou, Y.1 aJiang, Z.1 aMatsubara, T.1 aShimasaki, Y.1 aYamaguchi, K.1 aOshima, Y.1 aOda, T.1 aHonjo, T.0 tHydrobiologia.g2010 Mar., v. 641, no. 1 p.33-44dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-0052-y 7aarticle01434naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245010000115300001600215520060600231650001900837650001900856650002400875650002700899650001600926650001500942653001300957773008800970852001301058939003301071945000801104946001101112852000901123655001201132991572322430742620221122232520.0851211e198410  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850084172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aBreast-feeding modules for integration into the curriculum of health professionals.

Outlook 918 Acknowledgements 919 References 919 SUMMARY: Association mapping is rapidly becoming the main method for dissecting the genetic architecture of complex traits in plants. Currently most association mapping studies in plants are preformed using sets of genes selected to be putative candidates for the trait of interest, but rapid developments in genomics will allow for genome-wide mapping in virtually any plant species in the near future. As the costs for genotyping are decreasing, the focus has shifted towards phenotyping. In plants, clonal replication and/or inbred lines allows for replicated phenotyping under many different environmental conditions. Reduced sequencing costs will increase the number of studies that use RNA sequencing data to perform expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, which will increase our knowledge of how gene expression variation contributes to phenotypic variation. Current population sizes used in association mapping studies are modest in size and need to be greatly increased if mutations explaining less than a few per cent of the phenotypic variation are to be detected. Association mapping has started to yield insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits in plants, and future studies with greater genome coverage will help to elucidate how plants have managed to adapt to a wide variety of environmental conditions. 3aalleles 3aenvironmental factors 3agene expression 3agene interaction 3agenomics 3aheritability 3ainbred lines 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotypic variation 3apopulation size 3aquantitative trait loci 3aquantitative traits 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aGenomics 2aGenotype 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aReproducibility of Results1 aStreet, Nathaniel R.0 tnew phytologist.g2011 Mar., v. 189, no. 4 p.909-922dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03593.x 7aarticle01616naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115245007400133300001600207500001500223520039500238650002600633650001400659650002300673650001700696650002000713650001900733650001400752650001200766650003900778650004600817650001100863650002100874650002000895650002200915650004200937653002300979653001701002773007501019852001301094939003301107945000801140946001301148852000901161655001201170991572321070742620221122222505.0860109e198408  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860087652DNAL7 a64350422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL10aParenteral feeding no better than transpyloric feeding in the preterm  ap. 276-278.  a2019-12-04  aA literature review concludes that, in feeding preterm infants, parenteral feeding is not superior to transpyloric feeding.

New emphasis must be placed, therefore, on providing nutritional guidelines to the growing population of male food shoppers. Male shoppers tend to fall into a "good life" Hedonist class, seeking convenient low-cost appetizing foods and lacking concerns of nutritional risk factors (sugar, fat, cholesterol, salt, etc.). Men also are less likely then women to take multivitamin supplements and male joggers may display behavior characteristics similar to female anorexics.

Recently, however, there has been a concrete effort devoted to its substitution for other plasticizers such as polyadipates. ESBO is exploited particularly in food closure gaskets for metal lids used to seal glass jars and bottles. The closure gaskets form an airtight seal necessary to prevent microbiological contamination. Thus, there are potential uses for food sterilization and storage. Additionally, the main pathway of PVC degradation involves the elimination of HCl, which can react with the epoxy groups of ESBO to give mono-, polychlorohydrins and/or other cyclic derivatives. The European Food Safety Authority noted that not enough analytical and toxicological data exist to express a formal opinion on the significance for the health effects of such derivatives. At present in the scientific literature, there are only a few indicative results of direct measurements of ESBO derivatives and there are no official analytical methods available for the determination of chlorohydrins directly from foodstuffs. This study presents the first example of the analysis of commercial food sauces for the detection of ESBO-chlorohydrins (as methyl esters). The results are obtained by a dedicated development of an ultraperformance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) method. Sample preparation was based on the following main steps: organic extraction, transesterification and solid-phase extraction clean up. In particular, four isomers for 18-E-OHCl chlorohydrin and eight isomers for 18-2OHCl chlorohydrin were separated and identified. Different food sauces samples closed in glass jars with twist-off caps were subjected to qualitative determination, which yielded positive results for 18-E-OHCl, whereas no traces of 18-2OHCl were found.

The sample preparation is very simple; in fact, the oil samples are diluted without any chemical derivatization. A following statistical data treatment by general discriminant analysis (GDA) allows the determination of the olive oil cultivar.

A new kind of multi-mycotoxin immunoaffinity columns (IACs) available on the market (DZT MS-PREP®) was tested. A sensitive, selective and accurate method by high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry was developed, with electrospray ionization mass spectrometer operating in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, with negative-positive-negative ion switching. The method was used for the analysis of samples marked in Italy, in the frame of official monitoring plans. The advantages of combining IACs and LC-MS/MS technique are as follows: efficient removal of matrix interferences, simple chromatographic outline, high selectivity, low detection limits (DLs) and separation of a wide range of molecules with different physico-chemical properties in a single run. The method was studied on two different matrices, breakfast cereal and baby food, at contamination levels close to Regulation limits (EC) 1126/2007. The recoveries obtained (60-100%) fulfil the performance criteria required by Regulation (EC) 401/2006. The DL is 60 μg/kg for DON and 10 μg/kg for ZEA, T-2 and HT-2. Linearity range of the calibration curves is suitable for adult and baby food. 3aadults 3abreakfast cereals 3adeoxynivalenol 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainfant foods 3aionization 3amarkets 3amonitoring 3aphysicochemical properties 3asampling 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 3azearalenone 3aItaly1 aFerrari, Maria1 aBergamini, Cecilia0 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2010 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.1075-1080dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1076-51747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.18023Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02007naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014300126300001600269520107200285650002501357650002101382650002301403650001701426650002701443650001101470650002301481653001101504700001501515773008501530852000901615930003301624945001301657946001101670655001201681IND2321032920221122062316.0010516e200101  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232103292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerry, E.C.10aTemperature and soil moisture content effects on the growth of Lumbricus terrestris (Oligochaeta: Lumbricidae) under laboratory conditions  ap. 133-136.  aThe growth of Lumbricus terrestris was determined under varying temperatures and soil moisture contents under laboratory conditions. Our objective was to identify the optimum soil moisture or temperature that would aid in the reproduction of L. terrestris for inoculations in areas devoid of this species. A laboratory experiment using different growth chambers for temperature control with varying soil moisture contents was conducted at the National Soil Tilth Laboratory in Ames, IA. Five temperatures, three different soil moisture contents, and horse manure as a food source were selected and replicated 10 times. It was found that 30 degrees C were fatal to L. terrestris after 14 d and 25 degrees C after 182 d. Regardless of temperature, worms reared under high soil moisture content (30%) developed faster and increased in mass than those reared at 20 or 25% soil moisture content over 266 d. Optimum temperature and soil moisture content for mass rearing of L. terrestris was identified at 20 degrees C and at 30% soil moisture content for these Iowa soils. 3aLumbricus terrestris 3asoil temperature 3asoil water content 3amass rearing 3abiological development 3aweight 3alaboratory rearing 0agrowth1 aJordan, D.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2001 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.133-136x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle02616naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245007800130300001600208520154300224650002301767650002101790650001901811650001801830650003101848650002101879650001101900650002201911650002101933650001001954650002801964650002001992651001202012653001902024700002202043773008702065852000902152930003302161945001302194946001102207655001202218IND2321203920221122044124.0010524e200104  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232120392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHogh-Jensen, H.10aRhizodeposition of nitrogen by red clover, white clover and ryegrass leys  ap. 439-448.  aCorrect assessment of the rhizodeposition of N in grassland is essential for the evaluation of biological N2-fixation of legumes, for the total N balance of agro-ecosystems, and for the pre-cropping value of grasslands. Using a leaf-feeding technique by which plants were 15N labelled while growing in mezotrons in the field, the rhizodeposition of N by unfertilised red clover, white clover and perennial ryegrass growing in pure stands was shown to amount to 64, 71 and 9 g N m-2, respectively, over two complete growing seasons. The corresponding values for red clover and white clover growing in mixtures with ryegrass were 89 and 32 g N m-2, respectively. The rhizodeposited N compounds, including fine roots, constituted more than 80% of the total plant-derived N in the soil, and in all cases exceeded the amount of N present in stubble. In the mixtures of red clover-ryegrass and white clover-ryegrass and the pure stands of red clover, white clover and ryegrass, respectively, the rhizodeposition constituted a 1.05, 1.52, 1.26, 2.21 and 2.77 fold increase over the total N in the shoots harvested during the two production years. In pure stands and mixtures of clover, 84 and 92%, respectively, of this N derived from biological N2 fixation. It is concluded that rhizodeposition provides a very substantial input of N to the legume-based grassland systems with great consequences for ecosystem N balance and turnover. Furthermore, the amount of atmospheric-derived N in the rhizodeposits may exceed that in the harvested shoots. 3aTrifolium pratense 3aTrifolium repens 3aLolium perenne 3aroot exudates 3aorganic nitrogen compounds 3anitrogen content 3ashoots 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen balance 3aroots 3adry matter accumulation 3agrassland soils 3aDenmark 0amixed pastures1 aSchjoerring, J.K.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2001 Apr., v. 33, no. 4/5 p.439-448x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle02095naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001500178245006300193300001400256520095900270650001201229650002501241650002501266650001801291650001101309650002201320650001701342650002101359650002201380650002101402653002101423700001301444700001401457700001401471700001601485773007001501852000901571930003301580945002501613946001101638655001201649IND4374889820221122044117.0050930e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437488982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The methanolic extract (ME) and its four fractions of water (WtF), ethyl acetate (EaF), chloroform (CfF), and n-hexane (HxF) were prepared and then subjected to antioxidant evaluation. The results of both methods revealed that R. tuberosa possesses potent antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activities of the different fractions tested decreased in the order of EaF > CfF > ME > WtF > HxF according to the hydrogen peroxide-induced luminol chemiluminescence assay, and results were the same with the exception of the rank order of HxF and WtF according to the DPPH free radical-scavenging assay. The results provide useful information on the pharmacological activities associated with free radicals of this traditional folk remedy. 3aRuellia 3atraditional medicine 3aantioxidant activity 3afree radicals 3aassays 3achemiluminescence 3aantioxidants 3aherbal medicines 3aprotective effect 3afunctional foods 0aRuellia tuberosa1 aWu, A.B.1 aShieh, P.1 aKuo, D.H.1 aHsieh, C.Y.0 tFood chemistry.g2006 Jan., v. 94, no. 1 p.14-18x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060123b20060202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/01/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02098naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245006800159300001400227520116200241650001301403650002101416650002501437650002501462650001401487650002201501650001801523650001701541650001301558700001701571773007001588852000901658930003301667945002501700946001101725655001201736IND4374891320221122044125.0050930e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437489132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aToor, R.K.10aEffect of semi-drying on the antioxidant components of tomatoes  ap. 90-97.  aThree tomato cultivars (Excell, Tradiro, and Flavourine) grown under hydroponic conditions in a commercial greenhouse in New Zealand were semi-dried at 42 degrees C. The semi-dried tomatoes contained low levels of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural and were significantly (p < 0.05) darker (lower CIELAB L* values) and had a higher mean a*/b* value (1.6) than the fresh tomatoes (1.2). The mean total phenolics in the semi-dried samples of tomatoes (300 mg gallic acid equivalents, GAE/100 g dry matter (DM)) was significantly lower than that of fresh tomatoes (404 mg GAE/100 g DM). The mean total flavonoid, and lycopene contents in the fresh samples (206 mg rutin equivalents/100 g DM, 63 mg/100 g DM, respectively) also showed a significant decrease after semi-drying (179 mg rutin equivalents/100 g, 54 mg/100 g DM, respectively). Ascorbic acid content in fresh tomatoes (284 mg/100 g DM) decreased to 223 mg/100 g DM after drying. The total antioxidant activity of the semi-dried tomatoes (1783 micromole trolox equivalents antioxidant capacity (TEAC)/100 g DM) was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that of the fresh samples (2730 micromole TEAC/100 g DM). 3atomatoes 3adried vegetables 3aantioxidant activity 3afood nutrient losses 3acultivars 3aprotective effect 3aascorbic acid 3aantioxidants 3alycopene1 aSavage, G.P.0 tFood chemistry.g2006 Jan., v. 94, no. 1 p.90-97x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060123b20060202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/01/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02304naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001300127245008500140300001400225500001500239520122200254650001601476650002101492650001501513650001801528650001801546650001901564650001101583650002001594650001401614650002501628653003101653653002301684700001901707700002001726773007001746852000901816930003301825945002501858946001101883655001201894IND4374890520221122044242.0050930e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437489052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAmin, I.10aAntioxidant activity and phenolic content of raw and blanched Amaranthus species  ap. 47-52.  a2019-12-05  aThe study was aimed to determine the antioxidant activity (total antioxidant and free radical-scavenging activities) and total phenolic content of Amaranthus sp. The effects of different blanching times (10 and 15 min) on antioxidant activity and phenolic content were also studied. Four types of Amaranthus species locally known as spinach, namely 'bayam putih' (Amaranthus paniculatus) (BP), 'bayam merah' (Amaranthus gangeticus) (BM), 'bayam itik' (Amaranthus blitum) (BI) and 'bayam panjang' (Amaranthus viridis) (BPG), were selected. Total antioxidant activity of water-soluble components in raw spinach was in the order of BI approximately equal to BM approximately equal to BPG > BP, whereas free radical-scavenging activity was in the order of BI > BPG > BM > BP. The total phenolic contents of BM and BP were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than other samples. All the studied spinach species possessed different antioxidant activities and phenolic contents. Antioxidant activities and phenolic contents of all the spinach were in the order of raw > blanched 10 min > blanched 15 min. Blanching up to 15 min may affect losses of antioxidant activity and phenolic content, depending on the species of spinach. 3apolyphenols 3anutrient content 3aAmaranthus 3afood analysis 3afree radicals 3araw vegetables 3aassays 3anutritive value 3ablanching 3aantioxidant activity 0aradical scavening activity 0aphenolic compounds1 aNorazaidah, Y.1 aHainida, K.I.E.0 tFood chemistry.g2006 Jan., v. 94, no. 1 p.47-52x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060123b20060202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/01/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02920naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245005300144300001800197520185000215650001402065650001302079650002502092650001402117650002302131650001402154650001002168650001102178653001702189653001802206653001902224700001902243773007002262852000902332856012202341930003302463945002502496946001302521655001202534IND4426960420221122043422.0091009e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442696042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZawadzki, A.10aGlycerol Sensing in Biodiesel Using Turbidimetry  ap. 1261-1265.  aFree glycerol and total glycerol are the key quality parameters of biodiesel. Turbidity caused by emulsion formation when biodiesel is mixed with water was investigated as a method to sense free glycerol (FG) and bound glycerol (BG). Turbidity was measured as the absorbance at 600 nm. Six batches of biodiesel samples were spiked with 0%, 0.01%, 0.02%, and 0.03% of FG prepared with glycerol-ethanol solution. A small amount of deionized water was added, and the prepared sample was shaken in a shaker. The turbidity was measured at 3 min intervals at up to 27 min of shaking. Initially, the turbidity increased rapidly with shaking, but it soon leveled off. A linear relationship was found between FG and the square root of turbidity measured after 12 min of shaking (R 2 = 0.87). Although ANOVA showed a significant difference in mean measured turbidities with different levels of FG and BG, a mathematical relationship could not be derived relating BG to turbidity measurement. It is pointed out that the variation in turbidity could have come from unmeasured sterols rather than from BG itself. This method of predicting FG from turbidity was shown to be useful in screening biodiesel batches that need further glycerol removal through additional water washing or other techniques in a biodiesel production process. An absorbance value of less than 0.12 corresponded to an FG value of less than 0.02% with a 95% confidence interval. Four production samples of biodiesel showed that the absorbance limit of 0.12 is adequately conservative because the turbidity of the production samples was found to be slightly higher for the same amount of free glycerol compared to the spiked samples. This observation was ascribed to the presence of other impurities in the production samples, which were maintained at zero level for the control samples. 3abiodiesel 3aglycerol 3achemical composition 3aturbidity 3aanalytical methods 3aemulsions 3awater 3amixing 0aturbidimetry 0afree glycerol 0abound glycerol1 aShrestha, D.S.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2009 , v. 52, no. 4 p.1261-12657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=52&issue=4&conf=t&orgconf=t20093Available from publisher's Web site  a20091020b20091106c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/10/19  aOther US 7aarticle01766naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002000143245005400163300001600217520081900233650000901052650002001061650001101081650002101092650001501113650001501128700001701143700001701160773012501177852000901302856008301311930003301394946001301427655001201440IND4424858120221122002314.0090821e20090821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442485812DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11748812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuhlen, Michael10aExploring Dark Matter with Milky Way Substructure  ap. 970-973.  aThe unambiguous detection of dark matter annihilation in our Galaxy would unravel one of the most outstanding puzzles in particle physics and cosmology. Recent observations have motivated models in which the annihilation rate is boosted by the Sommerfeld effect, a nonperturbative enhancement arising from a long-range attractive force. We applied the Sommerfeld correction to Via Lactea II, a high-resolution N-body simulation of a Milky Way-sized galaxy, to investigate the phase-space structure of the galactic halo. We found that the annihilation luminosity from kinematically cold substructure could be enhanced by orders of magnitude relative to previous calculations, leading to the prediction of gamma-ray fluxes from as many as several hundred dark clumps that should be detectable by the Fermi satellite. 3acold 3agamma radiation 3amodels 3aparticle physics 3aprediction 3asatellites1 aMadau, Piero1 aSilk, Joseph0 tScience.g2009 Aug. 21, v. 325, no. 5943 p.970-973dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11748813Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03300naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245013400172300001800306520219500324650001102519653001402530653001802544653000902562653001502571653002602586700002002612700001802632700002002650700002302670773011202693852000902805856009202814930003302906946001102939655001202950IND4412728120221122002217.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441272812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3091.2008.00967.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPHELPS, RYAN M.10aThree-dimensional modelling and sequence stratigraphy of a carbonate ramp-to-shelf transition, Permian Upper San Andres Formation  ap. 1777-1813.  aThis study highlights three-dimensional variability of stratigraphic geometries in the ramp crest to basin of mixed carbonate-siliciclastic clinoforms in the Permian San Andres Formation. Standard field techniques and mapping using ground-based lidar reveal a high degree of architectural complexity in channellized, scoured and mounded outer ramp stratigraphy. Development of these features was a function of location along the ramp profile and fluctuations in relative sea-level. Deposition of coarse-grained and fine-grained turbidites in the distal outer ramp occurred through dilute and high-density turbidity flows and was the result of highstand carbonate shedding within individual cycles. In this setting, high-frequency cycles of relative sea-level are interpreted on the basis of turbidite frequency, lateral extent and composition. Submarine siliciclastic sediment bypass during lowstand cycles resulted in variable degrees of siliciclastic preservation. Abundant siliciclastic material is preserved in the basin and distal outer ramp as point-sourced lowstand wedges and line-sourced early transgressive blankets. In mounded topography of the outer ramp, siliciclastic preservation is minimal to absent, and rare incised channels offer the best opportunity for recognition of a sequence boundary. Growth of mounded topography in the outer ramp began with scouring, followed by a combination of bioherm construction, fusulinid mound construction and isopachous draping. Intermound areas were then filled with sediment and continued mound growth was prevented by an accommodation limit. Mound growth was independent of high-frequency cycles in relative sea-level but was dependent on available accommodation dictated by low-frequency cyclicity. Low-angle ramp clinoforms with mounded topography in the outer ramp developed during the transgressive part of a composite sequence. Mound growth terminated as the ramp transformed into a shelf with oblique clinoform geometries during the highstand of the composite sequence. This example represents a ramp-to-shelf transition that is the result of forcing by relative sea-level fluctuations rather than ecologic or tectonic controls. 3amodels 0aCarbonate 0aPermian Basin 0aramp 0aSan Andres 0asequence stratigraphy1 aKERANS, CHARLES1 aSCOTT, SAM Z.1 aJanson, Xavier.1 aBELLIAN, JEROME A.0 tSedimentology.g2008 Dec., v. 55, no. 6 p.1777-1813dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0037-07467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2008.00967.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03076naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245013400188300001600322520111500338650002401453650004401477650002501521650001501546650001401561650001501575650001901590650001601609650001701625650001401642650003701656650001501693650001101708650001401719650001201733650004001745650007401785650004401859650001401903650007701917650003801994650007702032650001402109651001202123651001202135700001602147700002502163700001602188700001702204773012002221852000902341856009202350930003302442946001102475655001202486IND4419490120221122002134.0090424e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441949012DNAL7 a193643862pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2761.2009.01041.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedersen, K.10aPhotobacterium damselae subsp. damselae, an emerging pathogen in Danish rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), mariculture  ap. 465-472.  aA selection of 16 field isolates of Photobacterium damselae from marine rainbow trout farms in Denmark was subjected to phenotypic and genotypic characterization and pathogenicity to fish. All isolates belonged to the subspecies damselae, being positive for haemolysis, motility and urease. There were considerable differences in haemolytic properties, some isolates presenting a broad zone of haemolysis and others only a narrow zone. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed a high diversity indicating that P. damselae subsp. damselae is an opportunistic, not clonal pathogen in Danish marine rainbow trout. Virulence of the strains to rainbow trout was highly variable with LD₅₀ values ranging from 3.9 x 10³ to 1.5 x 10⁸ cfu at 20 °C. The virulence was significantly higher at 20 °C than at 13 °C. The strains with the strongest haemolytic properties were the most virulent suggesting a strong involvement of haemolysin in the pathogenesis. The pathological changes were consistent with a bacterial septicaemia and the haemorrhages were more pronounced than for most other bacterial infections. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aPhotobacterium damselae subsp. damselae 3abacterial infections 3afish farms 3ahemolysis 3ahemorrhage 3alethal dose 50 3amariculture 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3asepticemia 3aurease 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxpharmacology 2aCommunicable Diseases, Emergingxmicrobiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aFish Diseasesxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aFisheries 2aGram-Negative Bacterial Infectionsxmicrobiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aOncorhynchus mykissxmicrobiology 2aPhotobacteriumxclassificationxdrug effectsxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aPhylogeny 3aDenmark 0aDenmark1 aSkall, H.F.1 aLassen-Nielsen, A.M.1 aBjerrum, L.1 aOlesen, N.J.0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2009 May, v. 32, no. 5 p.465-472dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2761.2009.01041.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090425b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03078naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245006700177300001800244520168100262650001801943650001801961650002201979650001902001650002302020650001802043650002202061650004402083650002302127650002202150650005802172650003102230650001602261650002302277650001602300650001902316653001002335773007802345852000902423856010702432930003302539945002502572946001102597655001202608IND4426698520221122002058.0091002e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442669852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aScotter, M.14aThe chemistry and analysis of annatto food colouring: a review  ap. 1123-1145.  aAnnatto food colouring (E160b) has a long history of use in the food industry for the colouring of a wide range of food commodities. The principal colouring component of annatto is the oil-soluble diapo carotenoid bixin, which is the methyl ester of the dicarboxylic acid norbixin and soluble in aqueous alkali. Bixin and norbixin, therefore, exhibit not only physicochemical properties normally associated with carotenoids, but also certain anomalous properties that have an impact on the stability, food colouring applications, and importantly the analysis of annatto. This review summarizes the key aspects of the structural determination of bixin (and norbixin) with special attention to cis-trans isomerization and how this links with its chemical structure, spectroscopic properties, and stability. The oxidative, thermal, and photo-stability of annatto and the subsequent implications for its use in the colouring of foods, food processing, and the analysis of foods and beverages are discussed along with important mechanistic, thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. The main analytical techniques used for the chemical characterization of annatto, i.e. spectrophotometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), chromatography (particularly high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)) and mass spectrometry are reviewed in detail and other methods are discussed. This links in with a review of the methods available for the detection and measurement of annatto in colour formulations and foods and beverages, which highlights the importance of the need for a good understanding and knowledge of the chemistry of bixin and norbixin in order to meet new analytical challenges. 3afood coloring 3aBixa orellana 3anatural additives 3aplant pigments 3achemical structure 3afood analysis 3achemical analysis 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3avolatile organic compounds 3aingredients 3afood contamination 3acarotenoids 3aplant extracts 0abixin0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2009 Aug., v. 26, no. 8 p.1123-11457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091020b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/10/16  aNon-US 7aarticle01951naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010800127300001600235520093800251650002201189650002101211650002501232650001401257650001401271650001501285650001801300650002001318651001601338653001701354653001901371700002001390700001601410773008501426852000901511930003301520945001301553946001101566655001201577IND2321025720221121175151.0010516e200102  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232102572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLean, K.L.10aIncreasing soil temperature to reduce sclerotial viability of Sclerotium cepivorum in New Zealand soils  ap. 137-143.  aA preliminary laboratory-based trial indicated Sclerotium cepivorum sclerotial viability could be reduced from >96-10.7% after 28 d at 20 degrees C and to 0% after 16 d at 30 degrees C.

  1 aJi, Jinhu10aFactors affecting the uptake of lead and copper in five wild mushroom species from Chengdu, China  ap. 1249-1255.  aA comparison was made of the lead and copper content of five wild-growing mushroom species. A significant variation in lead levels was found between caps and stalks in Lepista sordida. A clear difference between old and young fruiting bodies was found for copper contents in Coprinus atramentarius. Both lead and copper content were found to increase initially and then decrease with increasing fungal size of Coprinus atramentarius and Flammulina velutipes with asynchronous turning points. In Cortinarius cinnamomeus, the lead and copper content was significantly correlated with the NH4OAc/EDTA extractable fractions (Pb: r = 0.98; Cu: r = 0.96) in the topsoil rather than pH values, organic matter content, cation exchange capacity or even the total metal (except copper) levels (Cu: r = 0.99, p < 0.05). Additionally, soil-growing mushroom species seemed to accumulate copper similarly (BCF > 1.0), while variously excluding lead (BCF < 1.0), but both the metal concentrations are relatively low compared with relevant statutory levels or other reported values. 3amushrooms 3awild plants 3avarieties 3abioaccumulation 3alead 3acopper 3aenvironmental exposure 3aheavy metals 3asoil pollution 3afood contamination 3aBasidiomycota 3aChina1 aDai, Jiuzhou1 aZhang, Weiwei1 aXu, Heng0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2009 Sept., v. 26, no. 9 p.1249-12557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091020b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/10/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02191naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002100143245009600164300001700260520081300277650001201090650001801102650001301120650002301133650002301156650001101179650001001190650003301200650000901233650001701242700001901259700001901278700001601297700002201313700001801335700001901353700002101372700002401393700002101417700001901438773012601457852000901583856008301592930003301675946001301708655001201721IND4424858920221121142035.0090821e20090821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442485892DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11755502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuoka, Shuichi10aLoss of Function of a Proline-Containing Protein Confers Durable Disease Resistance in Rice  ap. 998-1001.  aBlast disease is a devastating fungal disease of rice, one of the world's staple foods. Race-specific resistance to blast disease has usually not been durable. Here, we report the cloning of a previously unknown type of gene that confers non-race-specific resistance and its successful use in breeding. Pi21 encodes a proline-rich protein that includes a putative heavy metal-binding domain and putative protein-protein interaction motifs. Wild-type Pi21 appears to slow the plant's defense responses, which may support optimization of defense mechanisms. Deletions in its proline-rich motif inhibit this slowing. Pi21 is separable from a closely linked gene conferring poor flavor. The resistant pi21 allele, which is found in some strains of japonica rice, could improve blast resistance of rice worldwide. 3aalleles 3ablast disease 3abreeding 3adefense mechanisms 3adisease resistance 3aflavor 3afungi 3aprotein-protein interactions 3arice 3astaple foods1 aSaka, Norikuni1 aKoga, Hironori1 aOno, Kazuko1 aShimizu, Takehiko1 aEbana, Kaworu1 aHayashi, Nagao1 aTakahashi, Akira1 aHirochika, Hirohiko1 aOkuno, Kazutoshi1 aYano, Masahiro0 tScience.g2009 Aug. 21, v. 325, no. 5943 p.998-1001dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11755503Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02924naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245007200168300001600240500002400256520173900280650001502019650001402034650001202048650001502060650002302075650001302098650002002111651002102131653003802152653003502190653002202225653001002247653002402257653002202281700001902303700002302322773011202345852000902457856004802466655001202514IND4441889620221121082613.0100827e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444188962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-010-0405-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrimbu, Bogdan M.12aA deterministic harvest scheduler using perfect bin-packing theorem  ap. 961-974.  aIncludes references  aThe use of heuristic techniques in forest planning has been promoted by the need to solve complex problems that cannot be solved using mixed integer programming. We proved that for merchantability standards ensuring the perfect bin-packing theorem (PBPT), the maximum volume that can be harvested annually equals the sum of the maximum MAI of the stands. The method accommodates optimality criteria at the stand level, regarded as maximum MAI, and at the forest level, regarded as maximum annual allowable cut. We scheduled the harvesting by adjusting the first fit decreasing algorithm (FFD) to the PBPT conditions. When PBPT conditions were not met, we developed a mixed integer programming solution to adjust the merchantability standards of the stands to the distributional requirements of the PBPT, an adjustment that ensured the optimal performance of the FFD. The adjusted FFD was compared with linear programming (LP) and simulated annealing (SA) using two harvesting ages (i.e., one based on MAI maximization and one determined as the minimal age) and the same set of spatial temporal constraints for three areas in north-eastern British Columbia, Canada. We found that the adjusted FFD performed 100 times faster than SA and for annual allowable cut (AAC) supplied results that were more homogenous and at least 10% greater than the AAC supplied by SA. Furthermore, the adjusted FFD seemed to be relatively insensitive to spatial constraints (i.e., adjacency), while SA displayed a 70% reduction in AAC in response to an increase in adjacency delay from 1 year to 20 years. The results suggest that both adjusted FFD and SA are impacted by the selection of the harvesting age, but the adjusted FFD could still outperform SA. 3aalgorithms 3aannealing 3aforests 3aharvesting 3alinear programming 3aplanning 3aproblem solving 3aBritish Columbia 0aMaximum volume harvested annually 0aFirst-fit decreasing algorithm 0aAdjacency/greenup 0aDelay 0aSimulated annealing 0aLinear programing1 aInnes, John L.1 aStrimbu, Victor F.0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2010 Sept., v. 129, no. 5 p.961-974dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-010-0405-0 7aarticle01575naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245007300130300001300203500002300216520078400239650000901023650001301032650001301045650001201058650002501070650001501095653002301110773006501133852000901198939003301207945000801240946001301248655001201261991572304100742620221121082633.0880401s1986    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870033762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpring, B.10aEffects of foods and nutrients on the behavior of normal individuals  ap. 1-47.  aLiterature review.  aA detailed critical review summarizes and discusses current findings on the effects of foods and food constituents on the behavior of normal children and adults, highlighting consistencies and contradictions in the published literature.

Maternal vitamin D status is thought to influence musculoskeletal health in children, but its relation with offspring metabolic risk is not known. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the association between maternal vitamin D status and anthropometric variables, body composition, and cardiovascular risk markers in Indian children. DESIGN: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were measured at 28-32 wk gestation in 568 women who delivered at Holdsworth Memorial Hospital, Mysore, India. Anthropometric variables, glucose and insulin concentrations, blood pressure, and fasting lipid concentrations were measured in the offspring at 5 and 9.5 y of age. Muscle-grip strength was measured by using a hand-held dynamometer at age 9.5 y. Arm-muscle area was calculated as a measure of muscle mass. Fasting insulin resistance was calculated by using the homeostasis model assessment equation. RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of women had vitamin D deficiency [serum 25(OH)D concentration <50 nmol/L]. At ages 5 and 9.5 y, children born to vitamin D-deficient mothers had smaller arm-muscle area in comparison with children born to mothers without deficiency (P < 0.05). There was no difference in grip strength between offspring of women with and without vitamin D deficiency. At 9.5 y, children of vitamin D-deficient mothers had higher fasting insulin resistance than did children of nondeficient women (P = 0.04). There were no associations between maternal vitamin D status and other offspring risk factors at either age. CONCLUSION: Intrauterine exposure to low 25(OH)D concentrations is associated with less muscle mass and higher insulin resistance in children.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3alipid content 3amothers 3awomen 3aglucose 3aequations 3ahospitals 3amuscles 3arisk factors 3adynamometers 3abody composition 3apregnancy 3achildren 3avitamin D 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin 3avitamin deficiencies 3ablood pressure 2a25-Hydroxyvitamin D 2xblood 2aAdult 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weights and Measures 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxbloodxepidemiology. 2aChild 2aChild Development 2aChild, Preschool 2aCohort Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulin Resistance 2aMale 2aMaternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aMuscle Strength 2aNutritional Status 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Trimester, Thirdxblood 2aRisk Factors 2aVitamin D Deficiencyxbloodxepidemiology. 3aIndia 0aIndiaxepidemiology. 0arisk1 aVeena, Sargoor R.1 aWinder, Nicola R.1 aHill, Jacqueline C.1 aNoonan, Khatoon.1 aBoucher, Barbara J.1 aKarat, Samuel C.1 aFall, Caroline HD0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2011 Mar., v. 93, no. 3 p.628-635dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.110.0039213Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02915naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245010600159300001500265500002400280520153100304650005001835650001701885650000801902650002301910650001201933650001701945650002101962650000901983650001201992650001302004650003102017650001102048651001002059653000902069653001402078653001202092653003202104653002702136700001202163700001902175700002102194700001602215700001202231773012102243852000902364856004802373655001202421IND4413769720221121051439.0081212e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441376972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-007-0142-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDutta, C.10aMixing ratios of carbonyls and BTEX in ambient air of Kolkata, India and their associated health risk  ap. 97-107.  aIncludes references  aMixing ratios of 15 carbonyls and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylenes) were measured for the first time in ambient air of Kolkata, India at three sites from March to June 2006 and their photochemical reactivity was evaluated. Day and nighttime samples were collected on weekly basis. Formaldehyde was the most abundant carbonyl (mean concentration ranging between 14.07 μg m⁻³ to 26.12 μg m⁻³ over the three sites) followed by acetaldehyde (7.60-18.67 μg m⁻³) and acetone (4.43-10.34 μg m⁻³). Among the high molecular weight aldehydes, nonanal showed the highest concentration. Among the mono-aromatic VOCs, mean concentration of toluene (27.65-103.31 μg m⁻³) was maximum, closely followed by benzene (24.97-79.18 μg m⁻³). Mean formaldehyde to acetaldehyde (1.4) and acetaldehyde to propanal ratios (5.0) were typical of urban air. Based on their photochemical reactivity towards OH· radical, the concentrations of the VOCs were scaled to formaldehyde equivalent, which showed that the high molecular weight carbonyls and xylenes contribute significantly to the total OH-reactive mass of the VOCs. Due to the toxic effect of the VOCs studied, an assessment for both cancer risk and non-cancer hazard due to exposure to the population were calculated. Integrated life time cancer risk (ILTCR) due to four carcinogens (benzene, ethyl benzene, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) and non-cancer hazard index for the VOCs at their prevailing level were estimated to be 1.42E-04 and 5.6 respectively. 3aBTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) 3aacetaldehyde 3aair 3aat-risk population 3abenzene 3aformaldehyde 3amolecular weight 3arisk 3atoluene 3atoxicity 3avolatile organic compounds 3axylene 3aIndia 0aBTEX 0aCarbonyls 0aKolkata 0aHydroxyl radical reactivity 0aHealth risk assessment1 aSom, D.1 aChatterjee, A.1 aMukherjee, A.

One of the plots is called “Manhattan plot” and offers an alternative way of presenting explained variances, while the “Hiding plot” provides information about how the different axes in the consensus space are related to the original measurements. Correlation loadings plots exhibit correlations between the common scores acquired from the consensus matrix and the variables in the original multi-way data. For the computation of the consensus matrices we propose a new tool that bridges Generalised Canonical Analysis and Tucker-1 by defining intermediate combinations of the two. This is accomplished by altering a parameter in a more general model that covers these two methods. Three-way sensory profiling data from cheese are used as input for this general model to compute consensus matrices at different values for the parameter. External validation is pointed out as a useful tool for indicating which of the two statistical methods is most appropriate for computing a consensus matrix representing all assessors. 3amathematical models 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3adata collection 3asensation 3afood quality 3amodel validation 3acheeses 3amultivariate analysis 0adescriptions1 aTomic, O.1 aWold, J.P.1 aNaes, T.0 tFood quality and preference.g2008 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.103-113dElsevier Science Pub.

Unfortunately, for many species this information is lacking. Here we use multiple approaches (phylogenetics, population genetics and ecological modelling) to evaluate the evolutionary history and conservation status of Capra walie, an endangered flagship species of wild goat endemic to Ethiopia. The analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b and Y-chromosome DNA sequences suggests that C. walie forms a monophyletic clade with Capra nubiana, but potentially has been isolated for up to 0.8 million years from this closely related species. Microsatellite DNA analyses show that C. walie has very low genetic variation (mean heterozygosity=0.35) compared with other endangered mammals. This reduced variation likely derives from a prolonged demographic decline and small effective population size. Ecological niche modelling using the bioclimatic features of habitats occupied by C. walie, suggests ecological differences between C. walie and C. nubiana, and identifies the areas most suitable for future reintroductions of C. walie. The genetic and bioclimatic data suggest that C. walie is distinct and requires immediate conservation actions including genetic monitoring and reintroductions to establish independent populations. This study illustrates how combining noninvasive sampling along with genetic and ecological (bioclimatic) approaches can help assess conservation status of poorly known species. 3aCapra 3aDNA 3aY chromosome 3aconservation status 3acytochrome b 3aecological genetics 3aflagship species 3agenetic variation 3agoats 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amonophyly 3aniches 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation size 3aEthiopia 0aconservation unit 0aY-chromosome 0anoninvasive sampling 0apopulation decline 0arealized niche1 aFicetola, G.F.1 aNaderi, S.1 aRezaei, H.-R.1 aMaudet, C.1 aRioux, D.1 aLuikart, G.1 aFlagstad, Ø.1 aThuiller, W.1 aTaberlet, P.0 tAnimal conservation.g2009 Apr., v. 12, no. 2 p.89-100dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1367-94307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2009.00238.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02920naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002800164245006800192300001600260520127900276650001701555650002501572650001701597650002901614650000901643650001701652650000901669650001501678650001901693650001401712650001701726650004001743650004101783650004001824650003801864650002401902650001101926650004401937650002001981651001102001653002502012653001802037653002002055700002602075700002702101773011202128852000902240856008502249930003302334946001102367655001202378IND4395045020221121051853.0070916e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439504502DNAL7 a177013632pmid7 a10.1007/s11130-007-0052-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDa Silva Pinto, Marcia 10aBioactive Compounds and Antioxidant Capacity of Strawberry Jams  ap. 127-131.  aStrawberries represent the main source of ellagic acid derivatives in the Brazilian diet. They are also good sources of flavonoids, mainly anthocyanins, and phenolic acids, to which many beneficial effects have been attributed. However, as the fruit is not available all the year, the objective of this work was to determine whether the jams could also represent a good source of bioactive compounds. In the current study, five different commercially available strawberry jams were characterized in relation to flavonoids, total phenolics, free and total ellagic acid contents, and antioxidant capacity. Anthocyanins were detected only in two jams at very low content. Kaempferol glycosides were the main flavonoids present (from 0.38 to 1.05 mg/100 g fresh weight, FW), while quercetin glycosides were present in the range 0.14-1.20 mg/100 g FW. Free and total ellagic acid content ranged from 0.4 to 2.9 mg/100 g FW, and from 17.0 to 29.5 mg/100 g FW, respectively. Total phenolics varied from 58 to 136 mg/100 g FW, and the antioxidant capacity from 0.55 to 0.76 μmol BHT (Butylhydroxytoluene) equivalents/g FW. Overall, results indicated that jams can also represent a good source of antioxidant compounds, although compared to the fruit important losses seem to occur. 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3adiet 3aellagic acid 3ajams 3akaempferol 3aphenolic acids 3aquercetin 3astrawberries 2aAntioxidantsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aEllagic Acidxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aFlavonoidsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aFragariaxchemistry 2aHumans 2aHydroxybenzoatesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aNutritive Value 0aBrazil 0aAntioxidant capacity 0aEllagitannins 0aStrawberry jams1 aLajolo, Franco Maria 1 aGenovese, Maria Inês.0 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2007 Sept., v. 62, no. 3 p.127-131dBoston : Springer USx0921-96687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-007-0052-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070916b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02520naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245005700169300001600226500001500242520128900257650001101546650001801557650001901575650001101594650001901605650002301624650002201647650002001669650001001689651001401699653001801713700001801731700001701749700001801766700001501784773015401799852000901953856009201962930003302054946001102087655001202098IND4422047720221121051907.0090619e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442204772DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8489.2009.00460.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConnor, Jeff10aImpacts of climate change on lower Murray irrigation  ap. 437-456.  a2019-12-04  aThis article evaluates irrigated agriculture sector response and resultant economic impacts of climate change for a part of the Murray Darling Basin in Australia. A water balance model is used to predict reduced basin inflows for mild, moderate and severe climate change scenarios involving 1, 2 and 4°C warming, and predict 13, 38 and 63% reduced inflows. Impact on irrigated agricultural production and profitability are estimated with a mathematical programming model using a two-stage approach that simultaneously estimates short and long-run adjustments. The model accounts for a range of adaptive responses including: deficit irrigation, temporarily following of some areas, permanently reducing the irrigated area and changing the mix of crops. The results suggest that relatively low cost adaptation strategies are available for a moderate reduction in water availability and thus costs of such a reduction are likely to be relatively small. In more severe climate change scenarios greater costs are estimated. Adaptations predicted include a reduction in total area irrigated and investments in efficient irrigation. A shift away from perennial to annual crops is also predicted as the latter can be managed more profitably when water allocations in some years are very low. 3abasins 3aprofitability 3acost estimates 3amodels 3aclimate change 3adeficit irrigation 3airrigated farming 3aeconomic impact 3acrops 3aAustralia 0awater balance1 aSchwabe, Kurt1 aKing, Darran1 aKaczan, David1 aKirby, Mac0 tAustralian journal of agricultural and resource economics.g2009 July, v. 53, no. 3 p.437-456dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-985X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8489.2009.00460.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090619b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04021naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245016700191300001800358500002400376500001500400520184900415650001902264650001002283650001102293650000802304650001902312650002402331650002502355650003702380650001302417650001802430650001902448650001102467650001102478650001202489650002202501650001102523650001902534650001102553650001102564650001802575650002602593650001902619650002002638650002702658650001202685650002202697650001402719650002302733650002002756650001902776650002902795650002402824650002402848650001202872650002202884651001202906651001102918651002802929651001102957653001502968653001802983700002503001700002803026700002003054773011303074852000903187856005503196655001203251IND4381644620221121041404.0060703e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438164462DNAL7 a168980132pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01520.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKEITEL, CLAUDIA10aCarbon isotopic composition and oxygen isotopic enrichment in phloem and total leaf organic matter of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) along a climate gradient  ap. 1492-1507.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study investigated the influence of climate on the carbon isotopic composition (δ¹³C) and oxygen isotopic enrichment (Δ¹⁸O) above the source water of different organic matter pools in European beech. In July and September 2002, δ¹³C and Δ¹⁸O were determined in phloem carbohydrates and in bulk foliage of adult beech trees along a transect from central Germany to southern France, where beech reaches its southernmost distributional limit. The data were related to meteorological and physiological parameters. The climate along the transect stretches from temperate [subcontinental (SC)] to submediterranean (SM). Both δ¹³Cleaf and Δ¹⁸Oleaf were representative of site-specific long-term environmental conditions. δ¹³C of leaves collected in September was indicative of stomatal conductance, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and radiation availability of the current growing season. Δ¹⁸O was mainly correlated to mean growing season relative humidity (RH) and VPD. In contrast to the leaves, δ¹³Cphloem varied considerably between July and September and was well correlated with canopy stomatal conductance (Gs) in a 2 d integral prior to phloem sampling. The relationship between δ¹³C and Δ¹⁸O in both leaves and phloem sap points, however, to a combined influence of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity on the variation of δ¹³C along the transect. Δ¹⁸Ophloem could be described by applying a model that included ¹⁸O fractionation associated with water exchange between the leaf and the atmosphere and with the production of organic matter. Hence, isotope signatures can be used as effective tools to assess the water balance of beech, and thus, help predict the effects of climatic change on one of the ecologically and economically most important tree species in Central Europe. 3aorganic matter 3atrees 3acarbon 3asap 3avapor pressure 3ameteorological data 3astomatal conductance 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aisotopes 3acarbohydrates 3aphotosynthesis 3aoxygen 3aleaves 3aclimate 3arelative humidity 3amodels 3aclimate change 3aphloem 3acanopy 3afractionation 3aenvironmental factors 3agrowing season 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aChemical Fractionation 2aClimate 2aFagusxmetabolism 2aGeography 2aModels, Biological 2aOxygen Isotopes 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Transpiration 2aRegression Analysis 2aSeasons 2aWaterxmetabolism 3aGermany 3aFrance 3aCentral European region 0aEurope 0aatmosphere 0awater balance1 aMatzarakis, Andreas.1 aRennenberg, H.q(Heinz)1 aGESSLER, ARTHUR0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2006 Aug., v. 29, no. 8 p.1492-1507dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01520.x 7aarticle02623naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245008300184300001600267520081000283650001501093650002401108650002201132650002401154650002101178650001201199650002401211650002101235650002601256650002501282650001701307650001401324650002401338650001601362650003601378650004401414650005001458650002501508650004601533650005001579653001601629653001501645653000901660700002201669700002201691700003101713700002601744700002601770773011101796852000901907856008501916930003302001946001102034655001202045IND4397139420221121041140.0071028e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439713942DNAL7 a179126432pmid7 a10.1007/s11130-007-0056-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez, Victor.10aIn Vitro Antioxidant and Anti-rhizopus Activities of Lamiaceae Herbal Extracts  ap. 151-155.  aEighty-eight extracts of different polarity obtained from 18 Lamiaceae medicinal and aromatic plants were screened for their antioxidant and antifungal properties.

The Arabidopsis quartet (qrt) mutation, which causes the four products of male meiosis to remain attached, enables plant biologists to apply this powerful tool to investigations of gamete development, cell division, chromosome dynamics, and recombination. Here we highlight several examples of how qrt has been used to perform tetrad analysis and suggest additional applications including a genetic screen for gametophytic mutants and methods for investigating gene interactions by synthetic lethal analysis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3achromosomes 3agene interaction 3amutation 3agametocytes 3amutants 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aheritability 3ameiosis 3abiological development 3agenetic recombination 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aCentromerexgenetics 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosome Segregation 2aGene Conversion 2aGenetic Linkage 2aMeiosisxgenetics 2aPollenxcytologyxgenetics. 0agerm cells 0acell division 0acells 0abiological techniques 0aplants1 aKeith, K.C.1 aPreuss, D.0 tPlant physiology.g2000 Sept., v. 124, no. 1 p.7-15dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02922naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245008200191300001400273520138100287650001401668650001401682650002101696650001501717650001601732650001601748650001801764650001401782650002401796650004101820650002701861650001601888650001101904650005201915650002001967650005801987653002802045700003302073700002902106700002302135773014402158852000902302856008502311930003302396946001102429655001202440IND4393062020221121030320.0070715e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439306202DNAL7 a173333962pmid7 a10.1007/s11130-007-0041-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGenovese, Maria Inês.10aCommercial Soy Protein Ingredients as Isoflavone Sources for Functional Foods  ap. 53-58.  aThe knowledge of the contents and profile of isoflavones present in soy protein ingredients, as well as the effect of industrial processing, is important for the development of functional foods rich in these compounds. The results obtained here showed that the total isoflavone content varied significantly among products. For defatted and whole soy flours the total isoflavone content ranged from 120 to 340 mg/100 g, for soy protein isolates from 88 to 164 mg/100 g, and for commercial textured soy proteins, from 66 to 183 mg/100 g (wet basis, expressed as aglycones). The highest isoflavone content was found for soy hypocotyl flours, from 542 to 851 mg/100 g. Compared to hypocotyl and whole and defatted flours, soy ingredients presented a decrease of malonylglycosides and deesterified β-glycosides with a significant increase in the percentage of aglycones, mainly for soy fibers (65-76%). While defatting was shown to cause isoflavone concentration without altering conjugation, extrusion process caused destruction of isoflavones and a significant increase in the amount of acetylglycosides, but this effect was less intense for the concentrates. From the results obtained it can be concluded that differences in isoflavone concentration and profile may be related to oscillations in the isoflavone content present in the raw material and to the type of processing. 3adefatting 3aextrusion 3afunctional foods 3ahypocotyls 3aingredients 3aisoflavones 3araw materials 3asoy flour 3asoy protein isolate 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aHealth Food 2aHumans 2aIsoflavonesxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aNutritive Value 2aSoybean Proteinsxadministration & dosagexchemistry. 0asoy protein ingredients1 aBarbosa, Ana Cristina Lopes 1 aPinto, MÁrcia Da Silva 1 aLajolo, Franco M. 0 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2007 June, v. 62, no. 2 p.53-58dNew York : Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishersx0921-96687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-007-0041-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02841naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001700157245008500174300001500259500002400274520123000298650001001528650001901538650002201557650001501579650002101594650002201615650002701637650002801664650001401692650002401706650001401730650002501744650001101769650002201780650002301802650001601825650001301841651001301854653002801867700001401895700001501909700001201924700001501936700001801951700001301969700001801982773009702000852000902097856008802106930003302194945002502227946001102252655001202263IND4398407720221121030221.0071204e20070920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439840772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aBarros, S.C.10aMolecular epidemiology of bluetongue virus in Portugal during 2004-2006 outbreak  ap.  25-32.  aIncludes references  aAfter 44 years of epidemiological silence, bluetongue virus (BTV) was reintroduced in Portugal in the autumn of 2004. The first clinical cases of bluetongue disease (BT) were notified in sheep farms located in the South of Portugal, close to the Spanish border. A total of six BTV, five of serotype 4 and one of serotype 2 were isolated from sheep and cattle during the 2004-006 epizootics. The nucleotide sequence of gene segments L2, S7 and S10 of BTV-4 prototype strain (BTV4/22045/PT04) obtained from the initial outbreak and of BTV-2 (BTV2/26629/PT05) was fully determined and compared with those from other parts of the world. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that BTV4/22045/PT04 is related to other BTV-4 strains that circulate in the Mediterranean basin since 1998, showing the highest identity (99%) with BTV-4 isolates of 2003 from Sardinia and Corsica, whereas BTV2/26629/PT05 is almost indistinguishable from the Onderstepoort BTV-2 live-attenuated vaccine strain and its related field strain isolated in Italy. Since live-attenuated BTV-2 vaccine was never used in Portugal, the isolation of this strain may represent a natural circulation of the vaccine virus used in other countries in Mediterranean Europe. 3asheep 3asheep diseases 3aemerging diseases 3abluetongue 3aBluetongue virus 3adisease outbreaks 3amolecular epidemiology 3apathogen identification 3aserotypes 3aantigenic variation 3aphylogeny 3anucleotide sequences 3agenome 3aprotein structure 3amicrobial genetics 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aPortugal 0amolecular sequence data1 aRamos, F.1 aLuis, T.M.1 aVaz, A.1 aDuarte, M.1 aHenriques, M.1 aCruz, B.1 aFevereiro, M.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2007 Sept. 20, v. 124, no. 1-2 p. 25-32dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.04.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/02/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02670naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100001500189245009900204300001400303500002400317500001500341520134000356650001701696650002301713650002201736650001801758650002001776650001501796653002401811653002601835653002301861653002001884653002901904700001801933773009001951852000902041856009302050930003302143945002502176946001102201655001202212IND4398411620221121004417.0071205e20071130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439841162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aX100 0aM001 0aM1201 aBusack, C.10aUsing factorial mating designs to increase the effective number of breeders in fish hatcheries  ap. 24-32.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the potential of full- and partial-factorial mating designs to increase the effective number of breeders in fish hatchery operations, using two probability distributions (normal and uniform) to generate individual fitness values, two methods (multiplicative and additive) of combining fitness values in individual matings, four full-factorial designs (10 x 10, 20 x 20, 40 x 40, 120 x 120), and three partial-factorial designs (2 x 2, 5 x 5, 10 x 10). N(b) under full-factorial mating was nearly linearly related to, and quite predictable from N(b) under single-pair mating. The higher the variance of family size under single-pair mating, the greater the N(b) benefit of full-factorial mating; and the larger the population, the greater the full-factorial benefit. Under assumptions of additive combination of fitness values, full-factorial mating resulted in an average N(b) increase of 33%. Partial-factorial designs as small as 2 x 2 achieved on average 45% of the N(b) advantage attainable under full-factorial mating. The proportionate incremental N(b) benefit from partial-factorial designs diminishes rapidly as the size of the design increases, but designs as small as 10 x 10 may attain such a large proportion of the full-factorial benefit as to render larger designs unnecessary. 3afish culture 3aMonte Carlo method 3asimulation models 3alinear models 3aanimal breeding 3ahatcheries 0amathematical models 0afull-factorial mating 0asingle-pair mating 0afish hatcheries 0apartial-factorial mating1 aKnudsen, C.M.0 tAquaculture.g2007 Nov. 30, v. 273, no. 1 p.24-32dElsevier Pub.

Based on sequence alignment to characterized SBEI cDNA clones isolated from plants, the SBEIc predicted from the cDNA sequence was produced with a transit peptide directing the polypeptide into plastids. Furthermore, the predicted mature form of SBEIc was much larger (152 kD) than previously characterized plant SBEI (80-100 kD) and contained a partial duplication of SBEI sequences. The first SBEI domain showed high amino acid similarity to a 74-kD wheat SBEI-like protein that is inactive as a branching enzyme when expressed in Escherichia coli. The second SBEI domain on SBEIc was identical in sequence to a functional 87-kD SBEI produced in the wheat endosperm. Immunoblot analysis of proteins produced in developing wheat kernels demonstrated that the 152-kD SBEIc was, in contrast to the 87- to 88-kD SBEI, preferentially associated with the starch granules. Proteins similar in size and recognized by wheat SBEI antibodies were also present in Triticum monococcum, Triticum tauschii, and Triticum turgidum subsp. durum.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahexosyltransferases 3astarch granules 3aprotein synthesis 3acomplementary DNA 3apeptides 3aamino acid sequences 3aendosperm 3aTriticum aestivum 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3amolecular weight 3aenzyme activity 2a1,4-alpha-Glucan Branching Enzymexgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCytoplasmic Granulesxenzymology 2aDNA, Complementaryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEnzyme Precursorsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia colixenzymology 2aImmunoblotting 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSeedsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aTriticumxenzymologyxgenetics. 0astarch 0amolecular sequence data1 aNair, R.B.1 aRepellin, A.1 aScoles, G.J.1 aChibbar, R.N.0 tPlant physiology.g2000 Sept., v. 124, no. 1 p.253-263dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03228naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245010300192300001600295520137700311650001301688650002301701650003301724650001401757650001301771650001201784650005801796650004201854650004701896650002501943650002801968650003201996650001402028650004602042650002302088650002702111650002702138650003302165651001002198651001102208651001002219651001102229653002102240653002202261653001202283653001502295653002302310700001702333700002102350773012202371852000902493856009202502930003302594946001102627655001202638IND4418927220221120223911.0090410e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441892722DNAL7 a193413922pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01571.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jing-Yang10aPhylogenetic study of two truffles, Tuber formosanum and Tuber furfuraceum, identified from Taiwan  ap. 157-171.  aTruffles are one of the most valuable edible fungi and have drawn extensive research interests worldwide. In Taiwan, two species of truffle, Tuber formosanum and Tuber furfuraceum, have been identified and reported. Although the morphological features of these two truffles have been described, lack of molecular identification has led to difficulties with firmly establishing their relatedness to other truffles. In this study, we utilized the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and β-tubulin gene sequences to generate the phylogenetic relationship of T. formosanum and T. furfuraceum with other taxonomic relatives. Our analysis revealed five/three major phylogenetic clades according to the 5.8S-ITS2/β-tubulin gene sequences and corroborated with their morphological characterization. Tuber formosanum highly resembles the Tuber indicum B complex, while T. furfuraceum is most similar to Tuber huidongense. Based on a molecular clock, we estimated that T. furfuraceum and T. formosanum would have diverged from their close relatives in mainland China between 10.2 and 4.1 Ma, respectively. Based on the results, we propose that these two Tuber species found in Taiwan might originate from the common ancestors with some truffle species in China. However, due to a long divergence time and geographical separation, they have evolved into indigenous species of Taiwan. 3aancestry 3aindigenous species 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aphylogeny 3atruffles 3atubulin 2aAscomycotaxclassificationxgeneticsxultrastructure. 2aDNA, Fungalxisolation & purification 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxanalysisxgenetics. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMycorrhizaexultrastructure 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 5.8Sxanalysisxgenetics. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSporesxultrastructure 2aTubulinxanalysisxgenetics. 3aChina 3aTaiwan 0aChina 0aTaiwan 0aTuber formosanum 0aTuber furfuraceum 0atruffle 0aβ-tubulin 0aphylogenetic study1 aHu, Hung-Tao1 aShen, Wei-Chiang0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2009 May, v. 294, no. 2 p.157-171dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01571.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090410b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03758naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180072000900189100002500198245019400223300001400417500002400431520204500455650002502500650001102525650001602536650001402552650001702566650001902583650002602602650001902628650002702647650002402674650002002698650002302718651001102741653002402752653005002776700002702826700002202853700002402875700002502899700001902924773009002943852000903033856009303042930003303135945002503168946001103193655001203204IND4398417920140724000000.0071205e20071130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439841792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL600 0aX100 0aM001 0aM1201 aCastillo-Juárez, H.10aHeritability for body weight at harvest size in the Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei, from a multi-environment experiment using univariate and multivariate animal models  ap. 42-49.  aIncludes references  aTo estimate family BLUP breeding values and the heritability of body weight at harvest size (BW) in the Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei, an experiment was conduced using information from two farm units of a Mexican hatchery and two shrimp population densities at each location. Data consisted of 12,658 shrimps that were siblings from 48 sires and 77 dams with a nested dam-sire structure. Shrimps were individually weighed at an average age of 130 days post-hatching. BW phenotypic mean (S.D.) was 18.2 (2.4) g, with values ranging from 8.4 to 30.0 g. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate models that considered BW within location by density pond environment as a different trait and included or not a common full-sib effect (c). The multivariate animal model included fixed effects of days from hatching and sex. For univariate models that included c effects, BW heritability (S.E.) estimates ranged from 0.24 (0.14) to 0.35 (0.18) across environments (heritability was zero in one environment). For multivariate models (excluding the environment with zero heritability) the heritabilities increased and ranged from 0.37 (0.06) to 0.45 (0.09). Standard errors of heritabilities and c effects were both drastically reduced in the multivariate analysis. Pairwise genetic correlations between environments were from 0.80 (0.08) to 0.86 (0.04). These differences may be indicative of genotype-environment interaction for BW at 130 days post-hatching. Statistical problems found to separate c from additive genetic effects both in univariate models were reduced using multivariate models. Correlation between family raw phenotypic means and family BV means from the multivariate analysis was 0.93 indicating a rather low risk of miss selecting superior families if BLUP solutions were neglected using replicated environment data. It is also concluded that use of incorrect statistical models or unreplicated data may lead to biased or inaccurate estimates of genetic parameters in shrimp breeding programs. 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3ashrimp 3abody weight 3abody size 3aheritability 3ashrimp culture 3amultivariate analysis 3abreeding value 3aphenotypic correlation 3agenetic correlation 3aanimal breeding 3astatistical models 3aMexico 0aunivariate analysis 0abest linear unbiased predicted breeding value1 aQuintana Casares, J.C.1 aCampos-Montes, G.1 aCabrera Villela, C.1 aMartínez Ortega, A.1 aMontaldo, H.H.0 tAquaculture.g2007 Nov. 30, v. 273, no. 1 p.42-49dElsevier Pub.

Pozueta-Romero, F. Rafia, G. Houlne, C. Cheniclet, J.P. Carde, M.-L. Schantz, R. Schantz [1997]Plant Physiol 115: 1185-1194). One population is comprised of plastoglobuli obtained from sonicated chloroplasts by flotation centrifugation. Higher density lipid-protein particles isolated from chloroplast stroma by ultrafiltration constitute a second population. Inasmuch as the stromal lipid-protein particles contain plastid-lipid-associated protein, but are distinguishable from plastoglobuli in terms of their lipid and protein composition, they appear to be plastoglobuli-like particles. Of particular interest is the finding that plastoglobuli and the higher density lipid-protein particles both contain catabolites of the thylakoid protein, cytochrome f. These observations support the view that there are distinguishable populations of plastoglobuli-like particles in chloroplasts. They further suggest that the formation of these particles may allow removal of protein catabolites from the thylakoid membrane that are destined for degradation as part of normal thylakoid turnover.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ametabolism 3aultrafiltration 3athylakoids 3ametabolites 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3alipids 3aleaves 3acytochromes 3achemical constituents of plants 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Fractionation 2aChloroplastsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, Gel 2aCytochromesxmetabolism 2aCytochromes f 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFabaceaexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aLipid Metabolism 2aLipidsxisolation & purification 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aPlastidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSubcellular Fractionsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aThylakoidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 0achloroplasts1 aLicatalosi, D.D.1 aThompson, J.E.0 tPlant physiology.g2000 Sept., v. 124, no. 1 p.211-221dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03135naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002600110245014400136300001300280500001500293520183600308650001202144650001502156650001602171650001902187650001602206650001202222650002302234650002602257650001602283650001802299650001502317650002102332650001102353650001202364650002302376650001602399650001502415650001002430650002302440650001302463650001902476650000902495653001802504773006402522852000902586939003302595946001302628655001202641IND4445430920221120223913.0101124s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444543092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuntington, Thomas G.10aClimate warming-induced intensification of the hydrologic cycle: an assessment of the published record and potential impacts on agriculture  ap. 1-53.  a2019-12-05  aClimate warming is expected to intensify and accelerate the global hydrologic cycle resulting in increases in evaporation, evapotranspiration (ET), atmospheric water-vapor content, and precipitation. The strength of the hydrologic response, or sensitivity of the response for a given degree of warming, is a critical outstanding question in climatology and hydrology. In this review chapter, I examine the published record of trends in various components of the hydrologic cycle and associated variables to assess observed hydrologic responses to warming during the period of observational records. Global and regional trends in evaporation, ET, and atmospheric water-vapor content and several large river basin water-balance studies support an ongoing intensification of the hydrologic cycle. Global trends in precipitation, runoff, and soil moisture are more uncertain than the trends in the variables noted above, in part because of high spatial and temporal variability. Trends in associated variables, such as systematic changes in ocean salinity, the length of the growing season, and the rate of precipitation recycling are generally consistent with intensification of the hydrologic cycle. The evidence for an increase in the frequency, intensity, or duration of extreme-weather events like hurricanes is mixed and remains uncertain. The largest potential impacts to agricultural systems depend greatly on the responses of hydrologic variables that are the most uncertain; for example, intensity and duration of heavy rainfall events; frequency, intensity, and duration of major storms and droughts; and rates of erosion. Impacts on agriculture will depend greatly on how insects, diseases, weeds, nutrient cycling, effectiveness of agrichemicals, and heat stress are affected by an intensification of the hydrologic cycle. 3adrought 3awatersheds 3aevaporation 3aglobal warming 3awater vapor 3ainsects 3ahydrologic factors 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aheat stress 3aagrochemicals 3ahurricanes 3ahydrologic cycle 3arunoff 3aclimate 3atemporal variation 3aclimatology 3asoil water 3aweeds 3aevapotranspiration 3asalinity 3agrowing season 3arain 0awater balance0 tAdvances in agronomy.g2010, v. 109 p.1-53x0065-21137nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b00000000c20111021  aOther US 7aarticle03077naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245016100128300001600289520173400305650001802039650001902057650001302076650001702089650002302106650002102129650002302150650002602173650001202199650002002211650001302231650001902244650001702263650003102280650001302311650002202324650001502346650002002361650002602381700002902407700002502436700002402461773006702485852000902552939003302561946001302594655001202607IND4445432420221120225209.0101124s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444543242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRusch, Adrien10aBiological control of insect pests in agroecosystems: effects of crop management, farming systems, and seminatural habitats at the landscape scale: A review  ap. 219-259.  aThere is a growing body of evidence to suggest that the simplification of land uses associated with a strong dependence on agrochemical inputs is decreasing environmental quality, threatening biodiversity, and increasing the likelihood of pest outbreaks. The development of farming systems with greater reliance on ecosystem services, such as biological control of insect pests, should increase the sustainability of agroecosystems. However, the factors responsible for the maintenance or enhancement of natural pest control remain unclear. The goal of this review is, therefore, to expose which elements, from the field to the landscape scale, influence natural enemy populations and pest regulation. We present here the principal effects of seminatural habitats, farming systems, and crop management on the abundance of insect pests and their biological control, with a view to evaluating their relative importance and identifying key elements that regulate natural pest control interactions. Because of the range of spatial and temporal scales experienced by these organisms, we advocate, in studies investigating trophic relations and biological pest control, a clear description of cropping systems and an explicit consideration of seminatural habitats and more generally of the surrounding landscape. Through this review, we also indicate gaps in knowledge and demonstrate the interest of linking agronomy and landscape ecology to understand trophic interactions, maximize natural pest control, and limit pesticide applications. Quantifying the relative importance of both local and landscape scales is a fundamental step in the design and assessment of ecologically sound integrated pest management strategies for farmers. 3aagrochemicals 3aagroecosystems 3aagronomy 3abiodiversity 3abiological control 3acropping systems 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental quality 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3ahabitats 3ainsect control 3ainsect pests 3aintegrated pest management 3aland use 3alandscape ecology 3alandscapes 3anatural enemies 3apesticide application1 aValantin-Morison, Muriel1 aSarthou, Jean-Pierre1 aRoger-Estrade, Jean0 tAdvances in agronomy.g2010, v. 109 p.219-259x0065-21137nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b00000000c20111021  aOther US 7aarticle03147naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245010900190300001600299520123000315650002401545650002401569650002701593650002301620650004001643650002401683650001501707650003001722650002201752650007801774650003301852650003201885650002501917650004001942650003001982650001302012650001402025650003902039650001502078650002702093651001902120651001902139653001302158653002502171653003502196653003202231700001402263700001902277773012802296852000902424856009202433930003302525946001102558655001202569IND4416225320221120225121.0090213e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441622532DNAL7 a190556262pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2008.02528.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNováková, D.10aCharacterization of Aeromonas encheleia strains isolated from aquatic environments in the Czech Republic  ap. 289-294.  aCharacterization and identification of Aeromonas strains isolated from surface and underground waters using phenotypic and genotyping methods. Biotyping using the ENTEROtest 24 kit and conventional biochemical and physiological tests assigned four strains to Aeromonas encheleia, whereas three isolates were identified as ambiguous Aeromonas bestiarum/Aeromonas caviae and one strain as Aeromonas eucrenophila/Aeromonas encheleia. Further characterization grouped the analysed strains together with Aer. encheleia CCM 4582T and assigned the analysed group as members of Aer. encheleia species using ribotyping, whole-cell protein analysis and ERIC-PCR fingerprinting. The results obtained were verified by DNA gyrase A subunit gene sequencing. All analysed isolates showed unique molecular patterns, except for isolates P 1769 and CCM 7407, which revealed the same EcoRI ribotype profile and proved to be identical strains. Our results imply that Aer. encheleia strains occur in unpolluted surface as well as in underground waters and demonstrate applied methods as suitable for their identification. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation and identification of Aer. encheleia in the Czech Republic. 3aAeromonas bestiarum 3aAeromonas encheleia 3aAeromonas eucrenophila 3aAeromonas punctata 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3aaquatic environment 3agenotyping 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 2aAeromonasxchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBacterial Proteinsxanalysis 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aDNA Gyrasexgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxgenetics. 2aFresh Waterxmicrobiology 2aGenotype 2aPhenotype 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRibotyping 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aCzech Republic 0aCzech Republic 0aERIC-PCR 0agyrA gene sequencing 0asurface and underground waters 0awhole-cell protein analysis1 aŠvec, P.1 aSedláček, I.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2009 Mar., v. 48, no. 3 p.289-294dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2008.02528.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090213b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03354naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180072000900189100001700198245012600215300001400341500002400355500001500379520181400394650001702208650001402225650001202239650001302251650001302264650002702277650002002304650002202324650002302346650001202369650002402381650001402405650001402419653002402433700001502457700001702472700001502489700001802504700001702522773009002539852000902629856009302638930003302731945002502764946001102789655001202800IND4398418820221120225309.0071205e20071130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439841882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL210 0aM310 0aM120 0aM0011 aPhelps, R.P.10aEffects of temperature on the induced spawning of channel catfish and the production of channel x blue catfish hybrid fry  ap. 80-86.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHybrid catfish (channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, female x blue catfish, I. furcatus, male) can be obtained by induced spawning and artificial fertilization but with variable results. Temperature of the surrounding environment affects the rates of physiological processes in fish including time to ovulation following hormone injection and time post-ovulation when quality eggs can be obtained. Brood females were held at 24, 26, and 28 °C in 100 L aquaria and injected with LH-RHa at 20 μg/kg followed 12 h later with 100 μg/kg. Fish were monitored hourly recording the time of the first egg deposit. Some females were manually stripped soon after the first eggs were observed, and the remaining females were stripped 4-6 h after the first eggs were observed. Eggs were artificially fertilized with blue catfish sperm and incubated. The percent of females that ovulated were 52.9%, 82.4% and 95.5% at 24, 26, and 28 °C (P = 0.001) respectively. The majority of females that ovulated did so between 58 to 64 h at 24 °C, 48 to 52 h at 26 °C and 24 to 40 h at 28 °C for a degree hour response time of 1405 ± 117, 1141 ± 238 and 951 ± 261 respectively (P < 0.001). Differences in eggs/kg female, eggs/g of eggs, percent viable eggs, percent hatch and survival of sac fry to swimup resulted in an average of 384.4 ± 316.97 fry/kg female at 24 °C, 370 ± 219.2/kg at 26 °C and 1284 ± 1394.1/kg at 28 °C (P = 0.136). Egg quality varied with how soon eggs were stripped after the first egg was observed. For fish held at 26 and 28 °C. the combined effects of egg quality and fry survival resulted in an average 1081 ± 1483.9 fry/kg female for fish stripped within 2 h after the first eggs were released and 500 fry/kg female when stripped after 4 or more hours once the first eggs were released. 3afish culture 3afish eggs 3ahybrids 3afish fry 3aspawning 3afreshwater aquaculture 3afreshwater fish 3awater temperature 3aIctalurus furcatus 3acatfish 3aIctalurus punctatus 3aovulation 3amortality 0aanimal reproduction1 aHastey, R.1 aPendetar, A.1 aLinley, L.1 aPapanikos, N.1 aDunham, R.A.0 tAquaculture.g2007 Nov. 30, v. 273, no. 1 p.80-86dElsevier Pub.

In plants, there are two isoenzymes of Protox, one located in plastids and other in the mitochondria. We cloned the cDNA of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) plastidal Protox and purified plastidal Protox protein from spinach chloroplasts. Sequence analysis of the cDNA indicated that the plastid Protox of spinach is composed of 562 amino acids containing the glycine-rich motif GxGxxG previously proposed to be a dinucleotide binding site of many flavin-containing proteins. The cDNA of plastidal Protox complemented a Protox mutation in Escherichia coli. N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified enzyme revealed that the plastidal Protox precursor is processed at the N-terminal site of serine-49. The predicted transit peptide (methionine-1 to cysteine-48) was sufficient for the transport of precursors into the plastid because green fluorescent protein fused with the predicted transit peptide was transported to the chloroplast. Immunocytochemical analysis using electron microscopy showed thatplastidal Protox is preferentially associated with the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane, and a small portion of the enzyme is located on the stromal side of the chloroplast inner envelope membrane.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aimmunocytochemistry 3acomplementary DNA 3aheme 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aisozymes 3abiochemical pathways 3aoxidoreductases 3aamino acid sequences 3amitochondria 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptides 3aprotein transport 3agenetic complementation 3amutation 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 3aEscherichia coli 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aChloroplastsxgeneticsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteins 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIsoenzymesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLuminescent Proteinsxgenetics 2aMicroscopy, Immunoelectron 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrganellesxmetabolism 2aOxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors 2aProtoporphyrinogen Oxidase 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSpinacia oleraceaxenzymologyxgeneticsxultrastructure. 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/ab029492 0aprecursors 0aplastids1 aWatanabe, N.1 aIwano, M.1 aInokuchi, H.1 aTakayama, S.1 aYoshida, S.1 aIsogai, A.0 tPlant physiology.g2000 Sept., v. 124, no. 1 p.59-70dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03125naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245010600171300001600277520188000293650001102173650001402184650001202198650001302210650001402223650002002237650001002257650002202267650001002289650002602299650001702325653001602342653002502358653001502383653002202398700002302420773011502443852000902558856009202567930003302659946001102692655001202703IND4417609720221120213915.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441760972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01500.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAiba, Masahiro10aArchitectural differences associated with adult stature and wood density in 30 temperate tree species  ap. 265-273.  a1. Tree architecture is a major determinant of performance, such as height growth, light capture, and mechanical stability. Studies both in temperate and tropical forests have shown significant architectural differences associated with adult stature and light demand. 2. However, studies in temperate forests have not been as thorough in examining these relationships with respect to phylogeny and ontogeny, thus preventing a complete understanding of the patterns in temperate forests and limiting comparisons of the relationship between tropical and temperate forests. Therefore, we performed a community-level analysis of the relationship between tree form and ecology in a temperate forest with statistical consideration of phylogeny and ontogeny. 3. The height-diameter relationship throughout tree development was asymptotic in most species. Crown diameter and depth increased allometrically with tree height, with no asymptote. The tree height, crown diameter, and crown depth of small trees were estimated using these relationships and were similar to those reported for tropical species. 4. Taller species had more slender stems at any reference size and narrower crowns at small reference sizes, whereas crown depth was relatively independent of adult stature. Light-wooded species had narrower and shallower crowns at medium to large reference heights. Stem thickness was virtually independent of wood density throughout the size range. 5. Our results support the hypothesis that the architecture of short or shade-tolerant species is optimized for light capture and mechanical stability, whereas that of tall or light-demanding species is optimized for height growth. These relationships generally agree with results from studies in tropical rain forests, although considerable differences exist, and may potentially promote the stable coexistence of the species. 3aadults 3aallometry 3aecology 3aontogeny 3aphylogeny 3ashade tolerance 3astems 3atemperate forests 3atrees 3atropical rain forests 3awood density 0acoexistence 0aOgawa Forest Reserve 0atrade-offs 0atree architecture1 aNakashizuka, Tohru0 tFunctional ecology.g2009 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.265-273dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01500.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090314b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03267naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002300181245009500204300001800299500002400317506007600341520137700417506003701794650002701831650002701858650001201885650002501897650001001922650001901932650001501951650001201966650001401978650001501992650001402007650002002021650001202041650003502053650001802088650008102106650001102187650006602198650002702264650002302291650002402314650001702338700002202355700002202377700001902399773013402418852000902552856008002561856004802641655001202689IND4383702420221207095206.0060917e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438370242DNAL7 a169572512pmid7 aPMC15636762pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.00344-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSearcy, Kristin E.10aCapture and Retention of Cryptosporidium parvum Oocysts by Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms  ap. 6242-6247.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe association of Cryptosporidium oocysts with biofilm communities can influence the propagation of this pathogen through both environmental systems and water treatment systems. We observed the capture and retention of C. parvum oocysts in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms using laboratory flow cells. Biofilms were developed in two different growth media using two different strains of P. aeruginosa, a wild-type strain (PAO1) and a strain that overproduces the exopolysaccharide alginate (PDO300). Confocal laser-scanning microscopy was used in conjunction with image analysis to assess the structure of the biofilms prior to introducing oocysts into the flow cells. More oocysts were captured by the biofilm-coated surfaces than the abiotic glass surface in both media. There was no significant difference in capture across the two strains of P. aeruginosa biofilm, but the fraction of oocysts captured was positively related to biofilm roughness and surface-area-to-volume ratio. Once captured, oocysts were retained in the biofilm for more than 24 h and were not released after a 40-fold increase in the system flow rate. We believe the capture and retention of oocysts by biofilm communities can impact the environmental transmission of C. parvum, and this interaction should be taken into consideration when predicting the migration of pathogens in the environment.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3abiofilm 3aenvironmental impact 3aglass 3aimage analysis 3amicroscopy 3aoocysts 3apathogens 3aprediction 3aroughness 3awater treatment 2aAnimals 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aCell Adhesion 2aCryptosporidium parvumxisolation & purificationxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aOocystsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aPseudomonas aeruginosa 2aSurface Properties 2aWaterxparasitology 2aWater Supply1 aPackman, Aaron I.1 aAtwill, Edward R.1 aHarter, Thomas0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Sept., v. 72, no. 9 p.6242-6247dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00344-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle02785naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245009800191300001400289520093100303592002801234650002801262650002301290650001801313650002301331650001101354650001501365650002201380650001001402650001701412650004301429650001301472650001801485650000901503650002201512650001401534650001201548650004101560650002101601650002201622650002801644650004001672650002501712650002801737650001301765650005701778700001701835700002701852700002601879700001801905700001901923700002401942700002301966773010001989856004802089961001302137852000902150655001202159IND50072590820221120064936.0140201e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007259082DNAL7 a243524752pmid7 a10.1007/s10886-013-0370-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrutcher, Frankie K.10aConversion of Fusaric Acid to Fusarinol by Aspergillus tubingensis: A Detoxification Reaction  ap. 84-89.  aThe fungus Fusarium oxysporum causes wilt diseases of plants and produces a potent phytotoxin fusaric acid (FA), which is also toxic to many microorganisms. An Aspergillus tubingensis strain with high tolerance to FA was isolated from soil and designated as CDRAt01. HPLC analysis of culture filtrates from A. tubingensis isolate CDRAt01 grown with the addition of FA indicated the formation of a metabolite over time that was associated with a decrease of FA. Spectral analysis and chemical synthesis confirmed the compound as 5-butyl-2-pyridinemethanol, referred to here as fusarinol. The phytotoxicity of fusarinol compared to FA was measured by comparing necrosis induced in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. Coker 312) cotyledons. Fusarinol was significantly less phytotoxic than FA. Therefore, the A. tubingensis strain provides a novel detoxification mechanism against FA which may be utilized to control Fusarium wilt.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus tubingensis 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium wilt 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotton 3acotyledons 3aculture filtrates 3afungi 3afusaric acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3anecrosis 3aphytotoxicity 3asoil 3aspectral analysis 3asynthesis 3awilting 2aAspergillusxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aBiological Assay 2aBiotransformation 2aCotyledonxdrug effects 2aFusaric Acidxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aFusariumxmetabolism 2aInactivation, Metabolic 2aKinetics 2aPyridinesxchemical synthesisxmetabolismxtoxicity.1 aLiu, Jinggao1 aPuckhaber, Lorraine S.1 aStipanovic, Robert D.1 aDuke, Sara E.1 aBell, Alois A.1 aWilliams, Howard J.1 aNichols, Robert L.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2014 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.84-89dSpringer-Verlagx0098-03317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-013-0370-4  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03594naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245012400213300001600337500001900353520225300372592002802625650002402653650002202677650001602699650001302715650001302728650001502741650001102756650002202767650001902789650001402808650002002822650001002842650002602852650001402878700002602892700002202918700002002940773010902960856008203069852000903151655001203160IND60737984320221120084340.0210520e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073798432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-021-02086-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonora, Flávia Sarti1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5166-587610aParopsis atomaria larval feeding induces a chemical but not a physical response in Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata  ap. 863-873.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKEY MESSAGE: Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata altered the expression of secondary metabolites in response to Paropsis atomaria larval feeding and mechanical wounding but did not alter leaf toughness and leaf trichomes. Plants have evolved strategies against herbivore pressure, relying on constitutive or induced traits that create physical and chemical barriers, which may influence herbivore performance. We evaluated the physical and chemical responses of Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata, an important hardwood plantation taxon, to feedings by Paropsis atomaria larvae, a pest that causes severe defoliation in young trees. This was undertaken to obtain insights into plant–herbivore interactions, aiming to identify parameters that may improve plant fitness and/or protection that may benefit pest management in forestry plantations. Seedlings of C. citriodora subsp. variegata were submitted to the following treatments: no damage, mechanical wounding, and P. atomaria larval feeding damage. Foliar samples were collected during and after treatment at day 15 and 22, respectively, from damaged and undamaged leaves to detect: local, systemic, or delayed induced responses. Leaf samples were analysed to determine whether there were induced physical (leaf toughness, trichome density) or chemical (secondary metabolite profiles) responses to damage. No physical response in any of the treatments was evident in C. citriodora subsp. variegata foliage at day 15 or 22. Systemic chemical responses were observed for the larval feeding and mechanical treatments, with, a delayed response evident in the larval feeding treatment only. The proportion of long chain hydrocarbons were reduced in these treatments relative to the control, whereas the proportion of monounsaturated hydrocarbons and monoterpenes increased. When analysed across treatments, larval mortality was negatively correlated with long chain hydrocarbons and positively correlated with monounsaturated hydrocarbons. These findings suggest that CCV systemic chemical responses induced by both larval feeding and mechanical damage but only larval feeding induced delayed response, suggesting that CCV responses to herbivory may be associated with plant defence strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorymbia citriodora 3aParopsis atomaria 3adefoliation 3aforestry 3ahardwood 3aherbivores 3aleaves 3amechanical damage 3amonoterpenoids 3amortality 3apest management 3apests 3asecondary metabolites 3atrichomes1 aHayes, Richard Andrew1 aNahrung, Helen F.1 aLee, David John0 tTrees.g2021 June, v. 35, no. 3 p.863-873dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl43090x0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-021-02086-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245008900178300001800267500000900285520152500294592002801819650001901847650001301866650001101879650001701890650001201907650002501919650001101944650000901955650001401964650001401978650001501992650001402007650002402021650001102045650001202056650001102068650001702079650001302096650001302109650001502122651001102137700002002148700001902168700001702187700002002204773015002224856009602374852000902470655001202479IND60668363920221117233438.0191125e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066836392DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1990.03615995005400040019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeldkamp, E.10aAlkali Basalt Gravel Weathering in Quaternary Allier River Terraces, Limagne, France  ap. 1043-1048.  aepub  aWeathering of alkali basalt pebbles was studied in three Quaternary Allier terraces of different ages. The isovolumetric method and Ti-constant method were applied to quantify compositional changes due to weathering. Bulk density of fresh gravel in the younger terraces (Weichselien and Holocene) was adequately estimated from geochemical data by a multiple linear regression model (R² = 0.81**, significant at P = 0.01). Since no chemical and micromorphological differences could be demonstrated between fresh gravel and the unweathered cores of partly weathered gravel, the regression model was also applied to calculate the bulk density of the cores of partly weathered pebbles in the oider terraces. The decrease in bulk density of the rind, compared with that of the core, was used as a measure of weathering intensity. The chemical composition of the weathering rind revealed a relative increase in the contents of Ti, Al, Fe, and Mn and a decrease of K, Na, Ca, and Si. Changes were estimated considering Ti essentially immobile. Except for Fe and Mn, all elements tended to decrease in the rind. The relative elemental mobilities were as follows: K > Na > Si > Mg > Ca > P > Al > Ti No relationship was found between weathering intensity and the age of the two oldest terraces or sampling depth. Differences in weathering intensity are predominantly a function of chemical (= mineralogical) composition of the alkali basalt pebbles. Contribution of the Dep. of Soil Science and Geology, Agric.

In this study, we evaluated the potential role of TAMs in specific histologic locations – intratumoral (iTAM) and stromal (sTAM), as well as total macrophage (tTAM) counts – as prognostic indicators in CMT. Clinicopathologic data from 66 animals with mammary carcinoma and their tumors were used in this study. Samples were stained with anti-macrophage antibody for subsequent TAM count. High levels of iTAM, sTAM, and tTAM were related with advanced clinical stage and vascular invasion. Additionally, tTAM revealed a relation with larger tumor size, while high levels of sTAM and tTAM were also correlated with node metastasis and a poor prognosis based on survival analysis. CMT with aggressive features can reveal higher TAM counts. TAMs are associated with vascular invasion and nodal metastasis, and sTAM and tTAM counts are correlated with overall survival, suggesting they could be used as prognostic indicators in canine mammary carcinomas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abreast neoplasms 3adogs 3ahistology 3ahumans 3amacrophages 3ametastasis 3aprognosis 3aresearch 3aveterinary medicine 0aMacrophages 0aInflammation 0aTumor microenvironment 0aMammary tumors 0aDog 0aCMT 0aOS 0aTAMs1 ados Reis, Diego Carlos1 aSalgado, Breno Souza1 aCassali, Geovanni Dantas0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2021 Mar., v. 135 p.329-334dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245016100163300001200324520163500336592002801971650001801999650001802017650002502035650001702060650001602077650002402093650001502117650001902132650001402151650001502165650000902180650002002189650001602209650004002225650002102265650000902286700001602295700001602311700002202327700002002349700001802369773013302387856008302520852000902603655001202612IND60773515220221122002055.0220618e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077351522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-022-03162-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKannan, A.10aEffect of dietary supplementation of zinc proteinate on performance, egg quality, blood biochemical parameters, and egg zinc content in White Leghorn layers  ap. 160.  aA study was conducted to investigate the effects of zinc proteinate (Zn-P) on laying performance, egg quality, antioxidant indices, and egg zinc content in laying hens from 38 to 49 weeks of age. A total of 150 White Leghorn layers were randomly assigned to five treatments, each with six replicates with five birds per replication. Dietary treatments included a corn-soybean meal–based basal diet with no zinc addition and basal diet supplemented with Zn-P at 40, 80, 120, or 160 mg/kg of feed for 12 weeks. The analyzed zinc concentrations of the five diets were 29.5, 70.8, 110.2, 147.5, and 187.5 mg Zn/kg, respectively. Dietary Zn-P supplementation had no effect on feed intake and egg production. However, raising the zinc level improved egg weight (P < 0.01) and egg mass (P < 0.05) and lowered the feed conversion ratio (P < 0.05) during the later (46–49 weeks) period. The Zn-P supplementation also significantly (P < 0.05) increased Haugh units, egg shell strength, and shell thickness and had no influence on other egg quality parameters. Increasing zinc levels in the diet resulted in increase in egg zinc contents and serum zinc level. The serum triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol levels significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in Zn-P-supplemented groups. Supplementation of Zn-P significantly (P < 0.05) increased serum Cu–Zn-SOD activity and reduced MDA concentration. It could be concluded that dietary supplementation of higher levels of Zn-P, more than 80 mg/kg diet, significantly improved the egg zinc content, some egg quality traits, antioxidant activity, and serum zinc levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWhite Leghorn 3aanimal health 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3adietary supplements 3aegg masses 3aegg production 3aegg shell 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3atriacylglycerols 3azinc1 aPrakash, B.1 aPaul, S.

The cellular aspect of these analyses is of crucial importance, because growth is driven by cell division and cell elongation. Kinematic analysis represents a methodology to quantify these two processes. Moreover, this technique is easy to use in non-specialized laboratories. Here, we present a protocol for performing a kinematic analysis in monocotyledonous maize (Zea mays) leaves. Two aspects are presented: (1) the quantification of cell division and expansion parameters, and (2) the determination of the location of the developmental zones. This could serve as a basis for sampling design and/or could be useful for data interpretation of biochemical and molecular measurements with high spatial resolution in the leaf growth zone. The growth zone of maize leaves is harvested during steady-state growth. Individual leaves are used for meristem length determination using a DAPI stain and cell-length profiles using DIC microscopy. The protocol is suited for emerged monocotyledonous leaves harvested during steady-state growth, with growth zones spanning at least several centimeters. To improve the understanding of plant growth regulation, data on growth and molecular studies must be combined. Therefore, an important advantage of kinematic analysis is the possibility to correlate changes at the molecular level to well-defined stages of cellular development. Furthermore, it allows for a more focused sampling of specified developmental stages, which is useful in case of limited budget or time.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aZea mays 3acell division 3acell growth 3acorn 3adevelopmental stages 3aenvironmental factors 3agenotype 3aleaves 3ameristems 3amicroscopy1 aAvramova, Viktoriya1 aBeemster, Gerrit T.

Understanding the distinct properties between Aβ conformations and how conformation may impact cellular activity remain open questions, yet still continue to provide new insights into protein misfolding and aggregation. In particular, there is interest in the group of soluble oligomeric prefibrillar Aβ species comprising lower molecular weight oligomers up to larger protofibrils. In the current study, a number of strategies were utilized to separate Aβ protofibrils and oligomers and show that the smaller Aβ oligomers have a much different conformation than Aβ protofibrils. The differences were consistent for both Aβ40 and Aβ42. Protofibrils bound thioflavin T to a greater extent than oligomers, and were highly enriched in β-sheet secondary structure. Aβ oligomers possessed a more open structure with significant solvent exposure of hydrophobic domains as determined by tryptophan fluorescence and bis-ANS binding, respectively. The protofibril-selective antibody AbSL readily discerned conformational differences between protofibrils and oligomers. The more developed structure for Aβ protofibrils ultimately proved critical for provoking the release of tumor necrosis factor α from microglial cells. The findings demonstrated a dependency on β-sheet structure for soluble Aβ aggregates to cause a microglial inflammatory response. The Aβ aggregation process yields many conformationally-varied species with different levels of β-structure and exposed hydrophobicity. The conformation elements likely determine biological activity and pathogenicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3aantibodies 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobicity 3ainflammation 3amolecular weight 3apathogenicity 3aprotein folding 3asolvents 3asurface area 3atryptophan 0aAlzheimer's disease 0aAmyloid-beta 0aConformation 0aOligomers 0aProtofibrils 0aAD 0aAβ 0aAPP 0aaCSF 0abis-ANS 0aBSA 0aGuHCl 0aHFIP 0aSEC 0aThT1 aKarki, Sanjib1 aParks, Antanisha1 aNichols, Cameron G.1 aNichols, Michael R.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 1870, no. 9 p.140817-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1570-96397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2022.1408173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009000168300001600258500000900274520166100283592002801944650001301972650000901985650001601994650001002010650003102020650001102051650001502062650000902077650001102086650002002097650001802117650001802135650001202153650001002165650001202175700002302187700001902210700001702229773015802246856008202404852000902486655001202495IND60668364120221117233246.0191125e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066836412DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2013.05.01982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuttmann, Rainer10aPredicting Soil Compaction Risks Related to Field Traffic during Silage Maize Harvest  ap. 408-421.  aepub  aReducing the traffic intensity and the mitigation of unnecessary traffic especially with heavy vehicles and high ground contact stress are basic requirements for preventing harmful soil compaction. This study focuses on quantifying traffic intensity and evaluating soil compaction risks during silage maize (Zea mays L.) harvest. Based on GPS data recorded by farm vehicles used on two study fields, wheel track patterns and the corresponding contact stresses have been modeled, using empirical approaches. Modeling the wheel track patterns considers the vehicle characteristics (e.g., axle width, tire type and size, and machine weight), and the changes in wheel load and contact stress during loading. The modeling results reveal that up to 62.8% of the field area had been trafficked during a single harvest. Between 16.4 and 26.8% of the field had been subjected to contact stresses exceeding 100 kPa. The actual vehicle-induced stresses calculated for the wheel track patterns were applied to model the stress distribution inside of the soil according to a method described by Horn and Fleige. The susceptibility of wheeled soil horizons to soil compaction was derived from a ratio between precompression stress and soil stress, which provides a useful measure of effective soil strength. Based on three scenarios, this article discusses how geospatial simulations might contribute to soil sustainability through an improved management of field traffic. Simulation results suggest that the risk of plastic subsoil deformation might be reduced from about 70% (related to the wheel track area) at water saturation to <5% at a matric potential of pF 2.5.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3adeformation 3afarms 3aglobal positioning systems 3amodels 3aprediction 3arisk 3asilage 3asoil compaction 3asoil horizons 3asoil strength 3asubsoil 3atires 3atraffic1 aSchwanebeck, Malte1 aNolde, Michael1 aHorn, Rainer0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2014 Mar., v. 78, no. 2 p.408-421dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2013.05.01983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02108naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008100169300001600250520097700266592002801243650002201271650001101293650001201304650001701316650002501333650002001358650001501378650001901393650002701412650000901439650002201448650002701470651001101497700001801508773010601526856008101632852000901713655001201722IND60080757220221118013722.0140809e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008075722DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-014-0191-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKeown, Niall J.10aMicrosatellite loci for studies of the common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis   ap. 701-703.  aThe common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, represents a model mobile marine species for studies of evolutionary processes occurring across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Such studies are relevant to sustainable fishery management and biodiversity conservation as the species is intensely exploited and an important component of inshore marine ecosystems. The isolation and preliminary characterisation of 10 dinucleotide repeat microsatellite loci is described. Genotyping of 48 adults from Agon Coutainville (France) revealed polymorphism at 9 of the loci. Among the polymorphic loci there was an average of 8.8 alleles per locus (range 3–14) with observed and expected heterozygosity per locus ranging from 0.104 to 0.792 and from 0.101 to 0.806, respectively. No evidence of linkage disequilibrium was detected between any locus pair.

While the central non-amyloidogenic-component (NAC) region of αS plays a critical role in fibrilization, recent studies have identified a specific sequence from within the N-terminal region (NTR, residues 36–42) as a key modulator of αS fibrilization. Due to the lack of effective therapeutics which specifically target αS aggregates, we have developed a strategy to prevent the aggregation and subsequent toxicity attributed to αS fibrilization utilizing NTR targeting peptides. In this study, L- and D-isoforms of a hexa- (VAQKTV-Aib, 77–82 NAC) and heptapeptide (GVLYVGS-Aib, 36–42 NTR) containing a self-recognition component unique to αS, as well as a C-terminal disruption element, were synthesized to target primary sequence regions of αS that modulate fibrilization. The D-peptide that targets the NTR (NTR-TP-D) was shown by ThT fluorescence assays and TEM to be the most effective at preventing fibril formation and elongation, as well as increasing the abundance of soluble monomeric αS. In addition, NTR-TP-D alters the conformation of destabilised monomers into a less aggregation-prone state and reduces the hydrophobicity of αS fibrils via fibril remodelling. Furthermore, both NTR-TP isoforms alleviate the cytotoxic effects of αS aggregates in both Neuro-2a and Caco-2 cells. Together, this study highlights how targeting the NTR of αS using D-isoform peptide inhibitors may effectively combat the deleterious effects of αS fibrilization and paves the way for future drug design to utilise such an approach to treat Parkinson's disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3abrain 3acytotoxicity 3adigestive system 3adrug design 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobicity 3apeptides 3atherapeutics 0aα-Synuclein 0aAmyloid fibrils 0aProtein aggregation 0aPeptide inhibitors 0aDrug design 0aαS 0aATD 0aPBS 0aIM-MS 0aNAC 0aNTR 0aTEM 0aThT 0aTP1 aJovcevski, Blagojce1 aPukala, Tara L.1 aAbell, Andrew D.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 1870, no. 10 p.140826-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1570-96397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2022.1408263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03406naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245014700210300001400357520178400371592002802155650001502183650001202198650001902210650002202229650002002251650000902271650002002280650002002300650001102320650001602331651001802347653001502365653002102380653001702401653003702418653002002455653002902475653001302504653001602517700002102533700002402554700002102578700006402599700001702663700002102680773009702701856008102798852000902879655001202888IND60612578720221120125027.0200517s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061257872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crm.2018.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJager, Henriette I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4253-533X10aWill future climate change increase the risk of violating minimum flow and maximum temperature thresholds below dams in the Pacific Northwest?  ap. 69-84.  aDetecting and avoiding environmental thresholds that lead to catastrophic change in ecological communities is an important goal, and one that is especially challenging to address over broad geographic extents. Here, we conducted a regional-scale climate vulnerability assessment (RCVA) to quantify the risk of violating thermal and minimum-flow thresholds below reservoirs. Our analysis used hybrid (process-based and empirical) models of tailwater temperature and flow driven by 4-km downscaled CMIP5 climate projections. Downscaling employed a combination of process-based models, quantile mapping, and a non-linear ‘reservoir’ transform function. RCVA can be applied at regional scales without proprietary and data-intensive physical models of reservoir systems or ecological models of species that comprise tailwater communities. Using RCVA, we produced ensemble projections of risk and duration of extreme high-temperature or low-flow events below federal reservoirs in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), USA. Bayesian modeling of simulated results allowed us to evaluate differences between risk under a future and baseline scenario relative to model uncertainties and to quantify uncertainty in modeled risks. Based on assumptions that historical patterns of reservoir dynamics and operation will continue, and that regulatory thresholds will not change, the risk of thermal exceedance was projected to increase by an average of 0.27 and extend into late-spring and fall (average change in duration of 10.3 d). For flow, RCVA projected an increase of 0.07 in the average risk below-thresholds flows, with an average increase in duration of 4.6 d. Both results raise concerns that cold-water salmonids of the PNW will be at increased risk under a future climate scenario.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonidae 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3amodel uncertainty 3aphysical models 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arisk management 3aspring 3atemperature 3aUnited States 0aThresholds 0aThermal criteria 0aMinimum flow 0aClimate vulnerability assessment 0aWater standards 0aSeasonal risk assessment 0aDuration 0aUncertainty1 aKing, Anthony W.1 aGangrade, Sudershan1 aHaines, Angelina1 aDeRolph, Christopher1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4253-533X1 aNaz, Bibi S.1 aAshfaq, Moetasim0 tClimate risk management.g2018, v. 21 p.69-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23250x2212-09637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2018.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05190naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245011400203520356100317592002803878650002303906650001703929650003203946650001603978650002203994650002004016650002404036650002404060650000904084650001404093650001104107650001604118650002104134650001204155650002004167650001704187650001404204650002004218653003104238653001704269653001704286653001104303653002404314653002004338700001404358700001504372700001904387700001904406700002004425773010004445856008204545852000904627655001204636IND60732473720221117034710.0210708e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073247372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2021.1020132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasti, Leila1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1327-445210aSublethal and antioxidant effects of six ichthyotoxic algae on early-life stages of the Japanese pearl oyster  aSeveral species of harmful algae form blooms that are detrimental to aquatic organisms worldwide with severe economic loss to several industries. The cosmopolitan ichthyotoxic dinoflagellates and raphidophytes Karenia spp., Chattonella spp., Heterosigma spp., and Margalefidinium (Cochlodinium) polykrikoides are known to cause mass mortalities of fish and invertebrates, and the dinoflagellates Heterocapsa spp. are known to cause mass mortalities of shellfish, notably bivalve molluscs. The species K. mikimotoi, K. papilionacea, H. circularisquama, H. akashiwo, M. polykrikoides, and C. marina form recurrent harmful algal blooms (HAB) in coastal aquaculture areas of shellfish, coinciding with the reproduction seasons of natural and farmed bivalve molluscs. In the present study, their effects on eggs, fertilization, embryos, and three larval stages (D-shaped, umbo and pre-settling larvae) of a model bivalve species, the Japanese pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata martensii, are reported. The harmful algae had differential negative effects on each developmental stage, and had differential effects on larvae depending on their growth stage. Eggs were more affected by M. polykrikoides, K. mikimotoi and H. circularisquama than H. akashiwo and K. papilionacea. Fertilized eggs and developing embryos were more affected by M. polykrikoides and H. circularisquama than K. mikimotoi, K. papilionacea and H. akashiwo. Mortalities as well as abnormalities were not observed in any larval stage; however, motility of d-larvae and umbo larvae was more reduced by H. circularisquama and C. marina, than M. polykrikoides. In elder, 16 day-old larvae, all harmful algae induced a significant decrease in motility with the most severe effect observed during exposures to H. circularisquama, C. marina, H. akashiwo and M. polykrikoides. The superoxidase dismutase activity in larvae was not affected by exposure to any harmful alga; however, 6- and 16-day old larvae experienced a significant increase in GST activity following 48 h of exposures, with higher sensitivity of the elder larvae to C. marina, K. mikimotoi and M. polykrikoides. These results indicate that all tested harmful algae are differentially detrimental to the early-life development of the Japanese pearl oyster, with involvement of oxidative stress. Both M. polykrikoides and H. circularisquama were the most toxic followed by C. marina, K. mikimotoi, H. akashiwo and K. papilionacea. In addition, more developed larvae were most sensitive to these harmful algae in terms of motility-avoidance behavior and oxidative stress response, suggesting that ingestion of the harmful algae might enhance the toxicity of contact-dependent effects and dissolved extracellular compounds. The results also showed that superoxide anions were not associated with effects observed in larvae. Instead cellular detoxification was induced. The differential, stage-specific and growth-specific sublethal effects on bivalve development and recruitment also warrant further investigations of the oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme activities in larvae of bivalves, to better address the toxicity mechanisms of ichthyotoxic HAB and their impacts on the reproduction, recruitment, and fitness of bivalve molluscs.Summary: The harmful algae Heterocapsa circularisquama, Chattonella marina, Hetrosigma akashiwo, Karenia mikimotoi, K. papilionacea, Margalefidinium (Cochlodinium) polykrikoides differentially affect early life stages of Japanese pearl oyster and activate detoxification enzymes in feeding larvae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChattonella marina 3aCochlodinium 3aHeterocapsa circularisquama 3aHeterosigma 3aKarenia mikimotoi 3aPinctada fucata 3aantioxidant enzymes 3afinancial economics 3afish 3aingestion 3alarvae 3amariculture 3aoxidative stress 3aoysters 3apoisonous algae 3areproduction 3ashellfish 3astress response 0aHarmful algal blooms (HAB) 0aPearl oyster 0aReproduction 0aLarvae 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aIchthyotoxicity1 aGo, Jyoji1 aOkano, Sho1 aHiguchi, Keita1 aNagai, Satoshi1 aNagai, Kiyohito0 tHarmful algae.g2021 Mar., v. 103 p.102013-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2021.1020133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245020100167300001800368520151500386592002801901650001601929650003201945650001601977650001601993650001202009650001602021650003102037650002102068653002502089653003102114653001402145653002202159700001502181700001402196700001502210700001402225700001402239700001702253700001902270700001302289773011402302856008302416852000902499655001202508IND60746731720221121004557.0211206e20211206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074673172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2021.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yongqing10aDynamic changes of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate levels modulate H+-ATPase and Na+/H+ antiporter activities to maintain ion homeostasis in Arabidopsis under salt stress  ap. 2000-2014.  aPlant metabolites are dynamically modified and distributed in response to environmental changes. However, it is poorly understood how metabolic change functions in plant stress responses. Maintaining ion homeostasis under salt stress requires coordinated activation of two types of central regulators: plasma membrane (PM) H⁺-ATPase and Na⁺/H⁺ antiporter. In this study, we used a bioassay-guided isolation approach to identify endogenous small molecules that affect PM H⁺-ATPase and Na⁺/H⁺ antiporter activities and identified phosphatidylinositol (PI), which inhibits PM H⁺-ATPase activity under non-stress conditions in Arabidopsis by directly binding to the C terminus of the PM H⁺-ATPase AHA2. Under salt stress, the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate-to-phosphatidylinositol (PI4P-to-PI) ratio increased, and PI4P bound and activated the PM Na⁺/H⁺ antiporter. PI prefers binding to the inactive form of PM H⁺-ATPase, while PI4P tends to bind to the active form of the Na⁺/H⁺ antiporter. Consistent with this, pis1 mutants, with reduced levels of PI, displayed increased PM H⁺-ATPase activity and salt stress tolerance, while the pi4kβ1 mutant, with reduced levels of PI4P, displayed reduced PM Na⁺/H⁺ antiporter activity and salt stress tolerance. Collectively, our results reveal that the dynamic change between PI and PI4P in response to salt stress in Arabidopsis is crucial for maintaining ion homeostasis to protect plants from unfavorable environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3ahomeostasis 3ametabolites 3amutants 3asalt stress 3asodium-hydrogen antiporter 3astress tolerance 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aendogenous small molecules 0aH+-ATPase 0aNa+/H+ antiporter1 aHan, Xiuli1 aMa, Liang1 aWu, Yujiao1 aLiu, Xiao1 aFu, Haiqi1 aLiu, Guoyong1 aLei, Xiaoguang1 aGuo, Yan0 tMolecular plant.g2021 Dec. 06, v. 14, no. 12 p.2000-2014dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2021.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245008900198300001600287520112200303592002801425650001501453650001401468650001301482650001901495650001401514650001601528700005501544700006301599773014401662856007601806852000901882655001201891IND60603835120221120030252.0180716e20180117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060383512DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b099642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuanyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5880-864910aTellurium: Fast Electrical and Atomic Transport along the Weak Interaction Direction  ap. 550-553.  aIn anisotropic materials, the electrical and atomic transport along the weak interaction direction is usually much slower than that along the chemical bond direction. However, Te, an important semiconductor composed of helical atomic chains, exhibits nearly isotropic electrical transport between intrachain and interchain directions. Using first-principles calculations to study bulk and few-layer Te, we show that this isotropy is related to similar effective masses and potentials for charge carriers along different transport directions, benefiting from the delocalization of the lone-pair electrons. This delocalization also enhances the interchain binding, and thus facilitates diffusion of vacancies and interstitial atoms across the chains, which together with the fast intrachain diffusion enable rapid self-healing of these defects at low temperature. Interestingly, the interstitial atoms diffuse along the chain via a concerted rotation mechanism. Our work reveals the unconventional properties underlying the superior performance of Te while providing insight into the transport in anisotropic materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aelectrons 3aisotropy 3asemiconductors 3atellurium 3atemperature1 aWu, Wenzhuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0362-66501 aGoddard, William A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0097-57160 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Jan. 17, v. 140, no. 2 p.550-553dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b099643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245018000169300001600349520115400365592002801519650001101547650001201558650002201570650001301592650000901605650001001614653001601624653002201640653003201662773015001694856007701844852000901921655001201930IND60521614820221122144836.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052161482DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1980-03152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEulenberger, Günther10aDarstellung und Kristallstruktur des Dithallium(I)blei(II)tetrathiogermanats(IV) Tl2PbGeS4 / Preparation and Crystal Structure of Dithallium(I)Lead(II) Tetrathiogermanate (IV)  ap. 335-339.  aTl₂PbGeS₄ was synthetized by fusion of a stoichiometric mixture of Tl₂S, PbS, and GeS₂, and prolonged heating of the reaction product. A single crystal could be isolated for intensity measurements on an automated four-circle single crystal diffractometer. Tl₂PbGeS₄ is monoclinic, space group P2₁/a with a = 8.907(2), b= 9.114(2), c = 10.502(3) Å, β = 94.08(2)°, and Z = 4. The crystal structure was determined by means of standard methods and refined to R = 0.065. The structure is composed of tetrahedral [GeS₄]⁴⁻ anions which are held together by Tl¹⁺ and Pb²⁺ cations. The GeS₄ tetrahedra are only slightly deformed (mean distance Ge-S: 2.220 Å). The Tl atoms are surrounded by eight S atoms at distances ranging from 3.085 to 4.055 Å forming irregular coordination polyhedra. The Pb atom is coordinated by six S atoms in a strongly distorted octahedral arrangement at distances varying from 2.803 to 3.256 A. The Pb atoms and the Tl(2) atoms are alternately situated between slabs of GeS₄ tetrahedra parallel to the ab plane.

Four food by‐products (i.e., potato waste, soy sauce cake, soybean curd residue and noodle waste) were obtained and mixed with commercial concentrate (CC) as TMR silage. The two types of TMR silage, T1 and T2, each contained CC, in addition to all by‐products for T1 (TRE1), and soy sauce cake and noodle waste for T2 (TRE2) on a dry matter (DM) basis. The silage was well‐fermented with low pH values and high lactic acid concentration. As the experimental treatments, T1, T2 and CC (CTL) were fed with a basal diet. The result showed that the digestibility of DM and organic matter (OM) were higher for T1 than for CC (P < 0.05), while crude protein digestibility was not significantly different among T1, T2 and CC. The retained nitrogen was not affected by inclusion of food by‐products. Ruminal pH in TRE1 and TRE2 immediately decreased compared to that in CTL. The study suggested that the two types of TMR silage, including food by‐products, might be used as a substitute for commercial concentrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3adigestible protein 3aexperimental design 3afeed intake 3alactic acid 3anitrogen 3anoodles 3aorganic matter 3apH 3apotatoes 3arumen fermentation 3asilage 3asilage fermentation 3asoy sauce 3atofu 3atotal mixed rations 3awastes 3awethers 2aAnimals 2aDigestion 2aEatingxphysiology 2aFermentationxphysiology 2aFood 2aMale 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aNutritive Value 2aRumenxphysiology 2aSheepxphysiology 2aSilagexanalysis 2aSolid Waste1 aYANI, Srita1 aKITAGAWA, Masayuki1 aOISHI, Kazato1 aHIROOKA, Hiroyuki1 aKUMAGAI, Hajime0 tAnimal science journal =.g2012 Nov., v. 83, no. 11 p.735-742dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-0929.2012.01016.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01450naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014200164300001600306520054300322592002800865650002100893650001900914650001100933700001900944773009600963856008101059990002301140852000901163655001201172IND60093813920221120220849.0141104e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009381392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2013.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Kyu Won10aSignificant reduction of the triggering electric field for half-metallicity in hydrogenated carbon nanotubes by optimized field direction  ap. 894-896.  aWe have investigated the half-metallicity in hydrogenated carbon nanotubes under an electric field as a function of the electric field direction by using the density functional theory calculation.

The replacement of meat did not significantly (p ≤ 0.05) affect the chemical composition of the patties. The cooking properties of the patties formulated with MSF improved with the flour level. The thiobarbituric acid value was higher for non-formulated patties than for formulated ones after storage. The addition of MSF slightly reduced the pH of raw patties with the storage time. Patties formulated with MSF had significantly (p ≤ 0.05) lower aerobic plate counts throughout the storage period. As the level of MSF increased, the patties had high lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*) values but low redness (a *) values. A relatively low sensory acceptability was noted for MSF-formulated patties and was slightly reduced at longer storage times, but that of non-formulated ones decreased significantly (p ≤ 0.05) at longer storage times. The results indicated that M. oleifera seed flour has a high potential as a binder for use in beef patty production in addition to its health and nutritional benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3aacid value 3abeef 3achemical composition 3acooking quality 3aflour 3anutritive value 3apH 3apatties 3aplate count 3astorage time 3athiobarbituric acid 0abeef burger 0aMoringa 0achemical composition 0acooking properties 0atexture 0acolour1 aGhafoor, Kashif1 aHawashin, Majed D.1 aAlsawmahi, Omer N.1 aBabiker, Elfadil E.0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 14, no. 1 p.1-9dTaylor & Francisx1947-63457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2015.10347843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01905naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010600171300001400277520081400291592002801105650001301133650001301146650002801159650001001187650002101197650001501218650001301233650003301246700001801279700001601297700002301313700001801336773009401354856008601448852000901534655001201543IND60095624320221119174849.0141104e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009562432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2011.03.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuralay, Filiz10aCarbon nanotube–chitosan modified disposable pencil graphite electrode for Vitamin B₁₂ analysis  ap. 18-22.  aA single walled carbon nanotube–chitosan (SWCNT–chitosan) modified disposable pencil graphite electrode (PGE) was used in this study for the electrochemical detection of Vitamin B₁₂.

The previous particle trapping methods based on membrane barriers resulted in low trapping efficiency due to the non-uniform slit gap between the membrane and the substrate, especially at the side walls of rectangular channel. In the present method, the air bubble plugs remained in the extended microchannel during sample filling process, block the particle passage at the both side ends of the membrane, thus all particles flow through the uniform slit gap. Therefore, high-efficient particle trapping without particle loss can be achieved. The present particle trapping chip was composed of three layers: pneumatic (top), membrane and channel (bottom) layers. The membrane was deformed by the pneumatic pressure applied from the top layer. In the experimental study using 10.3 μm-diameter polystyrene beads, the membrane barrier with the air bubble plugs successfully trapped the injected beads with the trapping efficiency of 100% at the flow rate of 10 μl/min, while the barrier without the air bubble plugs showed low efficiency of 20%. At the increased flow rate of 20 μl/min, beads were still trapped with trapping efficiency over 98% in the present device. By using a mixture of 5.7 and 10.3 μm-diameter beads, we also verified the present method was capable to trap and release the beads selectively according to their size with the release efficiency of 95.1%. The present simple and effective particle trapping device is applicable for the high-efficient bioparticle isolation and recovery in the micro total analysis system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aphysics 3apolystyrenes1 aKim, Yoonji1 aCho, Young-Ho0 tCurrent applied physics.g2013 July, v. 13, no. 5 p.902-906dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2013.01.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013300169300001400302520098000316592002801296650002401324650001101348650001001359650001801369650001301387650001001400650000901410650001801419650003301437650001001470650002301480650002301503650001801526650001001544653001001554653001401564653003301578653001801611700002301629700002201652700002601674773009701700856008501797852000901882655001201891IND60466237320221120032920.0151123e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046623732DNAL7 a10.1080/19476337.2015.10363092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcin, Kurek10aApplication of the response surface methodology in optimizing oat fiber particle size and flour replacement in wheat bread rolls  ap. 18-26.  aThere are few papers considering the effect of oat fiber particle size in bread production. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used for optimizing the flour replacement (FR) and particle size (PS) with the oat fiber powder in the production of wheat bread rolls. Response variables are bread quality characteristics (yield, volume, moisture content, crumb and crust color, firmness, springiness, sensory attributes, and total dietary fiber (TDF) content). The results obtained in the study indicated that a lower size of dietary fiber resulted in increased yield and moisture content and decreased the volume. The color characteristics were slightly affected by FR and PS. The measured firmness increased when increasing FR and PS. The sensory analysis reveals that the most acceptable combination was the lowest FR with the highest PS. RSM was an efficient statistical tool to model the influence of FR and PS of the oat dietary fiber on wheat bread characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreadmaking quality 3abreads 3acolor 3adietary fiber 3afirmness 3aflour 3aoats 3aparticle size 3aresponse surface methodology 3arolls 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3awater content 3awheat 0abread 0aoat fiber 0aresponse surface methodology 0aparticle size1 aJarosław, Wyrwisz1 aMonika, Piwińska1 aAgnieszka, Wierzbicka0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 14, no. 1 p.18-26dTaylor & Francisx1947-63457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2015.10363093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245017500180300001600355520092700371592002801298650001901326650002601345650002001371650002201391650002201413650001301435650002101448650001101469650002501480650006001505650003401565650002201599650003601621650003701657650005301694650002301747650005401770700001401824700001401838700001701852773012901869856004801998852000902046655001202055IND4467753820221119131233.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446775382DNAL7 a217133862pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-011-0359-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yinghua10aChanges in Microbial Populations and Enzyme Activities During Nitrogen Biodegradation of Domestic Sewage Treatment in the Subsurface Wastewater Infiltration System (SWIS)  ap. 431-435.  aDuring the process of domestic sewage treatment in the Subsurface Wastewater Infiltration System (SWIS), changes in the microbial populations (nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria) and enzyme activities (urease, nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase) involved in the nitrogen removal process were evaluated over a 2-year period. The results showed nitrifying bacteria number declined with depths increasing, while denitrifying bacteria increased, both of which increased nearer the inlet. The depth for nitrate reductase activity from high to low in sequence was 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 and 1.1 m. For nitrite reductase, the sequence was 0.5, 0.3, 0.7, 0.9 and 1.1 m. Urease and nitrite reductase activities were in positive correlation with the total nitrogen removal efficiency, with correlation coefficients 0.8662 and 0.9140, respectively and could be alternative to monitor the nitrogen biodegradation process in SWIS.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3adenitrifying bacteria 3aenzyme activity 3anitrate reductase 3anitrite reductase 3anitrogen 3asewage treatment 3aurease 3awastewater treatment 2aBacteriaxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aEnzymesxanalysis 2aNitrogenxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSewagexchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aWater Microbiology 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxmetabolism.1 aLi, Haibo1 aWang, Xin1 aSun, Tieheng0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2011 Oct., v. 87, no. 4 p.431-435dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-011-0359-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245009700188300001800285520121000303592002801513650001101541650001701552650000801569650000901577650002001586650001101606650001101617650001101628650001501639650002601654650001701680650001501697650003701712650001501749650001201764650001901776650002901795650004101824650001101865650003801876650003701914650002101951650002401972650003301996650002902029650004802058650003902106650003102145650003202176650000902208651001002217700001802227700003102245700001702276700002402293700002302317700002002340700002302360700002402383773013502407856008102542852000902623655001202632IND50067497820221118111223.0150207e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006749782DNAL7 a233250552pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-012-1456-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Nicola, Flavia12aA multi-approach monitoring of particulate matter, metals and PAHs in an urban street canyon  ap. 4969-4979.  aFor the first time until now, the results from a prediction model (Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System (ADMS)-Road) of pollutant dispersion in a street canyon were compared to the results obtained from biomonitors. In particular, the instrumental monitoring of particulate matter (PM10) and the biomonitoring of 14 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 11 metals by Quercus ilex leaves and Hypnum cupressiforme moss bags, acting as long- and short-term accumulators, respectively, were carried out. For both PAHs and metals, similar bioaccumulation trends were observed, with higher concentrations in biomonitors exposed at the leeward canyon side, affected by primary air vortex. The major pollutant accumulation at the leeward side was also predicted by the ADMS-Road model, on the basis of the prevailing wind direction that determines different exposure of the street canyon sides to pollutants emitted by vehicular traffic. A clear vertical (3, 6 and 9 m) distribution gradient of pollutants was not observed, so that both the model and biomonitoring results suggested that local air turbulences in the street canyon could contribute to uniform pollutant distribution at different heights.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypnum 3aQuercus ilex 3aair 3abags 3abioaccumulation 3aleaves 3ametals 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amosses and liverworts 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aprediction 3atraffic 3awind direction 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aBryopsidaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCities 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFagusxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aModels, Theoretical 2aParticulate Matterxanalysis 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxanalysis. 2aQuercusxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aVehicle Emissionsxanalysis 2aWind 0aItaly1 aMurena, Fabio1 aCostagliola, M.

The Cu-poor phase is chosen as a counterpart of Cu-poor Cu(In,Ga)Se₂ to show the highest efficiency in this class of materials, and also give a test board for parasitic phases which might influence on device properties. Although the Cu-poor CGSe thin-films were deposited on the four substrates at the same time in an identical condition, they showed differences in the morphology and grain size due to different CGSe/substrate interfaces and growth mechanisms depending on the substrates. These surface properties of the CGSe films were identified clearly by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement also supported the result of the AFM analysis and showed that the preferred orientation of CGSe is (112), independent of the substrates. The existence of parasitic phases was examined by Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopic techniques. While defect compounds such as CuGa₃Se₅ and CuGa₅Se₈ were identified for all films, the signals related to these parasitic phases are strongest for the films on the pure SLG substrate. Furthermore, the absorption property was investigated by spectroscopic ellipsometry in a photon energy range of 0.7–5 eV. We found that the absorption coefficient values for the CGSe films are about 10⁴–10⁵ cm⁻¹ in the visible region. The absorption coefficient is also changed according to the use of different substrates. This difference comes from the parasitic phase formation, which leads to an increase of the bandgap and suppression of the optical absorption strength. Our systematic study suggests clearly that the difference in distribution of parasitic phases in the CGSe films could originate primarily from the different substrates used for the film deposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3acopper 3aenergy 3aglass 3aoptical properties 3aphotoluminescence 3aspectroscopy 3atin1 aJo, W.1 aPark, D.Y.1 aCheong, H.1 aSeo, Y.K.1 aPark, J.H.1 aChung, J.S.1 aLee, Y.S.1 aKwark, Young-Je0 tCurrent applied physics.g2013 July, v. 13, no. 5 p.907-912dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2013.01.0443Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010300168300001400271520155300285592002801838650001301866650001201879650002101891650001601912651001001928653001501938653001901953653002001972653001601992653002002008700002202028700001802050700001802068773009902086856008302185852000902268655001202277IND60535940120221119040412.0190411e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053594012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actao.2015.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFusato, Yusuke10aEffect of change in floral openness with floral age on floral display and reproduction in Gentiana  ap. 17-23.  aSome plant species have flowers that open widely and then close slowly over time, resulting in changes in the width of the corolla opening. We examined the adaptive significance of retaining flowers with relatively closed corollas using Gentiana triflora var. japonica, a perennial species with petal movement, in Hakkoda, northern Japan. Under open pollination, floral openness changed with floral age. It increased from days 1–3 after the flower initially opened and decreased thereafter until floral senescence. Hand-pollinated flowers showed a significant reduction in floral openness compared with unpollinated flowers, suggesting that a floral openness reflects its demand for pollination. Pollinators visited inflorescences with many flowers irrespective of their openness, suggesting that the reduction in floral openness does not affect the attractiveness of the inflorescences to pollinators. Within inflorescences, pollinators visited less-pollinated flowers with wider floral openness more frequently and more-pollinated flowers with lower floral openness less frequently, possibly because of the time cost of entering flowers with low openness. This strategy appears adaptive because if all flowers maintain wide floral openness irrespective of their pollination demand, pollinators may visit more-pollinated flowers in an inflorescence and may leave the inflorescence without visiting less-pollinated flowers. Reduction of openness of more-pollinated flowers fits a strategy of enhancing effective pollination within inflorescences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGentiana 3acorolla 3aopen pollination 3apollinators 3aJapan 0aFloral age 0aFloral display 0aFloral openness 0aPollination 0aSeed production1 aItagaki, Tomoyuki1 aOguro, Michio1 aSakai, Satoki0 tActa oecologica.g2015 Aug., v. 67 p.17-23dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2015.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01711naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011400164300001600278520077500294592002801069650003701097650001401134650001401148650001101162650001201173700001501185773009601200856008101296990002301377852000901400655001201409IND60093814420221120200416.0141104e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009381442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2013.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Shuai10aMetal and annealing atmospheres dependence of resistive switching in metal/Nb₀.₇wₜ%-SrTiO₃ interfaces  ap. 913-918.  aWe investigated the resistance switching (RS) effect of metal/Nb-doped SrTiO₃ interfaces under different treating conditions. Two types of I–V characteristics appeared due to the modification of Schottky-like barrier and the formation of insulating layer. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, the change in interface potential barrier was contributed to the migration of oxygen vacancies and electrons trapping/detrapping of carriers in the vicinity of interface. Nonlinear fitting is applied to the curves to study the conduction mechanism of metal/NSTO. For “barrier height” style, Schottky emission and Poole–Frenkel (P–F) emission are dominating; for “insulating layer” style, space-charge-limited current, controls the conduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aannealing 3aelectrons 3aoxygen 3aphysics1 aCui, Yimin0 tCurrent applied physics.g2013 July, v. 13, no. 5 p.913-918dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2013.01.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01381naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245024200161300001600403520015500419592002800574650001700602650002900619650001900648653001700667653002900684653001800713653001900731653001800750653001900768700002000787773015000807856007700957852000901034655001201043IND60521615420221122175922.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052161542DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1980-03212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBäk, Claudia10aOrganische Schwefelverbindungen, XLVII [1] Dimerisierung des Monothiobenzils zu einem 1.3-Dithietan und dessen Cycloreversion / Organic Sulfur Compounds, XLVII [1] Dimerization of Monothiobenzil to a 1,3-Dithietane and its Cycloreversion  ap. 372-375.  aThe thermal dimerization of monothiobenzil (1c) to a 1,3-dithietane (2c) and the photochemical cycloreversion of this heterocycle to 1 c is described.  aPublisher supplied data 3adimerization 3aorganic sulfur compounds 3aphotochemistry 0aHeterocycles 0aOrganic Sulfur Compounds 0aα-Oxothiones 0a1,3-Dithietans 0a1,3-Oxathiols 0aPhotoreactions1 aPraefcke, Klaus0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 35, no. 3 p.372-375dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1980-03213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01689naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245005600167300001600223520087500239592002801114650001701142650001701159651001201176700001501188773012801203856008301331852000901414655001201423IND60764775420220414000000.0220409e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076477542DNAL7 a10.17221/14/2010-agricecon2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŽUTINIĆ, Đ.10aFamily farm inheritance in Slavonia region, Croatia  ap. 522-531.  aThe aim of the study was to determine the chances of the Slavonian family farms for social reproduction in the next generation and to determine attitudes of farmers towards some aspects of family farm inheritance and the possible ways of preventing the division of land.

The traditional pattern of behavior is obvious with regard to inheritance and to postponing the transfer of management and control of the farm resources.

To optimise nutrient utilisation and embryonic development throughout incubation and posthatch period, embryos originating from older breeder flocks may require a higher oxygen availability. The current study investigated effects of broiler breeder flock age and incubational oxygen concentration on embryonic metabolism and chicken development until 7-day posthatch. Similar sized eggs of a young (28–32 week) or old (55–59 week) Cobb 500 breeder flock were incubated at one of three oxygen concentrations (17%, 21% or 25%) from day 7 of incubation until 6 h after emergence from the eggshell. Posthatch, chickens were reared until 7 days of age. Egg composition at the start of incubation, heat production during incubation, and embryo or chicken development at embryonic day (ED)14 and ED18 of incubation, 6 h after hatch and day 7 posthatch were evaluated. An interaction was found between breeder age and oxygen concentration for yolk-free body mass (YFBM) at ED18. A higher oxygen concentration increased YFBM in the old breeder flock, whereas no difference was found between 21 and 25% oxygen in the young breeder flock. Yolk size was larger in the old compared to the young flock from ED0 until 6 h after hatch. Breeder flock age did not affect YFBM at ED14 and 6 h after hatch nor daily embryonic heat production, but there were some effects on relative organ weights. Chickens of the old compared to the young breeder flock showed a higher weight gain at day 7, but at a similar feed conversion ratio (FCR). A higher oxygen concentration during incubation stimulated embryonic development, especially between 17% and 21% of oxygen, in both flock ages. Although this growth advantage disappeared at 7 days posthatch, a low oxygen concentration during incubation resulted in a higher FCR at 7 days posthatch. Results indicated that breeder flock age seemed to influence body development, with an advantage for the older breeder flock during the posthatch period. Oxygen concentrations during incubation affected body development during incubation and FCR in the first 7 days posthatch. Although an interaction was found between breeder flock age and oxygen concentration at ED18 of incubation, there was no strong evidence that nutrient availability at the start of incubation (represented by breeder flock ages) affected embryo and chicken development at a higher oxygen concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3abroiler breeders 3aegg composition 3aegg shell 3aembryogenesis 3afeed conversion 3aflocks 3aheat production 3ametabolism 3anutrient availability 3aoxygen 3aweight gain 0aIncubation 0aPosthatch growth1 aMolenaar, R.1 aMeijerhof, R.1 avan den Anker, I.1 aHeetkamp, M.J.W.1 aKemp, B.1 avan den Brand, H.0 tAnimal.g2021 Sept., v. 15, no. 9 p.100323-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3938811x1751-73117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2021.1003233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245013300211300001200344520134400356592002801700650001801728650001501746650002101761650001501782650001301797650002501810650002301835650002001858650001201878650001901890650001901909650001601928650001201944650001801956650002301974650001701997773013502014856008102149852000902230655001202239IND60597845420221120192836.0180627e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059784542DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-018-7633-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Khuram Shahzad1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9171-890410aSorption and Juglans regia-derived activated carbon-mediated removal of aniline-based herbicide Alachlor from contaminated soils  ap. 437.  aAlachlor interaction with soil has been evaluated by batch equilibrium method on nine soils, geographically distant, from hilly to desert areas. Different soil samples have been investigated for sorption and removal mechanism of Alachlor. Linear and Freundlich soil–pesticide sorption isotherms were used to study the adsorption phenomena. Distribution coefficient (Kd) shifted extraordinarily from 94.9 to 6.15 µg mL⁻¹. Statistical analysis showed a negative correlation between soil pH and Kd (R² = − 0.70) and a positive relationship with organic matter content (R² = 0.80). The adsorption results gave a C-type isotherm. The results were additionally investigated by univariate ANOVA and their accuracy was checked through residual plots. Activated carbon prepared from walnut shells (Juglans regia) was utilized for green remediation of Alachlor-contaminated soils, proved to be a cost-effective absorbent. The influence of two parameters including pesticide concentration and contact time for the abatement of Alachlor were investigated. Most prominent removal in 5 ppm Alachlor concentration was 84% while in 7.5 ppm most astounding removal was 72% from soils. The utilization of Juglans regia shells for decontamination of soils makes this technique environmental friendly, economical and easily applicable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuglans regia 3aabsorbents 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aalachlor 3aanalysis of variance 3acost effectiveness 3adecontamination 3adeserts 3aorganic matter 3apolluted soils 3aremediation 3asoil pH 3asoil sampling 3asorption isotherms 3awalnut hulls0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2018 June, v. 77, no. 12 p.437-437dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7633-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245010500168300001600273520207800289592002802367650002602395650001102421650002002432650001202452650001202464650002302476650001702499700001702516773008702533856008502620852000902705655001202714IND4483002020221116143523.0141110e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448300202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2011.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yaohong10aDiel methane emissions in stands of Spartina alterniflora and Suaeda salsa from a coastal salt marsh  ap. 262-267.  aIn this study, we aimed to understand the influence of plant type on the monthly variations of diel CHâ fluxes from Spartina alterniflora and Suaeda salsa of coastal salt marshes at three growth stages (July, August and September). Dissolved CHâ concentrations in porewater and sediment redox potentials were monitored, as were aboveground plant biomass and stem densities. CHâ fluxes exhibited clear monthly variations and peaked in September in the S. alterniflora and S. salsa mesocosms. However, no discernible diel variation was observed in the CHâ flux in the S. salsa mesocosm, probably due to its weak gas transport capacity. By contrast, notable diel variations of CHâ flux with the peak of 1.42 and 3.67mgCHâmâ»Â²hâ»Â¹ at 12:00 and the lowest of 0.75 and 2.11mgCHâmâ»Â²hâ»Â¹ at 3:00 or 6:00 were observed in the S. alterniflora mesocosm on 11 August and 11 September, respectively, but not in July mainly due to low plant biomass masking diel variations in the porewater CHâ concentration. The ratios of the maximum flux to minimum flux over the course of the day in the S. alterniflora mesocosm on 10 July, 11 August and 11 September were 1.28, 1.89 and 1.76, respectively, and corresponding values for porewater CHâ concentration were 1.31, 1.39 and 1.17, respectively. CHâ flux significantly correlated with CHâ concentration in porewater, and both were significantly related to air temperature. These findings indicate that CHâ production and CHâ flux at the middle growth stage (August) exhibited greater responses to changes in air temperature, which in turn induced the higher diel variation. The higher diel cycle for CHâ flux in August than in September was likely due to the higher proportion of CHâ oxidized during diffusion within the aerenchyma system. Our results suggest that the extent of diel variations in CHâ flux may have depended on the gas transport capacity of plants, and the highest diel variation occurred at the middle growth stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpartina alterniflora 3aSuaeda 3aair temperature 3abiomass 3amethane 3amethane production 3asalt marshes1 aDing, Weixin0 tAquatic botany.g2011 Nov., v. 95, no. 4 p.262-267dElsevier B.V.x0304-37707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2011.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245014800161300001600309520203800325592002802363650001502391650002402406650001102430650002402441650002302465650001502488650001002503650002502513650001802538650001702556650001302573650001302586650002102599650002502620650001102645700001502656700001902671700001902690700001702709773009602726856008102822852000902903655001202912IND4451289020221119131038.0141110e20110403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445128902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2011.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrullu, L.10aBiomass production and nitrogen accumulation and remobilisation by Miscanthus×giganteus as influenced by nitrogen stocks in belowground organs  ap. 381-391.  aThe nitrogen (N) requirement of dedicated crops for bioenergy production is a particularly significant issue, since N fertilisers are energy-intensive to make and have environmental impacts on the local level (NO₃ leaching) and global level (N₂O gas emissions). Nitrogen nutrition of Miscanthus×giganteus aboveground organs is assumed to be dependent on N stocks in belowground organs, but the precise quantities involved are unknown. A kinetic study was carried out on the effect of harvest date (early harvest in October or late harvest in February) and nitrogen fertilisation (0 or 120kgNha⁻¹) on aboveground and belowground biomass production and N accumulation in established crops. Apparent N fluxes within the crop and their variability were also studied. Aboveground biomass varied between 24 and 28tDMha⁻¹ in early harvest treatments, and between 19 and 21tDMha⁻¹ in late harvest treatments. Nitrogen fertilisation had no effect on crop yield in late harvest treatments, but enhanced crop yield in early harvest treatments due to lower belowground biomass nitrogen content. Spring remobilisation, i.e. nitrogen flux from belowground to aboveground biomass, varied between 36 and 175kgNha⁻¹, due to the variability of initial belowground nitrogen stocks in the different treatments. Autumn remobilisation, i.e. nitrogen flux from aboveground to belowground organs, varied between 107 and 145kgNha⁻¹ in late harvest treatments, and between 39 and 93kgNha⁻¹ in early harvest treatments. Autumn remobilisation for a given harvest date was linked to aboveground nitrogen accumulation in the different treatments. Nitrogen accumulation in aboveground biomass was shown to be dependent firstly on initial belowground biomass nitrogen stocks and secondly on nitrogen uptake by the whole crop. The study demonstrated the key role of belowground nitrogen stocks on aboveground biomass nitrogen requirements. Early harvest depletes belowground nitrogen stocks and thus increases the need for nitrogen fertiliser.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiscanthus 3aaboveground biomass 3aautumn 3abelowground biomass 3abiomass production 3acrop yield 3acrops 3aenvironmental impact 3agas emissions 3aharvest date 3aleaching 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aspring1 aCadoux, S.1 aPreudhomme, M.1 aJeuffroy, M-H.1 aBeaudoin, N.0 tField crops research.g2011 Apr. 3, v. 121, no. 3 p.381-391dElsevier B.V.x0378-42907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2011.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01859naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011400174300001600288520066300304592002800967650001200995650002301007650002301030650001201053650002401065650001801089650001301107650000901120653002701129653002201156653001201178653002101190653002701211700002301238700002001261773008701281856008401368852000901452655001201461IND60559637420221120125553.0170105e20170118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055963742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Kimberly M.10aRapid synthesis of aurones under mild conditions using a combination of microwaves and deep eutectic solvents  ap. 240-241.  aThe combination of microwave heating and the deep eutectic solvent formed from choline chloride and urea has resulted in a new, essentially neutral, yet rapid method for the synthesis of a wide range of aurone derivatives. While isolated yields remain somewhat variable, in virtually every case, a significant increase in yield has been observed on going from conventional thermal heating to microwave heating. In addition, some compounds inaccessible using prior methods have become reproducibly available using this modification.

In our study, experimental and computational study on thermal behavior of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was carried out using various sizes of Au nanoparticles (NPs; 4, 18, and 57 nm) and thermo-reversible polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) on SPR chip. It was interesting that SPR angle shift on temperature was dependent on NP sizes, where the smaller size the better sensitive. It is probable that both plasmonic interaction and polymer dynamicity were collaboratively affected and presumably the latter dominated in the thermal monitoring of SPR signals. The simulations clearly indicated that the interaction between the Au NPs and polymers was strengthened by increasing temperature and NP sizes, resulting in decreasing sensitivity. These results are supportive to develop further accurate devices using plasmonics and polymer dynamics, such as plasmonic sensing devices, thermo-actuators, hybrid organic solar cell, and flexible display.  aPublisher supplied data 3agold 3amonitoring 3ananogold 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apolymers 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atemperature 3athermal properties1 aZhou, Hongjian1 aHong, Seongcheol1 aPark, Jung Youn1 aChen, Hongxia1 aKoh, Kwangnak1 aLee, Jaebeom0 tCurrent applied physics.g2013 July, v. 13, no. 5 p.940-944dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2013.01.0483Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001600171245009400187300001600281520080500297592002801102650001301130650001501143650001401158650001801172650002401190650002001214650001401234650001801248650001301266650002701279650002601306650002401332650002601356650002701382650002401409651001001433653001401443653002001457653002801477653002101505653002801526700002201554700001901576700001101595700001501606700001701621700001501638773010601653856008701759852000901846655001201855IND50067163320221118042210.0190409e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006716332DNAL7 a237146932pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.04.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fei,10aProduction of biodiesel from non-edible herbaceous vegetable oil: Xanthium sibiricum Patr  ap. 435-438.  aIn this study, Xanthium sibiricum Patr oil, a non-edible oil, was investigated for the first time to produce biodiesel.

The observed symptoms were similar to those caused by whitefly transmitted criniviruses (family Closteroviridae) Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV) and Beet pseudo-yellows virus (BPYV), as well as Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (CCYV), a recently described crinivirus that infects cucurbits in Japan (4) and by the aphid transmitted polerovirus (family Luteoviridae) Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV). Dense populations of whiteflies were present in all the affected crops. Leaf samples from cucumber (10 from Rhodes and 10 from Crete), melon (10), and watermelon (10) were collected and tested for the presence of the above viruses. Total RNA was extracted from the samples (2) and detection of BPYV, CYSDV, and CABYV was done as previously described (1,3) whereas detection of CCYV was conducted by herein developed two-step RT-PCR assays. Two new pairs of primers, ‘CC-HSP-up’ (5′-GAAGAGATGGGTTGGTGTAGATAAA-3′)/‘CC-HSP-do’ (5′-CACACCGATTTCATAAACATCCTTT-3′) and ‘CC-RdRp-up’ (5′-CCTAATATTGGAGCTTATGAGTACA-3′)/‘CC-RdRp-do’ (5′-CATACACTTTAAACACAACCCC-3′) were designed based on GenBank deposited sequences of CCYV for the amplification of two regions partially covering the heat shock protein 70 homologue (HSP70h) (226 bp) and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes (709 bp). Interestingly, CCYV was detected in all samples tested, while CYSDV was detected in 18 cucumbers (10 from Rhodes and 8 from Crete), 1 melon, and 3 watermelon plants. Neither BPYV nor CABYV were detected. In order to verify the presence of CCYV, the partial HSP70h and RdRp regions of a cucumber isolate from Crete were directly sequenced using the primers ‘CC-HSP-up’/‘CC-HSP-do’ and ‘CC-RdRp-up’/‘CC-RdRp-do’. BLAST analysis of the obtained sequences (HG939521 and 22) showed 99% and 100% identities with the HSP70h and RdRp of cucumber CCYV isolates from Lebanon, respectively (KC990511 and 22). Also, the partial HSP70h sequence of a watermelon CCYV isolate from Rhodes showed 99% identity with the cucumber isolate from Crete. Whitefly transmission of CCYV was also carried out by using an infected cucumber from Crete as virus source. Four groups of 30 whitefly adults of Bemisia tabaci biotype Q were given an acquisition and inoculation access time of 48 and 72 h, respectively. Each whitefly group was transferred to a healthy cucumber plant (hybrid Galeon). Two weeks post inoculation, the plants, which have already been showing mild interveinal chlorosis, were tested for virus presence by RT-PCR. CCYV was successfully transmitted in three of four inoculated cucumbers, which was further confirmed by sequencing. In Greece, cucurbit yellowing disease has occurred since the 1990s, with CYSDV, BPYV, and CABYV as causal agents. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CCYV infecting cucurbits in Greece; therefore, our finding supports the notion that the virus is spreading in the Mediterranean basin and is an important pathogen in cucurbit crops.References: (1) I.

Previous work has suggested that plant invasions can modify arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal community structure. However, there is a lack of understanding about how long it takes for these changes to develop. To test this we investigated temporal changes in AM fungal communities colonising the invasive plant Vincetoxicum rossicum (Apocynaceae). We hypothesised that AM fungal community structure would change in a particular direction during the invasion process. We collected soil from two sites with a long history of invasion by this plant, with each site having paired invaded and uninvaded plots. Soil from these plots was used in a glasshouse experiment to characterise AM fungal community structure in the roots of V. rossicum at different times throughout a simulated growing season. AM fungal community structure differed between invaded and uninvaded plots. However, contrasting with our hypothesis, AM fungal communities colonising V. rossicum growing in soil from uninvaded plots did not change towards those in plants growing in previously invaded soil. Our data suggest that changes to AM fungal communities in the presence of V. rossicum require longer than the first growing season after establishment to develop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVincetoxicum rossicum 3acommunity structure 3aecological invasion 3afungal communities 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agrowing season 3ainvasive species 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aplants (botany) 3aroots 3asoil 3asoil-plant interactions 3atemporal variation 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aPlant invasion 0aPlant–soil feedbacks 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi 0aVincetoxicum rossicum 0aDog-strangling vine 0aDenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)1 aAntunes, Pedro M.1 aDunfield, Kari E.0 tActa oecologica.g2015 Aug., v. 67 p.66-74dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2015.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03555naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003300152245011100185300001600296500001900312520217100331592002802502650001502530650001702545650001602562650001102578650001402589650001202603650002002615650001002635650001502645650002002660650001902680650002302699650001002722650001102732650002202743650002302765650001002788650001602798650001502814651001702829700001902846700002302865773010902888856005502997852000903052655001203061IND6037154220221116143549.0210726e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603715422DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1472-4642.2011.00821.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVitule, Jean Ricardo Simões10aHomogenization of freshwater fish faunas after the elimination of a natural barrier by a dam in Neotropics  ap. 111-120.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAim We quantify biotic homogenization of fish fauna caused by the elimination of a natural barrier between two freshwater ecoregions. We also evaluated fish introductions by different mechanisms such as aquaculture, angling and the aquarium trade in the homogenization of fish assemblages. The relative importance of native extinctions in the homogenization process was assessed by simulating the exclusion of threatened species in the data set. Location Paraná River, south‐eastern South America. Methods A fish species list of the Parana River Basin was organized in a subset of species distributions, according to pre‐ and post‐introductions caused by the elimination of the natural barrier and by other mechanisms. Biotic homogenization was verified by the use of Jaccard’s and Bray–Curtis’s coefficients, Whittaker’s beta diversity index, non‐metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) and nonparametric tests. Results For all subsets of species distributions, we observed an increase in the number of non‐native species in common related to the introductions. Between 40 and 52% of the species currently present in the Upper Paraná Basin dispersed upstream from the Lower Paraná after the construction of Itaipu Dam, including at least 1 class, 2 orders, 4 families and 16 genera of fish. Jaccard’s coefficient between the Upper and Lower Parana River increased by 6–7.5% only considering the Itaipu Dam influence and 10.5% considering all mechanisms of fish introductions. More than 50% of the increase in similarity was caused by the elimination of the barrier. Our results indicated functional homogenization related to large‐bodied Siluriformes (catfish). Main conclusions Itaipu Lake flooded a natural barrier and allowed hydrologic connectivity between the Upper and Lower Paraná River, and many fishes of the lower part of the river were able to colonize the upper stretches. The homogenization of the two assemblages between these adjacent aquatic regions was an unpredicted result of hydropower implementation. Introductions by dam can also shift longitudinal and latitudinal body size patterns (i.e. Bergmann's rule).  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3aSiluriformes 3aaquaculture 3abasins 3abody size 3acatfish 3adata collection 3afauna 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3ahomogenization 3aintroduced species 3alakes 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3athreatened species 3atrade 3awater power 3awatersheds 3aParana River1 aSkóra, Felipe1 aAbilhoa, Vinícius0 tDiversity & distributions.g2012 Feb., v. 18, no. 2 p.111-120dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2011.00821.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245019700161520137700358592002801735650001401763650001301777650001301790650001001803650001601813650002601829650001601855651001001871700002901881700002301910700003001933700002601963700002501989700002602014700002102040700002402061773012102085856007602206852000902282655001202291IND60754136120221119225023.0211023e20211017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075413612DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111029872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNardi, Samanta 10aTear Production, Intraocular Pressure, Ultrasound Biometric Features and Conjunctival Flora Identification in Clinically Normal Eyes of Two Italian Breeds of Chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)  aGiven the abundance of chickens in Italy, it is important for veterinarians to know the normal state of chickens’ eyes in order to identify any ophthalmic pathological changes. The aim of this study was to determine the normal values of select ocular parameters and to evaluate conjunctival microflora in two Italian chicken breeds. Sixty-six healthy chickens underwent a complete ophthalmic examination, which included a phenol red thread test (PRTT) for the evaluation of tear production and the assessment of intraocular pressure by rebound tonometry. B-mode ultrasound biometric measurements and conjunctival microflora identification were also performed in twenty-seven chickens. Mean PRTT was 23.77 ± 2.99 mm/15 s in the Livorno breed and 19.95 ± 2.81 mm/15 s in the Siciliana breed. Mean intraocular pressure was 14.3 ± 1.17 mmHg in the Livorno breed and 14.06 ± 1.15 mmHg in the Siciliana breed. Reference ranges for morphometric parameters were reported in the two breeds. Twenty-three chickens (85.18%) were bacteriologically positive. Chlamydia spp. antigen was detected in 14.81% of chickens. No positive cultures were obtained for fungi. Normal reference range values for selected ophthalmic parameters were obtained in clinically healthy chickens, which could facilitate accurate diagnosis and better management of ophthalmic diseases in these animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydia 3aantigens 3achickens 3aflora 3amorphometry 3aphenolsulfonphthalein 3aultrasonics 3aItaly1 aPuccini Leoni, Federico 1 aMonticelli, Viola 1 aEbani, Valentina Virginia1 aBertelloni, Fabrizio 1 aMarzoni, Margherita 1 aMancianti, Francesca 1 aCiti, Simonetta 1 aBarsotti, Giovanni 0 tAnimals.g2021 Oct. 17, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111029873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013900165520096300304592002801267650002801295650001601323650002401339650001401363650001201377650001101389650001201400650002101412650001501433650001201448653000901460653001001469653002001479700002001499700001901519700002001538700001701558700001801575700002101593773011201614856008201726852000901808655001201817IND60746733020221121004552.0210911e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074673302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2021.1046512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Li-Hao10aLactobacillus paracasei PS23 dietary supplementation alleviates muscle aging via ghrelin stimulation in d-galactose-induced aging mice  aSome probiotics have been shown to alleviate age-related muscle atrophy via the gut-muscle axis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of live or heat-killed Lactobacillus paracasei PS23 (PS23) on muscle health in D-galactose-induced aging mice. Administration of D-galactose significantly reduced the strength, size, and levels of phosphorylated Akt in the muscle of mice. These effects were ameliorated by both live and heat-killed PS23 supplementation. Ghrelin is a multifaceted gut hormone with the ability to improve muscle atrophy. The levels of ghrelin in the serum and stomach of the aging mice were also significantly reduced and could be rescued by heat-killed but not live PS23. Furthermore, heat-killed PS23 greatly stimulated ghrelin secretion in the KATO III human gastric cell line. In conclusion, PS23 is a potential dietary supplement that can alleviate age-related muscle loss and dysfunction by regulating ghrelin secretion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3ablood serum 3adietary supplements 3agalactose 3aghrelin 3ahumans 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3aprobiotics 3astomach 0aPS23 0aAging 0aMuscle strength1 aZheng, Shixuan,1 aWu, Chien-Chen1 aHuang, Chin-Lin1 aWen, Pei-Jun1 aChang, Min-Yu1 aTsai, Ying-Chieh0 tJournal of functional foods.g2021 Oct., v. 85 p.104651-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.1046513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002800141245018400169520136800353592002801721650001501749650000901764650001901773650002001792650002301812650001801835700001801853773012101871856007601992852000902068655001202077IND60754136220221119224929.0211023e20211017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075413622DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111029882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Kuijk, Sandra J.

A meta-analysis combining 13 individual studies, executed in Salmonella-challenged broilers comparing a control diet with and without the synergistic blend, was performed. Cecal Salmonella colonies and overall growth performance were measured. Raw data from all studies were combined and analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS, taking the within and between-study variation into account. In the first 14 days post-inoculation (DPI), cecal Salmonella was reduced by 0.429 log CFU/g (p = 0.011, n = 10 comparisons from five studies) when feeding the synergistic blend compared to the control group. During 15–34 DPI, the overall means were not different between treatments (0.069 log CFU/g; p = 0.519, n = 12 comparisons from eight studies). The feed conversion ratio was improved when feeding the synergistic blend compared to the control diet (1.474 vs. 1.482, respectively; p = 0.002). In conclusion, feeding a synergistic blend, containing organic acids and ß-1,4 mannobiose amongst other ingredients, reduced cecal Salmonella counts during the first 14 DPI and improved growth performance of Salmonella challenged broilers compared to a control diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3adiet 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3agrowth performance 3ameta-analysis1 aHan, Yanming 0 tAnimals.g2021 Oct. 17, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111029883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245012100166300001800287520128700305592002801592650001401620650002501634650001101659650001501670650001501685650001301700650001801713700002301731773009201754856004801846852000901894655001201903IND4467444020221119131354.0121003e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446744402DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-012-1923-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriffin, Nina E.14aThe effect of pulsed versus gradual salinity reduction on the physiology and survival of Halophila johnsonii Eiseman  ap. 1439-1447.  aPlants of Halophila johnsonii Eiseman were exposed, in mesocosms, to either pulsed hyposalinity treatments of 30, 15, 10, and 8 or gradual salinity reductions of two every 2 days. When salinity was pulsed, survivorship (>80 %) and maximum quantum yields (>0.7) were high in the 30 and 15 salinity treatments, but both declined in the 10 and 8 salinity treatments. Leaf osmolality declined with respect to salinity treatment, but the difference between leaf and media osmolality remained relatively constant (675 ± 177 mmol kg−1). In contrast, when salinity was gradually reduced, survivorship remained high from salinities of 30 to 4, and maximum quantum yields remained high from salinities of 30 to 6. Leaf osmolality declined linearly with respect to media osmolality and, similar to the pulsed treatments, the difference between leaf and media osmolality remained relatively constant from salinities of 30 to 2 (638 ± 161 mmol kg−1). Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity declined over time in both pulsed and gradual salinity reduction. The results indicate that H. johnsonii is more tolerant of hyposalinity than has previously been reported and that gradually reducing salinity extended its low-salinity tolerance threshold by approximately a salinity of 10.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalophila 3aantioxidant activity 3aleaves 3aosmolality 3aphysiology 3asalinity 3asurvival rate1 aDurako, Michael J.0 tMarine biology.g2012 July, v. 159, no. 7 p.1439-1447dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-012-1923-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03770naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245007800162300002000240520198600260592002802246650002302274650001602297650001102313650002402324650002302348650001802371650001102389650001802400650002102418650003702439653001902476653001302495653002602508653002402534653002002558653002302578700002602601700006102627700002102688700005802709700006102767700006402828700002002892700002002912700005902932700002002991773014203011856007803153852000903231655001203240IND60634978020190422000000.0190327e20190307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063497802DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b216672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastanet, Uli10aControlling the {111}/{110} Surface Ratio of Cuboidal Ceria Nanoparticles  ap. 11384-11390.  aThe ability to control the size and morphology is crucial in optimizing nanoceria catalytic activity as this is governed by the atomistic arrangement of species and structural features at the surfaces. Here, we show that cuboidal cerium oxide nanoparticles can be obtained via microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis in highly alkaline media. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed that the cube edges were truncated by CeO₂{110} surfaces and the cube corners were truncated by CeO₂{111} surfaces. When adjusting synthesis conditions by increasing NaOH concentration, the average particle size increased. Although this was accompanied by an increase of the cube faces, CeO₂{100}, the cube edges, CeO₂{110}, and cube corners, CeO₂{111}, remained of constant size. Molecular dynamics (MD) was used to rationalize this behavior and revealed that energetically, the corners and edges cannot be atomically sharp, rather they are truncated by {111} and {110} surfaces, respectively, to stabilize the nanocube; both the experiment and simulation showed agreement regarding the minimum size of ∼1.6 nm associated with this truncation. Moreover, HRTEM and MD revealed {111}/{110} faceting of the {110} edges, which balances the surface energy associated with the exposed surfaces, which follows {111} > {110} > {100}, although only the {110} surface facets because of the ease of extracting oxygen from its surface and follows {111} > {100} > {110}. Finally, MD revealed that the {100} surfaces are “liquid-like” with a surface oxygen mobility 5 orders of magnitude higher than that on the {111} surfaces; this arises from the flexibility of the surface species network that can access many different surface arrangements because of very small energy differences. This finding has implications for understanding the surface chemistry of nanoceria and provides avenues to rationalize the design of catalytically active materials at the nanoscale.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aceric oxide 3aenergy 3amicrowave treatment 3amolecular dynamics 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3aparticle size 3asodium hydroxide 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aceria nanocube 0afaceting 0aliquid-like catalysis 0amolecular modelling 0aceria catalysis 0aceria nanoparticle1 aFeral-Martin, Cédric1 aDemourgues, Alain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3828-84981 aNeale, Rachel L.1 aSayle, Dean C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7227-90101 aCaddeo, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2909-53791 aFlitcroft, Joseph M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8373-02331 aCaygill, Robert1 aPointon, Ben J.1 aMolinari, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7144-60751 aMajimel, Jerome0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Mar. 07, v. 11, no. 12 p.11384-11390dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b216673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01382naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245007900162300001800241520041600259592002800675650002300703650001600726650002300742650002200765650001200787700002000799700003500819700002300854773010700877856007500984852000901059655001201068IND60578587020221118055243.0170813e20130906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057858702DNAL7 a10.1021/ol402042f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopchuk, Justin M.12aA Short, Protecting Group-Free Total Synthesis of Bruceollines D, E, and J  ap. 4485-4487.  aA short, protecting group-free total synthesis of bruceollines D, E, and J has been achieved.

Nowadays, most 2-PE originates from chemical synthesis. Since there is an increasing demand for natural products, we designed an alternative method of 2-PE production. The utilization of yeast biomass in the production of natural 2-PE is a promising alternative for both chemical synthesis and expensive plant extraction. Here, we investigated the JM2014 yeast strain, which we recently isolated from a fermented milk drink and classified as a species of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To produce 2-PE, we used a 4L batch culture of the JM2014 strain in a laboratory-scale bioreactor and, subsequently, developed a method of isolation and purification of 2-PE from the broth. Within 72h, the not-genetically modified JM2014 strain produced 3.60gL−1 of 2-PE in the simple batch culture, which corresponds to an overall efficiency of the biotransformation step of 97.21%. Through the application of appropriately selected techniques and reagents, we extracted 2-PE that meets the criteria for a natural product with a 78% efficiency and a purity of >98% (GC). This is the first report documenting a complete methodology for 2-PE production, from biotransformation to purification of the final product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiomass production 3abioreactors 3abiotransformation 3acosmetics 3afermented milk 3aindustry 3aisolation techniques 3aodors 3aphenylethyl alcohol 3asynthesis 3ayeasts 0a2-Phenylethanol 0aBiotransformation 0aEthyl acetate 0aExtraction 0aL-phenylalanine 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae1 aWielechowska, M.1 aGłówczyk-Zubek, J.1 aRybak, E.1 aMierzejewska, J.0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2016 Oct., v. 100 p.275-281dElsevier B.V.aInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2016.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245016000168300002000328520136400348592002801712650001401740650002301754650001501777650000901792650001601801650001101817650001701828650002301845650001301868650001501881650001801896650001901914650002101933650000901954650001501963700002501978700002202003773012902025856008202154852000902236655001202245IND60582674420221118062114.0171006e20171005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058267442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b065212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJonayat, A.

These materials are used in fuel cells, in gas sensors, and as heterogeneous catalysts. The large number of possible combinations of different mixed-metal oxides and their metastability make the experimental discovery of such systems very inefficient. Herein, we develop an ab initio thermodynamic framework using density functional theory to accelerate this discovery process by predicting stable monolayer metal oxides that can be subjected to further computational study or experimental investigation. As an example of the application of this framework, we present our stability analysis of ZnO(0001)–Zn terminated and rutile TiO₂(110) surfaces with epitaxial MₓOy (M = Pd, Ru, Ni, Pt, Au, Zn) monolayers. Metastability is predicted relative to segregated particle structures of varying radii. We predict that NiO can form a metastable monolayer with the same stoichiometry as the support, ZnO(0001). A PdO and RuO₂ monolayer on ZnO(0001) are potentially stable. A monolayer of RuO₂ on TiO₂(110) is stable relative to segregated RuO₂ particles of 2 nm radius or less. However, RuO₂ shows a high preference for growing as 2D multilayer islands. Predicted stable monolayers are also found stable against subsurface segregation in the host oxide.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3afuel cells 3agold 3amethodology 3anickel 3anickel oxide 3aphysical chemistry 3aplatinum 3aprediction 3astoichiometry 3athermodynamics 3atitanium dioxide 3azinc 3azinc oxide1 avan Duin, Adri C.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglial activation exhibited increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and pro-inflammatory cytokines. LPS-induced microglial activation was suppressed by AYE treatment via inhibition of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. To investigate the protective effects of AYE on inflammatory pain, complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) was injected into the right paw of mice. Pain hypersensitivity and microglial activation in the spinal cord were markedly alleviated by oral administration of AYE. HPLC was performed and identified chlorogenic acid (CGA) and t-Ferulic acid (FRA) as the major active components in AYE. Both components showed inhibitory effects on LPS-induced microglial activation in BV2 cells. Our study demonstrates that AYE inhibits microglial activation-mediated inflammatory pain and that AYE has potential application as a natural analgesic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAster (Asteraceae) 3aanalgesic effect 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3achlorogenic acid 3acytokines 3adrug adjuvants 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aferulic acid 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneuroglia 3apain 3aplant extracts 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprotective effect 3asignal transduction 3aspinal cord 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aAster yomena 0aInflammatory pain 0aMicroglial activation 0aNatural products 0aNuclear factor-κB 0aCNS 0aAYE 0aiNOS 0aCOX-2 0aNF-κB 0aMAPK1 aLim, Eun Yeong1 aKim, Yun Tai0 tJournal of functional foods.g2021 Oct., v. 85 p.104659-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.1046593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245014100213300002000354520169700374592002802071650001302099650001402112650001902126650001302145650001102158650001302169650002102182650001802203650002402221650001102245650003102256650002202287700002102309700006002330773011602390856008402506852000902590655001202599IND60623105420221117074229.0181127e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062310542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b024902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshizawa, Kazunari1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6279-972210aDensity-Functional Tight-Binding Study on the Effects of Interfacial Water in the Adhesion Force between Epoxy Resin and Alumina Surface  ap. 14428-14438.  aAdhesion is one of the most interesting subjects in interface phenomena from the viewpoint of wide-range applications as well as basic science. Interfacial water has significant effects on coatings, adhesives, and fiber-reinforced polymer composites, often causing adhesion loss. The way of thinking based on quantum mechanics is essential for a better understanding of physical and chemical properties of adhesive interfaces. In this work, the molecular mechanism of the adhesion interaction between epoxy resin and hydroxylated alumina surface in the presence of interfacial water molecules is investigated by using density-functional tight-binding calculations. Periodic slab model calculations demonstrate that hydrogen bond is an important factor at the adhesion interface. Effects of interfacial water molecules located between epoxy resin and hydroxylated alumina surface are assessed by using a dry model without interfacial water and wet models with water layers of 3, 6, and 9 Å thicknesses. Interesting first- and second-layer structures are observed in the distribution of interfacial water molecules in the tight space between the adhesive and adherend. Energy plots with respect to the displacement of epoxy resin from the alumina surface are nicely approximated by the Morse potential. The adhesion force and stress are theoretically obtained by differentiating the potential curve with respect to the displacement of epoxy resin. Computational results show that the adhesion force and stress are significantly weakened with an increase in the thickness of interfacial water layer. Thus, interfacial water molecules have a clue as to the role of water in the loss of adhesion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadhesives 3aaluminum oxide 3acoatings 3aenergy 3aepoxides 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydroxylation 3ainterface phenomena 3amodels 3aphysicochemical properties 3aquantum mechanics1 aMurata, Hiroyuki1 aTanaka, Hiromasa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8516-82800 tLangmuir.g2018 Nov. 02, v. 34, no. 47 p.14428-14438dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b024903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245005200212300001600264520123100280592002801511650002001539650001201559650002101571650001801592650001201610650002501622651001301647700002001660773011201680856008201792852000901874655001201883IND60569844720221117233027.0180619e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056984472DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-017-0654-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMekonnen, DanielAyalew1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8323-438410aAspirations and food security in rural Ethiopia  ap. 371-385.  aDespite some improvements in recent years, poverty and food insecurity remain widespread and the main challenges in Ethiopia. Much of the empirical literature focuses on identifying the resource-related constraints for farmers to achieve food security and move out of poverty, with little attention paid to ‘internal’ or psychological factors such as aspirations. Using individual and household data collected in rural Ethiopia, we examined if aspirations were strongly associated with well-being outcomes, in our case food security, as posited in the theoretical framework of aspirations failure. We found that aspirations of the household head were positively and strongly associated with various triangulating measures of household food security including per-capita calorie consumption, the food consumption score (FCS), the household dietary diversity score (HDDS), and negatively associated with the household food insecurity access scale (HFIAS). In contrast, results suggest that the aspirations of the spouse of the household head are negatively associated with per-capita calorie consumption and FCS. We discuss the channels through which aspirations may affect food security and the avenues for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3afarmers 3afood consumption 3afood security 3apoverty 3apsychosocial factors 3aEthiopia1 aGerber, Nicolas0 tFood security.g2017 Apr., v. 9, no. 2 p.371-385dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000074x1876-45177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-017-0654-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011500173520161300288592002801901650003001929650001101959650001901970650001501989650002102004650001202025651001402037653001902051653001502070653001402085653001502099653001202114653002502126700005802151700006102209700006102270773010102331856008602432852000902518655001202527IND60732470120221117035611.0210813e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073247012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1076012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRowland, Freya E.10aLake Erie tributary nutrient trend evaluation: Normalizing concentrations and loads to reduce flow variability  aEstablishing tributary load (i.e., the mass exported over a period of time) targets to reduce anthropogenic nutrient inputs to receiving waters — and thus eutrophication — is a common mitigation strategy in freshwater and coastal ecosystems. However, detecting and quantifying trends can be difficult because annual precipitation strongly influences tributary flow (e.g., average daily stream discharge). This may obscure trends as wet years tend to produce high tributary loads despite management activities to reduce nutrient export, and dry years typically generate low loads, even without management of nutrients. Furthermore, flow and nutrient concentrations are often correlated. Earlier efforts to reduce the effect of flow variability on tributary nutrient assessment were limited by computational and methodological constraints, until the weighted regressions on time, discharge, and season (WRTDS) method was introduced in 2010. Here we use WRTDS to assess nutrient concentration and load changes from 1982 to 2018 in three tributaries to the western basin of Lake Erie, of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Generally, trends revealed by flow-normalization do not contradict those of non-normalized metrics; however flow-normalization made the patterns more perceptible than in non-normalized metrics and reduced the influence of a particularly wet or dry period at the end of records on long-term trend analysis. We demonstrate that using WRTDS for flow-normalization removed the noise arising from annual precipitation variability and makes tributary nutrient trend evaluation more straightforward.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abasins 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3anutrient content 3astreams 3aLake Erie 0aLong-term data 0aMonitoring 0aNutrients 0aStatistics 0aStreams 0aTime-series analysis1 aStow, Craig A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6171-78551 aJohnson, Laura T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2432-26241 aHirsch, Robert M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4534-075X0 tEcological indicators.g2021 June, v. 125 p.107601-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1076013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013200163300001600295500000900311520198900320592002802309650001502337650001302352650001702365650002002382650001602402650002702418650002602445650001002471650001102481650001302492650000902505650001702514650001802531650001102549650001202560650001202572650001802584650002002602650001702622650001102639700001702650700001602667773013702683856008202820852000902902655001202911IND60668361120221117233258.0191228e200101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066836112DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2001.651215x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichard, G.10aComparison of Inverse and Direct Evaporation Methods for Estimating Soil Hydraulic Properties under Different Tillage Practices  ap. 215-224.  aepub  aTillage and traffic modify soil porosity and pore-size distribution, leading to changes in the unsaturated hydraulic properties of the tilled layer. These modifications are difficult to characterize although they can greatly affect evaporation. This study was conducted to compare field and laboratory methods for estimating the unsaturated hydraulic properties of two soils under different tillage practices. Soils freshly tilled, soils tilled 6 mo earlier that received winter rainfall (340–380 mm), and soils compacted by wheel tracks, were created in loess (Typic Hapludalf) and calcareous (Typic Rendoll) soils to obtain a wide range of soil bulk densities (1.0–1.6 g cm⁻³). The Wind laboratory method (direct evaporation) was compared with an inverse modeling method applied to field measurements of water content and water potential during dry periods in spring. The soil samples were saturated with water from the top (full saturation) or from the bottom (partial saturation) before conducting the laboratory evaporation experiment. The Wind method overestimated water retention, except in the compacted soils, when the soil samples were initially fully saturated with water. On the contrary, there was good agreement between the Wind method and field data for tilled soils with a low bulk density when the samples were only partially saturated from the bottom. In that case, the hydraulic conductivity obtained with the Wind and the inverse modeling methods were similar. The Wind method can be used to estimate the unsaturated hydraulic properties of tilled soils, but care must be taken to saturate the soil cores with water: full saturation (saturation fraction of the total pore space >0.9 m³ m⁻³) for the cores from compacted soils with a low structural void ratio (<0.3 m³ m⁻³), partial saturation (saturation fraction of the total pore space around 0.7 m³ m⁻³) for the cores from the tilled soils with a high structural void ratio (>0.5 m³ m⁻³).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHapludalfs 3aRendolls 3abulk density 3acompacted soils 3aevaporation 3ahydraulic conductivity 3alaboratory techniques 3aloess 3amodels 3aporosity 3arain 3asoil density 3asoil sampling 3aspring 3atillage 3atraffic 3awater content 3awater potential 3awheel tracks 3awinter1 aSillon, J.F.1 aMarloie, O.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2001 Jan., v. 65, no. 1 p.215-224dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2001.651215x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008900176520180700265592002802072650002302100650002602123650002702149650002702176650000802203650001802211650002302229650002502252650001102277650001002288650000902298650001002307650000902317650001402326650002502340650001202365651001502377653001202392653000902404653002202413653001602435653001602451653001602467700002402483700001802507773010102525856008602626852000902712655001202721IND60732470320221117035929.0210813e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073247032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1076052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Nicholas S.10aAssessment of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) diet using DNA metabarcoding of feces  aSea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) are invasive in the Laurentian Great Lakes, parasitize large-bodied fishes, and therefore are the focus of an international control program. However, damage caused by sea lamprey to modern day fish stocks remains uncertain because diet analysis of juvenile sea lamprey has been challenging; they feed on blood and are difficult to randomly sample in the lakes. Here, both challenges were addressed by showing that DNA metabarcoding of fecal material can be used to identify the diet of actively feeding juvenile sea lamprey, and can also be used to determine what non-feeding adult sea lamprey captured in streams fed on while parasitizing fish. Fecal samples from juvenile sea lamprey that were feeding on lake trout in northern Lake Huron overwhelmingly contained lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) DNA (90%), while smaller percentages contained lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis; 5%) and longnose sucker (Catostomus catostomus; 5%) DNA. Fecal samples from adult sea lamprey captured from a tributary to northern Lake Huron overwhelmingly contained longnose and white sucker DNA (Catostomus spp.; 80%), while a smaller percentage contained lake trout DNA (10%). Diet composition of adult sea lamprey sampled in the tributary (Black Mallard Creek) was more diverse than juvenile diet composition. DNA metabarcoding suggests that Catostomus spp. may be an important host fish in northern Lake Huron for sea lamprey prior to spawning. Future research could investigate how diet varies across years and lakes and the prevalence and sources of DNA contamination. Application of DNA metabarcoding for diet assessment may be practical for identifying populations of invasive sea lamprey that feed on highly valued fishes and help guide restoration of lampreys worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aCatostomus catostomus 3aCatostomus commersonii 3aCoregonus clupeaformis 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aPetromyzon marinus 3aSalvelinus namaycush 3aadults 3ablood 3adiet 3afeces 3afish 3ajuveniles 3anutrition assessment 3astreams 3aLake Huron 0aLamprey 0aDiet 0aDNA metabarcoding 0aGreat Lakes 0aHematophagy 0aGut content1 aLewandoski, Sean A.1 aMerkes, Chris0 tEcological indicators.g2021 June, v. 125 p.107605-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1076053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01939naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245009100161300001600252520094100268592002801209650001201237650002101249650001601270650001901286650001301305650001301318650002101331650001101352700001701363700001601380700001601396773012001412856004801532852000901580655001201589IND4474564920221119080442.0121003e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447456492DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-010-0491-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Wen He13aAn uPA cleavable conjugate of a recombinant αvβ3 targeting toxin and its bioactivity  ap. 563-569.  aMelittin is the predominant component of bee venom with cell membrane-disrupting capability.

It contains A Disintegrin-like domain of ADAM 15 to selectively deliver fusion protein to the surface of the tumor cells expressing integrin αvβ3, a toxin domain consisting of four repeats of N-terminal 22 amino acids of melittin, and an uPA cleavable link in between. The fusion protein named as ADAM-Conj-Mel was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and can be cleaved by uPA as well as conditioned medium of SW1990 tumor cells. In vitro, ADAM-Conj-Mel efficiently inhibits proliferation of human melanoma (C32) tumor cells. In vivo, it reduces B16 tumor volume by approximately 80%.

Knockout of the central carbon metabolic gene zwf (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) resulted in the enhancement of lycopene production (above 130 % relative to control). The amplification and overexpression of rate-limiting steps encoded by idi (isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase), dxs (1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase) and ispDF (4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol synthase and 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase) genes improved lycopene synthesis from 0.89 to 5.39 mg g⁻¹DCW. The combination of central metabolic genes knockout with the amplification of MEP pathway genes yielded best amounts of lycopene (6.85–7.55 mg g⁻¹DCW). Transcript profiling revealed that idi and dxs were up-regulated in the zwf knock-out strain, providing a plausible explanation for the increase in lycopene yield observed in this strain. An increase in precursor availability might also have contributed to the improved lycopene production.  aPublisher supplied data 3ametabolism 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3agene overexpression 3alycopene 3acarbon 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3aEscherichia coli 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aCarotenoidsxanalysisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Knockout Techniques 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGlucosephosphate Dehydrogenasexgenetics 2aMetabolic Engineeringxmethods 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathwaysxgenetics 2aPlasmids 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase1 aNambou, Komi1 aWei, Liujing1 aCao, Jingjing1 aImanaka, Tadayuki1 aHua, Qiang0 tBiotechnology letters.g2013 Dec., v. 35, no. 12 p.2137-2145dSpringer-Verlagx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-013-1317-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245009300168300001600261520117300277592002801450650001601478650002601494650001601520650001701536650002101553650001501574650001901589650004001608650002401648650002101672773011001693856004801803852000901851655001201860IND4480295320221123004605.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448029532DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437120201612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolovchenko, A. E.10aPhysiological role of neutral lipid accumulation in eukaryotic microalgae under stresses  ap. 167-176.  aIn the studies of lipid metabolism of unicellular photoautotrophic eukaryotes (microalgae), the main attention is commonly paid to polar membrane lipids and their fatty acid (FA) composition, whereas neutral lipids, represented predominantly by triacylglycerols (TAG), are insufficiently studied. As was reported recently, the role of these compounds in microalgae is not limited to their storage function. It was found that TAG are frequently involved in adaptation to environmental conditions. This review summarizes experimental data obtained so far allowing to distinguish at least three aspects of TAG adaptive function in microalgae. First, these compounds are the source of long-chain FA, the building blocks for membranes necessary for rearrangements of the photosynthetic apparatus. Second, TAG biosynthesis consumes excessive photoassimilates preventing photooxidative injuries under stresses which reduce cell capacity of photosynthesis product utilization. Third, TAG deposited as cytoplasmic oil bodies form a depot for secondary carotenoids in carotenogenic microalgae producing an optical screen protecting the cell against photodamage by excessive PAR.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarotenoids 3aenvironmental factors 3afatty acids 3alipid bodies 3alipid metabolism 3amicroalgae 3aphotosynthesis 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aproduct utilization 3atriacylglycerols0 tRussian journal of plant physiology.g2012 Mar., v. 59, no. 2 p.167-176dSpringer-Verlagx1021-44377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1021443712020161  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012800175520139800303592002801701650001701729650001501746650001701761650002601778650001301804650001201817650001501829650002501844650001301869650002101882650001101903650001101914650001601925651000901941653000801950653000601958653000801964653000801972653000801980653000801988653000701996653000802003653000802011653000702019653000802026653000602034653001102040653000702051653000802058653000902066653000802075653000802083653000902091653002402100653001902124653002402143653003002167653003202197700002202229700002102251773010102272856008602373852000902459655001202468IND60732470420221117035547.0210820e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073247042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1076062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadipari, Masumeh10aEcological monitoring and assessment of habitat suitability for brown bear species in the Oshtorankooh protected area, Iran  aHabitat assessment of species is one of the most important strategies to conserve biodiversity in the protected areas. The main objective of this study is to present an ecological assessment model for habitat management of brown bears using the MaxEnt algorithm in Oshtorankooh protected area, Lorestan. 55 presence points of brown bear and seven environmental variables including slope, elevation, distance from river, distance from road, distance from forest and grassland, distance from cropland and vegetation, and distance from rural area were applied for habitat assessment process. The importance of these variables was investigated by the Jaknikfe test and their predictive rate was assessed by response curves. The distance from the rural area and elevation were respectively the most important factors for modeling the distribution of brown bears in Oshtorankooh protected area. The final suitability map of habitat for brown bear species was classified into four categories: more suitable, suitable, less suitable and unsuitable. An area of 22566.7 ha was determined as a more suitable habitat for brown bears in the study area. The result indicates that the southern and central areas of the study area are more suitable for the species. The result of the model validity was obtained as 0.92, showing that the integrated model was very efficient in the habitat assessment process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrsus arctos 3aalgorithms 3abiodiversity 3abiological assessment 3acropland 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3amodel validation 3amodels 3arivers 3arural areas 3aIran 0aAUC 0aC 0aD.F 0aDEM 0aDoE 0aESA 0aHa 0akm2 0aKML 0aLC 0aLPT 0aM 0aMaxEnt 0aMm 0aNCC 0aNDVI 0aROC 0aSDM 0aUSGS 0aEcological modeling 0aJackknife test 0aHabitat suitability 0aMaximum entropy algorithm 0aOshtorankooh protected area1 aYavari, Ahmadreza1 aGhobadi, Morteza0 tEcological indicators.g2021 July, v. 126 p.107606-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1076063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014900171300001600320520153800336592002801874650001201902650001901914650001901933650002001952650001201972650001301984650001701997650001602014650001602030650002002046650001502066700001802081700003202099773009602131856008102227852000902308655001202317IND50073633720221118023233.0161029e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007363372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-014-1061-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhave, Ajay Gajanan10aEvaluation of hydrological effect of stakeholder prioritized climate change adaptation options based on multi-model regional climate projections  ap. 225-239.  aAn integrated process involving participatory and modelling approaches for prioritizing and evaluating climate change adaptation options for the Kangsabati reservoir catchment is presented here. We assess the potential effects of climate change on water resources and evaluate the ability of stakeholder prioritized adaptation options to address adaptation requirements using the Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) model. Two adaptation options, check dams and increasing forest cover, are prioritized using pair-wise comparison and scenario analysis. Future streamflow projections are generated for the mid-21ˢᵗ century period (2021–2050) using four high resolution (~25 km) Regional Climate Models and their ensemble mean for SRES A1B scenario. WEAP simulations indicate that, compared to a base scenario without adaptation, both adaptation options reduce streamflow. In comparison to check dams, increasing forest cover shows greater ability to address adaptation requirements as demonstrated by the temporal pattern and magnitude of streamflow reduction. Additionally, over the 30 year period, effectiveness of check dams in reducing streamflow decreases by up to 40 %, while that of forest cover increases by up to 47 %. Our study highlights the merits of a comparative assessment of adaptation options and we conclude that a combined approach involving stakeholders, scenario analysis, modelling techniques and multi-model projections may support climate change adaptation decision-making in the face of uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adecision making 3aforests 3aplanning 3astakeholders 3astream flow 3auncertainty 3awater resources 3awatersheds1 aMishra, Ashok1 aRaghuwanshi, Narendra Singh0 tClimatic change.g2014 Mar., v. 123, no. 2 p.225-239dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-014-1061-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245010500181300001800286520185100304592002802155650002202183650002902205650001802234650002202252650002702274650001102301650001502312651001402327653001502341653001902356653002802375653001402403653002002417653002202437700002102459700002702480700002802507773010402535856008702639852000902726655001202735IND60545782420221119035934.0170719e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054578242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.10.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhury, Rubel Biswas12aA novel substance flow analysis model for analysing multi-year phosphorus flow at the regional scale  ap. 1269-1280.  aAchieving sustainable management of phosphorus (P) is crucial for both global food security and global environmental protection. In order to formulate informed policy measures to overcome existing barriers of achieving sustainable P management, there is need for a sound understanding of the nature and magnitude of P flow through various systems at different geographical and temporal scales. So far, there is a limited understanding on the nature and magnitude of P flow over multiple years at the regional scale. In this study, we have developed a novel substance flow analysis (SFA) model in the MATLAB/Simulink® software platform that can be effectively utilized to analyse the nature and magnitude of multi-year P flow at the regional scale. The model is inclusive of all P flows and storage relating to all key systems, subsystems, processes or components, and the associated interactions of P flow required to represent a typical P flow system at the regional scale. In an annual time step, this model can analyse P flow and storage over as many as years required at a time, and therefore, can indicate the trends and changes in P flow and storage over many years, which is not offered by the existing regional scale SFA models of P. The model is flexible enough to allow any modification or the inclusion of any degree of complexity, and therefore, can be utilized for analysing P flow in any region around the world. The application of the model in the case of Gippsland region, Australia has revealed that the model generates essential information about the nature and magnitude of P flow at the regional scale which can be utilized for making improved management decisions towards attaining P sustainability. A systematic reliability check on the findings of model application also indicates that the model produces reliable results.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental protection 3afood security 3aissues and policy 3amaterial flow analysis 3amodels 3aphosphorus 3aAustralia 0aPhosphorus 0aRegional scale 0aSubstance flow analysis 0aModelling 0aSystem analysis 0aMATLAB/Simulink®1 aMoore, Graham A.1 aWeatherley, Anthony J.1 aArora, M.q(Meenakshi),0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 572 p.1269-1280dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.10.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245009700204300001600301520182300317592002802140650000902168650002502177650002302202650002502225650003202250650001802282650001202300650001502312650001502327650001102342650001302353650002202366650002002388650001902408651001002427700002002437773011202457856008202569852000902651655001202660IND60569845320221117233034.0180619e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056984532DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-017-0655-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGautam, Yograj1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1961-959410aAid or abyss? Food assistance programs (FAPs), food security and livelihoods in Humla, Nepal  ap. 227-238.  aOver two thirds of the world’s poorest and most food-insecure people live in developing countries. Since Food Assistance Programs (FAPs) are the most commonly applied food security interventions in these countries, their effective management remains a shared concern in development policies. In addition to addressing short-term relief needs, FAPs have also been funding integrated rural development projects. This paper assesses how FAPs are operationalized in terms of food aid distribution among people in different social and economic strata in Nepal. In addition, it also explores micro-level institutional, technical and geographical factors that influence the implementation of FAPs based community projects in order to analyze their potential efficiency in stimulating local development. Results suggest that FAPs do bring certain benefits, for instance helping to reduce household food deficits as well as acting as a safety net for poorer households, by reducing their reliance on debt as a means of securing food. However, they also suggest that the provision of food by FAPs is not equitable in view of intra-community socio-economic variations and food security needs. Households belonging to the high caste and thus enjoying better food security conditions were found to exploit their political and social networks in order to acquire a disproportionately higher amount of food assistance. Furthermore, the community projects also failed to attract effective local participation which, in turn, led them to becoming incompatible with the needs, priorities and capacities of local communities. From the perspective of ‘targeting’, we conclude that the continuation of FAPs in their existing modalities mostly maintain the status quo, and can even have the effect of exacerbating local inequalities.  aPublisher supplied data 3adebt 3adeveloping countries 3adevelopment policy 3adevelopment projects 3afood and nutrition programs 3afood security 3afunding 3ahouseholds 3alivelihood 3apeople 3apolitics 3arural development 3asocial networks 3asocioeconomics 3aNepal1 aAndersen, Peter0 tFood security.g2017 Apr., v. 9, no. 2 p.227-238dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000074x1876-45177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-017-0655-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03989naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245016800162300001600330520214900346592002802495650002302523650001102546650002302557650001502580650001902595650001602614650001202630650001302642650001302655650001802668650001702686650001802703650000902721650001102730650002602741650001302767650002602780650000902806651001602815653001102831653001702842653002002859653001402879653001802893653001302911653002702924653003302951653002002984700001903004700002303023700002003046700002303066700002503089700002103114773014303135856007603278852000903354655001203363IND60624377020221118104019.0191016e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062437702DNAL7 a10.1093/ajcn/nqy0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacDonell, Sue O12aA comparison of methods for adjusting biomarkers of iron, zinc, and selenium status for the effect of inflammation in an older population: a case for interleukin 6  ap. 932-940.  aOlder people are at risk of micronutrient deficiencies, which can be under- or overestimated in the presence of inflammation. Several methods have been proposed to adjust for the effect of inflammation; however, to our knowledge, none have been investigated in older adults in whom chronic inflammation is common. We investigated the influence of various inflammation-adjustment methods on micronutrient biomarkers associated with anemia in older people living in aged-care facilities in New Zealand. Blood samples were collected from 289 New Zealand aged-care residents aged >65 y. Serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), total body iron (TBI), plasma zinc, and selenium as well as the inflammatory markers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), α₁-acid glycoprotein (AGP), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured. Four adjustment methods were applied to micronutrient concentrations: 1) internal correction factors based on stages of inflammation defined by CRP and AGP, 2) external correction factors derived from the literature, 3) a regression correction model in which reference CRP and AGP were set to the maximum of the lowest decile, and 4) a regression correction model in which reference IL-6 was set to the maximum of the lowest decile. Forty percent of participants had elevated concentrations of CRP, AGP, or both, and 37% of participants had higher than normal concentrations of IL-6. Adjusted geometric mean values for serum ferritin, sTfR, and TBI were significantly lower (P < 0.001), and plasma zinc and selenium were significantly higher (P < 0.001), than the unadjusted values regardless of the method applied. The greatest inflammation adjustment was observed with the regression correction that used IL-6. Subsequently, the prevalence of zinc and selenium deficiency decreased (–13% and –14%, respectively; P < 0.001), whereas iron deficiency remained unaffected. Adjustment for inflammation should be considered when evaluating micronutrient status in this aging population group; however, the approaches used require further investigation, particularly the influence of adjustment for IL-6.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aanemia 3aat-risk population 3abiomarkers 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3aelderly 3aferritin 3ageometry 3aglycoproteins 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3airon 3amodels 3anutrient deficiencies 3aselenium 3atransferrin receptors 3azinc 3aNew Zealand 0aanemia 0ainflammation 0airon deficiency 0aaged-care 0ainterleukin 6 0aferritin 0anutritional assessment 0asoluble transferrin receptor 0atotal body iron1 aMiller, Jody C1 aHarper, Michelle J1 aReid, Malcolm R1 aHaszard, Jillian J1 aGibson, Rosalind S.,1 aHoughton, Lisa A0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2018 June 01, v. 107, no. 6 p.932-940dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45206x1938-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqy0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02089naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010300161300001800264520082300282592002801105650001501133650001501148650001801163650002001181650001301201650001601214650001701230700002001247700002201267700002301289700002201312700002101334700002601355700001701381700001901398700001801417700002201435773012601457856007501583852000901658655001201667IND60753875020221119072357.0211020e20211018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075387502DNAL7 a10.1039/d1gc02634h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartelli, Giulia10aReplacing piperidine in solid phase peptide synthesis: effective Fmoc removal by alternative bases  ap. 8096-8107.  aSolid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is a key technology for the production of pharmaceutical grade peptides, although it represents the worst modality in the pharma segment when considering its Process Mass Intensity (PMI).

In this context, 3-(diethylamino)propylamine (DEAPA) was identified to be a viable alternative to piperidine for Fmoc removal. In addition, the use of DEAPA in N-octyl-pyrrolidone (manual synthesis) or N-octyl pyrrolidone/dimethyl carbonate 8/2 v/v (automated synthesis) was proved to be able to minimize the formation of side products like diastereoisomers and aspartimide-containing derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3acarbonates 3adiastereomers 3agreen chemistry 3apeptides 3apiperidines 3apyrrolidones1 aCantelmi, Paolo1 aPalladino, Chiara1 aMattellone, Alexia1 aCorbisiero, Dario1 aFantoni, Tommaso1 aTolomelli, Alessandra1 aMacis, Marco1 aRicci, Antonio1 aCabri, Walter1 aFerrazzano, Lucia0 tGreen chemistry.g2021 Oct. 18, v. 23, no. 20 p.8096-8107dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1gc02634h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245011100205300001600316500001900332520172900351536031802080592002802398596008802426650002302514650001002537650000902547650001802556650001302574650002202587650001802609650000902627650001202636653001502648653001602663653002102679653001202700653001202712653002002724653002302744653001902767653001702786700002402803700002102827773011502848856008002963852000903043655001203052IND60737982120221122204058.0210520e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073798212DNAL7 a10.1177/02601060209805322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChopra, Chandni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5202-657410aDoes diet play a role in the prevention and management of depression among adolescents? A narrative review  ap. 243-263.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDepression is one of the major causes of illness and disability, while suicide is the second leading cause of death amongst adolescents. Although many factors determine the mental health of an individual, diet has been gaining popularity as a key modifiable factor in the prevention and management of depression. Nutritional Psychiatry is an emerging field where researchers suggest that the food we consume influences our mental well-being. This review aims to explore the significance of diet, nutrient deficiencies, imbalances, and unhealthy dietary patterns in the prevention and management of unipolar depression or major depressive disorder among adolescents. Electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and MEDLINE were searched using keywords such as “mental health,” “depression,” “adolescents,” “diet,” “dietary pattern,” and pertinent articles (N = 68) were retrieved and reviewed. The Mediterranean and traditional diets rich in complex carbohydrates, omega-3 fatty acids, B-group vitamins and several amino acids have shown negative correlation with the incidence of depression. On the other hand, Western dietary patterns (sweetened beverages, processed/ junk food, and foods rich in saturated fatty acids), along with low consumption of fruits and vegetables have been linked to an increased risk of depression among adolescents. Dietary modification can prove to be a cost-effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of depression among adolescents. Diet and nutrition need to be recognized as key modifiable targets for the prevention of mental disorders and nutritional medicine should be considered as an integral part of psychiatric treatment.  aFunding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the University Grants Commission (BININ00754263 U).

F.10aVapor Density of Soil-Applied Dieldrin as Related to Soil-Water Content, Temperature, and Dieldrin Concentration  ap. 509-511.  aepub  aVapor densities of dieldrin (principal constituent HEOD-hexachloro-epoxyoctahydro-endo, exo-dimethanonaphthalene) in dieldrin-soil mixtures increased with temperature and dieldrin concentration but were not affected by soil-water content until the water content decreased below that equivalent of one molecular layer of water. Vapor densities dropped to very low values when the water content fell below this level, but increased again as water was added to the dry soil, indicating that the drying effect is reversible. When more than a monomolecular layer of water was present in the soil, vapor density increased with increasing soil dieldrin (HEOD) concentration until a saturation vapor density equal to that of HEOD without soil [54, 202, and 676 ng HEOD/liter at 20, 30, and 40C, respectively (9)] was reached at approximately 25 ppm HEOD. This implies that surface applications of dieldrin and probably other similar chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides will volatilize as rapidly from mineral soils as from the pure materials until the concentration at the surface falls to relatively low levels. The data indicate that loss of water, per se, is not required for significant rates of volatilization to occur from soils or other surfaces on which water can successfully compete for adsorption sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adieldrin 3adrying 3amineral soils 3asoil water content 3atemperature 3avapors 3avolatilization 3awater content1 aCliath, M.

This objective can be reached by proper shaping of vegetation structure in green spaces, including urban wastelands, on the basis of e.g. investigation of relations between bees and their food plants. We evaluated the attractiveness of vegetation to the Apiformes, as an indicator of food availability in wastelands, in the city of Bydgoszcz and its suburbs. In respect of species richness and abundance, early-spring bees (emergence in March-April) and spring bees (emergence in May) prevailed in suburban habitats. In contrast, in urban wastelands, summer species of bees (emergence in June) were the richest and most abundant. This was linked with analogous differences in species richness of bee food plants starting to flower in those periods, and various plant life-forms played important roles in individual phenological periods. In the case of early-spring and spring bee species, the differences concerned primarily polylectic and cleptoparasitic bees, which prevailed in suburban habitats. Polylectic bees that emerged in summer were more abundant in urban habitats. No such a relationship was observed for oligolectic species, whose occurrence depends on the presence of a narrow group of bee food plant species, irrespective of their location and degree of human disturbance. We also found that trees and shrubs were major sources of food for the dominant bee species in early spring and spring. Among native plants, the most important role was played by apophytes (i.e. native plants typically growing on disturbed land) starting to flower in spring. Our results can be used by managers of urban landscape to shape urban vegetation so that it provides a continuous supply of food for bees and other pollinating insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abees 3adisturbed land 3afood availability 3afood plants 3alandscapes 3aphenology 3aspecies richness 3aspring 3asummer 3avegetation 3avegetation structure 0aApiformes 0aBiological indicators 0aUrban ecosystem 0aEnvironmental management 0aGreen spaces 0aUrban green areas1 aBanaszak-Cibicka, Weronika1 aSobieraj-Betlińska, Anna1 aWaldon-Rudzionek, Barbara1 aHoffmann, Renata0 tEcological indicators.g2021 July, v. 126 p.107616-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1076163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245011300152300001800265520101800283592002801301650001901329650001501348650001401363650002301377650001301400650002001413650001201433650001401445650002101459650002001480650001601500650001901516650002501535700001901560700001701579700001501596700001801611700001501629700001701644700001601661773012401677856007401801852000901875655001201884IND60662655420221116212642.0190906e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066265542DNAL7 a10.1039/c2gc35150a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Jun10aOne-pot conversion of CO₂ and glycerol to value-added products using propylene oxide as the coupling agent  ap. 1743-1748.  aThe effective conversion of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and glycerol is an interesting topic in green chemistry. In this work, we studied the simultaneous transformation of CO₂ and glycerol to value-added products using propylene oxide (PO) as coupling agent catalyzed by alkali metal halides. The effects of reaction temperature, CO₂ pressure, reaction time, amount of catalyst, and PO to glycerol molar ratio on the reaction were investigated. It was discovered that the coupled catalytic reaction could produce glycerol carbonate (GC), propylene glycol (PG) and propylene carbonate (PC) very effectively using KI, an abundant and cheap salt, as the catalyst. The main reasons are that glycerol and PG are not only the reactant and product, respectively, but also act as the effective co-catalysts to promote the key step of the coupled reaction, and the reaction is thermodynamically favorable. This effective and atom economic route to convert glycerol and CO₂ simultaneously has great potential application.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aglycerol 3agreen chemistry 3ahalides 3apropylene 3apropylene glycol 3apropylene oxide 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3avalue-added products1 aSong, Jinliang1 aLiu, Huizhen1 aLiu, Jinli1 aZhang, Zhaofu1 aJiang, Tao1 aFan, Honglei1 aHan, Buxing0 tGreen chemistry.g2012 June 1, v. 14, no. 6 p.1743-1748dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2gc35150a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010000167506010400267506007600371506011700447520101800564592002801582506003701610650001601647650002001663650001701683650001601700650001001716653001501726653002401741653003101765653002601796700001601822700001501838773015101853856008202004852000902086655001202095IND60786255820221207123503.0220914e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078625582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2022.1029412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPitkänen, T.P.10aQuantifying the effects of competition on the dimensions of Scots pine and Norway spruce crowns  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aInter-tree competition can be assessed using relatively simple indices derived from tree diameters, heights and locations, but they have often been found to be deficient for predicting tree growth. To better understand these linkages, we measure dimensions of Scots pine and Norway spruce crowns, which are assumed to be affected by competition pressure. We extract these features from terrestrial laser scanning point clouds and model their dependencies on competition. Our results indicate that while competition is a major determinant for crown morphology, the characteristics and most applicable indices of the two species are contrasting. We interpret our results primarily by light competition: pines are seeking for light and invest their resources on widening the crown only in suitable conditions, while spruce may grow large despite of shortage of light. We conclude that shade tolerance affects strongly on the identification of actual competitors, which should be addressed when modelling competition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPicea abies 3ashade tolerance 3aspatial data 3atree growth 3atrees 0aTree crown 0aCompetition indices 0aTerrestrial laser scanning 0aTree growth modelling1 aBianchi, S.1 aKangas, A.0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2022 Aug., v. 112 p.102941-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.1029413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245012700161300001600288520160500304592002801909596005401937596007501991596014202066650002702208650001502235650001802250650001602268650000902284650001002293650001002303650001602313650001202329650002102341650001702362650002202379650002002401650001602421700001302437700001702450700001702467700005302484773011102537856008302648852000902731655001202740IND60773512920221120184317.0220417e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077351292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10126-022-10109-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Na10aComparative piRNAs Profiles Give a Clue to Transgenerational Inheritance of Sex-Biased piRNAs in Cynoglossus semilaevis  ap. 335-344.  aPiwi interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are involved in the epigenetic and post-transcriptional gene silencing of retrotransposons in germ line cells, especially in spermatogenesis. There are many related reports on model organisms, such as flies and mice. In fish, however, there are few studies on piRNAs. Cynoglossus semilaevis, a benthic warm water flatfish, with remarkable sexual dimorphism, especially the “pseudo males” with sex reversal, mating with normal females to produce viable offspring, is an ideal material for the study of sex development. Here, sperm piwi-interacting RNAs profiles of Cynoglossus semilaevis were characterized, comparing between male and pseudomale groups. Differential piRNAs were identified with their predicted and annotated targets. Attention was then focused on candidate piRNAs associated with sex development and methylation. We continued to compare the expression levels of 10 candidates differentially expressed piRNAs in F1 spermatozoa. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that five of the ten piRNAs showed sex bias consistent with parental sequencing results, with four significantly higher expression level in sperm of five males offspring than that of pseudomales, while one piRNAs showed the opposite expression profile. The five signature piRNAs (piR-mmu-49600337, piR-mmu-95849, piR-xtr-7474223, piR-xtr-1790334, and piR-mmu-4491546) could be employed as male-specific molecular biomarkers for C. semilaevis. Besides, this study also implied the possibility of transgenerational inheritance of sex-biased piRNAs exiting in sperm of Cynoglossus semilaevis.  aPublisher supplied data  a17JCQNJC15000ctianjin natural science foundation  a201604090ctransformation project of tianjin agricultural achievements  aCARS-47-Z01ccollaborative innovation center for modern science and technology and industrial development of jiangxi traditional medicine 3aCynoglossus semilaevis 3abiomarkers 3abiotechnology 3aepigenetics 3afish 3agenes 3amales 3amethylation 3aprogeny 3aretrotransposons 3asex reversal 3asexual dimorphism 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatozoa1 aJia, Lei1 aDeng, Qiuxia1 aZhu, Chunhua1 aZhang, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9157-89880 tMarine biotechnology.g2022 Apr., v. 24, no. 2 p.335-344dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870069x1436-22287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-022-10109-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245011300207300001600320520139900336592002801735650001701763650003001780650002001810650002301830650002501853650002201878650001601900700001901916700002301935700001901958700001801977700005601995700005502051700005902106700002102165700005602186773011402242856008502356852000902441655001202450IND60612576620221120101034.0190416e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061257662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwarz, Nina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4624-488X10aUnderstanding biodiversity-ecosystem service relationships in urban areas: A comprehensive literature review  ap. 161-171.  aPositive relationships between biodiversity and urban ecosystem services (UES) are widely implied within both the scientific and policy literatures, along with the tacit suggestion that enhancing urban green infrastructure will automatically improve both biodiversity and UES. However, it is unclear how much published empirical evidence exists to support these assumptions. We conducted a review of studies published between 1990 and May 2017 that examined urban biodiversity ecosystem service (BES) relationships. In total, we reviewed 317 publications and found biodiversity and UES metrics mentioned 944 times. Only 228 (24%) of the 944 mentions were empirically tested. Among these, 119 (52%) demonstrated a positive BES relationship. Our review showed that taxonomic metrics were used most often as proxies for biodiversity, with very little attention given to functional biodiversity metrics. Similarly, the role of particular species, including non-natives, and specific functional traits are understudied. Finally, we found a paucity of empirical evidence underpinning urban BES relationships. As urban planners increasingly incorporate UES delivery consideration to their decision-making, researchers need to address these substantial knowledge gaps to allow potential trade-offs and synergies between biodiversity conservation and the promotion of UES to be adequately accounted for.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3adecision making 3aecosystem services 3agreen infrastructure 3aissues and policy 3aurban areas1 aMoretti, Marco1 aBugalho, Miguel N.1 aDavies, Zoe G.1 aHaase, Dagmar1 aHack, Jochen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8060-79901 aHof, Angela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0763-110X1 aMelero, Yolanda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4337-14481 aPett, Tristan J.1 aKnapp, Sonja1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5792-46910 tEcosystem services.g2017 Oct., v. 27 p.161-171dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001500137245010700152300001800259500002000277520142000297592002801717596005401745650002401799650001301823650001401836650001501850650001601865650001101881650001901892650002801911650001501939650002301954650001301977650001201990650002002002650001002022650001902032650001802051650003002069650002302099650001002122700001602132700005902148700001502207700005102222700005302273773012602326856007102452852000902523655001202532IND60701313420221119023348.0200710e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070131342DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.58192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Kaidi10aEvaluation of the efficacy of benzothiazole against the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst)  ap. 2726-2735.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: In the context of the resistance development and health risks of currently used fumigants, it is urgent to seek more effective and ecofriendly compounds for stored‐product pest control. The microbial volatile compound benzothiazole is known to have fungicidal and insecticidal activity; however, its detailed efficacy on storage pests is largely unknown. RESULTS: Benzothiazole was identified for its great ovicidal, larvicidal, pupicidal and adulticidal activity against Tribolium castaneum, and exhibited potent repellency against T. castaneum. The benzothiazole concentrations and developmental stage of T. castaneum were the key factors affecting the insecticidal effects. Adults of T. castaneum exposed to benzothiazole for as long as 168 h showed a decrease in progeny production. Based on 7 days of fumigation in the model food system, benzothiazole at 0.12 mg mL⁻¹ provided an efficacy of 96% and completely inhibited the number of offspring. Safety profile assessment showed that benzothiazole did not affect the germination rate of wheat seeds but had a slight negative effect on seedling growth. However, sufficient ventilation and soil nutrients could relieve this adverse impact. CONCLUSION: Benzothiazole is a strong fumigant and repellent against T. castaneum. This study provides a good perspective of novel ways to control T. castaneum. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0201600cNational Key R&D Program of China 3aTribolium castaneum 3aTriticum 3afumigants 3afumigation 3agermination 3aimagos 3ainsect control 3ainsecticidal properties 3alarvicides 3amodel food systems 3aovicides 3aprogeny 3aseedling growth 3aseeds 3asoil nutrients 3astorage pests 3astored product protection 3avolatile compounds 3awheat1 aHe, Leiming1 aZhang, Zhengqun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1726-24721 aZhang, Tao1 aMu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9836-478X1 aLiu, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0271-36320 tPest management science.g2020 Aug., v. 76, no. 8 p.2726-2735dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.58193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245009300207300001600300520156900316592002801885650002501913650002401938650001901962650002101981650001702002650001902019650002602038650002302064650001202087650001102099650003802110650002202148650002102170650001502191650001502206650001502221650001402236650001302250650002102263650000902284650002002293651001002313651001702323653002102340653001902361653002902380653001902409653001302428653001202441700002102453700002302474700002602497700001702523700002002540773009902560856008502659852000902744655001202753IND60612576720221120101134.0200210e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061257672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2018.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEverard, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0251-848210aCan control of invasive vegetation improve water and rural livelihood security in Nepal?  ap. 125-133.  aNepal’s predominantly rural population depends on the ecosystem services of heterogeneous mountainous landscapes that are degrading under changing climate and development pressures. Invasive alien plants (IAPs) compound threats to ecosystem services including water resource security from mid-hill springs, though implications for Nepal’s water resources are under-researched. South Africa’s Working for Water (WfW) programme addresses linked policy priorities related to IAP management including water, biodiversity and employability. We use the STEEP (Social, Technological, Environmental, Economic, Political) framework to explore success criteria behind WfW and their potential translation into the geographically, culturally and politically different Nepali context, including local considerations at three sites in Kavrepalanchok district. An adapted WfW approach could potentially contribute to water, food, biodiversity, forest, soil, gender equity, community development and security outcomes in Nepal, delivering national and international policy priorities. Evidence from study sites suggests four priority IAPs – Lantana camara, Ageratina adenophora, Chromolaena odorata and Pinus roxburghii – of differing characteristics, extents of invasion and perceived impacts at selected sites requiring control. These initial observations warrant trial management of IAPs in a test area with monitoring to evaluate outcomes for water, food and livelihood security, with potential for subsequent regional or national roll-out of a management programme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgeratina adenophora 3aChromolaena odorata 3aLantana camara 3aPinus roxburghii 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3acommunity development 3aecosystem services 3aforests 3agender 3ainternational policy and programs 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3alivelihood 3amonitoring 3amountains 3apolitics 3arural population 3asoil 3awater resources 3aNepal 3aSouth Africa 0aInvasive species 0aWater security 0aSocio-ecological systems 0aSustainability 0aConflict 0aPoverty1 aGupta, Nishikant1 aChapagain, Prem S.1 aShrestha, Bharat Babu1 aPreston, Guy1 aTiwari, Prakash0 tEcosystem services.g2018 Aug., v. 32 p.125-133dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2018.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013400168300001600302500001400318520113700332592002801469650002201497650002301519650000901542650001301551650001101564650001101575650002001586650001501606650002101621653001901642653003101661653002201692653003101714700001701745700001801762700001301780700001501793773010201808856008501910852000901995655001202004IND60714856220221120162424.0201216e20210122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071485622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.10.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, Guishang10aIsothermal reduction of V2O5 powder using H2 as oxygen carrier: Thermodynamic evaluation, reaction sequence, and kinetic analysis  ap. 785-794.  aNAL-light  aV₂O₃ was prepared by reducing V₂O₅ powder using H₂ as the oxygen carrier. To initially determine reasonable experimental for the H₂-based reduction, oxygen potential and equilibrium calculations were performed. The reaction sequence of the V₂O₅ powder reduction was predicted by VO phase diagram assessments and was then verified by XRD and XPS measurements under various experimental condition. It was observed that the reduction followed the path of V₂O₅-VₙO₂ₙ₊₁(n = 3 and 6)-VO₂-VₙO₂ₙ₋₁(n = 7, 6, 5, 4, and 3)-V₂O₃. Isothermal reduction experiments and kinetic analysis were performed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at 813 K, 823 K, and 833 K, under a pure H₂ gas flow. The entire reduction process, from V₂O₅ to V₂O₃, obeyed the unreacted shrinking core model (with random instant nucleation and three-dimensional growth of nuclei) and was controlled by chemical reactions. Mathematical fitting showed that the reduction process could be described as G(α) = [−ln(1-α)]¹/³, and the apparent activation energy was determined to be 47.11 kJ·mol⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3achemical reactions 3aflow 3akinetics 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aphysical phases 3atechnology 3athermogravimetry 0aV2O5 reduction 0aThermogravimetric analysis 0aReaction sequence 0aApparent activation energy1 aXiang, Junyi1 aZhong, Dapeng1 aLi, Gang1 aLv, Xuewei0 tPowder technology.g2021 Jan. 22, v. 378 p.785-794dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.10.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245010800165300001600273500001900289520150700308536012001815592002801935650001101963650002301974650002801997650001902025650001702044650001902061650002302080650001802103650002402121651001002145653001402155653000802169653001202177653000802189653000902197653001102206700005802217700002602275773011502301856008002416852000902496655001202505IND60737982620221122204041.0210520e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073798262DNAL7 a10.1177/02601060209823482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Pradeep10aPrevalence and risk factors of anaemia among men: A study based on Empowered Action Group states, India  ap. 191-198.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDespite various programmes initiated by the Government of India, the nutritional indicators are not encouraging, as several problems like undernutrition, malnutrition and anaemia – still persist in the country, especially in the Empowered Action Group (EAG) states. Because of the dearth of studies regarding anaemia among men in India, the present study aimed to determine its prevalence in this population in the EAG states and to analyse its geographical and socio-demographic determinants. The study utilized nationally representative, cross-sectional survey data from round 4 of the National Family Health Survey conducted in 2015–16. Bivariate analysis along with binary logistic regression were performed to assess the predictors of anaemia among men in the EAG states. Around a quarter of the men in the EAG states suffered from anaemia. A similar high-prevalence pattern was observed across the EAG states. Wherein, Bihar and Jharkhand had the highest prevalence of anaemia while Uttarakhand showed the lowest. Age, place of residence, marital status and caste were positively associated with the likelihood of anaemia among men in the EAG states. Focusing on the EAG states, this study considered the severity of anaemia as a public health problem among men. Strategies to reduce the burden of anaemia among this population are needed. The government should formulate programmes targeting anaemia specifically, and improving the nutritional status among men in general in the EAG states.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3abivariate analysis 3across-sectional studies 3ahealth surveys 3amalnutrition 3amarital status 3anutritional status 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3aIndia 0aNutrition 0amen 0aanaemia 0aEAG 0adiet 0ahealth1 aSharma, Himani1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8317-27371 aPatel, Kamalesh Kumar0 tNutrition and health.g2021 June, v. 27, no. 2 p.191-198dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl34213x2047-945X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/02601060209823483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245010300187300001600290520142600306592002801732650001401760650001701774650001301791650001401804650001501818650002701833650001201860650001001872650001101882650001401893650001301907650002501920650000901945650001001954650000901964650004201973650005602015650001602071650003802087650006702125650004002192650005902232650001402291650005502305650006602360650002902426650006502455700001402520700001402534700001802548700001802566773009302584856004802677852000902725655001202734IND50072587020221120064841.0140201e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007258702DNAL7 a242582422pmid7 a10.1007/s00299-013-1536-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Chengqiang10aNitrogen fertilizer increases spikelet number per panicle by enhancing cytokinin synthesis in rice  ap. 363-371.  aKEY MESSAGE : Nitrogen fertilizer enhances local cytokinin synthesis to increase flower numbers in the panicles of rice. Localized cytokinin biosynthesis is an important response to nitrogen. Flower number per panicle is one of the most important traits in rice productivity determination. The number of flowers is established in the early stages of panicle development. Nitrogen fertilizer application before panicle initiation is well known to increase flower number. Nitrogen increases cytokinin (CKs) biosynthesis in plants, and CKs have very similar effects as nitrogen fertilizer on panicle branching. The effects of nitrogen fertilizer on panicle branching may be mediated by CKs, in which accumulation in the inflorescence meristem can regulate panicle development, resulting in increased numbers of flowers and branches. Adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase (IPT) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of CKs biosynthesis. We analyzed the effect of nitrogen fertilizer (urea) on the expression of OsIPT genes (OsIPTs). The results showed that OsIPTs were markedly increased, and CKs accumulated in panicle when nitrogen fertilizer was applied. CKs biosynthesis in the roots and leaves was not up-regulated by nitrogen. These results suggest that nitrogen fertilizer enhances local CKs synthesis to increase flower numbers in the panicles of rice. Localized CKs biosynthesis is an important response to nitrogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine 3abiosynthesis 3abranches 3abranching 3acytokinins 3afertilizer application 3aflowers 3agenes 3aleaves 3ameristems 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3arice 3aroots 3aurea 2aAlkyl and Aryl Transferasesxgenetics 2aCytokininsxbiosynthesisxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aFertilizers 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aInflorescencexdrug effectsxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aNitrogenxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aOryzaxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgrowth & development.1 aYou, Juan1 aChen, Lin1 aWang, Shaohua1 aDing, Yanfeng0 tPlant cell reports.g2014 Feb., v. 33, no. 2 p.363-371dSpringer-Verlagx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-013-1536-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02086naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014900164300001600313520083800329592002801167650001401195650001201209650001301221650001401234650001301248650000901261650002701270650001201297650002501309650001001334651001901344651001101363700001701374700002601391700001401417700001801431700001901449773010601468856008101574852000901655655001201664IND60080754620221118013857.0150216e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008075462DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-014-0164-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRøed, K.

Ten polymorphic microsatellites were characterized among 26 and 45 individual samples obtained from dead trees in the Czech Republic and Norway respectively. All loci were polymorphic in both samples with number of alleles per locus ranged from two to eleven in the Norwegian sample and from two to six in the Czech sample. The genetic difference between the Czech and the Norwegian material were highly significant (P < 0.0001). For several trees the sampled genotypes gave evidence that more than two parents were responsible for the breeding. These microsatellite loci should prove useful in the study of population structure including mate and dispersal patterns for this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucujidae 3aalleles 3abreeding 3adead wood 3agenotype 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparents 3apopulation structure 3atrees 3aCzech Republic 3aNorway1 aBirkemoe, T.1 aSverdrup-Thygeson, A.1 aHorak, J.1 aMidthjell, L.1 aLeinaas, H.

The mechanical properties of such materials should mimic the human tissues they are aiming to replace; to provide the required anatomical shape, the materials must be able to sustain the mechanical forces they will experience when implanted at the defect site. Although the mechanical properties of tissue-engineered scaffolds are of great importance, many human tissues that undergo restoration with engineered materials have not been fully biomechanically characterized. Several compressive and tensile protocols are reported for evaluating materials, but with large variability it is difficult to compare results between studies. Further complicating the studies is the often destructive nature of mechanical testing. Whilst an understanding of tissue failure is important, it is also important to have knowledge of the elastic and viscoelastic properties under more physiological loading conditions. This report aims to provide a minimally destructive protocol to evaluate the compressive and tensile properties of human soft tissues. As examples of this technique, the tensile testing of skin and the compressive testing of cartilage are described. These protocols can also be directly applied to synthetic materials to ensure that the mechanical properties are similar to the native tissue. Protocols to assess the mechanical properties of human native tissue will allow a benchmark by which to create suitable tissue-engineered substitutes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomechanics 3acartilage 3aforces 3ahumans 3amechanical testing 3amedicine 3asynthetic products 3atensile strength 3aviscoelasticity1 aPremakumar, Yaami1 aSeifalian, Alexander1 aButler, Peter Edward1 aSzarko, Matthew0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Dec. 13, , no. 118 p.e54872-e54872dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/548723Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54872/biomechanical-characterization-human-soft-tissues-using-indentation  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02062naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245019700171300001600368520088600384592002801270650001501298650000801313650002601321650002701347650000901374650002701383650001701410650002201427651002001449700002201469700002501491773010601516856008101622852000901703655001201712IND60080754720221118013903.0140809e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008075472DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-014-0165-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuller, Nicholas C.10aIsolation and characterisation of 16 microsatellite markers for the endangered Gould’s long-eared bat (Nyctophilus gouldi) and cross-amplification in the lesser long-eared bat (N. geoffroyi)  ap. 519-522.  aSixteen microsatellite markers were developed for use on two species of long-eared bats (Nyctophilus). 454 pyrosequencing of genomic DNA was conducted on N. gouldi which is listed as endangered in South Australia. Fifteen loci successfully amplified on N. gouldi while nine cross-amplified for use on N. geoffroyi. Two populations from south-eastern Australia were genotyped for each species, comprising 91 individuals for N. gouldi and 70 individuals for N. geoffroyi. There was no evidence of linkage disequilibrium and all loci displayed Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium except Nyg19 and Nyg39 which displayed evidence of null alleles in both N. geoffroyi populations. These markers will prove valuable in assessing connectivity between endangered populations of N. gouldi, and facilitate a comparative investigation into the impacts of habitat fragmentation on two vespertilionids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aDNA 3ahabitat fragmentation 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anull alleles 3asequence analysis 3aSouth Australia1 aCarthew, Susan M.1 aCooper, Steven J.

(Wild Pig) are known to eat the eggs of ground-nesting birds, but it is unknown to what extent they have an impact on populations of Colinus virginianus L. (Northern Bobwhite). We combined data from 2 prior studies conducted on a large ranch in South Texas to assess comparative habit use and selection by Wild Pigs and Bobwhites. Both species were distributed throughout the ranch, but their preferred habitats were very different. Bobwhites favored upland habitats, particularly areas with deep, sandy soils, while Wild Pigs favored low-lying habitats with clay soils. We conclude that depredation of Bobwhite nests by these invasive mammals may be restricted by the thermoregulatory requirement for Wild Pigs to stay near riparian areas. The extent of this effect will depend on the availability and spatial arrangement of water and riparian areas on the landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColinus virginianus 3aSus scrofa 3abirds 3aclay soils 3aeggs 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3alandscapes 3anests 3arangelands 3ariparian areas 3asandy soils 3aswine 3aTexas1 aSieckenius, Shane S.0 tSoutheastern naturalist.g2016, v. 15, no. 3 p.382-393dHumboldt Field Research Institutex1528-70927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1656%2F058.015.03013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002000176245008800196300001500284520126600299592002801565650001301593650001401606650001201620700002401632700001901656773015201675856007001827856009501897990002301992852000902015655001202024IND60608488020221116142111.0190510e20170427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060848802DNAL7 a10.3791/548732doi7 aPMC55651162pmcid7 a285180692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapp, Tobias G.10aModification and functionalization of the guanidine group by tailor-made precursors  ap. e54873.  aThe guanidine group is one of the most important pharmacophoric groups in medicinal chemistry. The only amino acid carrying a guanidine group is arginine. In this article, an easy method for the modification of the guanidine group in peptidic ligands is provided, with an example of RGD-binding integrin ligands. It was recently demonstrated that the distinct modification of the guanidine group in these ligands allows for the selective modulation of the subtype (e.g., between the subtypes αv and α5). Moreover, a formerly unknown strategy for the functionalization via the guanidine group was demonstrated, and the synthetic approach is reviewed in this document. The modifications described here involve terminally (Nω) alkylated and acetylated guanidine groups. For the synthesis, tailor-made precursor molecules are synthesized, which are then subjected to a reaction with an orthogonally deprotected amine to transfer the pre-modified guanidine group. For the synthesis of alkylated guanidines, precursors based on N,N′-Di-Boc-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine are used to synthesize acylated compounds, the precursor of choice being a correspondingly acylated derivative of N-Boc-S-methylisothiourea, which can be obtained in one- and two-step reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3aintegrins 3aligands1 aFottner, Maximilian1 aKessler, Horst0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Apr. 27, , no. 122 p.e54873-e54873dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/548733Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54873/modification-functionalization-guanidine-group-tailor-made  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245010300171300002000274520107600294592002801370650001101398650001601409650002401425650001601449650002801465650001201493650001101505650001501516650001401531650001201545653001601557653002401573653003001597653002301627653002601650700005601676700005901732700005901791700005901850700006201909773014201971856007802113852000902191655001202200IND60634975320221119065604.0190327e20190312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063497532DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b190382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntartis, Dimitrios A.10aNanofibrillar Si Helices for Low-Stress, High-Capacity Li⁺ Anodes with Large Affine Deformations  ap. 11715-11721.  aWe report on the chemical lithiation of long microscale helices composed of densely packed amorphous silicon (aSi) nanofibrils, fabricated by glancing angle deposition (GLAD) through e-beam evaporation. In situ electron microscopy and companion finite element modeling demonstrate that the nanofibrillar structure of the aSi helices allows for 2 orders of magnitude faster effective rates for Li diffusion (D₀ = 10–¹⁰ cm²/s) compared to solid aSi nanowires, while also averting fragmentation during lithiation. More importantly, it is shown that specific helical geometries can accommodate large, lithium-induced, volumetric expansions without shape distortion. A major advantage of the helical nanostructures is that the compressive force generated due to lithiation-induced expansion is an order of magnitude smaller than in straight nanocolumns that permanently buckle during lithiation.

The minimum and maximum ⁷Be activity concentrations were observed during 2000 and 2009, corresponding with the maximum and minimum solar activity, respectively. The maximum ¹³⁷Cs activity concentration found in May–June 1998 was due to the accident at Algeciras in Spain. The deposition velocities of ⁷Be, ¹³⁷Cs and ²¹⁰Pb depended on the precipitation rate, and attained maximum values during dry seasons. The investigated radionuclides may be used as atmospheric tracers, especially in long-term periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aaerosols 3aair 3acesium radioisotopes 3ahumidity 3aradioactivity 3atemperature 3aMonaco 3aSpain1 aBetti, Maria1 aNies, Hartmut1 aPovinec, P.,0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2011 Nov., v. 102, no. 11 p.1045-1054dElsevier Ltdx0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2011.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245004700165520169000212592002801902650002001930650000901950650001101959650001201970650002401982650000902006650001102015650001602026651001302042700002402055700001802079700002102097700003502118773012102153856007602274852000902350655001202359IND60754133520221119223535.0211023e20211014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075413352DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111029642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzevedo, Alexandre 10aPet Reptiles—Are We Meeting Their Needs?  aThe ability to meet the needs of each species in captivity is at the heart of the ethical debate on the acceptability of keeping reptiles and other animals as pets. Little is known about the ability of reptile owners to understand their pets’ behavior and to meet their welfare requirements. In this study, we surveyed pet reptile owners in Portugal (N = 220) to assess their behavioral knowledge and the provision of essential husbandry needs. Although two-thirds of respondents (68%) scored very good to excellent in terms of knowledge of their pet reptile’s behaviors, only 15% of respondents met four essential reptile husbandry needs (temperature, lighting, diet and refuge) and 43% met two or less. None of the respondents reported their reptile’s welfare as very poor, and only a single respondent reported it as poor. Logistic regression model showed that while snake owners had fourteen times higher odds of reporting adequate husbandry provision, lizard owners had the highest odds of reporting good or very good welfare despite providing less of their animals’ basic husbandry needs. These results suggest that many pet reptiles in Portugal live in, at best, ‘controlled deprivation’ and are at risk of suffering poor welfare throughout their captive lives. Moreover, behaviors indicative of poor welfare and captivity stress were considered ‘normal’ by up to one quarter of respondents. We suggest that the frequency of these behaviors in pet reptiles has led to their acceptance as normal, precluding the search for ways to prevent them. These results suggest that campaigns aimed at challenging the current norm for adequate reptile welfare are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaptive animals 3adiet 3aethics 3alizards 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asnakes 3atemperature 3aPortugal1 aGuimarães, Leonor 1 aFerraz, Joel 1 aWhiting, Martin 1 aMagalhães-Sant’Ana, Manuel 0 tAnimals.g2021 Oct. 14, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111029643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05761naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245009400170300001200264500001500276520369600291592002803987650001804015650001204033650001304045650002004058650003104078650001604109650001304125650002304138650002504161650002004186650001004206650000804216650001104224650001504235650001204250650001304262650004004275650002204315650001504337650001204352650002604364650001604390650003704406650001104443650005204454650001204506650002204518650002504540650000804565650001104573650001004584651002304594651001404617651001404631651001604645651001104661651001104672653003004683653003204713700001604745700001704761700001704778700001704795773011104812856008304923852000905006655001205015IND60549185820221119213327.0160907e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054918582DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-05-13-0578-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez, R. T.10aFirst Report of Tomato spotted wilt virus in Peppers and Tomato in the Dominican Republic  ap. 163.  a2019-12-06  aIn the Dominican Republic, green bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) are widely cultivated under protected greenhouse conditions as high value commercial crops for export. For the past 2 to 3 years, pepper and tomato have been observed in protected crop facilities in Jarabacoa and Constanza in the North Region with chlorotic and necrotic spots and rings on leaves, petioles, and stems, leaf bronzing, and tip necrosis. Fruits on symptomatic pepper and tomato plants showed concentric rings, irregular chlorotic blotches and deformation, and uneven maturation and development. Incidence on pepper and tomato was 20 to 100% and 5 to 20%, respectively. In initial tests, leaves and fruits from each of 20 symptomatic tomato and pepper plants from several greenhouse facilities were reactive in Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV; genus Tospovirus, family Bunyaviridae) immunostrip assays (Agdia, Inc., Elkhart, IN). Since these immunostrips are known to react with other tospoviruses, such as Tomato chlorotic spot virus (TCSV) and Groundnut ring spot virus, additional molecular diagnostic assays were conducted. Leaf and fruit samples from symptomatic plants were imprinted on nitrocellulose membrane (NCM) (2), air-dried, and sent to Washington State University for confirmatory tests. Viral nucleic acids were eluted from NCM discs (1) and subjected to reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using primers gL3637 (CCTTTAACAGTDGAAACAT) and gL4435 (CATDGCRCAAGARTGRTARACAGA) designed to amplify a portion of the L RNA segment of several tospoviruses (3). A single DNA product of ~800 bp was amplified from all samples. Amplicons from two tomato (leaf and fruit) and one pepper fruit samples were cloned separately into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Two independent clones per amplicon were sequenced in both orientations. Sequence analyses of these clones (GenBank Accession Nos. KF 219673 to 75) showed 100% nucleotide sequence identity among themselves and 97% identity with corresponding L RNA sequences of pepper isolates of TSWV from Taiwan (HM180088) and South Korea (HM581940), 94 to 95% with tomato isolates of TSWV from South Korea (HM581934) and Hawaii (AY070218), and 89% with a tomato isolate from Indonesia (FJ177301). These results further confirm the presence of TSWV in symptomatic tomato and pepper plants. A comparison of TSWV sequences from the Dominican Republic with TSWV isolates from the United States and other countries in the Caribbean region could not be made due to the absence of corresponding sequences of the L-RNA of the virus from these countries in GenBank. TSWV-positive samples were negative for TCSV in RT-PCR, indicating the absence of this tospovirus that has been reported in the Caribbean region (data not shown). To our knowledge, this is the first confirmed report of TSWV in tomatoes and peppers in the Dominican Republic. The presence of vector thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, on symptomatic plants was also confirmed, suggesting a role in the spread of TSWV under greenhouse conditions. Recent surveys identified some greenhouses with 100% symptomatic peppers. The presence of TSWV in tomato and pepper has important implications for the domestic and export vegetable industry in the Dominican Republic because of the broad host range of the virus (4). It is critical for commercial producers to monitor TSWV and deploy appropriate management strategies to limit virus spread.References: (1) O. J. Alabi et al. J. Virol. Methods 154:111, 2008.

The DAE molecular junctions show two stable electrical states, a closed state (high conductance) or an open state (low conductance), which are created upon illumination with UV or visible light, respectively. For the Au-DAE-MLG junction structure, we observe that the current levels between the two conductance states are separated by 2 orders of magnitude. However, in a real-time measurement, we observe only unidirectional switching behavior from the open to the closed state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3agold 3agraphene 3alighting 0amolecular electronics 0aphotoswitching 0adiarylethene 0aself-assembled monolayer 0agraphene electrode1 aJang, Yeonsik1 aMartin, Léon,1 aKim, Dongku1 aJeong, Hyunhak1 aKang, Keehoon1 aLee, Woocheol1 aKim, Junwoo1 aHwang, Wang-Taek1 aXiang, Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5632-63551 aScheer, Elke1 aKabdulov, Mikhail1 aHuhn, Tom,1 aPauly, Fabian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8017-23791 aLee, Takhee1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5988-52190 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 11, no. 12 p.11645-11653dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b193723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01945naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009500164300001800259520096000277592002801237650001401265650001001279650002501289650002801314650002401342650002401366700001501390700001701405700001101422700001501433773010201448856004801550852000901598655001201607IND4483993920221116143542.0120715e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448399392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-012-5116-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, ZaiXiang10aFramework for dissection of complex cytonuclear epistasis by a two-dimensional genome scan  ap. 2675-2680.  aEpistasis between cytoplasmic and nuclear genes is the primary genetic component of complex quantitative traits. Genetic dissection of cytonuclear epistasis is fundamentally important to understand the genetic architecture of complex traits. In this study, a two-dimensional genome scan strategy was employed to evaluate the contribution of cytoplasm, quantitative trait loci (QTL), QTLÃQTL interactions and QTLÃQTLÃcytoplasm interactions to the phenotypic variation. The p-value and parameter value for each genetic effect were calculated by multiple regression analysis. A stepwise approach was suggested to build confidence in candidate QTL on the basis of q-value estimation, false discovery rate calculation and Bonferroni adjustment. A fine-scale grid scan strategy was proposed for further analysis of peaks of interest. Plant height in maize was used as an example to illustrate the efficiency of the two-dimensional genome scan strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepistasis 3agenes 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3aquantitative traits 3aregression analysis1 aHu, ZhiQiu1 aYang, ZeFeng1 aYu, Bo1 aXu, ChenWu0 tChinese science bulletin.g2012 July, v. 57, no. 21 p.2675-2680dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5116-0  aDNAL 7aarticle01511naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245013800162500002200300520035900322592002800681650001400709650002300723650002300746650001300769650002000782653002800802653002400830653001800854653002000872700001600892700001500908700001500923700001600938700001400954773006400968856008401032852000901116655001201125IND60559635220221120052855.0161216s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055963522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.11.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bin10a“One pot” synthesis of tertiary amines: Ru(II) catalyzed direct reductive N-benzylation of imines with benzyl bromide derivatives  aPre-press version  aThe direct reductive N-benzylation of imines by reaction with benzyl bromide derivatives, in the presence of [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 catalyst and PhSiH3, is performed under mild conditions without additional base.

The observed yields of essential oils increase significantly from arid to humid climate. A significant qualitative and quantitative variation of the chemical composition according to the studied localities was revealed. Plants collected from the Inferior Arid bioclimatic region (Gafsa) presented chamazulene, α-thujone and camphor as the main components of their essential oils. However, for Superior Arid (Kasserine) and Semi Arid (El Kef) bioclimatic regions, camphor and chamazulene are the dominant constituents followed by linalool for Kasserine and bornyl acetate for El Kef originated oils. The Humid bioclimatic zone (Ghar Dimaou) showed different chemotype and presented camphor, (Z)-sabinene hydrate and 1-terpinen-4-ol as the major compounds. Based on the two DPPH and ABTS tests, the investigated oils highlighted important in vitro antioxidant capacities which increase significantly from the humid (Ghar Dimaou) to the Inferior Arid bioclimatic zone (Gasfa). Even the investigated essential oils displayed an antimicrobial activity against all the tested bacterial and fungal strains with variable degrees, our findings did not reveal a clear correlation between the antimicrobial properties and the studied bioclimatic zones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia absinthium 3aanti-infective properties 3aantioxidant activity 3abiochemical polymorphism 3abornyl acetate 3acamphor 3achemical composition 3achemotypes 3aenvironmental factors 3aessential oils 3afungi 3ahumid zones 3alinalool 3aoils 3apolymorphism 3aprovenance 3aTunisia 0aArtemisia absinthium L. 0aEssential oils 0aBiological activities 0aEnvironmental factors 0aTunisia1 aGhazghazi, Hanene1 aAyari, Besma1 aAouadhi, Chedia1 aKlay, Imen1 aChograni, Hnya1 aCherif, Ameur1 aZoghlami, Nejia0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2015 Apr., v. 66 p.96-102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.12.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002700141245007700168520141600245592002801661650002001689650001401709650001801723650000901741650001301750651001201763700002301775700002101798700002201819700002101841773012201862856007601984852000902060655001202069IND60754133720221119223543.0211023e20210923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075413372DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111027772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHildebrandt, Frederik 10aArea and Resource Utilization of Group-Housed Horses in an Active Stable  aThe aim of this study was to analyze the utilization of different stable areas of a total of 52 group-housed horses as well as their preferred stable parts and the use of resources. The study was situated in a “HIT Active Stable®” in Northern Germany for a period of 227 observation days. After dividing the whole farm area in a grid of 3 × 3 m, the dataset was examined with and without the pasture area. Furthermore, linear mixed models were applied. On average, horses used 53.2 ± 19 different squares per hour. The observation day (p < 0.001) and the covariate age (p < 0.001) had significant effects on the different squares visited per hour. No significant effects were found for sex (p = 0.30) and breed (p = 0.65) as only geldings and no stallions were part of the group and the distribution of the breeds was unfavorable. The random effect animal showed that the horse-individual estimates from −19.2 to 17.6 different squares visited per hour were quite large. Furthermore, it could be shown that the horses used resources such as feed stalls with a frequency of up to 0.14% more than other paddock areas without resources. Open lying halls with tarp skin were also preferred over the metal hall. The shelters were only partly popular. Use could be visualized with the help of heat maps. This study gives a good overview of the use of individual areas and resources and possible improvements.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3afarm area 3agroup housing 3aheat 3apastures 3aGermany1 aBüttner, Kathrin 1 aSalau, Jennifer 1 aKrieter, Joachim 1 aCzycholl, Irena 0 tAnimals.g2021 Sept. 23, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111027773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245017200171300001600343520170900359592002802068650004402096650003702140650001302177650002802190650001402218650002302232650001802255650001902273650002202292650001602314650001102330650002202341650000902363650001302372650002502385650001302410650001602423650002302439650002102462650002902483653002602512653002402538653002302562653002302585653002002608700002202628700002302650773011802673856008502791852000902876655001202885IND60466235620221120114332.0151123e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046623562DNAL7 a10.1080/02773813.2015.10835842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorge, Michael10aSurface and Bulk Transformation of Thermomechanical Pulp Using Fatty Acyl Chlorides: Influence of Reaction Parameters on Surface, Morphological, and Thermal Properties  ap. 114-128.  aA method is proposed for producing fatty acid esters of thermomechanical pulp (TMP) using fatty acids of intermediate chain length (C6-C12). The end objective is to use a stream of fatty acids produced via refining tall oil from Alberta's pulping mills. Depending on the degree of modification, these treated materials can serve either as reinforcement or as copolymers in composite applications. The effect of reaction conditions—reaction time, reaction temperature, fatty acyl concentration, and fatty acid chain length—on the degree of substitution of the pulp samples was studied. The reaction conditions were applied for each fatty acyl chloride and the pulp samples were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, force tensiometry, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and thermal gravimetric analysis. The degree of substitution (DS) plateaued after two hours at a concentration of 0.25 M of hexanoyl chloride. These conditions were used for the other systems studied. The esterification of the pulp samples was heterogeneous as evident from both the AFM and SIMS images, because of the presence of lignin on the surface. Nevertheless, based on adhesion forces measured using AFM, the surface of the modified pulp samples was less polar. This was also confirmed via contact angle measurements. Also, the changes in chemical functionality were studied using FTIR and XPS with the appearance of peaks characteristic of C˭O (esters) and an increase in intensity of the alkyl shifts, respectively. Finally, it was found that esterification significantly improved the thermal properties of the pulp samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadhesion 3aatomic force microscopy 3achlorides 3acomposite polymers 3acontact angle 3aesterification 3afatty acid esters 3afatty acids 3alignin 3amass spectrometry 3apulp 3arefining 3astrength (mechanics) 3atall oil 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3athermomechanical pulping 0aThermomechanical pulp 0afatty acyl chloride 0asurface properties 0athermal properties 0afiber chemistry1 aMussone, Paolo G.1 aBressler, David C.0 tJournal of wood chemistry and technology.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 36, no. 2 p.114-128dTaylor & Francisx1532-23197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02773813.2015.10835843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245007700158300001600235500001900251520124500270592002801515650001901543650001901562650001401581650001301595650002001608650001501628700001901643700001501662700001601677700002001693773013301713856004801846852000901894655001201903IND50062570620221116143650.0130324e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006257062DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-012-1147-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKe, Xu12aA review of membrane fouling in municipal secondary effluent reclamation  ap. 771-777.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReclamation of municipal secondary effluent for non-potable purposes is considered vital in alleviating the demand for existing limited water supplies while helping to protect remaining water sources from being polluted. In recent decades, reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membrane technologies have become increasingly attractive for reclamation of municipal secondary effluent because they are highly efficient, easy to operate, and economical. However, membrane fouling is a major obstacle in the development of membrane technology in municipal secondary effluent reclamation. This paper reviews three types of membrane fouling in municipal secondary effluent reclamation, namely, effluent organic matter (EfOM) membrane fouling, microbial membrane fouling, and inorganic membrane fouling, as well as their correlation. Membrane fouling by EfOM and microbes are found to be severe, and they are significantly correlated. Most previous studies conducted laboratory-scale experiments of membrane fouling with model organic matters and bacteria, but these model organic matters and bacteria might still be unrepresentative.

In this study, we comprehensively examined the degradation process in Li₂MnO₃, using theoretical density functional computations as well as experimental techniques (in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy). Our study reveals that during the delithiation process, the Li ions mixed in the Mn layer are removed together with those in the Li layer, thereby inducing the release of oxygen atoms. The oxygen loss reaction is energetically favorable at the highly delithiated states, and it can reduce the plateau voltage in the charging curve. Such oxygen loss was observed during or even before the second cycle and furthermore it accelerates the phase transformation of the layered structure to a spinel one. Our results also suggest that oxygen release can be prevented when H ions are exchanged with Li ions during the charging process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abatteries 3acathodes 3aelectric power 3aions 3amanganese 3aoxygen 3aphase transition1 aKim, Kihong1 aJung, Changhoon1 aSŏ, Sŭng-u.,1 aMin, Kyoungmin1 aLee, Hyo Sug1 aPark, Gyeong-Su1 aShin, Jaikwang0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Oct. 05, v. 121, no. 39 p.21118-21127dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b049373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245007500173300001600248520135100264592002801615650001201643650001601655650001201671650001801683650002101701650001201722650001301734650001301747650000901760653002401769653003501793653002801828653002501856653001201881653001601893700002001909700002201929773011801951856008502069852000902154655001202163IND60466235720221120114356.0151123e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046623572DNAL7 a10.1080/02773813.2015.11045432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPranovich, Andrey10aTwo-Stage Hot-Water Extraction of Galactoglucomannans from Spruce Wood  ap. 140-156.  aIn order to preserve the polymeric structure and the acetylation degree of extracted galactoglucomannans and, at the same time, achieve high yield, ground spruce wood was subjected to a series of sequential two-stage extractions with an Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE) apparatus using plain water at 170°C. The total combined extraction time was one hour in all the extractions. The total yield of the dissolved material after 1 h extraction was almost the same, about 25% of the wood, irrespective of the time ratios between the first and the second extractions. The yield of hemicellulose high polymers with the weight average molar mass of 8–10 kDa during the first extraction had a maximum at 20 min extraction time, amounting to about 7% on dry wood basis, and comprising about half of the total extract. Along with the progress of the extraction, the molar mass of the hemicelluloses decreased and hemicellulose-derived low polymers with the weight average molar mass of 6–2 kDa became dominating. The extracted substances were fractionated, mainly according to their molar mass, by sequential precipitation with ethanol, acetone, and methyl tert- butyl ether (MTBE). The hemicelluloses with some amount of pectins comprised 83–90% of the precipitated polymeric material and the content of galactoglucomannans was about 80%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aacetylation 3aethanol 3ahemicellulose 3amolecular weight 3apectins 3apolymers 3asolvents 3awood 0aGalactoglucomannans 0ahemicellulose characterization 0ahemicellulose isolation 0ahot-water extraction 0apectins 0aspruce wood1 aHolmbom, Bjarne1 aWillför, Stefan,0 tJournal of wood chemistry and technology.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 36, no. 2 p.140-156dTaylor & Francisx1532-23197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02773813.2015.11045433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245012700167300002000294520206000314592002802374650003402402650002202436650001502458650002202473650001602495650000902511650001902520650001502539650001302554650001702567650001602584650001602600650002102616700002302637700002502660700001902685700001702704700001902721700002402740700002302764700002802787773012902815856008202944852000903026655001203035IND60582672120221118062126.0171006e20171005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058267212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b049642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukherjee, Smita10aTuning the Band Gap in Titanium Dioxide Thin Films by Surfactant-Mediated Confinement and Patterning of Gold Nanoparticles  ap. 21311-21323.  aAu nanoparticle (NP)-decorated titanium dioxide (TiO₂) thin films (Au-TO), prepared by a unique surfactant-assisted 2D self-assembling technique of Au NP layering onto a titanium dioxide matrix (TO) with molecular-level control, in conjunction with a classic sol–gel route, showed a significant decrease in the optical band gap (ΔEg = ∼0.6 eV) of Au-TO films compared to the conventional sol–gel-prepared pristine counterpart. Strong dependence on surfactant type and deposition temperature of the 2D Au NP layer was observed upon a band gap decrease of the films. Unlike spin-coated Au NP overlayers on TiO₂, which resulted in Au NP agglomeration, in this modified inverted Langmuir–Schaefer (MILS) technique, the organic surfactant induced 2D patterned confinement of Au NP layers on TiO₂, causing an increase in the active surface area of the Au NP–TiO₂ interface. Results of X-ray diffraction and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy indicated changes in crystal structure as well as in electronic states at the O k absorption edge for Au NP–surfactant patterned films, changes being maximum for films showing a maximum band gap decrease. A temperature evolution of morphology of Au-TO films and their Au NP–surfactant monolayer counterpart at the air–water interface, by ellipsometric imaging and Brewster angle microscopy, respectively, revealed that Au NP patterning was induced by surfactant and varied with the temperature of the Au NP–surfactant monolayer, the band gap decrease being closely associated with a change in the active Au NP–TiO₂ surface area. The maximum band gap decrease was observed for Au-TO films having tree- or finger-like 2D Au NP patterns, clearly indicating that an increase in active Au–TiO₂ surface area causes enhancement in structural changes and hence a greater band gap decrease of the system. Results demonstrate the potential of the MILS technique of surfactant-aided Au NP-patterned confinement in semiconducting oxides, in band gap engineering of the latter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3acrystal structure 3aengineering 3agold 3aimage analysis 3amicroscopy 3ananogold 3asurface area 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide1 aDas, Pradip Sekhar1 aChoudhuri, Madhumita1 aDatta, Alokmay1 aGhosh, Jiten1 aSaha, Biswajit1 aKoshmak, Konstantin1 aNannarone, Stefano1 aMukhopadhyay, Anoop Kr.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Oct. 05, v. 121, no. 39 p.21311-21323dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b049643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002700141245016300168520120700331592002801538650001901566650002001585650003001605650001501635650001601650650001201666650001001678650000901688650002701697650001201724650001501736650001401751650003401765650001401799650001001813651001501823700001901838700002201857700002101879700001801900773012101918856007602039852000902115655001202124IND60754134020221119225035.0211023e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075413402DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111029682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBritt-Marie, Bäcklin 10aTemporal and Geographical Variation of Intestinal Ulcers in Grey Seals (Halichoerus grypus) and Environmental Contaminants in Baltic Biota during Four Decades  aThe prevalence of intestinal ulcers and parasites was investigated in 2172 grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) collected in the Baltic Sea and 49 grey seals collected outside the Baltic Sea (i.e., the Atlantic). An increase in frequency of ileocaeco-colonic ulcers was observed in the early 1980s, followed by a decrease in the mid-1990s. At the same time, there was an increase followed by a decrease in brominated flame retardants, Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and cadmium levels in herring (Clupea harengus), the most common prey item in Baltic grey seal diet, as well as in another top predator in the Baltic, the common guillemot (Uria aalge). The frequency of intestinal ulcers was significantly related to the intensity of acanthocephalan parasites, the age of the seal and the region of the Baltic Sea. Perforation of the intestinal wall was the cause of death in 26 of the investigated Baltic grey seals. In contrast, none of the investigated Atlantic grey seals had intestinal ulcers. They showed a thin colonic wall and very few acanthocephalan parasites. The high prevalence of intestinal ulcers and the high parasite intensity appear to be unique to the Baltic population of grey seals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthocephala 3aClupea harengus 3aHalichoerus grypus grypus 3aUria aalge 3abromination 3acadmium 3adeath 3adiet 3ageographical variation 3aherring 3aintestines 3aparasites 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3apollution 3aseals 3aBaltic Sea1 aSara, Persson 1 aSuzanne, Faxneld 1 aFrank, Rigét F.1 aAnna, Roos M.0 tAnimals.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111029683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01357naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012300166300001600289520044300305592002800748650001500776650001300791650000900804650001600813650001100829651001000840700001500850700001500865773010600880856004800986852000901034655001201043IND50065266320221119131236.0130419e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006526632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-012-0068-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Huifang12aA new species of Barbine genus Sinocyclocheilus (Teleostei: Cyprinidae) from Zuojiang River drainage in Guangxi, China  ap. 747-751.  aA new species of the genus Sinocyclocheilus is described based on specimens collected from Zuojiang River drainage, Guangxi, China.

By regulating the hydroxyl groups on the organic linker step by step, new fluorescent magnesium–organic framework (Mg–MOF) probes for Al³⁺ ions were established based on the ESIPT fluorescence mechanism. It is observed for the first time that the number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between adjacent hydroxyl and carboxyl groups can effectively adjust the ESIPT process and lead to tunable fluorescence sensing performance. Together with the well-designed porous and anionic framework, the Mg–TPP–DHBDC probe decorating with a pair of intramolecular hydrogen bonds exhibits extra-high quantitative fluorescence response to Al³⁺ through an unusual turn-off (0–1.2 μM) and turn-on (4.2–15 μM) luminescence sensing mechanism. Notably, the 28 nM limit of detection value represents the lowest record among all reported MOF-based Al³⁺ fluorescent sensors up to now. Benefited from the unique turn–off–on ESIPT fluorescence detection process, the Mg–TPP–DHBDC MOF sensor exhibits single Al³⁺ detection compared with other 16 common metal ions including Ga³⁺, In³⁺, Fe³⁺, Cr³⁺, Ca²⁺, and Mg²⁺. Impressively, such an Al³⁺ selective sensing process can even be fulfilled by the reusable MOF test paper detected by naked eyes. Overall, the quantitative Al³⁺ detection, together with the extraordinary sensitivity, selectivity, fast response, and good reusability, strongly supports our concept of ESIPT-based fluorescent MOF Al³⁺ probes and makes Mg–TPP–DHBDC one of the most powerful Al³⁺ fluorescent sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3achromium 3acoordination polymers 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3agallium 3ahydrogen bonding 3aindium 3airon 3amagnesium 3ametal ions 3amoieties 3apaper 0afluorescent probes 0aAl3+ detection 0ametal−organic frameworks (MOFs) 0aexcited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) 0aturn-off−on fluorescence1 aZhu, Xiao-Han1 aLi, Shu-Ni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6614-92411 aJiang, Yu-Cheng1 aHu, Man-Cheng1 aZhai, Quan-Guo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1117-40170 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Mar. 05, v. 11, no. 12 p.11338-11348dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b204103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01310naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245015900170300001600329520024400345592002800589650002300617650002300640650002300663650002000686653002100706653002200727700002300749773015000772856007700922852000900999655001201008IND60521614020221122144825.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052161402DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1980-03072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDörrscheidt, Wolfgang14aDie Struktur der Phase BaNi2Si2 und ihre Verwandtschaft zum ThCr2Si2 -Strukturtyp / The Structure of BaNi2Si2 and its Relationshiptothe ThCr2Si2 Structure  ap. 297-299.  aThe new compound BaNi₂Si₂ crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, space group Cmcm-D₂ₕ¹⁷ with a = 650 ± 1 pm, b = 535 ± 1 pm, c = 1133 ± 2 pm.

In many behavioural contexts, however, we know comparatively little about the moment-to-moment information-processing challenges animals face in their daily lives. In predator avoidance, for instance, we lack an accurate description of the natural signal stream and its value for risk assessment throughout the prey's defensive behaviour. We characterized the visual signals generated by real, potentially predatory events by video-recording bird approaches towards an Uca vomeris colony. Using four synchronized cameras allowed us to simultaneously monitor predator avoidance responses of crabs. We reconstructed the signals generated by dangerous and non-dangerous flying animals, identified the cues that triggered escape responses and compared them with those triggering responses to dummy predators. Fiddler crabs responded to a combination of multiple visual cues (including retinal speed, elevation and visual flicker) that reflect the visual signatures of distinct bird and insect behaviours. This allowed crabs to discriminate between dangerous and non-dangerous events. The results demonstrate the importance of measuring natural sensory signatures of biologically relevant events in order to understand biological information processing and its effects on behavioural organization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abirds 3acameras 3acrabs 3adefensive behavior 3aflight 3ainsects 3apredators 3arisk assessment1 aZeil, Jochen1 aHemmi, Jan M.0 tProceedings.g2011 Dec. 7, v. 278, no. 1724 p.3584-3592dRoyal Societyx0962-84527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2010.27463Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle01546naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007600163300001800239520054000257592002800797650001500825650002500840650001800865650002300883650001600906650001500922700002100937700001800958700002000976773009900996856008101095990002301176852000901199655001201208IND60096367620221120065713.0141104e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009636762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2011.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoushki, E.10aTemperature effect on optical properties of colloidal ZnO nanoparticles  ap. 1164-1167.  aIn this paper, we investigated the temperature dependence and optical contrast variations of a nonlinear optical material.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of drought stress on growth and active constituents composition in S. miltiorrhiza. Three water-stress treatments, including control, medium drought stress and severe drought stress, were applied on the whole growth cycle. The results showed that drought stress significantly decreased both shoot and root dry weight in S. miltiorrhiza, but increased the root to shoot ratio at later growth cycle. Except rosmarinic acid the other active constituents content increased under water-stress conditions. Water stress significantly increased salvianolic acid B yield, and decreased that of tanshinone IIA.

Strain XC0140ᵀ grew at 10–37 °C and pH 6.0–9.0 (optimum, 35 °C and pH 7.5) and with 0–17% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 1%). According to phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, strain XC0140ᵀ was assigned to the genus Pararhizobium with high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 95.97% to “Pararhizobium helanshanense CCNWQTX14ᵀ”, followed by Pararhizobium sphaerophysae CCNWGS0238ᵀ (95.95%). Chemotaxonomic analysis showed that strain XC0140ᵀ contains ubiquinone-10 as the predominant respiratory quinone and possessed summed feature 8 (comprising C₁₈: ₁ ω7c and/or ω6c), 11-methyl C₁₈:₁ ω7c, C₁₈: ₀ and C₁₆: ₀ as predominant forms of fatty acids. The polar lipids of strain XC0140ᵀ consisted of seven phospholipids (PL), two aminolipids (AL), one glycolipid (GL) and three unidentified lipids (L1, L2 and L3). The DNA G+C content was 62.7 mol%. Based on the polyphasic taxonomic characterization, strain XC0140ᵀ is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Pararhizobium, for which the name Pararhizobium haloflavum sp. nov. is proposed.

Ingestion of raw or undercooked meat containing tissue cysts of T. gondii is one major source of transmission of this parasite. It is important to guarantee the meat quality of China since our pork industry produces about half of the world's pork. In this study, a total of 746 pig samples were collected from Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces in eastern China, and examined for T. gondii infection by PCR amplification targeting B1 gene. In this study, we found that 57 of 746 (7.6%) pigs were positive for B1 gene, with 8.5% (48/562) in Zhejiang province and 4.9% (9/184) in Jiangsu province, respectively. The positive DNA samples were further genotyped at 11 genetic markers, including SAG1, 5′-and 3′-SAG2, alternative SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, L358, PK1, c22-8, c29-2, and an apicoplast locus Apico through PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technology. Two genotypes (ToxoDB 9 and ToxoDB 10) of T. gondii were identified by PCR-RFLP in Zhejiang province. However, both genotypes were not determined from Jiangsu province, which is speculated on the low DNA concentration and the small number of samples. These results indicate that T. gondii infection is endemic in pigs in eastern China and may raise public food safety concerns, suggesting more interventions for T. gondii-related risks are needed in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aToxoplasma gondii 3afood safety 3agenes 3agenotyping 3ahumans 3aingestion 3aloci 3ameat quality 3aparasites 3apork 3apork industry 3aswine 3aChina 0apigs 0aprevalence 0agenetic characterization1 aFu, Yuan1 aYuan, Xiu-Fang1 aLi, Jun-Xing1 aXu, Li-hua1 aZhang, Jia-Ning1 aYu, Bin1 aHuang, Jing1 aQi, Meng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4662-03981 aShi, Tuan-Yuan0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2022 Sept. 30, dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2022.00363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011500170520193200285592002802217650001302245650001902258650000902277650002002286650002102306650002702327650002402354650001302378650001502391650001402406650001502420650001902435650000902454650002402463650001102487650000902498650001802507651003102525653003702556653002502593653002502618653001902643700001902662773010802681856008402789961001302873852000902886655001202895IND60649628520221118060803.0200320e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064962852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2019.1043252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatts, Dexter B.10aSubsurface banding of poultry litter influence on runoff nutrient losses in a no-tillage maize cropping system  aPoultry litter (PL) is often used as an alternative nutrient source to inorganic fertilization for crop production in the southeastern US. Historically, PL has been broadcast applied on the soil surface, leaving the nutrients susceptible to runoff. Developments made in recent years allow for placing PL in narrow bands below the soil surface with minimal disturbance. This technological advancement could reduce the transport of P in surface water runoff from fields managed under conservation agricultural systems. Thus, a study was conducted to evaluate the influence of banding PL into a no-tillage corn (Zea Mays L.) field on P loss. Treatments consisted of surface banded PL, subsurface banded PL (3–5 cm below the surface), broadcasted PL, broadcasted commercial fertilizer (CF), and a nonfertilized control. The PL treatments were applied based on an N rate of 168 kg total N ha⁻¹. For the CF, inorganic N was applied at a rate of 168 kg total N ha⁻¹ and P at a rate of 45 kg P ha⁻¹. Runoff events (40 min) were created using rainfall simulations (rainfall was applied at 89 mm hr⁻¹). The greatest losses of dissolved reactive P and inorganic N occurred with the surface broadcast treatments. Subsurface band applying PL reduced P concentration losses and loading in surface water runoff to levels of the control. No differences were observed in runoff volume between treatments. Thus, total P losses mimic those observed for dissolved reactive P concentration in surface water runoff and loads. Approximately 60–80% of the total P concentration was dissolved reactive P regardless of application method. Subsurface band application reduced total P concentration by 95% when compared to surface broadcasted litter. These results show that subsurface band-applied PL can greatly reduce the impact of P loss to the environment when compared to conventional surface-applied PL and CF practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aband placement 3acorn 3acrop production 3acropping systems 3afertilizer application 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrogen 3ano-tillage 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3apoultry manure 3arain 3arainfall simulation 3arunoff 3asoil 3asurface water 3aSoutheastern United States 0aSubsurface banded poultry litter 0aRainfall simulations 0aSurface water runoff 0aN and P losses1 aWay, Thomas R.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2019 Nov., v. 194 p.104325-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.1043253Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013000174300001300304520134000317592002801657650002401685650001101709650001501720650001401735650001201749650001001761650002701771650001401798650000901812650001401821650002101835653002801856653001301884653002401897653002301921653001401944653002101958700002001979700002201999773010002021856008502121852000902206655001202215IND60524521320221118003319.0190403e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052452132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2016.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChuard, Pierre J.C.14aThe effects of adult sex ratio on mating competition in male and female guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in two wild populations  ap. 1-10.  aWhen competing for mates, males typically exhibit higher rates of intrasexual aggression and courtship than females. Operational sex ratio, represented here by adult sex ratio (ASR) as a proxy, is likely the best predictor of this competition, which typically increases between members of one sex as members of the opposite sex become rarer. Moreover, in populations subject to high predation, males often decrease mating competitive behaviour due to predation risk. We explored the combined effects of ASR and population of origin (low vs. high ambient predation risk) on mating competition in male and female wild-caught Trinidadian guppies. Both male and female aggression rates increased with ASR, but the increase for males was only significant in the low-predation population. In regard to male mating tactics, courtship propensity was unaffected by ASR, while the propensity to sneak increased at male-biased ASRs. Guppies from a high predation population had lower aggression rates than their low predation counterpart, but male courtship and sneaking attempts did not differ between populations. Surprisingly, females were just as aggressive as males when competing for mates. These results highlight the trade-offs between antipredator and agonistic behaviour, which may affect sexual selection pressures in wild populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoecilia reticulata 3aadults 3aaggression 3acourtship 3afemales 3amales 3amating competitiveness 3apredation 3arisk 3asex ratio 3asexual selection 0aAnimal population group 0aPoecilia 0aPredatory behaviour 0aSex characteristic 0aSex ratio 0aSexual behaviour1 aBrown, Grant E.1 aGrant, James W.A.0 tBehavioural processes.g2016 Aug., v. 129 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2016.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010500167300001600272520113300288592002801421650001501449650001901464650001701483650001801500650002001518650001901538650002601557650001501583650001101598650001501609650002601624650001201650700002401662700001801686700001401704773011301718856008101831990002301912852000901935655001201944IND60094185020221121180438.0141104e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009418502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gde.2011.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuengo-Oroz, MA10aImage analysis for understanding embryo development: a bridge from microscopy to biological insights  ap. 630-637.  aThe digital reconstruction of the embryogenesis of model organisms from 3D+time data is revolutionizing practices in quantitative and integrative Developmental Biology. A manual and fully supervised image analysis of the massive complex data acquired with new microscopy technologies is no longer an option and automated image processing methods are required to fully exploit the potential of imaging data for biological insights. Current developments and challenges in biological image processing include algorithms for microscopy multiview fusion, cell nucleus tracking for quasi-perfect lineage reconstruction, segmentation, and validation methodologies for cell membrane shape identification, single cell gene expression quantification from in situ hybridization data, and multidimensional image registration algorithms for the construction of prototypic models.

This bacterium colonizes host vascular tissues via the production of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) including amylovoran. It is well-established that the nearly ubiquitous plasmid pEA29 of E. amylovora is an essential virulence factor, but the underlying mechanism remains uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrated that pEA29 was required for E. amylovora to produce amylovoran and to form a biofilm, and this regulation was dependent on the thiamine biosynthesis operon thiOSGF. We then conducted carbohydrate and genetic analyses demonstrating that the thiamine-mediated effect on amylovoran production was indirect, as cells lacking thiOSGF produced an EPS that did not contain glucuronic acid, one of the key components of amylovoran, whereas the transcriptional activity and RNA levels of the amylovoran biosynthesis genes were not altered. Alternatively, addition of exogenous thiamine restored amylovoran production in the pEA29-cured strain of E. amylovora and positively impacted amylovoran production in a dose-dependent manner. Individual deletion of several chromosomal thiamine biosynthesis genes also affected amylovoran production, implying that a complete thiamine biosynthesis pathway is required for the thiamine-mediated effect on amylovoran production in E. amylovora. Finally, we determined that an imbalanced tricarboxylic acid cycle negatively affected amylovoran production, which was restored by addition of exogenous thiamine or overexpression of the thiOSGF operon. In summary, our report revealed a novel signaling pathway that impacts E. amylovora virulence in which thiamine biosynthesis enhances bacterial respiration that provides energetic requirements for the biosynthesis of EPS amylovoran.

Many diatoms store photosynthate as the neutral lipid triacylglycerol (TAG). While the pathways of diatom fatty acid and TAG synthesis appear to be well conserved with plants, the pathways of TAG catabolism and downstream fatty acid β‐oxidation have not been characterised in diatoms. We identified a putative mitochondria‐targeted, bacterial‐type acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase (PtMACAD1) that is present in Stramenopile and Hacrobian eukaryotes, but not found in plants, animals or fungi. Gene knockout, protein‐YFP tags and physiological assays were used to determine PtMACAD1's role in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. PtMACAD1 is located in the mitochondria. Absence of PtMACAD1 led to no consumption of TAG at night and slower growth in light : dark cycles compared with wild‐type. Accumulation of transcripts encoding peroxisomal‐based β‐oxidation did not change in response to day : night cycles or to PtMACAD1 knockout. Mutants also hyperaccumulated TAG after the amelioration of N limitation. We conclude that diatoms utilise mitochondrial β‐oxidation; this is in stark contrast to the peroxisomal‐based pathways observed in plants and green algae. We infer that this pattern is caused by retention of catabolic pathways from the host during plastid secondary endosymbiosis.  aPublisher supplied data  aDOE‐DE‐SC0008595cBiological and Environmental Research  aDOE‐DE‐SC0018344cBiological and Environmental Research 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3aacyl-CoA dehydrogenase 3acatabolism 3aeukaryotic cells 3afatty acids 3agene targeting 3amitochondria 3aphotosynthesis 3asolar radiation 3asymbiosis 3atriacylglycerols1 aXing, Denghui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0283-42471 aHughes, Alexander1 aMoosburner, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8672-87421 aSimmons, Mark P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3896-46331 aAllen, Andrew E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5911-60811 aPeers, Graham1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3590-78200 tnew phytologist.g2020 Nov., v. 228, no. 3 p.946-958dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.167443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245014500174300001600319520139700335592002801732650001101760650001601771650000801787650001401795650001001809650001401819650001401833651002201847653002101869653002201890653001801912653001801930653002401948653003501972653001702007653001302024653002202037653003602059653001502095653001402110700001802124700002302142700002102165700002502186700002102211773010702232856008802339852000902427655001202436IND60126457320221117002957.0151107e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012645732DNAL7 a10.7872/crya.v35.iss3.2014.2212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManghisi, Antonio14aThe Mediterranean Endemic New genus Felicinia (Halymeniales, Rhodophyta) Recognized by a Morphological and Phylogenetic Integrative Approach  ap. 221-243.  aRecently, DNA phylogenies resulted in the transfer of some species of the halymeniacean genus Aeodes, namely A. orbitosa and A. ulvoidea, to the genus Pachymenia leaving the former supposedly as a monotypic genus based on the type species, A. nitidissima. Nevertheless, that work overlooked the presence of A. marginata, a red foliaceus alga endemic to the Mediterranean Sea with a convoluted nomenclatural history.In the present study, we provided a thorough description of A. marginata based on both anatomical and molecular data and inferred its phylogenetic relationships among halymeniacean genera using both chloroplastic (rbcL) and nuclear genes (LSU). Based on our data, A. marginata allied with Halymenia, Cryptonemia, and associated genera rather than with the generitype A. nitidissima, and presented a unique set of characters deserving the status of genus within the Halymeniaceae. Therefore, we proposed the new genus Felicinia based on Felicinia marginata comb. nov.A description of the multiaxial vegetative of F. marginata construct was provided, highlighting a unique characteristic among red algae: the presence, in the medulla, of peculiar oblique multicellular filaments connecting periclinal filaments. These filaments are produced secondarily as branches from axial filaments and are possibly homologous to the anticlinal filaments observed in the medulla of Halymenia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeodes 3aCryptonemia 3aDNA 3aHalymenia 3agenes 3anew genus 3aphylogeny 3aMediterranean Sea 0aAeodes marginata 0aauxiliary ampulla 0aCOI-5P region 0aDNA barcoding 0aFelicinia gen. nov. 0aFelicinia marginata comb. nov. 0aHalymeniales 0aLSU rDNA 0aMediterranean sea 0amultiaxial vegetative construct 0aRhodophyta 0arbcL gene1 aGall, Line Le1 aRibera, M.

In this study, we investigated whom Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata) mothers huddled with—their young offspring or other adult group members—when there is need for thermoregulation. We used a focal-animal sampling method, targeting 17 females at Katsuyama, Okayama Prefecture, Japan. A majority of huddling among adult females was recorded during winter season (December, January, and February). Females who had young (0- or 1-year-old) offspring huddled less frequently with other adult females compared to females who did not have young offspring in winter. However, including young offspring, the frequency of huddling with any other individuals did not differ by whether females had young offspring. Moreover, the females who did not have young offspring huddled with other adult females more often in cloudy than in sunny weather during winter season. In contrast, females who had young offspring increased huddling with their young offspring in cloudy than in sunny weather, but did not do so with other adult females. This study indicates that Japanese macaque mothers huddle with their young offspring instead of other adult females when there is need for thermoregulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacaca fuscata 3aadults 3aanimals 3afemales 3amothers 3aprogeny 3athermoregulation 3aweather 3awinter 3aJapan 0aHuddling 0aJapanese macaque 0aMaternal behavior 0aThermoregulation behavior1 aNakamichi, Masayuki0 tBehavioural processes.g2016 Aug., v. 129 p.41-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2016.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245007400172520180700246592002802053650002702081650001102108650001302119650001102132650001102143650001002154650002302164650002002187650001002207650001302217650001502230650002202245650001102267650001202278650002002290650000902310650001602319650002502335650001302360651002002373653001802393653002502411653002602436653002502462653002502487653002402512700002002536700006202556700002402618773012502642856008302767852000902850655001202859IND60649628920221118060655.0201230e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064962892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2019.1065992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerring, Matthew W.10aRice fields support the global stronghold for an endangered waterbird  aNovel, agricultural habitats are increasingly recognised for the conservation opportunities they present. Rice fields show particular promise for waterbirds and 'wildlife-friendly' farming initiatives, but most work has focussed on conspicuous, well-known species and the value of flooding harvested fields to provide non-breeding habitat. The Australasian bittern (Botaurus poiciloptilus) is a cryptic, globally endangered waterbird that breeds in rice crops in the Riverina region of New South Wales, Australia. To assess the size of the population, we surveyed rice fields from 2013 to 2017 on randomly selected farms in the Murrumbidgee valley. Occupancy modelling yielded population estimates ranging from 368 to 409 for 'early permanent water' crops. With conservative estimates for the unsurveyed Murray region, and for fields with 'delayed permanent water', we suggest that in most years the Riverina's rice fields attract approximately 500–1000 individuals to breed, representing about 40% of the global population. Water allocations for irrigation drive the area of rice grown, with the total Riverina rice crop ranging from 5,000-113,000 ha during 2010–2019. Previously overlooked, rice fields can play an integral role alongside natural wetlands in the conservation of the Australasian bittern. Contraction of the ponding period to increase water use efficiency and the transition of Riverina irrigators to cotton farming are immediate threats to this population. We recommend trialling 'bittern-friendly' rice growing incentives, development of supportive policy and acknowledgement that some water allocated to agriculture in the Murray-Darling Basin can have explicit environmental benefits. The significance of rice fields to other cryptic wetland species should also be assessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotaurus poiciloptilus 3abasins 3abreeding 3abreeds 3acotton 3acrops 3aecosystem services 3afarming systems 3afarms 3ahabitats 3airrigation 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apaddies 3apopulation size 3arice 3awater birds 3awater use efficiency 3awetlands 3aNew South Wales 0aNovel habitat 0aAgricultural wetland 0aThreatened waterbirds 0aAustralasian bittern 0aMurray-Darling Basin 0aEnvironmental water1 aRobinson, Wayne1 aZander, Kerstin K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2237-18011 aGarnett, Stephen T.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 284 p.106599-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2019.1065993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01606naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013200158300001800290520038200308592002800690650002600718650002700744650002300771650002300794650002300817650002100840650001400861650001300875700001300888700001500901700001600916700001600932700001400948700001200962700001700974773013400991856007401125852000901199655001201208IND60659620420221120033031.0190823e20120730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065962042DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc34049f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Qunpeng10aNovel [2]pseudorotaxanes constructed by self-assembly of bis-urea-functionalized pillar[5]arene and linear alkyl dicarboxylates  ap. 8532-8534.  aA bis-urea-functionalized pillar[5]arene has been synthesized and shown to form [2]pseudorotaxanes spontaneously with linear alkyl dicarboxylates in highly polar solvent DMSO, in which the hydrogen bonding interactions between the bis-urea hydrogens and dicarboxylate oxygens play an important role in stabilizing the novel [2]pseudorotaxanes alongside C–H⋯π interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3adicarboxylic acids 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3ahydrogen bonding 3arotaxanes 3asolvents1 aXia, Wei1 aHu, Xiaoyu1 aNi, Mengfei1 aJiang, Juli1 aLin, Chen1 aPan, Yi1 aWang, Leyong0 tChemical communications.g2012 July 30, v. 48, no. 68 p.8532-8534dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2cc34049f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007900168300001800247520158400265536009301849592002801942596009801970650004402068650002202112650001502134650002202149650000902171650001202180650003102192650003702223650001702260650000902277650001402286650001402300650001202314650000702326650001402333650001402347650001402361650003402375650003302409650002302442653001502465653001202480653001002492653001502502653001802517700002002535700001802555773012002573856008502693852000902778655001202787IND60595866820221119172956.0180608e20180603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059586682DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2017.13321032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Hanjiang10aModification of biochar by Fe2O3 for the removal of pyridine and quinoline  ap. 1470-1480.  aThe biochar produced by pyrolysis at 600°C from powdered mango bark impregnated with iron, namely Fe₂O₃/biochar, was recognized as a multifunctional material for environmental applications. This work aims at using the above material for the removal of pyridine and quinoline from aqueous solutions. The physico-chemical properties of synthesized biochars were studied systematically with several commonly used material characterization methods including scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). Structural and morphological analyses of the biochars showed that Fe₂O₃ particles were nanosized and distributed evenly on the surface of biochar, and thus exhibited great adsorption capacity for the removal of pyridine and quinoline. In addition, the results suggested that the main magnetic phase is maghemite (Fe₂O₃). The modified biochar showed high removal capacity (99%) for quinoline, but the removal capacity of pyridine was only 73%. The pH experiment in this passage indicated that both pyridine and quinoline reached a maximum adsorption amount at pH near 9.0. Adsorption kinetics suggested that the pseudo-second-order was well fitting the experiment data. The equilibrium study showed that the Langmuir model can adequately describe the adsorption process for pyridine and quinoline. The main mechanism of pyridine and quinoline removal was possibly electrostatic interactions and π–π interactions between the modified biochar and the adsorbate.  aThis study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [21377041].  aPublisher supplied data  a21377041cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abark 3abiochar 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aferric oxide 3airon 3amaghemite 3amagnetism 3amangoes 3apH 3apyridines 3apyrolysis 3aquinoline 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 0aAdsorption 0abiochar 0aFe2O3 0amango bark 0ananocomposite1 aZhang, Xiaoping1 aZhang, Yudong0 tEnvironmental technology.g2018 June 3, v. 39, no. 11 p.1470-1480dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.13321033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03458naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245013700180300001600317500001500333520158300348592002801931650001801959650001501977650001201992650001602004650001202020650000802032650002802040650001602068650002002084650002802104650000902132650001802141650001402159650001202173650004702185650003502232650005202267650001102319650003002330650000902360650003802369650003802407650003502445650000902480650001702489650004002506653001702546700001502563700001302578700001502591700001302606700001202619773011102631856008102742852000902823655001202832IND50090152320221121162920.0150215e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009015232DNAL7 a248190892pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-014-9977-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Shu10aPreventive Effects of Dextromethorphan on Methylmercury-Induced Glutamate Dyshomeostasis and Oxidative Damage in Rat Cerebral Cortex  ap. 332-345.  a2019-12-05  aMethylmercury (MeHg) is a well-known environmental pollutant leading to neurotoxicant associated with aberrant central nervous system (CNS) functions, but its toxic mechanisms have not yet been fully recognized. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that MeHg induces neuronal injury via glutamate (Glu) dyshomeostasis and oxidative damage mechanisms and that these effects are attenuated by dextromethorphan (DM), a low-affinity and noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist. Seventy-two rats were randomly divided into four groups of 18 animals in each group: control group, MeHg-treated group (4 and 12 μmol/kg), and DM-pretreated group. After the 4-week treatment, we observed that the administration of MeHg at a dose of 12 μmol/kg significantly increased in total mercury (Hg) levels, disrupted Glu metabolism, overexcited NMDARs, and led to intracellular calcium overload in the cerebral cortex. We also found that MeHg reduced nonenzymatic and enzymatic antioxidants, enhanced neurocyte apoptosis, induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), and caused lipid, protein, and DNA peroxidative damage in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) appeared to be inhibited by MeHg exposure. These alterations were significantly prevented by the pretreatment with DM at a dose of 13.5 μmol/kg. In conclusion, these findings strongly implicate that DM has potential to protect the brain from Glu dyshomeostasis and oxidative damage resulting from MeHg-induced neurotoxicity in rat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneurotoxicity 3ametabolism 3amercury 3aantagonists 3acalcium 3aDNA 3areactive oxygen species 3aneurotoxins 3acerebral cortex 3amethylmercury compounds 3arats 3aglutamic acid 3aapoptosis 2aAnimals 2aCerebral Cortexxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aDextromethorphanxpharmacology 2aExcitatory Amino Acid Antagonistsxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aGlutamic Acidxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMethylmercury Compoundsxtoxicity 2aOxidation-Reductionxdrug effects 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 0aantioxidants1 aXu, Zhaofa1 aLiu, Wei1 aLi, Yuehui1 aDeng, Yu1 aXu, Bin0 tBiological trace element research.g2014 June, v. 159, no. 1-3 p.332-345dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-014-9977-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002200161245009900183300001600282500000900298520142900307592002801736650001101764650000901775650002301784650001901807650001901826650001301845650001501858650001201873650001301885650002901898650001101927650001801938650001501956650001501971650001101986650001101997650001702008650001802025650001502043650001102058650001402069773014802083856009602231852000902327655001202336IND60667889020221121220730.0191125e196307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066788902DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1963.03615995002700040027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDreibelbis, F. R.10aLand Use and Soil Type Effects on the Soil Moisture Regimen in Lysimeters and Small Watersheds  ap. 455-460.  aepub  aAgronomic practices had a pronounced effect on both the rate and amount of extraction of moisture as determined by studies on the soil moisture regimen in lysimeters and small watersheds. These effects influenced water storage opportunity in the soil profile with its possible influence on infiltration, surface runoff, and percolation. For a second-year meadow in 1960, evapotranspiration from a 72-inch profile amounted to 19.06 and 14.40 inches on improved and prevailing practice, respectively. For corn in 1961, the values on the same areas were 19.81 and 17.90 inches, respectively. Soil type effects on the moisture regimes were more noticeable in extraction patterns with depth than in the overall water budget. Evapotranspiration from a 72-inch profile in meadow amounted to 19.06 and 19.37 inches on the Keene and Muskingum soils, respectively. The following year (1961) the values in corn were 19.81 and 18.57 on the same areas, respectively. Both rates and amounts of moisture extraction from a woodland watershed were much greater during the summer and early fall than from pasture. The water needed to recharge the 0- to 72-inch profile to field capacity at the end of the growing season amounted to 6.49 and 5.16 inches on the woodland and pasture watersheds, respectively. Accretion during late fall and winter contributed to water storage so that moisture values on both areas approached equality by spring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3acorn 3aevapotranspiration 3afield capacity 3agrowing season 3aland use 3alysimeters 3ameadows 3apastures 3aplant cultural practices 3arunoff 3asoil profiles 3asoil types 3asoil water 3aspring 3asummer 3awater budget 3awater storage 3awatersheds 3awinter 3awoodlands0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1963 July, v. 27, no. 4 p.455-460dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1963.03615995002700040027x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245008900169300001400258520179700272592002802069650001502097650001802112650002002130650001102150650000902161650001802170650002002188650002902208650002602237650001602263700002102279773009502300856008302395852000902478655001202487IND60082657120221119220641.0141101e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008265712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorsetti, Elise10aFunctional dissection of the splice variants of the Drosophila gene homothorax (hth)  ap. 72-82.  aHomothorax belongs to the TALE-homeodomain family of transcription factors, together with its vertebrate counterparts, the Meis family of proto-oncogenes. It fulfills many important different functions during embryonic and larval developments in Drosophila, which encompass from subdivision and specification of body parts to assembly of heterochromatin structures. Hth interacts with Extradenticle, another member of the TALE-homeodomain family of conserved transcription factors, to facilitate its entrance to the nucleus. The many different functions described for Hth rely on the complexity of the locus, from which six different isoforms arise. The isoforms can be grouped into full-length and short versions, which contain either one or the two conserved domains of the protein (homeodomain and Exd-interacting domain). We have used molecular and genetic tools to analyze the levels of expression, the distribution and the function of the isoforms during embryonic development. Our results clearly show that the isoforms display distinct levels of expression and are differentially distributed in the embryo. This detailed study also shows that during normal embryonic development not all the Hth isoforms translocate Exd into the nucleus, suggesting that both the proteins can also function separately. We have demonstrated that the full-length Hth protein activates transcription of exd, augmenting the levels of exd mRNA in the cell. The higher levels of Exd protein in those cells facilitate its entrance to the nucleus. Our work demonstrates that hth is a complex gene that should not be considered as a functional unit. The roles of the different isoforms probably rely on their distinct protein domains and conformations and, at the end, on interactions with particular partners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aembryogenesis 3aheterochromatin 3alarvae 3aloci 3amessenger RNA 3aproto-oncogenes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3avertebrates1 aAzpiazu, Natalia0 tDevelopmental biology.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 384, no. 1 p.72-82dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01652naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245004400166300001600210520067000226592002800896650002100924650002300945650001400968650001400982650002300996650001201019650001101031651001801042651001801060700002301078773012501101856007901226852000901305655001201314IND60302180020221117235823.0150704e20140228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030218002DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12512722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaspari, Michael10aMeet the New Boss, Same as the Old Boss  ap. 974-975.  aIn Nature's marketplace, there are many ways to compete.

Bird species (especially oscines) have been shown to alter their singing behaviour to increase signal efficiency in highly urbanized environments. However, few studies on the effects of noise on song structure have included birds with low frequency vocal signals which may be especially vulnerable to noise pollution due to significant frequency overlap of their signals with traffic noise. We compared the perch coos of spotted doves (Streptopelia chinensis), a species with very low frequency vocalizations, in different background noise levels across urban and peri-urban areas in Hong Kong. We documented a 10% upward shift in the minimum frequency of coos of spotted doves across the noise gradient (a relatively small but significant shift), and a reduced maximum frequency in urban habitats with a higher density of built up area. Hong Kong doves had significantly higher minimum and maximum frequencies than doves from throughout their range (from mostly rural sites). Our results indicate that urban species with extremely low sound frequencies such as doves can alter their vocalizations in response to variable urban acoustic environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptopelia 3aacoustics 3adoves 3ahabitats 3anoise pollution 3aperch 3atraffic 3aurbanization 3avocalization 3aChina 0aAnthropogenic noise 0aColumbidae 0aCoo 0aFrequency 0aSignals 0aUrbanization1 aBonebrake, Timothy C.1 aDingle, Caroline1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9176-97870 tBehavioural processes.g2016 Aug., v. 129 p.86-93dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2016.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245014900182300001600331520110300347592002801450650001401478650001501492650001401507650001801521650002301539650002101562650001001583650001101593650000901604650001301613650002401626650003801650650003201688650000901720650001401729650003201743650003701775650002801812650004601840650001101886650003801897650005101935650004401986650003302030700001602063700001502079700001702094700001802111773011102129856004802240852000902288655001202297IND50090152520221121225027.0140627e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009015252DNAL7 a247529732pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-014-9979-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Yuxiang10aZinc Chloride Inhibits Human Lens Epithelial Cell Migration and Proliferation Involved in TGF-β1 and TNF-α Signaling Pathways in HLE B-3 Cells  ap. 425-433.  aZinc is one of the most abundant essential elements in the human body, which is an essential, coenzyme-like component of many enzymes, and is indispensable to their functions. However, high levels of zinc ions can lead to cell damage. In the present study, we explored the effects of high concentrations of zinc chloride (ZnCl₂) on lens epithelial cell proliferation and migration and further investigated the effects of different concentrations of ZnCl₂ on caspase-9 and caspase-12, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). We found that ZnCl₂ could inhibit human lens epithelial (HLE) B-3 cell migration and induce apoptosis/necrosis. In addition, ZnCl₂ can efficiently decrease the expressions of caspase-9 and caspase-12, increase the expression of TNF-α at both gene and protein levels, and thus induces cell death. Taken together, our results indicate that ZnCl₂ can inhibit HLE B-3 cell migration and proliferation by decreasing the expression of TGF-β1 and increasing the expression of TNF-α and finally lead to HLE B-3 cell death.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-12 3acaspase-9 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3aepithelial cells 3agenes 3ahumans 3aions 3anecrosis 3asignal transduction 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3azinc 2aCell Line 2aCell Movementxdrug effects 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aChloridesxpharmacology 2aEpithelial Cellsxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aHumans 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 2aTransforming Growth Factor beta1xpharmacology 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxmetabolism 2aZinc Compoundsxpharmacology1 aGuo, Dadong1 aWu, Qiuxin1 aLiu, Dongmei1 aBi, Hongsheng0 tBiological trace element research.g2014 June, v. 159, no. 1-3 p.425-433dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-014-9979-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245010100212520169700313592002802010650002102038650002802059650001402087650001702101650002002118650001302138650003002151650001702181650001302198650001402211653001702225653001302242653001102255653002702266653002202293653001902315700005502334700002902389700003002418700005602448773009302504856008202597852000902679655001202688IND60683639120221121024322.0201025e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068363912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2020.1107502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, Ana Campos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7146-345710aDoes malnutrition influence hospital reimbursement? A call for malnutrition diagnosis and coding  aThe aim of this study was to determine how diagnosing and coding of malnutrition in an internal medicine ward setting influences potential hospital reimbursement.Patients admitted to the internal medicine ward of Centro Hospitalar do Médio Ave between April 24 and May 22, 2018 were screened by Nutritional Risk Screening 2002, and patients classified as at “risk for malnutrition” were assessed by the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). For each patient, medical coders simulated coding, taking into account the malnutrition diagnosis by PG-SGA, and compared it with the real coding as retrieved from the medical records. For the coding, the Diagnosis-Related Group and Severity of Illness were determined, allowing the calculation of hospitalization cost (HC) according to Portuguese Ministerial Directive number 207/2017. The increase of HC in this subsample was extrapolated to the number of patients admitted during 2018, to obtain the estimated unreported annual HC.Of the 71% (92/129) participants having malnutrition risk according to Nutritional Risk Screening 2002, 86% were malnourished. Including malnutrition diagnosis in the coding of malnourished patients increased the level of Severity of Illness in 39% of cases and increased HC for this subsample, resulting in €52 000. Extrapolating for the annual HC, total HC reached €1.3 million.Identifying malnourished patients and including this highly prevalent diagnosis in medical records allows malnutrition coding and consequent increase of HC. This can improve the potential hospital reimbursement, which could contribute to the quality of patient care and economic sustainability of hospitals.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren at risk 3aeconomic sustainability 3ahospitals 3amalnutrition 3amedical records 3amedicine 3anutrition risk assessment 3apatient care 3apatients 3ascreening 0aMalnutrition 0aNRS-2002 0aPG-SGA 0aHospital reimbursement 0aInternal medicine 0aMedical coding1 aPessoa, Ana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6881-16571 aVigário, Maria Antónia1 aJager-Wittenaar, Harriët1 aPinho, João1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3047-28480 tNutrition.g2020 June, v. 74 p.110750-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.1107503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04426naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024004100138040001800179100001800197245011000215506007600325506003100401520252400432592002802956596008502984596004703069596002603116506003703142650002103179650001803200650001903218650001803237650002003255650002003275650002203295650001403317650002903331650002003360650001403380650001003394650001003404650001903414650002303433650002003456650003003476650002103506653003403527653002103561653003203582700001703614700001903631773011303650856008803763852000903851655001203860IND60744566920221207124727.0211213e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074456692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.domaniend.2021.1066492chorus7 a10.1016/j.domaniend.2021.1066492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaccaro, L.A.10aEffects of genetic selection on activity of corticotropic and thyrotropic axes in modern broiler chickens  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aCommercial selection for meat-type (broiler) chickens has produced economically valuable birds with fast growth rates, enhanced muscle mass, and highly efficient feed utilization. The physiological changes that account for this improvement and unintended consequences associated with them remain largely unexplored, despite their potential to guide further advancements in broiler production efficiency. To identify effects of genetic selection on hormonal signaling in the adrenocorticotropic and thyrotropic axes, gene expression in muscle and liver and post-hatch circulating hormone concentrations were measured in legacy [Athens Canadian Random Bred (ACRB)] and modern (Ross 308) male broilers between embryonic days (e) 10 and e18 and post-hatch days (d) 10 and d40. No interactive effects or main effects of line were observed for adrenocorticotropic gene expression during either developmental period, although age effects appeared for corticosteroid-binding globulin in liver during embryogenesis and post-hatch and glucocorticoid receptor in both tissues post-hatch. There was a main line effect for circulating corticosterone, with levels in ACRB greater than those in Ross. Several thyrotropic genes exhibited line-by-age interactions during embryonic or post-hatch development. In liver, embryonic expression of thyroid hormone receptor beta was greater in ACRB on e12, and deiodinase 3 (DIO3) levels were greater in Ross on e14 and e16. In juvenile liver, deiodinase 2 (DIO2) expression was greater in ACRB on d10 but greater in Ross on d20, while DIO3 was higher in ACRB on d30 and d40. Levels of thyroid hormone receptor alpha mRNA exhibited a main line effect, with levels greater in ACRB juvenile breast muscle. Several thyrotropic genes exhibited main age effects, including DIO2 and DIO3 in embryonic breast muscle, thyroid hormone receptor alpha and thyroid hormone receptor beta in post-hatch liver, and DIO2 in post-hatch breast muscle. Circulating triiodothyronine displayed a main line effect, with levels in Ross significantly reduced as compared to ACRB. These findings suggest that in modern broilers, a decrease in levels of hormones that control basal metabolism triiodothyronine and the stress response circulating corticosterone, as well as altered expression of genes regulating thyroid hormone activity, could contribute to lower heat production, reduced stress response, and altered nutrient partitioning, leading to more efficient feed utilization and faster, more productive growth.  aPublisher supplied data  cCollege of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences, Ohio State University  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cUniversity of Georgia0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abasal metabolism 3abreast muscle 3acorticosterone 3aembryogenesis 3afeed conversion 3agene expression 3agenetic selection 3aglobulins 3aglucocorticoid receptors 3aheat production 3ajuveniles 3aliver 3amales 3amuscle tissues 3apoultry production 3astress response 3athyroid hormone receptors 3atriiodothyronine 0aDevelopmental mRNA expression 0aThyroid hormones 0aAthens Canadian Random Bred1 aPorter, T.E.1 aEllestad, L.E.0 tDomestic animal endocrinology.g2022 Jan., v. 78 p.106649-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl34945x0739-72407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2021.1066493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04321naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245016300171520234800334592002802682650001502710650002602725650001602751650001802767650001602785650001702801650001602818650002202834650001302856650001402869650001402883650004802897650001502945650002902960650001402989650001303003650001803016650001703034650001703051650001703068650001303085650001703098650001603115650001403131651001003145653000903155653002503164653001103189653000803200653001003208700001203218700001303230700001703243700001703260700001803277700001703295700001803312700001303330700001503343700001603358700002003374773013003394856009003524852000903614655001203623IND60761619320221119154455.0220124e20220216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076161932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.1095122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Feng10aPresence and characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus co-carrying the multidrug resistance genes cfr and lsa(E) in retail food in China  aStaphylococcus aureus is an important food-related pathogen associated with bacterial poisoning that is difficult to treat due to its multidrug resistance. The cfr and lsa(E) genes both cause multiple drug resistance and have been identified in numerous Staphylococcus species, respectively. In this study, we found that a methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain, 2868B2, which was isolated from a sample of frozen dumplings in Hangzhou in 2015, co-carried these two different multidrug resistance genes. Further analysis showed that this strain was resistant to more than 18 antibiotics and expressed high-level resistance to florfenicol, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, tiamulin, erythromycin, ampicillin, cefepime, ceftazidime, kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and linezolid (MIC = 8 μg/mL). Whole genome sequencing was performed to characterize the genetic environment of these resistance genes and other genomic features. The cfr gene was located on the single plasmid p2868B2 (39,159 bp), which demonstrated considerable similarity to many plasmids previously identified in humans and animals. p2868B2 contained the insertion sequence (IS) element IS21–558, which allowed the insertion of cfr into Tn558 and played an important role in the mobility of cfr. Additionally, a novel multidrug resistance region (36.9 kb) harbouring lsa(E) along with nine additional antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (aadD, aadE, aacA-aphD, spc, lnu(B), lsa(E), tetL, ermC and blaZ) was identified. The multidrug resistance region harboured four copies of IS257 that were active and can mediate the formation of four circular structures containing ARGs and ISs. In addition, genes encoding various virulence factors and affecting multiple cell adhesion properties were identified in the genome of MRSA 2868B2. This study confirmed that the cfr and lsa(E) genes coexist in one MRSA strain and the presence of plasmid and IS257 in the multi-ARG cluster can promote both ARG transfer and dissemination. Furthermore, the presence of so many ARGs and virulence genes in food-related pathogens may seriously compromise the effectiveness of clinical therapy and threaten public health, its occurrence should pay public attention and the traceability of these genes in food-related samples needs further surveillance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3aceftazidime 3acell adhesion 3aclindamycin 3aerythromycin 3aflorfenicol 3afood microbiology 3agenomics 3akanamycin 3alinezolid 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amonitoring 3amultiple drug resistance 3apathogens 3aplasmids 3apublic health 3astreptomycin 3atetracycline 3atherapeutics 3atiamulin 3atraceability 3atransposons 3avirulence 3aChina 0aMRSA 0aMultidrug resistance 0alsa(E) 0acfr 0aIS2571 aWu, Shi1 aLei, Tao1 aWu, Qingping1 aZhang, Jumei1 aHuang, Jiahui1 aDai, Jingsha1 aChen, Moutong1 aDing, Yu1 aWang, Juan1 aWei, Xianhu1 aZhang, Youxiong0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2022 Feb. 16, v. 363 p.109512-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.1095123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01134naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245006900159300001800228520023000246592002800476650001100504650001100515650002700526650002300553700002700576700002400603773013400627856007400761852000900835655001200844IND60659621120221120072632.0190823e20120905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065962112DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc34061e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscuer, Albert10aAnion coordination by metallamacrocycles: a cryptand-like cavity  ap. 9777-9779.  aA {Ni₉(N₃)₉} metallamacrocycle is able to coordinate azide and halide anions in trigonal prismatic cavities by means of H-bond interactions.

We wish to understand the control of differentiation and pluripotency in pASCs and to understand how conserved, convergent or divergent these mechanisms are across the Bilateria. Here we show the planarian methyl-CpG Binding Domain 2/3 (mbd2/3) gene is required for pASC differentiation during regeneration and tissue homeostasis. The genome does not have detectable levels of 5-methylcytosine (5ᵐC) and we find no role for a potential DNA methylase. We conclude that MBD proteins may have had an ancient role in broadly controlling animal stem cell pluripotency, but that DNA methylation is not involved in planarian stem cell differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aadult stem cells 3aadults 3aanimals 3acell differentiation 3aevolution 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3aproteins 3atissue repair1 aLo, Priscilla J.K.P.1 aMihaylova, Yuliana1 aFoster, Jeremy M.1 aBenner, Jack S.1 aTejada Romero, Belen1 aChen, Chen1 aMalla, Sunir1 aSolana, Jordi1 aRuzov, Alexey1 aAziz Aboobaker, A.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 384, no. 1 p.141-153dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.09.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01611naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245007800209300001600287520065800303592002800961650001800989650002101007650001101028700001401039700001801053773011301071856008101184990002301265852000901288655001201297IND60094186420221121041316.0141104e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009418642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gde.2011.09.0072doi7 aPMC32241792pmcid7 a219557942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Jayme M10aSymmetry breaking and the establishment of cell polarity in budding yeast  ap. 740-746.  aCell polarity is typically oriented by external cues such as cell–cell contacts, chemoattractants, or morphogen gradients. In the absence of such cues, however, many cells can spontaneously polarize in a random direction, suggesting the existence of an internal polarity-generating mechanism whose direction can be spatially biased by external cues. Spontaneous ‘symmetry-breaking’ polarization is likely to involve an autocatalytic process set off by small random fluctuations [1].

Disruption of these characteristics can lead to the loss of epithelial identity through a process called epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which can contribute to pathological conditions such as tissue fibrosis and invasive cancer. In invertebrates, the epithelial polarity gene scrib plays a critical role in establishing and maintaining cell adhesion and polarity. In this study we asked if the mouse homolog, Scrib, is required for establishment and/or maintenance of epithelial identity in vivo. To do so, we conditionally deleted Scrib in the head ectoderm tissue that gives rise to both the ocular lens and the corneal epithelium. Deletion of Scrib in the lens resulted in a change in epithelial cell shape from cuboidal to flattened and elongated. Early in the process, the cell adhesion protein, E-cadherin, and apical polarity protein, ZO-1, were downregulated and the myofibroblast protein, αSMA, was upregulated, suggesting EMT was occurring in the Scrib deficient lenses. Correlating temporally with the upregulation of αSMA, Smad3 and Smad4, TGFβ signaling intermediates, accumulated in the nucleus and Snail, a TGFβ target and transcriptional repressor of the gene encoding E-cadherin, was upregulated. Pax6, a lens epithelial transcription factor required to maintain lens epithelial cell identity also was downregulated. Loss of Scrib in the corneal epithelium also led to molecular changes consistent with EMT, suggesting that the effect of Scrib deficiency was not unique to the lens. Together, these data indicate that mammalian Scrib is required to maintain epithelial identity and that loss of Scrib can culminate in EMT, mediated, at least in part, through TGFβ signaling.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acadherins 3acell adhesion 3acell polarity 3acornea 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3afibrosis 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahead 3ainvertebrates 3amice 3arepressor proteins 3atransforming growth factor beta1 aRachel, Rivka A.1 aShatadal, Shalini1 aCopeland, N.

The bulk density near the inlet end of the column decreased rapidly as water entered. Since the ends of the column were confined, the expansion of the wetted bentonite-silt produced a compensating compression in the remaining air-dry portion of the column. Several water-content variables were plotted against the so-called reduced material coordinate m/t¹/² (Boltzmann variable expressed in terms of the material coordinate m and time t). Neither the volumetric water content nor the volumetric water ratio would coalesce the data when plotted against m/t¹/². In contrast, a plot of water saturation vs. m/t¹/² did coalesce the data into a single curve, except for very early times at positions nearer than 1 cm to the water inlet.  aPublisher supplied data 3abentonite 3abulk density 3agamma radiation 3asilt 3avolumetric water content 3awater content1 aSwartzendruber, D.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1976 May, v. 40, no. 3 p.345-348dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1976.03615995004000030014x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04295naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245014600169300001600315520210500331592002802436650001502464650002502479650002502504650001602529650002102545650001102566650002002577650000902597650003102606650002302637650001002660650001302670650002102683650002102704650002102725650001202746650001802758650001102776650001702787650002502804650001002829653001002839653001002849653000802859653001002867653001102877653000802888653000802896653001102904653000802915653000902923653001002932653000902942653000802951653000902959653000802968653000902976653000902985653001002994653000803004653000903012653001703021653001303038653002503051653002303076653001303099700001603112700001303128700001403141700001503155700001203170700005403182773011903236856008903355852000903444655001203453IND60524522720221118003304.0190403e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052452272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2016.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Y.P.10aDietary palygorskite supplementation improves immunity, oxidative status, intestinal integrity, and barrier function of broilers at early age  ap. 200-209.  aThe current study was conducted to investigate the effects of palygorskite inclusion in diet on the immunity, oxidative status, intestinal integrity, and barrier function of broilers at early age. A total of 144 one-day-old Arbor Acres broiler chicks were allocated into 3 dietary treatments with 6 replicates of 8 chicks each, and fed a basal diet supplemented with 0, 5 and 10g/kg palygorskite for 21days, respectively. Treatments did not alter the growth performance of broilers. Compared with the control group, the inclusion of 10g/kg palygorskite decreased serum diamine oxidase (DAO) activity (P=0.041). Dietary palygorskite supplementation increased ileal goblet cell number (P=0.004), and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth in the jejunum (P<0.001) and ileum (P=0.001), and the extent to increase the ratio of villus height to crypt depth in jejunum was more pronounced when its dosage was 10g/kg (P<0.05). Similarly, broilers fed a diet supplemented with 10g/kg palygorskite exhibited increased jejunal goblet cell number (P=0.021), and villus height in the jejunum (P=0.002) and ileum (P=0.008). Palygorskite supplementation, irrespective of dosage, reduced cecal Salmonella colonies (P=0.038). Dietary 10g/kg palygorskite supplementation increased the concentrations of ileal immunoglobulin M (IgM, P=0.037) and secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA, P=0.023), and the activity of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) in the jejunum (P=0.035) and ileum (P=0.049). The inclusion of 10g/kg palygorskite increased mRNA abundances of ileal mucin 2 (MUC2, P=0.033) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1, P=0.017) whereas reduced mRNA expressions of ileal toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4, P=0.040) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ, P=0.023). Additionally, the supplementation of 5g/kg palygorskite increased jejunal trefoil factor 2 (TFF2) mRNA abundance (P=0.042), but downregulated the expression of ileal IFN-γ mRNA (P=0.023). In conclusion, dietary palygorskite inclusion would exert beneficial effects on the immunity, antioxidant capacity, intestinal integrity, and barrier function of broilers at early age.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3adiamine oxidase 3adiet 3agene expression regulation 3agrowth performance 3aileum 3aimmunity 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin M 3ainterferon-gamma 3ajejunum 3amessenger RNA 3amucins 3apalygorskite 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avilli 0aCLDN2 0aCLDN3 0aDAO 0aELISA 0aIFN-γ 0aIgG 0aIgM 0aIL-1β 0aMDA 0aMUC2 0aMyD88 0aOCLN 0aSEM 0aSIgA 0aTEM 0aTFF2 0aTLR4 0aT-SOD 0aXRD 0aZO-1 0aPalygorskite 0aImmunity 0aIntestinal integrity 0aAntioxidant status 0aBroilers1 aCheng, Y.F.1 aLi, X.H.1 aZhang, H.1 aYang, W.L.1 aWen, C.1 aZhou, Y.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7844-542X0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2016 Sept., v. 219 p.200-209dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2016.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245011300209300001600322506007600338520160600414592002802020506003702048650001302085650002202098650001902120650002502139650002202164650002002186650001202206650002402218650001602242650001102258650002102269650001002290650001802300650001402318650001402332650002602346650001202372650002602384700002502410700002102435700001402456700002602470773009802496856008302594852000902677655001202686IND60082658120221207091903.0141101e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008265812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.10.0122doi7 aPMC38729692pmcid7 a241449212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Fengming14aThe human constitutive androstane receptor promotes the differentiation and maturation of hepatic-like cells  ap. 155-165.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aExpression of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) is enriched in the mature mammalian liver and increasingly recognized for its prominent role in regulating a myriad of processes including biotransformation, chemical transport, energy metabolism and lipid homeostasis. Previously, we demonstrated that CAR levels were markedly enhanced during the differentiation of hepatic-like cells derived from hESCs, prompting the hypothesis that CAR contributes a key functional role in directing human hepatogenesis. Here we demonstrate that over-expression of CAR in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), transduced by a lentiviral vector, accelerates the maturation of hepatic-like cells, with CAR over-expressing cells exhibiting a 2.5-fold increase in albumin secretion by day 20 in culture differentiation, and significantly enhanced levels of mRNA expression of several liver-selective markers, including hepatic transcription factors, plasma proteins, biotransformation enzymes, and metabolic enzymes. CAR over-expressing cells also exhibited enhanced CITCO-inducible CYP3A7 enzymatic activity. Knockdown of CAR via siRNA attenuated the differentiation-dependent expression programs. In contrast, expression levels of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor most similar to CAR in primary sequence, were negligible in human fetal liver tissues or in the differentiating hESCs, and stable over-expression of PXR in hepatic-induced hESCs failed to enhance expression of hepatic phenotype markers. Together, these results define a novel role for human CAR in hepatic lineage commitment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalbumins 3abiotransformation 3ablood proteins 3aembryonic stem cells 3aenergy metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3agene overexpression 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3aphenotype 3asecretion 3asmall interfering RNA 3atissues 3atranscription factors1 aZamule, Stephanie M.1 aCoslo, Denise M.1 aChen, Tao1 aOmiecinski, Curtis J.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 384, no. 2 p.155-165dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245008600211300001800297520176100315592002802076596009402104596005902198596004802257650002302305650002302328650001102351650002602362650000902388650001202397650002602409650001602435650001002451653001402461653003202475653001602507700006502523700006602588700006002654700002002714700002002734773013602754856008302890961001302973852000902986655001202995IND60759426320221120094945.0211209e20210930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075942632DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-01-21-0066-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaxwell, Lourena A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4643-148510aDegradation of Aflatoxins B₁ by Atoxigenic Aspergillus flavus Biocontrol Agents  ap. 2343-2350.  aAflatoxins are potent Aspergillus mycotoxins that contaminate food and feed, thereby impacting health and trade. Biopesticides with atoxigenic Aspergillus flavus isolates as active ingredients are used to reduce aflatoxin contamination in crops. The mechanism of aflatoxin biocontrol is primarily attributed to competitive exclusion but, sometimes, aflatoxin is reduced by greater amounts than can be explained by displacement of aflatoxin-producing fungi on the crop. Objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the ability of atoxigenic A. flavus genotypes to degrade aflatoxin B₁ (AFB1) and (ii) characterize impacts of temperature, time, and nutrient availability on AFB1 degradation by atoxigenic A. flavus. Aflatoxin-contaminated maize was inoculated with atoxigenic isolates in three separate experiments that included different atoxigenic genotypes, temperature, and time as variables. Atoxigenic genotypes varied in aflatoxin degradation but all degraded AFB1 >44% after 7 days at 30°C. The optimum temperature for AFB1 degradation was 25 to 30°C, which is similar to the optimum range for AFB1 production. In a time-course experiment, atoxigenics degraded 40% of AFB1 within 3 days, and 80% of aflatoxin was degraded by day 21. Atoxigenic isolates were able to degrade and utilize AFB1 as a sole carbon source in a chemically defined medium but quantities of AFB1 degraded declined as glucose concentrations increased. Degradation may be an additional mechanism through which atoxigenic A. flavus biocontrol products reduce aflatoxin contamination pre- or postharvest. Thus, selection of optimal atoxigenic active ingredients can include assessment of both competitive ability in agricultural fields and their ability to degrade aflatoxins.  aPublisher supplied data  aTA-CR-14-075cUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service  a2020-42000-022-00DcUSDA-Agricultural Research Service  aOPP1007117cBill & Melinda Gates Foundation 3aAspergillus flavus 3abiological control 3acarbon 3acompetitive exclusion 3acorn 3aglucose 3anutrient availability 3atemperature 3atrade 0aaflatoxin 0aatoxigenic biocontrol agent 0adegradation1 aCallicott, Kenneth A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3286-56451 aBandyopadhyay, Ranajit1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2422-42981 aMehl, Hillary L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8570-35621 aOrbach, Marc J.1 aCotty, Peter J.0 tPlant disease.g2021 Sept. 30, v. 105, no. 9 p.2343-2350dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-01-21-0066-RE3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01878naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009400165300001600259520094500275592002801220650001301248650001601261650001401277650002501291650001501316700001901331773011301350856008101463990002301544852000901567655001201576IND60094186720221123032013.0141104e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009418672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gde.2011.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReuven, Peter10aMacromotives and microbehaviors: the social dimension of bacterial phenotypic variability  ap. 759-767.  aBacterial phenotypic variability—the display of multiple distinct phenotypes in a genetically homogenous population of bacteria—emerges as an adaptive response to conflicting challenges. This creates an opportunity for social interactions which are able to dynamically redistribute cell fates within a community and to directly share the benefits of the different fates. While social interactions between cell fates can optimize community behavior, they also make the community vulnerable to exploitation. The aim of this review is to emphasize the social roles of phenotypic variability and introduce it as a communal rather than a single-cell property. Specifically, we present two prevalent perspectives on the forces shaping social interactions between cell fates—engineering optimality and social stability—and review recent works combining engineering, developmental and social evolution analyses in light of this distinction.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3aengineering 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3apopulation1 aEldar, Avigdor0 tCurrent Opinion in Genetics & Development.g2011 Dec., v. 21, no. 6 p.759-767dElsevier Ltdx0959-437X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gde.2011.09.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03717naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001500156245009800171300001600269500002000285500001500305520194600320592002802266650001802294650002002312650002202332650002002354650001802374650002502392650002102417650002202438650002302460650002002483650002402503650001702527650001302544650001602557650002302573650001602596650001102612650001702623650002002640650002102660650001102681650001002692650003802702650001402740650003502754650001102789650002002800650001702820651001102837653001802848653001902866700001602885773009602901852000902997856007303006655001203079IND4404127220221120225002.0170626e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440412722DNAL7 a183765622pmid7 a10.1890/06-1768.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDufour, S.10aGeomorphological controls of fraxinus excelsior growth and regeneration in floodplain forests  ap. 205-215.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aGeomorphological changes can alter river hydrology and thus influence floodplain forest growth and regeneration. In this paper we quantify the effect of changes in channel elevation at the scale of four decades on hydrological conditions, overbank sediment deposits, water availability, and their impacts on common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) growth and recruitment in floodplain forests of the Ain River, France. Ash is a drought‐sensitive species, and its regeneration is influenced by flood disturbance. We compared ash growth between 20 sample plots located in two contrasting geomorphological contexts using dendrochronological measurements: 11 along reaches degrading over the last 80 years and nine along stable or slightly aggrading reaches. In each context, half of the plots were located near the channel, and the remainder were within the floodplain. Ash regeneration was also quantified in each plot. This work showed that sites which undergo channel degradation are associated with less frequent overbank flows. Whereas there is no trend in either the climatic or stream flow timeseries over the last four decades, the growth patterns of ashes of these sites are significantly different as opposed to plots located in stable or aggraded reaches (bell shaped curve vs. constant increase in tree ring width). The variance through time due to climatic or stream flow control is masked by variance due to topographical changes. Currently plots located in degraded reaches show a lower ash growth (mean of 0.20 cm/yr vs. 0.34 cm/yr over the last decade) and less frequent ash seedling establishment. We have identified a hydrologic threshold for ash growth response when stand elevation values reach 1.5–2 m above the mean annual flow stage. Our results confirm that, at a many‐decade timescale, changes in channel elevation must be considered in addition to other hydrological controls of hardwood species growth and recruitment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoverland flow 3aseedling growth 3adrought tolerance 3aalluvial plains 3aforest growth 3anatural regeneration 3adendrochronology 3adeciduous forests 3aFraxinus excelsior 3alowland forests 3asediment deposition 3aforest trees 3avariance 3afloodplains 3aseedling emergence 3atree growth 3arivers 3agrowth rings 3astream channels 3ahardwood forests 3afloods 3awater 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEcosystem 2aFraxinusxgrowth & development 2aRivers 2aWater Movements 2aWater Supply 3aFrance 0ageomorphology 0aforest ecology1 aPiégay, H.0 tEcology.g2008 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.205-215dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-1768.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02448naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245006600168520126400234592002801498650001901526650001401545650001301559650001101572650001001583650001201593650002601605650001501631651001001646651001001656651001801666653002101684653002301705653000801728653000901736700001801745700001601763700002201779700002501801773009501826856008401921852000902005655001202014IND60649630020221118060339.0190712e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064963002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2019.1043462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstay, Karinna12aA cross-cultural analysis of children's vegetable preferences  aThe successful promotion of vegetable consumption by children requires a deep understanding of children's vegetable preferences as well as the factors shaping them throughout childhood. This study analyzed children vegetable liking in four different age ranges (5–6, 7–8, 9–10 and 11–12 years old) in Chile, China and the United States. Three hundred and eighty-four children completed this study. All participants tasted and rated 14 different vegetables for liking and described the samples using Check-All-That-Apply (CATA). We found significant differences in degree of overall liking among children from the three countries (p < 0.001). Specifically, children in China gave higher overall liking scores than children in the US, and in the US higher than in Chile. Child age and gender did not influence children's vegetable overall liking across the three countries. Across all countries and age groups, liking of taste and texture were the best predictors of children overall liking. The penalty analysis of CATA selections by children showed that the mean impact of the attributes that children used to describe the samples on their liking varied among countries, with the descriptors having the least impact on liking for Chinese children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese people 3achildhood 3achildren 3agender 3ataste 3atexture 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables 3aChile 3aChina 3aUnited States 0aVegetable liking 0aSensory modalities 0aAge 0aCATA1 aPan, Shuliang1 aZhong, Fang1 aCapitaine, Chloé1 aGuinard, Jean-Xavier0 tAppetite.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 142 p.104346-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2019.1043463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02041naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245009600160300001600256500002000272520090300292592002801195650001801223650001701241650001701258650001201275650001501287650001101302650001501313650001801328650001301346650002201359650003201381700002301413700001701436773012101453856007201574852000901646655001201655IND60589220920221120165006.0180207e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058922092DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.59812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJalsrai, Aldarmaa10aEthanol Iris tenuifolia extract reduces brain damage in a mouse model of cerebral ischaemia  ap. 333-339.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the previous experiments, the neuroprotective role of Iris tenuifolia Pall. (IT) in the model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was investigated. In addition, the concentrations of the cytokines tumour necrosis factor‐alpha and interleukin‐6 in blood plasma were measured. It was found that IT administered 1 hr prior to MCAO or immediately after MCAO reduced infarct volume significantly. IT application 1 and 4 hr after MCAO, respectively, was without any effect on infarct volume. There were no significant changes as regards tumour necrosis factor‐alpha, whereas interleukin‐6 concentrations were increased in blood plasma. This is the first evidence that flavonoids from Iris tenuifolia exert protective effects in the in vivo MCAO model. Our results suggest that these flavonoids are likely to be beneficial to humans by virtue of their ability to reduce infarct volume.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3ablood plasma 3abrain damage 3aethanol 3aflavonoids 3ahumans 3ainfarction 3ainterleukin-6 3aischemia 3aprotective effect 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aReinhold, Annegret1 aBecker, Axel0 tPhytotherapy research.g2018 Feb., v. 32, no. 2 p.333-339dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.59813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03395naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245013500212520151800347592002801865650001701893650001401910650002601924650002901950650002001979650001501999650001002014650001402024650001802038650001702056650002202073650001402095650001602109651001002125653001702135653002602152653002802178653002302206653002502229700005902254700006302313700002102376700002002397700006102417700006302478700002702541700006302568700002302631773010402654856008602758852000902844655001202853IND60744567720221120162036.0210820e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074456772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2021.1050842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEissa, Alaa Eldin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7042-899910aStreptococcus, Centrocestus formosanus and Myxobolus tilapiae concurrent infections in farmed Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)  aStress triggered concurrent microbial/parasitic infections are prevalent in earthen pond based farmed Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus. In the current study, a total of thirty five O. niloticus were collected from a commercial fish farm with a history of severe mortalities at Port Said, Egypt. Nile tilapia samples were subjected to bacteriological, parasitological and pathological examinations. Twenty one Enterococcus fecalis and 15 Streptococcus agalactiae isolates were presumptively identified utilizing the semi-automated API 20 Strept test kit. The identities of the retrieved bacteria were confirmed by the sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene. Moribund O. niloticus were found to be heavily infected by one or both of Centrocestus formosanus encysted metacercariae (EMC) and/or Myxobolus tilapiae spores presenting a unique form of synergistic and/or symbiotic relationship. The identities of both parasites were confirmed through morphological and molecular characterization. Variable circulatory, degenerative, necrotic and proliferative changes were also noticed in hematopoietic organs. Interestingly, multiple myxobolus spores and EMC were noticed in some histological sections. It was obvious that the current concurrent bacterial and parasitic infections are triggered by the deleterious effects of some stressing environmental conditions. The unfavorable climatic conditions (high temperature and high relative humidity) recorded at the surge of mortalities are probable predisposing stress factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus 3aMyxobolus 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aanalytical kits 3afish farms 3agenes 3ahistology 3ametacercariae 3apathogenesis 3arelative humidity 3asymbiosis 3atemperature 3aEgypt 0aNile tilapia 0aEnterococcus faecalis 0aCentrocestus formosanus 0aMyxobolus tilapiae 0aConcurrent infection1 aAttia, Marwa M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1383-48511 aElgendy, Mamdouh Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8627-06551 aIsmail, Gehad A.1 aSabry, Nader M.1 aPrince, Abdelbary1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6155-88711 aMahmoud, Mahmoud A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9385-25491 aEl-Demerdash, Ghada O.1 aAbdelsalam, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1406-70301 aDerwa, Hassan I.M.0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2021 Sept., v. 158 p.105084-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2021.1050843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01773naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245004600183300001600229520053300245592002800778650001400806650001300820650002600833651001500859651002300874653001400897653001500911653001100926653001500937700003100952700002700983700002201010700002601032700002001058700002501078700002201103700002201125773010701147856008801254852000901342655001201351IND60126459220221117002757.0151107e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012645922DNAL7 a10.7872/cryb.v33.iss3.2012.1992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarline, Lovanomenjanahary10aChecklist of the Bryophytes of Madagascar  ap. 199-255.  aThis updated checklist of the bryophytes of Madagascar was compiled from the literature, herbarium and recent collections.

In a randomized crossover design, ten physically active adults completed two 4-week training blocks, one where they maintained euhydration (EUH) and the other where they were water-restricted (DEH) during walking/running at 55% V.O₂ₘₐₓ, 40 °C. Three sessions per week were performed: (1) 1 h of exercise, (2) exercise until 2% or (3) 4% of body mass has been lost or replaced. Limited to the first and fourth training week, a 12 min walking/running time-trial was completed following the 2 and 4% exercise bouts. Trail making, the Wisconsin card sort, the Stop signal task, Simple visual reaction time and Corsi block-tapping tests were performed immediately following the time-trials. Body mass loss was maintained < 1% with EUH and reached 2.7 and 4.7% with DEH following the time-trials. Except for a lower percentage of correct responses (% accuracy) during the Wisconsin card sort test (p < 0.05) with DEH compared to EUH, no statistically significant decline in cognitive performance was induced by low and moderate levels of hypohydration. Compared to week 1, no statistical differences in cognitive responses were observed after repeated exposures to hypohydration (all p > 0.05). From a practical perspective, the gains in cognitive performance following training to DEH were mostly unclear, but under certain circumstances, were greater than when EUH was maintained. Based on the battery of cognitive tests used in the current study, we conclude that whether physically active individuals are habituated or not to its effect, exercise-induced hypohydration of 2 and 4% has, in general, no or unclear impact on cognitive performance immediately following exercise. These results encourage further research in this area.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3acognition 3across-over studies 3aeuhydration 3aexercise 3ahabituation1 aDaigle, Nicolas 1 aJeker, David 1 aLamontagne-Lacasse, Martin 1 aPerreault-Briere, Maxime 1 aClaveau, Pascale 1 aSimoneau, Ivan L.1 aChamoux, Estelle 1 aGoulet, Eric D.

Little is known about the antidepressant mechanism of CSS. The main aims of the this study were to evaluate the antidepressant-like effects of CSS and its components and further explore the CSS׳s effect upon signal transduction of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) expressions in the hippocampus of rats with depression induced by chronic unpredicted mild stress.SD rats were randomly divided into six groups: Normal; Model; CSS; Component I; Component II; and Fluoxetine. Antidepressant-like effects of CSS and two of its constituents, Components I and II in aqueous extract, were assessed using rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) by measuring weight change, observing the open-field test and measuring sucrose water consumption. Antidepressant mechanism were examined by measuring the effect of CSS, and two of its constituents, on extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) expression, phosphorylation-ERK5 (p-ERK5), and ERK5 mRNA in the hippocampus by using western blotting and Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Three preparations were prepared: (1) an aqueous extract of CSS (5.9g/kg·d); (2) Component I (3.3g/kg·d); and (3) Component II (2.6g/kg·d). During the 28-day CUMS, the three preparations were intragastrically administered all three preparations. Simultaneously a parallel positive fluoxetine control group was given fluoxetine hydrochloride (1.8mg/kg·d). Normal and Model groups were intragastrically administered with a isovolumic distilled water (4.5ml/kg·d).Depressed rats had decreased weight gain; decreased locomotor activity as measured by the open field test; and reduced sucrose consumption. The rats׳ hippocampus ERK5 activation was significantly suppressed. CSS reduced the incidence of depressive-like behaviors and increased ERK5 activation in depressed rats at the same rate as fluoxetine. Component I, and II, each had only a partial effect on the depression indicators measured.CSS aqueous extract has antidepressant-like effects on CUMS-induced depression model rats. The antidepressant effect of CSS is greater than that of either the two separate components measured. CSS׳s antidepressant mechanism may be mediated by reversing the stress-induced disruption of ERK5 activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aantidepressants 3ahippocampus 3alocomotion 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3asignal transduction 3asucrose 3atraditional medicine 3aweight gain 0aCSS 0aTCM 0aCUMS 0aERK 0ap-ERK 0aMAPK 0aBDNF 0aChaihu-Shugan-San 0aAntidepressant-like activity 0aExtracellular signal-regulated kinase 0aHippocampus1 aHu, Sui-Yu1 aZhang, Chun-Hu1 aShi, Guang-Qing1 aXu, Rulin,1 aXiang, Tian0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2014 Mar. 14, v. 152, no. 2 p.320-326dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2014.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01364naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245013800160300001600298500001900314520028800333592002800621650001800649650002200667650001600689650001300705651001000718653001700728653001300745700001200758700002000770700002000790773011900810856007600929852000901005655001201014IND60736701620221120053909.0210510e20210429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073670162DNAL7 a10.3897/jhr.82.647422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Shu-Ping10aTwo new species of Anisotacrus Schmiedeknecht (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae, Ctenopelmatinae) with a key to Eastern Palaearctic species  ap. 187-197.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTwo species of genus Anisotacrus Schmiedeknecht, 1913, A. externus Sheng & Sun, sp. nov. and A. senticosus Sheng & Sun, sp. nov., collected from the Natural Reserve, Huairou, Beijing, are described and illustrated.

One of the 12–14 major clades identified in the genus is the Leptostemonum clade, or tire “spiny solanums.” Previous molecular phylogenetic studies have identified 14 major clades in the spiny solanums. Among these is the Carolinense clade, which contains Solanum carolinense, the type species of S. subsect. Lathyrocarpum. However, previous results have suggested that the species composition of the Carolinense clade is only partially congruent with taxonomic circumscriptions of S. subsect. Lathyrocarpum. The main goal of this study was to increase taxon sampling over previous molecular phylogenies in order to better understand the composition of the Carolinense clade. We newly sequenced 31 accessions of 17 taxa putatively belonging to the clade for two nuclear (ITS, waxy) and one plastid gene region (trnT-trnF) and combined these with previously generated molecular data. Phylogenetic analyses of separate and combined DNA matrices were done using maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods. Results from analyses of the combined nuclear and plastid data set showed 10 taxa to be resolved within a well-supported Carolinense clade. However, three species, Solanum dimidiatum, S. perplexum, and S. hieronymi, showed conflicting placements in phylogenies based on analyses of nuclear vs. plastid data sets, suggesting a history of allopolyploidy or introgression. Within the Carolinense clade, the North and South American species were both recovered as well-supported clades, implying a single dispersal event from South to North America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum carolinense 3aSolanum dimidiatum 3aallopolyploidy 3adata collection 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aintrogression 3aphylogeny 3aplant taxonomy 3aplastid DNA 3aspecies diversity 3aNorth America 0aAllopolyploidy 0agranule-bound starch synthase (GBSSI) 0ahybridization 0aphylogeny 0aSolanum subsect.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies indicate that the particle size decreases when doped with Mn. The ferroelectric Curie temperature estimated from differential thermal analysis (DTA) study shows a decreasing tendency with the increase of Mn concentration. Magnetic study shows that below 200 K all samples exhibit ferromagnetic behavior and magnetization value at 10 K increases from 0.0027 to 2.75 emu/gm when doped with 5% Mn. Enhancement of magnetization observed in these nanocrystals were discussed on the basis of the combined effect of local ferrimagnetization by B-site doping and the breakdown of spin cycloid due to smaller particle size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3amagnetic properties 3amanganese 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aHossain, S.K.M.1 aChakravorty, D.1 aPal, M.0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 July, v. 11, no. 4 p.976-980dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2010.12.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04015naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245011500202500002000317520174700337592002802084596005502112596005502167596005502222596005502277596002802332596003002360596002702390596004602417596008702463596005502550650001302605650001102618650001102629650003102640650001502671650000902686650002902695650001302724650001802737650001802755650001302773650001802786651001902804700006502823700006002888700002302948700005802971700006003029700006403089700006103153773013703214856007703351852000903428655001203437IND60795117120221119080226.0220930e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079511712DNAL7 a10.1029/2022JC0189712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallschuss, Sina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7071-716814aThe Influence of Agulhas Leakage on Primary Production and Nitrogen Cycling in the Southeastern Atlantic Ocean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe well‐established importance of Agulhas Current “leakage” for Indian‐Atlantic Ocean exchange of heat and salt raises the question of the relevance of Agulhas eddies for carbon and nitrogen cycling. We measured net primary production (NPP), nitrate and ammonium uptake, and nitrification along a transect of the Cape Basin (CB) in winter 2017, including across an anticyclonic Agulhas eddy sampled at high‐resolution. Euphotic zone‐integrated rates of NPP and nitrogen uptake were more than three‐fold lower at the eddy center than at its edges, with intermediate rates measured outside the eddy. Additionally, proportionally more nitrate was consumed at the eddy edges than at its center. Mixed‐layer integrated nitrification rates were highest at the eddy‐center, with lower rates at the edges and in the surrounding basin. Accounting for phytoplankton consumption of newly nitrified nitrate in the eddy decreased the carbon export potential inferred from nitrate uptake (i.e., the f‐ratio) by 66% ± 37% (vs. a 14% ± 22% decrease across the rest of the transect). At most stations, NPP and total measured nitrogen uptake were decoupled relative to stoichiometric expectations, with roughly a third of NPP possibly supported by regenerated dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). Accounting for DON uptake decreased the average f‐ratio from 0.28 ± 0.26 to 0.22 ± 0.21, with the highest f‐ratio estimated for an eddy‐edge station (0.64) and the lowest for its center (0.00). While the low productivity metrics measured in the eddy‐center could imply that Agulhas leakage decreases carbon export potential in the CB, enhanced nutrient supply and consumption at eddy edges may (partly) offset this reduction.  aPublisher supplied data  a129229cSouth African National Research Foundation  a112380cSouth African National Research Foundation  a129320cSouth African National Research Foundation  a116142cSouth African National Research Foundation  cUniversity of Cape Town  cHarry Crossley Foundation  cVC Future Leaders 2030  cAfrican Academy of Sciences/Royal Society  cSouth African Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment: Oceans and Coasts  cSouth African Department of Science and Innovation 3aammonium 3abasins 3acarbon 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3ageophysics 3aheat 3anet primary productivity 3anitrates 3anitrification 3aphytoplankton 3aresearch 3astoichiometry 3aAtlantic Ocean1 aMdutyana, Mhlangabezi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3854-388X1 aParrott, Ruan G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0592-99031 aForrer, Heather J.1 aRoman, Raymond1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7129-45151 aWalker, David R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4235-16991 aAnsorge, Isabelle J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7071-81471 aFawcett, Sarah E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0878-64960 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Sept., v. 127, no. 9 p.e2022JC018971-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JC0189713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01919naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013700162300001600299520084000315592002801155650001101183650001001194650002001204650000901224650000901233650002401242650001701266700001601283700001601299700001401315700001901329773009601348856008101444990002301525852000901548655001201557IND60096363820221120141140.0141104e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009636382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2011.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKane, S.N.10aOn the influence of Joule heating induced nanocrystallization on structural and magnetic properties of Co₆₄Fe₂₁B₁₅ alloy  ap. 981-985.  aStructural and magnetic properties of Joule heated Co₆₄Fe₂₁B₁₅ alloy have been studied. Crystallization of the specimens starts after Joule heating with 1.6 A current, leading to the formation of nanocrystalline Co₈₀Fe₂₀ phase with grain diameter ranging between 19 and 25 nm. Crystallization of the specimens is found to detoriate the soft magnetic properties. Observed decrease of the hyperfine field of the amorphous component upon Joule heating suggests the increase of the boron near-neighbours to iron and the changes in the hyperfine field of the crystalline component are attributed to the changes in the environment around Fe atom in the specimen. The coercivity is found to obey a domain wall pinning process instead of random anisotropy, as expected in soft magnetic nanocrystalline magnetic materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aboron 3acrystallization 3aheat 3airon 3amagnetic properties 3ananocrystals1 aCoisson, M.1 aTiberto, P.1 aVinai, F.1 aMazaleyrat, F.0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 July, v. 11, no. 4 p.981-985dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2011.01.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012700168300001800295520107500313536039301388592002801781596007401809596007601883596005401959596008502013650001002098650002302108650001102131650001102142650001602153650002302169650001102192650001402203650002202217650001002239650001402249650001102263650002002274650001302294650001202307650000902319653001502328653001402343653000902357653001102366653002002377700002002397700001602417700003002433700001602463700002002479700001802499700001602517773014102533856008502674852000902759655001202768IND60627845720221122124322.0190209e20181110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062784572DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2014.8980202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Weidong10aScreening of 19 Salix clones in effective phytofiltration potentials of manganese, zinc and copper in pilot-scale wetlands  ap. 1275-1283.  aWillows (Salix spp.) have been regarded as one of interesting plants for phytofiltration of water contaminated with trace metals. In this paper, the clonal differences in tolerance and phytofiltration capacity of mixed metals (Mn, Zn, and Cu) were evaluated in greenhouse pilot-scale wetlands with a floating-support culture system. The results showed that broad clonal variations of biomass accumulation in response to mixed metals ranging from growth inhibition to stimulation. Clones differed in tolerance to multi-metals by tolerance index (TI) based on shoot and root biomass. We also found that wide variations in uptake and accumulation of three metals, which was related to species/clones and metal species. The willows showed high Mn and Zn translocation capacity from roots to leaves suitable for phytoextraction. In contrast, all clones had poor Cu translocation capacity, and Cu mainly retained in roots suitable for rhizofiltration. Among all Salix clones, clones SM30 and J903 had large phytofiltration potential for three metals with their high tolerance.  aThis work was funded by Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 31100513), the Key International Cooperative Project of CN-USA (Grant No. 2010DFB33960), key project from Zhejiang Science and Technology Bureau (Grant No. 2011C13015), the Key project of Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant No. 2012BAC17B02) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 2010DFB33960cthe Key International Cooperative Project of CN-USA  aNo. 2011C13015ckey project from Zhejiang Science and Technology Bureau  aNo. 31100513cNatural Science Foundation of China  aNo. 2012BAC17B02cthe Key project of Ministry of Science and Technology of China 3aSalix 3abiomass production 3aclones 3acopper 3agreenhouses 3agrowth retardation 3aleaves 3amanganese 3aphytoaccumulation 3aroots 3ascreening 3ashoots 3awater pollution 3awetlands 3awillows 3azinc 0aSalix spp. 0amanganese 0azinc 0acopper 0aphytofiltration1 aZhao, Fengliang1 aDing, Zheli1 aShohag, Md.

Significance for Systems Biology and Metabolic Engineering  ap. 827-841.  aAt present, ¹³C-MFA is a primary method for quantitatively characterizing intracellular carbon fluxes in cells in vivo under steady-state conditions. The method has been successfully used to investigate both the fundamental characteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell metabolism and to improve producer strains for more than twenty years. This publication is the last in a set of reviews that describe various aspects of the method. Here, the authors highlight recent achievements that involved using ¹³C-MFA to elucidate bacterial metabolism. Analyses of well-characterized bacterial model strains revealed that central metabolism robustness is provided by a set of alternative metabolic pathways; these analyses also helped develop a better understanding of the physiological significance of these pathways and identified previously unknown functions of well-studied metabolic pathways. Several examples of ¹³C-MFA-based fundamental investigations of poorly characterized bacteria are also analyzed. In applied investigations, flux analysis of strains that produce amino acids, vitamins and antibiotics indicated targets for modifications, suggested unconventional metabolic engineering approaches, and, most importantly, confirmed their utility. In the last section of this article, ¹³C-MFA prospects, including the monitoring of the dynamics of metabolic flux distribution during culture growth, are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon 3aeukaryotic cells 3ametabolic engineering 3ametabolic flux analysis 3ametabolism 3amodels 3amonitoring 3astable isotopes 3avitamins1 aShupletsov, M.S.1 aMashko, S.V.0 tApplied biochemistry and microbiology.g2017 Dec., v. 53, no. 9 p.827-841dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl45505x0003-68387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S00036838170900583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245012900162300001800291520158500309592002801894650001301922650001401935650002501949650000901974650001901983650002002002650001702022650002602039650001702065650001302082650001702095650002902112650001602141653003502157653002302192653001702215653003902232653001502271700001502286700001302301700001802314700002502332700001902357700001602376700002002392700001802412773014902430856008202579852000902661655001202670IND60580214020221121094623.0170913e20170913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058021402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b028272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiya10aMultiplex Lateral Flow Immunoassays Based on Amorphous Carbon Nanoparticles for Detecting Three Fusarium Mycotoxins in Maize  ap. 8063-8071.  aThe detecting labels used for lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs) have been traditionally gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and, more recently, luminescent nanoparticles, such as quantum dots (QDs). However, these labels have low sensitivity and are costly, in particular, for trace detection of mycotoxins in cereals. Here, we provided a simple preparation procedure for amorphous carbon nanoparticles (ACNPs) and described multiplex LFAs employing ACNPs as labels (ACNP-LFAs) for detecting three Fusarium mycotoxins. The analytical performance of ACNPs in LFA was compared to GNPs and QDs using the same immunoreagents, except for the labels, allowing for their analytical characteristics to be objectively compared. The visual limit of detection for ACNP-LFAs in buffer was 8-fold better than GNPs and 2-fold better than QDs. Under optimized conditions, the quantitative limit of detection of ACNP-LFAs in maize was as low as 20 μg/kg for deoxynivalenol, 13 μg/kg for T-2 toxin, and 1 μg/kg for zearalenone. These measurements were much lower than the action level of these mycotoxins in maize. The accuracy and precision of the ACNP-LFAs were evaluated by analysis of spiked and incurred maize samples with recoveries of 84.6–109% and coefficients of variation below 13%. The results of ACNP-LFAs using naturally incurred maize samples showed good agreement with results from high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, indicating that ACNPs were more sensitive labels than and a promising alternative to GNPs used in LFAs for detecting mycotoxins in cereals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3aT-2 toxin 3acarbon nanoparticles 3acorn 3adeoxynivalenol 3adetection limit 3aimmunoassays 3aliquid chromatography 3aluminescence 3ananogold 3aquantum dots 3atandem mass spectrometry 3azearalenone 0aamorphous carbon nanoparticles 0agold nanoparticles 0aquantum dots 0amultiplex lateral flow immunoassay 0amycotoxins1 aYu, Xuezhi1 aWen, Kai1 aLi, Chenglong1 aMujtaba Mari, Ghulam1 aJiang, Haiyang1 aShi, Weimin1 aShen, Jianzhong1 aWang, Zhanhui0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Sept. 13, v. 65, no. 36 p.8063-8071dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.7b028273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01632naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245008900174300001800263520055700281592002800838650001200866650001100878650001000889650001200899650002400911650001300935650001600948650001900964651001100983653002600994653001301020653001501033773013301048856008001181852000901261655001201270IND60130219020221119124223.0151127e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013021902DNAL7 a10.1600/036364414X6826252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Marcos José da,10aManihot veadeirensis (Euphorbiaceae s. s.): A New Species from the Brazilian Cerrado  ap. 1161-1165.  aManihot veadeirensis, from Chapada dos Veadeiros, Goiás, Brazil, is described, illustrated, and assigned to Manihot section Quinquelobae.

This study aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology of the circulating virus lineages between March 2020 and February 2021. We performed variant identification, spike mutation pattern analysis, and phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses for 1106 high-coverage whole-genome sequences, implementing maximum likelihood, multiple continuous-time Markov chain, and Bayesian birth–death skyline models. For time trends, logistic regression was used. In the dataset, virus B.1.221 lineage was predominant (15.37%), followed by B.1.258 (15.01%) and B.1.1.29 (11.48%) strains. Three clades were identified, being responsible for 74.41% of infections over the analyzed period. Expansion in variant diversity was observed since September 2020 with increasing frequency of the number in spike substitutions, mainly H69V70 deletion, P681H, N439K, and S98F. In population dynamics inferences, three periods with exponential increase in infection were observed, beginning in March, July, and September 2020, respectively, and were driven by different virus clades. Additionally, a notable increase in infections caused by the B.1.1.7 lineage since February 2021 was noted. Over time, the virus accumulated mutations related to optimized transmissibility; therefore, faster dissemination is reflected by the second wave of epidemics in Poland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3adata collection 3amolecular epidemiology 3amutation 3aphylogeny 3apopulation dynamics 3aregression analysis 3aviruses 3aPoland1 aOssowski, Andrzej 1 aSzargut, Maria 1 aCytacka, Sandra 1 aUrbańska, Anna,1 aMajchrzak, Adam 1 aNiedźwiedź, Anna,1 aCzerska, Ewa 1 aPawińska-Matecka, Anna 1 aGołąb, Joanna,1 aParczewski, Miłosz 0 tViruses.g2021 July 02, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130712953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100002200173245009400195300001600289520114000305592002801445650002401473650001801497650002301515650001701538650001301555650001501568650000901583650004201592650000901634650002401643650001101667650001601678650001101694650001701705650001501722650001301737650001701750650002101767651001401788651002201802773011901824856005501943852000901998655001202007IND50059096020221121020308.0121011e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005909602DNAL7 a226204732pmid7 a10.1111/j.1440-1584.2012.01270.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScelza, Brooke A.10aFood scarcity, not economic constraint limits consumption in a rural Aboriginal community  ap. 108-112.  aObjective: To determine whether food scarcity or economic constraint is more strongly associated with purchasing patterns in a rural Aboriginal community. Design: Store receipts were collected to determine money spent in the community shop across a four‐month period from January to April 2006. Variability in expenditures is then studied using measures of food scarcity (days since shop loading) and economic constraint (days since payday). Setting: Parnngurr Outstation in the Western Desert of Australia. Main outcome measures: Daily gross and per‐household gross expenditures at the community shop. Results: There is a significant association between food scarcity and money spent in the shop (−42.89, confidence interval −62.62 to −23.18, P < 0.001). There is no association between economic constraint and money spent in the shop. Conclusion: In rural and remote communities, reliable access to food is critical to food security. Circumstantial constraints such as seasonal flooding and political insecurity can augment food access problems and put Aboriginal people at risk of malnutrition and other dietary harms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3afood security 3aindigenous peoples 3amalnutrition 3apolitics 3apurchasing 3arisk 2aCommercexstatistics & numerical data 2aDiet 2aFinancing, Personal 2aFloods 2aFood Supply 2aHumans 2aMalnutrition 2aOceanians. 2aPolitics 2aRisk Factors 2aRural Population 3aAustralia 0aWestern Australia0 tAustralian journal of rural health.g2012 June, v. 20, no. 3 p.108-112dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1038-52827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1584.2012.01270.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245021800163300001800381520167600399592002802075650001502103650001402118650002202132650002302154650002102177650001102198650001702209650001402226650001902240650002102259650002102280650001202301650002202313650002502335653002102360653003402381653002802415653002402443653001302467700001602480700001402496700001402510700001902524700001602543700001702559700002302576773014902599856008202748852000902830655001202839IND60580214120221121094648.0170913e20170913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058021412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b028422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wenhua10aMechanism of Reduction in IgG and IgE Binding of β-Lactoglobulin Induced by Ultrasound Pretreatment Combined with Dry-State Glycation: A Study Using Conventional Spectrometry and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry  ap. 8018-8027.  aBovine β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) is one of major allergens in cow’s milk. Previous study showed that ultrasound treatment induced the conformational changes of β-Lg and promoted the glycation in aqueous solutions, which is, however, less efficient compared with dry-state. In this work, the effect of ultrasound pretreatment combined with dry-state glycation on the IgG and IgE binding of β-Lg was studied. Dry-state glycation with mannose after ultrasound pretreatment at 0–600 W significantly reduced the IgG and IgE binding of β-Lg, with the lowest values observed at 400 W. The decrease in the IgG and IgE binding of β-Lg was attributed to the increase in glycation extent and the changes of secondary and tertiary structure, which reflected in the increase of UV absorbance, α-helix and β-sheet contents, as well as the decrease of intrinsic fluorescence intensity, surface hydrophobicity, β-turn, and random coil contents. Moreover, ultrasound pretreatment promoted the reduction of IgG and IgE binding abilities by improving glycation, reflecting in the increase of the glycation sites and the degree of substitution per peptide (DSP) value determined by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Ultrasound pretreatment at 400 W showed the most significantly enhanced glycation extent. Besides, the results suggested FTICR-MS could provide insights into the glycation at molecular level, which was conducive to the understanding of the mechanism of the reduction in the IgG and IgE binding of β-Lg. Therefore, ultrasound pretreatment combined with dry-state glycation may be a promising method for β-Lg hyposensitization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aallergens 3aaqueous solutions 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3abinding capacity 3acattle 3afluorescence 3aglycation 3ahydrophobicity 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amannose 3amass spectrometry 3aultrasonic treatment 0aβ-lactoglobulin 0aIgG and IgE binding abilities 0aultrasound pretreatment 0adry-state glycation 0aFTICR-MS1 aTu, Zongcai1 aWang, Hui1 aZhang, Lu1 aXu, Shengsheng1 aNiu, Chendi1 aYao, Honglin1 aKaltashov, Igor A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Sept. 13, v. 65, no. 36 p.8018-8027dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.7b028423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245005700167300001800224520122000242592002801462650002501490650001701515650001301532650002001545650001701565650001101582650001601593650001501609650001401624650001101638650002101649650001301670650001401683650001201697650001001709650000901719653001601728653001401744653002501758653002901783653002101812700002401833700001901857700001901876773014101895856008602036852000902122655001202131IND60627845920221122161429.0190209e20181110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062784592DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2015.10451222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoori, Azam10aLeucanthemum vulgare lam. crude oil phytoremediation  ap. 1292-1299.  aSites with crude oil pollution have been successfully treated using phytoremediation, but expanding the range of plants that can be used and understanding how exposure impacts the plants are two areas of study that are important to continue. Leucanthemum vulgare has been shown to grow well under a variety of stressful conditions. To examine L. vulgare’s ability to both survive crude oil exposure and to reduce crude oil concentrations in soil, plants were placed in soil containing 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, or 10% w/w crude oil. Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) concentration, peroxidase and catalase activity, proline and phenol content in roots and leaves were determined at the start of planting and every 2 months for 6 months. L. vulgare roots were successfully colonized with mycorrhizae under all conditions. Results showed positive correlation between antioxidant compound concentration and crude oil contamination. Also, a significant reduction occurred in TPH content of soil over time in planted pots as compared to controls. The lowest TPH content was recorded after 6 months under all treatments. Results showed L. vulgare could survive crude oil exposure and enhance reducing of crude oil from soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeucanthemum vulgare 3aantioxidants 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrocarbons 3aleaves 3amycorrhizae 3aperoxidase 3apetroleum 3aphenol 3aphytoremediation 3aplanting 3apollution 3aproline 3aroots 3asoil 0aAntioxidant 0apetroleum 0aLeucanthemum vulgare 0amycorrhizae colonization 0aphytoremediation1 aZare Maivan, Hassan1 aAlaie, Ebrahim1 aNewman, Lee A.0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2018 Nov. 10, v. 20, no. 13 p.1292-1299dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2015.10451223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03939naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245017800173300001800351520267800369592002803047650001603075650002203091650001503113650002203128650001703150650001903167650001103186650001003197650001703207650003303224650001603257650002103273700005803294773012003352856008403472852000903556655001203565IND60744428820221119023642.0210713e20210624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074442882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.1c001422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKummara, Sreenivas10aHeterogeneous Stress Distribution and Hierarchical Structure in the Highly Oriented Nylon 6 Strings Annealed at Various Temperatures to Evaluate the True Crystallite Modulus  ap. 6449-6465.  aThe apparent crystallite modulus Ecᵃᵖᵖ along the chain axis has been measured by the X-ray diffraction method for a series of melt-drawn nylon 6 strings annealed at various temperatures under tension, where “apparent” means Young’s modulus obtained under the assumption of the homogeneous stress distribution or the assumption of the equality between the crystalline stress and the stress of the bulk sample. The Ecᵃᵖᵖ decreased drastically from 160 GPa of the original unannealed sample to 60 GPa for the sample annealed in a temperature region of 30–180 °C (region I) and then increased steeply up to 230 GPa by the annealing in 180–220 °C (region II). The Ebᵤₗₖ or Young’s modulus of the bulk sample was about 3.5 GPa and did not change very much in region I, and it increased to 5 GPa by annealing in region II. In order to interpret the observed change in Ecᵃᵖᵖ and Ebᵤₗₖ from the structural point of view, various experimental data have been collected for all of the samples used here on the basis of the wide-angle and small-angle X-ray scattering, the polarized infrared (IR) spectra, and the thermal analysis, from which the unit cell parameters, the anisotropic crystallite size, the degree of crystallinity, the degree of chain orientation in the crystalline and amorphous regions, the long period and averaged thickness of the stacked lamellae, and so forth have been determined. The thus-derived structural features may be described as follows: the original melt-drawn sample consisted of the highly oriented crystalline phase and the mechanically strained and relatively highly oriented amorphous phase containing a small amount of the taut tie chains. The heat treatment in region I caused an increase of these tie chains with the chain orientation kept unchanged in both of the crystalline and amorphous regions. The annealing in region II induced the remarkable structural evolution of the larger crystallites with the more regularly packed and more highly extended chains. The mechanical series–parallel model was introduced, and the parameters (p and q) were chosen suitably to give a satisfactorily good reproduction of the observed Ecᵃᵖᵖ. The annealing effect on these parameters was found to correspond well to the structural evolution revealed by the X-ray and IR data analysis. The finally obtained maximal Ecᵗʳᵘᵉ or the true Young’s modulus along the chain axis was about 290 GPa for the sample annealed immediately below the melting point, which is closer to but slightly lower than the value 312 GPa predicted theoretically for the fully extended nylon 6 chains in the crystal lattice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanisotropy 3acrystal structure 3acrystallites 3aheat treatment 3amodels 3anylon 3areproduction 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3atemperature 3athermal analysis1 aTashiro, Kohji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7543-27780 tMacromolecules.g2021 June 24, v. 54, no. 13 p.6449-6465dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c001423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245006900166520148700235592002801722650001001750650001301760650002401773650001901797650001701816650002201833650001801855650001701873700002301890773012101913856007302034852000902107655001202116IND60745615920221119005208.0210723e20210702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074561592DNAL7 a10.3390/v130712942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuryawanshi, Yogesh R.10aOncolytic Viruses for Malignant Glioma: On the Verge of Success?  aGlioblastoma is one of the most difficult tumor types to treat with conventional therapy options like tumor debulking and chemo- and radiotherapy. Immunotherapeutic agents like oncolytic viruses, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and chimeric antigen receptor T cells have revolutionized cancer therapy, but their success in glioblastoma remains limited and further optimization of immunotherapies is needed. Several oncolytic viruses have demonstrated the ability to infect tumors and trigger anti-tumor immune responses in malignant glioma patients. Leading the pack, oncolytic herpesvirus, first in its class, awaits an approval for treating malignant glioma from MHLW, the federal authority of Japan. Nevertheless, some major hurdles like the blood–brain barrier, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and tumor heterogeneity can engender suboptimal efficacy in malignant glioma. In this review, we discuss the current status of malignant glioma therapies with a focus on oncolytic viruses in clinical trials. Furthermore, we discuss the obstacles faced by oncolytic viruses in malignant glioma patients and strategies that are being used to overcome these limitations to (1) optimize delivery of oncolytic viruses beyond the blood–brain barrier; (2) trigger inflammatory immune responses in and around tumors; and (3) use multimodal therapies in combination to tackle tumor heterogeneity, with an end goal of optimizing the therapeutic outcome of oncolytic virotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aantigens 3ablood-brain barrier 3acancer therapy 3aglioblastoma 3aimmunosuppression 3aimmunotherapy 3aradiotherapy1 aSchulze, Autumn J.0 tViruses.g2021 July 02, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130712943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01724naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245008900134300001600223520093700239592002801176653001301204653001101217653002701228653001501255653001201270700002201282700002201304773011101326852000901437655001201446IND60125300320221118145239.0151124e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012530032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScott, J.

A recent call for natural resource professional societies to endorse position statements on economic growth raises questions about how scientific societies can and should effectively contribute to policy development. Taking a stand on policy issues is akin to serving as a policy advocate. We believe that natural resource professionals can most constructively contribute to policy development by conducting rigorous research that is policy relevant and by effectively conveying the results and policy implications of that research to all parties interested in the issue. By actively engaging decisionmakers and providing information on pressing policy issues, professional societies can increase opportunities to be recognized as sources for reliable, unbiased information about natural resources and their management.  aPublisher supplied data 0aadvocacy 0apolicy 0aprofessional societies 0ascientists 0ascience1 aRachlow, Janet L.1 aLackey, Robert T.0 tBioScience.g2008 Oct., v. 58, no. 9 p.865-869dAmerican Institute of Biological Sciencesx0006-35687nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245008400169300001800253520122200271592002801493650002401521650002001545650002601565650001801591650001601609650001501625650001701640650001201657650001201669650002401681650001001705650001701715650001601732650000901748650000901757650003701766650001201803653005401815653001501869653003701884653002601921700001901947700001601966700002101982700002402003700002102027700002002048700002002068700002202088700002002110700002002130700001802150700002202168700002002190700001902210700002202229700002302251773014902274856008202423852000902505655001202514IND60580214320221121094638.0170913e20170913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058021432DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b029242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnozaki, Yasumichi10aFlupyrimin: A Novel Insecticide Acting at the Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors  ap. 7865-7873.  aA novel chemotype insecticide flupyrimin (FLP) [N-[(E)-1-(6-chloro-3-pyridinylmethyl)pyridin-2(1H)-ylidene]-2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide], discovered by Meiji Seika Pharma, has unique biological properties, including outstanding potency to imidacloprid (IMI)-resistant rice pests together with superior safety toward pollinators. Intriguingly, FLP acts as a nicotinic antagonist in American cockroach neurons, and [³H]FLP binds to the multiple high-affinity binding components in house fly nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (nAChR) preparation. One of the [³H]FLP receptors is identical to the IMI receptor, and the alternative is IMI-insensitive subtype. Furthermore, FLP is favorably safe to rats as predicted by the very low affinity to the rat α4β2 nAChR. Structure–activity relationships of FLP analogues in terms of receptor potency, featuring the pyridinylidene and trifluoroacetyl pharmacophores, were examined, thereby establishing the FLP molecular recognition at the Aplysia californica ACh-binding protein, a suitable structural surrogate of the insect nAChR. These FLP pharmacophores account for the excellent receptor affinity, accordingly revealing differences in its binding mechanism from IMI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAplysia californica 3aMusca domestica 3aPeriplaneta americana 3aacetylcholine 3aantagonists 3achemotypes 3aimidacloprid 3ainsects 3aneurons 3anicotinic receptors 3apests 3apharmacology 3apollinators 3arats 3arice 3astructure-activity relationships 3atritium 0apyridinylidene and trifluoroacetyl pharmacophores 0aflupyrimin 0anicotinic acetylcholine receptor 0anicotinic insecticide1 aHorikoshi, Ryo1 aOhno, Ikuya1 aKitsuda, Shigeki1 aDurkin, Kathleen A.1 aSuzuki, Tomonori1 aAsahara, Chiaki1 aHiroki, Natsuko1 aKomabashiri, Rena1 aShimizu, Rikako1 aFurutani, Shogo1 aIhara, Makoto1 aMatsuda, Kazuhiko1 aMitomi, Masaaki1 aKagabu, Shinzo1 aUomoto, Katsuhito1 aTomizawa, Motohiro0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Sept. 13, v. 65, no. 36 p.7865-7873dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.7b029243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01683naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009800170300001800268520076800286592002801054650002601082650002201108650001901130700001901149700001401168773009801182856008101280990002301361852000901384655001201393IND60096364320221120105707.0141104e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009636432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2011.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Edward Namkyu10aContact resistance dependent scaling-down behavior of amorphous InGaZnO thin-film transistors  ap. 1015-1019.  aHere, we report scaling effects on the electrical properties of amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs). The a-IGZO TFTs had same channel width/length ratio (W/L = 20), but different channel lengths (L = 20, 10, 5, and 2.5 μm). To examine the scaling-down behaviors, short-channel effects and contact resistance of the TFTs were investigated. As the channel length decreased, apparent shift of threshold voltage (Vₜₕ) and degradation of subthreshold swing (SSUB) were shown. In addition, it is also found that the field-effect mobility (μFE) was degraded as the channel length was decreased which was originated from contact resistance. Due to this contact resistance effect, drain current (IDS) was decreased for short-channel devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical properties 3afilms (materials) 3asemiconductors1 aKang, Jung Han1 aYun, Ilgu0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 July, v. 11, no. 4 p.1015-1019dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2011.01.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245013100202500002000333520125700353592002801610596005401638650001801692650001501710650001501725650003101740650002101771650001501792650001101807650000701818650001301825651002201838700006001860700006601920700002201986700006602008773013702074856007702211852000902288655001202297IND60795117620221119080116.0220930e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079511762DNAL7 a10.1029/2022JC0186152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFourrier, Marine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2227-995710aImpact of Intermittent Convection in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea on Oxygen Content, Nutrients, and the Carbonate System  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUsing Argo profiling floats, cruises and mooring data, we reconstructed the dissolved oxygen (O₂) dynamics in the Gulf of Lion and the Ligurian Sea, with a focus on the intermediate waters. By applying the CANYON‐MED neural network‐based method on the large network of O₂‐equipped Argo floats we derived nutrients and carbonate system variables in the Gulf of Lion and the Ligurian Sea at different depths in the water column and derived trends over the 2012–2020 period. In these waters, the O₂ minimum is strongly affected by the intermittent convection process, and the two areas show dissimilar responses to the mixing events. In the absence of deep convection events, the O₂‐depleted layer tends to spread vertically and intensify even more so in the Ligurian than in the Gulf of Lion. In both areas, over the 2012–2020 period, nutrients increase overall in deep layers, with a concomitant impact on nutrient molar ratios tending toward an increase in P‐limitation. Acidification estimates derived in different layers of the water column show an overall increase in dissolved inorganic carbon and a concurrent pH decrease. These trends were strongly affected by convection events slowing down the overall acidification trend.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR J11R107‐FcAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3aacidification 3acarbonates 3aconvection 3adissolved inorganic carbon 3adissolved oxygen 3ageophysics 3aoxygen 3apH 3aresearch 3aMediterranean Sea1 aCoppola, Laurent1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0473-11291 aD’Ortenzio, Fabrizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0617-73361 aMigon, Christophe1 aGattuso, Jean‐Pierre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4533-41140 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Sept., v. 127, no. 9 p.e2022JC018615-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JC0186153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245007000164300001800234520102400252592002801276650001101304650001001315650001201325650003301337650001001370650001501380650001401395650001901409650001101428651001701439653003201456653001501488653001601503653001501519700002201534700001401556700002201570773011901592856008201711852000901793655001201802IND60130219520221119124340.0151127e20140903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013021952DNAL7 a10.1600/036364414X6838682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDreyer, L.

Superficially it closely resembles Oxalis aridicola, Oxalis callosa, Oxalis odorata, and Oxalis primuloides, and it shares a unique supra-areolate pollen type with most of these species. No single vegetative morphological character defines this species, but a unique combination of bulb and leaflet characters distinguishes it from all other known species. The flowers of Oxalis noctiflora are unique for the genus in displaying typical moth-pollination characters. The white flowers open at night, have a long, unusually narrow, corolla tube, and produce a strong sweet scent. All previously described Oxalis species have flowers that open during the day. Phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear Internal Transcribed Spacer data placed this species sister to O. aridicola within a clade of morphologically and palynologically similar taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOxalis 3abulbs 3acorolla 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aodors 3apalynology 3aphylogeny 3aplant taxonomy 3apollen 3aSouth Africa 0aInternal Transcribed Spacer 0amorphology 0anew species 0apalynology1 aMacfarlane, R.

Of the twelve analyzed elements, the highest concentration was found for Fe followed by Mn > Se > Zn > Mo > Cu > Cr > Pb > Cd >Ni > As > Co in rhizospheric substrate of Z. mauritiana grown on FA dumps. Metal accumulation, bioconcentration factor, and translocation factor for each metal were calculated in various parts of the edible fruit tree. Significant variations of metal accumulations were observed among various plant parts. Accumulation of toxic elements was higher in roots, and it gradually declined toward the aerial parts of the plant corresponding to its distance from the ground. The concentration of some elements in fruit tree was found to be above prescribed limits in edible parts. Therefore, the present study suggested that additional care should be undertaken, if edible fruit trees are considered for phytoremediation or afforestation programs of FA dumps.  aFinancial support given to main author by Science and Engineering Research Board (No.SR/FTP/ES-96/2012), Government of India, is gratefully acknowledged.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.SR/FTP/ES-96/2012cScience and Engineering Research Board, Government of India 3aZiziphus mauritiana 3aaerial parts 3aafforestation 3aarsenic 3aash dumps 3abioaccumulation factor 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aedible fruits 3afly ash 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3aphytoaccumulation 3apower plants 3aroots 3atoxic substances 3azinc 0aFly ash dumps 0aelements 0aedible fruit tree 0aphytoaccumulation1 aMishra, Tripti0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 20, no. 12 p.1250-1256dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2016.12677033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02025naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245009800166300001600264500001900280520085500299592002801154650001601182650000901198650001901207650001101226650001201237650001301249650002101262651002201283651001101305653001501316653002701331653001701358653002601375700002201401773011901423856007601542852000901618655001201627IND60736702320221120053854.0210510e20210429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073670232DNAL7 a10.3897/jhr.82.608952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinckley, Robert L.10aExtreme species density of bees (Apiformes, Hymenoptera) in the warm deserts of North America  ap. 317-345.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDespite the long intertwined evolutionary histories of bees and plants, bee diversity peaks in the xeric areas of the eastern and western hemispheres and not the tropics, where plant diversity is greatest. Intensive sampling in the northeast Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico and the United States provide the first quantitative estimate of bee species richness where high diversity had been predicted in North America from museum records. We find that the density of bee species in a limited area of 16 km² far exceeds any other site in the world and amounts to approximately 14% of the bee species described from the United States. Long-term studies of bees and other pollinators from areas that are minimally impacted by humans provide much-needed baseline data for studies of bees where human impacts are more severe and as climate change accelerates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHymenoptera 3abees 3aclimate change 3ahumans 3amuseums 3aresearch 3aspecies richness 3aChihuahuan Desert 3aMexico 0aAnthophila 0abee-plant interactions 0aBiodiversity 0apollen specialization1 aRadke, William R.0 tJournal of Hymenoptera research.g2021 Apr. 29, v. 82 p.317-345dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2122x1314-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/jhr.82.608953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013600171300001600307520154300323592002801866650001501894650001601909650001301925650001401938650001001952650001801962650000901980650002101989650001402010650001502024650001402039650001702053650001102070650002002081700002102101700002702122700002602149700001702175700002002192700002302212773013302235856008202368852000902450655001202459IND60588925720221121090406.0191106e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058892572DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-017-1413-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLasheen, Mohamed E.10aPredicting early pregnancy in Egyptian buffalo cows via measuring uterine and luteal blood flows, and serum and saliva progesterone  ap. 137-142.  aVarious methods are being employed to detect early pregnancy in domestic animals. This study aimed to predict early pregnancy in buffaloes via measuring the corpus luteum (CL) diameter, the luteal blood flow (LBF) area, the uterine blood flow (UBF) vascularization area, and progesterones in saliva and serum for non-pregnant (NPBs, N = 12) and pregnant (PBs, N = 12) buffaloes. The results revealed that the CL diameter and the luteal color blood flow blue and red (P = 0.0001) areas of the pregnant animals kept increasing from day 1 to day 35 of the gestation period, but it decreased in NPBs on day 21 after reaching a peak from ovulation to day 18. Interestingly, the UBF of the pregnant buffaloes (PBs) kept increasing (P = 0.0001) from ovulation to day 42. The difference of the CL diameter (P = 0.03) and the LBF color blue vascularization area (P = 0.002) between PBs and NPBs became clear from day 14 after ovulation, though the difference of UBF between PBs and NPBs became markedly obvious from day 7 after breeding. Both saliva (P = 0.001) and serum (P = 0.0001) progesterones of PBs continued increasing (P = 0.0001) from day 14 to day 35, but those of NPBs started decreasing (P = 0.0001) from day 14 and reached low values on day 21. Therefore, measuring saliva progesterone in addition to the high LBF (day 14) and UBF (day 7) of the pregnant buffaloes using a Doppler ultrasound could be applicable as noninvasive methods to detect early pregnancy and to improve reproductive management of buffaloes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood flow 3ablood serum 3abreeding 3abuffaloes 3acolor 3acorpus luteum 3acows 3agestation period 3aovulation 3aprediction 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone 3asaliva 3aultrasonography1 aBadr, Hussein M.1 aKandiel, Mohamed M.

But yet, no controlled human study has determined its efficacy in diabetic patients. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of the Juglans regia leaf extract on hyperglycemia and lipid profiles in type II diabetic patients.Total 61 patients, suffering from type II diabetes with fasting blood glucose (FBG) between 150 and 200mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) between 7% and 9% and aged between 40 and 60 years were selected, and randomly divided in to two groups of Juglans regia and placebo. First group received 100mg Juglans regia leaf extract in capsules form two times a day for 3 months and other group received 100mg placebo capsule with the same dosage. The standard anti-diabetic therapy (metformin and glibenclamide, and nutritional regimen) was continued in both groups. At the baseline and after three months the FBG, insulin, HbA1c, cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, LDL and liver and renal function tests were determined. In addition general satisfaction with the treatment was identified using health questionnaires.The results indicated that FBG, HbA1c, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in Juglans regia treated patients significantly decreased compared with the baseline and with placebo group. Patients in Juglans regia group were significantly satisfied with Juglans regia treatment compared with the placebo group. No liver, kidney and other side effects were observed in the groups, except more GI events (specially a mild diarrhea) associated with extract treatment at the beginning of the study.In conclusion, treatment of type II diabetic patients with 100mg Juglans regia leaf extract two times a day for three months improves lipid profile and glycemic control without any tangible adverse effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuglans regia 3aadverse effects 3ablood glucose 3acholesterol 3aclinical trials 3adiarrhea 3aglibenclamide 3aglycemic control 3aglycohemoglobin 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin 3akidney function tests 3akidneys 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3alipid composition 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein 3ametformin 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine 3atriacylglycerols 3aIran 0aJuglans regia 0aDiabetes 0aMedicinal plants 0aBlood glucose 0aLipid profiles1 aJamshidi, Leila1 aMehrzadi, Saeed1 aMohammad, Kazem1 aNajmizadeh, Ali Reza1 aAlimoradi, Houman1 aHuseini, Hasan Fallah0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2014 Mar. 28, v. 152, no. 3 p.451-456dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2014.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100007300142245014100215300001600356500001900372520085300391592002801244650001401272650000901286650001301295651001201308651001001320653001501330653001401345653002001359653001301379653001301392700002901405773011901434856007601553852000901629655001201638IND60736702420221120053933.0210510e20210429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073670242DNAL7 a10.3897/jhr.82.641302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAstafurova, I︠U︡.

Like biodiversity hotspots and frontier forests, the world's largest wetlands are now mapped and described by an international team of scientists, highlighting their conservation importance at the global scale. We explore current understanding of some ecosystem services wetlands provide. We selected four of these wetlands (the largest peatland, West Siberian Lowland; the largest floodplain, Amazon River Basin; the least-known wetland, Congo River Basin; and the most heavily developed wetland, Mississippi River Basin), and we illustrate their diversity, emphasizing values and lessons for thinking big in terms of conservation goals. Recognizing the global significance of these wetlands is an important first step toward forging global conservation solutions. Each of the world's largest wetlands requires a basinwide sustainable management strategy built on new institutional frameworks——at international, national, and regional levels——to ensure provision of their vital services.  aPublisher supplied data 0aecosystem function 0aecosystem service 0aglobal priority 0alargest wetlands 0awetland conservation1 aFraser, Lauchlan H.1 aSolomeshch, Ayzik I.1 aJunk, Wolfgang J.1 aCampbell, Danq(Daniel),1 aArroyo, Mary T.

Timoshenko beam theory is employed to take into account the effects of shear deformation and rotary inertia. It is found that, in addition to surface effects, the resonance frequency could perceptively depend on adsorption-induced mass and bending stiffness variation of the microbeam which in turn depend on the adatom category and the substrate material. Adsorption and surface effects on the first three modes of vibrations are also studied, and comparisons are made with the results obtained on the basis of Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. This study is of interest for the optimal design of micro- and nanobeam-based sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adeformation 3amodels1 aHasheminejad, Seyyed M.0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 July, v. 11, no. 4 p.1035-1041dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2011.01.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008500166300001400251520084800265592002801113650001301141650001601154650001001170650001501180650001401195650002101209650001901230650004301249650001701292650001501309650002201324650000701346650001301353650002501366650001601391650001701407650002001424700002001444700002001464700002201484773013201506856008201638852000901720655001201729IND60590904720221118040110.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059090472DNAL7 a10.1134/S00036838180100762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuranova, T.A.10aHydrolysis of Soybean Proteins with Kamchatka Crab Hepatopancreas Enzyme Complex  ap. 76-82.  aTo perform hydrolysis with the enzyme complex from the hepatopancreas of the Kamchatka crab, a protein mixture was isolated from soybean meal by extraction at alkaline pH values. Extractable low-molecular impurities were removed by ultrafiltration and precipitation of proteins with alcohol. The amino acid composition of the obtained protein extract turned out to be similar to the composition of the fish meal traditionally used in the production of fish feeds. Analysis of the products of fermentolysis by DDS-electrophoresis, HPLC, and mass spectrometry showed a high degree of hydrolysis of soybean proteins. Depending on the time of fermentolysis, the hydrolysates contained up to 60% (18 h of hydrolysis) of free amino acids (the fraction of the weight of the hydrolyzed protein mixture) and short peptides (2–20 amino acid residues).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aamino acids 3acrabs 3afish feeds 3afish meal 3afree amino acids 3ahepatopancreas 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3amass spectrometry 3apH 3apeptides 3aprotein hydrolysates 3asoy protein 3asoybean meal 3aultrafiltration1 aZinchenko, D.V.1 aMelanyina, L.A.1 aMiroshnikov, A.I.0 tApplied biochemistry and microbiology.g2018 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.76-82dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl45505x0003-68387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S00036838180100763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002500142245009900167300001600266520168400282592002801966650004801994650004202042650003002084650002502114650004402139650002002183650001302203650002102216650002102237650001602258650002302274650003202297650001102329650000702340650001702347650001602364650002502380650001702405650001902422650001602441700002602457700001702483773011002500856004502610852000902655655001202664IND4520854220221120043542.0151109e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452085422DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2011001132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJha, Chaitanya Kumar10aIsolation of Rhizobacteria from Jatropha curcas and characterization of produced ACC deaminase  ap. 285-295.  aDecreased levels of ACC (1âaminocyclopropaneâ1âcarboxylic acid) result in lower levels of endogenous ethylene, which eliminate the potentially inhibitory effects of stressâinduced higher ethylene concentrations. It is worth noting the substantial ability of the bacterial species to colonize different environments, including taxonomically distinct plants cultivated in distantly separated geographical regions. For example, Enterobacter cloacae, designated as MSA1 and Enterobacter cancerogenus, designated as MSA2 were recovered from the rhizosphere of Jatropha in the present work. This study first time confirms the ACC deaminase activity in the Enterobacter cancerogenus on the preliminary basis. Several bacterial plant growthâpromoting mechanisms were analyzed and detected like phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, IAA production, GA3 (gibberellic acid) production and ACC deaminase activity in the isolated cultures. Isolates were grown until exponential growth phase to evaluate their ACC deaminase activity and the effect of pH, temperature, salt, metals and substrate concentration after the partial purification of enzyme by ion exchange chromatography. The FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED (FTâIR) spectra were recorded for the confirmation of Î±âketobutyrate production. By using lineweaver Burk plot Km and Vmax value for ACC deaminase of both the organism was calculated in the different fractions. In this work, we discuss the possible implications of these bacterial mechanisms on the plant growth promotion or homeostasis regulation in natural conditions. (Â© 2012 WILEYâVCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This has been achieved by means of a thermo-chemical process and a true continuous flow system. This also enables combination of esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) and transesterification of triglycerides into a single process without utilizing a catalyst, and leads to a 98–99±0.5 % conversion efficiency of FAME within 1min in the temperature range of 350–500°C. High FFA content in oil feedstock is not a matter of the new process, which enables the use of a broader variety of feedstocks, including all edible and inedible fats. Another feature of this novel method is that it does not produce wastewater. Thus, the new process has potential to spur a breakthrough in the lowest cost of biodiesel production. Moreover, this method also requires utilization of carbon dioxide during biodiesel production, an additional environmental benefit.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3alipid content 3acarbon dioxide 3aecosystem services 3afree fatty acids 3acontinuous systems 3acatalysts 3atransesterification 3atriacylglycerols 3aesterification 3amethodology 3aproduction costs 3abiodiesel 3afeedstocks 2aBacteria, Aerobicxmetabolism 2aBiofuelsxmicrobiology 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aCatalysis 2aEquipment Design 2aEquipment Failure Analysis 2aEsterification 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxmetabolism 2aRheologyxinstrumentation 0anew methods1 aYi, Haakrho1 aPark, Jongseok1 aSeo, Jaegun0 tBioresource technology.g2012 June, v. 114 p.370-374dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.03.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01928naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009700167300001600264520097300280592002801253650002001281650001101301650001501312650001801327653002101345653001801366653001601384653002101400773009901421856008501520852000901605655001201614IND60747324820221123034343.0210911e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074732482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2021.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalman, Haim10aEffect of moisture content on flowability: Angle of repose, tilting angle, and Hausner ratio  ap. 582-596.  aThe angle of repose, angle of tilting, and Hausner ratio are frequently used to estimate the flowability of a particulate material. In this study, these factors were determined for 12 samples as a function of the moisture content. The measurements were thoroughly analyzed and indicate that the angle of tilting is the most appropriate for describing a material's response to moisture content. The flowability results clearly showed three types of materials according to their response to moisture content: solid particles, porous particles, and size-changing particles. A thorough analysis of various sizes of spherical solid particles enabled the identification of five zones from dry to fully immersed in water, and a zone map could be obtained. In addition, a model predicting flowability as a function of moisture content and Archimedes number could then be developed. Further experiments are required to relate the zone map and model to other types of materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangle of repose 3amodels 3atechnology 3awater content 0aAngle of tilting 0aHausner ratio 0aFlowability 0aMoisture content0 tPowder technology.g2021 Nov., v. 393 p.582-596dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01739naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011100165300001800276520083300294592002801127650001901155650001501174650001201189700001901201700001701220773009901237856008101336990002301417852000901440655001201449IND60096364920221120075404.0141104e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009636492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2011.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Sang Mo10aNanoscale studies of defect-mediated polarization switching dynamics in ferroelectric thin film capacitors  ap. 1111-1125.  aRecent developments in ferroelectric (FE) domain imaging techniques have established an understanding of intriguing polarization switching dynamics.

Recent nanoscale PFM-based studies have demonstrated that quenched defects inside the FE thin films play important roles in domain switching processes, including defect-mediated inhomogeneous nucleation, pinning-dominated nonlinear dynamics of domain walls, and many other intriguing phenomena.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3amicroscopy 3aphysics1 aYoon, Jong-Gul1 aNoh, Tae Won0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 Sept., v. 11, no. 5 p.1111-1125dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2011.05.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245013600208520146900344592002801813650001501841650001401856650002401870650001101894650000901905650001701914650002501931650001301956651001201969653003501981653002502016653001402041653002202055700002002077773010502097856008602202852000902288655001202297IND60697393420221117191446.0210617e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069739342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1251502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Dongkyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4222-744412aA stochastic rainfall model that can reproduce important rainfall properties across the timescales from several minutes to a decade  aA stochastic rainfall model that can reproduce various rainfall characteristics at timescales between 5 min and one decade is introduced. The model generates the fine-scale rainfall time series using a randomized Bartlett-Lewis rectangular pulse model. Then the rainstorms are shuffled such that the correlation structure between the consecutive storms are preserved. Finally, the time series is rearranged again at the monthly timescale based on the result of the separate coarse-scale monthly rainfall model. The method was tested using the 69 years of 5-minute rainfall data recorded at Bochum, Germany. The mean, variance, covariance, skewness, and rainfall intermittency were well reproduced at the timescales from 5 min to a decade without any systematic bias. The extreme values were also well reproduced at timescales from 5 min to 3 days. The past-7-day rainfall before an extreme rainfall event, which is highly associated with the extreme flow discharge was reproduced well too. The rainstorm shuffling approaches introduced here may be adopted as a standard procedure in combination with any Poisson cluster rainfall model. The methods are simple and parsimonious, yet significantly reduce the systematic underestimation of rainfall variance at coarse scales, and improve the reproduction of skewness, and extreme rainfall depths values at a range of time-scales, thereby addressing well-known shortcomings of Poisson cluster rainfall models.  aPublisher supplied data 3acovariance 3ahydrology 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3arain 3areproduction 3atime series analysis 3avariance 3aGermany 0aPoisson cluster rainfall model 0aRainfall variability 0aTimescale 0aHolistic approach1 aOnof, Christian0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Oct., v. 589 p.125150-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1251503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010400171300001800275520132700293592002801620650003001648650000901678650000801687650001801695650001601713650001201729650001001741650001601751650002701767650002901794650001701823650001501840650001101855650001501866650001601881650001501897653001701912653002701929653001701956653002301973653001701996700001702013700001602030700002002046773010502066856008502171852000902256655001202265IND60519042520221118071141.0170218e20160702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051904252DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2015.11253942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSekine, Yoshika10aColorimetric monitoring of formaldehyde in indoor environment using built-in camera on mobile phone  ap. 1647-1655.  aA simple monitoring system of indoor air pollution is proposed by integrating a novel colorimetric detector of formaldehyde (HCHO) and a function of a built-in camera on mobile phone. The colorimetric detector employs a solid phase colorimetric reagent made from 4-amino-3-hydrazino-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole, ZnO, KIO ₄ and agar, and changes colour from white to purple by exposure to HCHO gas. The degree of colour changes expressed in Red, Green and Blue model model responded to the HCHO concentration levels both in air and from building materials. Limit of quantitation of the detector with 24 h-exposure resulted in 0.011 mg/m ³ of air concentration which meets a requirement of methodology to detect indoor air quality guideline level of HCHO set by World Health Organization. The detector is also applicable to classify HCHO-emitting materials at least into Type 1, whose emission flux is greater than 120 μg/m ²/h, and others. Then, variation of the acquired photo images was investigated by using various mobile phones and changing conditions of photography. As a result, the calibration of the measured colour intensity with a colour standard reduced the variation of the results and gave a significant output when the auto-focused images were taken under the condition of common indoor environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aagar 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acameras 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3aconstruction materials 3aenvironmental technology 3aformaldehyde 3aguidelines 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aphotography 3azinc oxide 0aFormaldehyde 0acolorimetric detection 0amobile phone 0aindoor environment 0ahome testing1 aKatori, Risa1 aTsuda, Yuko1 aKitahara, Takio0 tEnvironmental technology.g2016 July 2, v. 37, no. 13 p.1647-1655dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2015.11253943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024003400131024004100165040001800206100001800224245015600242300001800398506002800416506005600444506007600500506003100576520116200607592002801769596007001797596006501867506003701932650001201969650001801981650004401999650001902043650002202062650001702084650001802101650001102119650003702130650001402167653002202181653001902203653002102222653003102243653001402274653002502288700003302313700002102346700002202367700002602389700001202415700002302427700002402450700002302474700001702497700002502514773014902539856008102688903002202769852000902791655001202800IND60580215020221207102000.0170913e20170913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058021502DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b034892chorus7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b034892doi7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b034892chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Ron H.10aFacile Purification of Milligram to Gram Quantities of Condensed Tannins According to Mean Degree of Polymerization and Flavan-3-ol Subunit Composition  ap. 8072-8082.  aResource is Open Access  aAmerican Chemical Society (ACS) License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aUnambiguous investigation of condensed tannin (CT) structure–activity relationships in biological systems requires well-characterized, high-purity CTs. Sephadex LH-20 and Toyopearl HW-50F resins were compared for separating CTs from acetone/water extracts, and column fractions analyzed for flavan-3-ol subunits, mean degree of polymerization (mDP), and purity. Toyopearl HW-50F generated fractions with higher mDP values and better separation of procyanidins (PC) and prodelphinidins (PD) but required a prepurification step, needed more time for large scale purifications, and gave poorer recoveries. Therefore, two gradient elution schemes were developed for CT purification on Sephadex LH-20 providing 146–2000 mg/fraction. Fractions were analyzed by thiolysis and NMR spectroscopy. In general, PC/PD ratios decreased and mDP increased during elution. ¹H NMR spectroscopy served as a rapid screening tool to qualitatively determine CT enrichment and carbohydrate impurities present, guiding fractionation toward repurification or ¹H–¹³C HSQC NMR spectroscopy and thiolysis. These protocols provide options for preparing highly pure CT samples.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cUniversity of Readingdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/5011000008390 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetone 3afractionation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3aproanthocyanidins 3aprocyanidins 3arapid methods 3aresins 3astructure-activity relationships 3athiolysis 0aproanthocyanidins 0aSephadex LH-20 0aToyopearl HW-50F 0anuclear magnetic resonance 0athiolysis 0abatch chromatography1 aMueller-Harvey, I.q(Irene),1 aZeller, Wayne E.1 aReinhardt, Laurie1 aStringano, Elisabetta1 aGea, An1 aDrake, Christopher1 aRopiak, Honorata M.1 aFryganas, Christos1 aRamsay, Aina1 aHardcastle, Emily E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Sept. 13, v. 65, no. 36 p.8072-8082dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b034893Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle01768naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010600165300001400271520053800285592002800823650002600851650001200877650001200889650001300901650001200914650001800926650001100944650002100955650002200976650001700998700002001015700002501035700001701060700001801077700002201095700001801117773013201135856008201267852000901349655001201358IND60590905220221118040232.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059090522DNAL7 a10.1134/S00036838180101312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalyzin, V.V.10aMethemoglobin Reductase of Bacteria and Bacteroids Bradyrhizobium lupini: Purification and Properties  ap. 26-33.  aReductase capable of reducing hemoglobin-like proteins was isolated from nodule bacteria Bradyrhizobium lupini and bacteroids of lupine root nodules.

The viral genome is 23,954 bp comprising 10 segmented double-stranded RNAs with a new electropherotype among cypoviruses. Each segment encodes one putative protein and has non-coding regions that contain conserved sequences at their 5′ and 3′ termini, 5′-AGAA(U/A)U-3′ and 5′-UGC-3′, respectively. Seven proteins encoded in the genome are homologous to those of other cypoviruses at a cut-off E-value of 1 × 10⁻⁵. The maximal sequence identities of these proteins with cypovirus homologs are 24.30%–39.40%. These results indicate that the virus isolated is a novel cypovirus; herein designated as Biston robustus cypovirus 24 (BrCPV-24).

Though trichinellosis and agents thereof are serious problems for human health and animal husbandry, only a limited number of Trichinella isolates from Serbia have been identified at the species level so far. The aim of the present study was the surveillance and monitoring of Trichinella in domestic pigs and wild animals from the endemic district of Branicevo. Investigations performed during the 2009–2010 period revealed Trichinella infections in 344 out of 282,960 (0.12%) domestic pigs. Among wildlife, Trichinella infections were detected in 11 out of 94 (11.7%) wild boars (Sus scrofa), 7 out of 57 (12.3%) red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), 7 out of 13 (53.8%) golden jackals (Canis aureus), and in all three examined wolves (Canis lupus). Trichinella spiralis and Trichinella britovi were the only two species identified. T. britovi was identified in 31% of isolates from wildlife of the Branicevo district and T. spiralis was found in 53% of wild animals; mixed infections were observed in 16% of the animals examined. Findings form the basis of an information campaign for veterinary services, pig owners and the hunter's associations about the risk of the transmission of these zoonotic agents. The application of control programs as established at the Veterinary Specialist Institute of Pozarevac resulted in a decline in Trichinella infections among domestic pigs and the absence of human trichinellosis in the last three years in the Branicevo district.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis lupus 3aSus scrofa 3aTrichinella spiralis 3aVulpes vulpes 3aanimal husbandry 3ahosts 3aindigenous species 3ajackals 3amixed infection 3arisk 3aswine 3atrichinosis 3awild boars 3awildlife 3awolves 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aAnimals, Wild 2aDigestion 2aEndemic Diseasesxstatistics & numerical dataxveterinary. 2aFoxesxparasitology 2aJackalsxparasitology 2aLarva 2aMultiplex Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aMusclesxparasitology 2aPopulation Surveillance 2aPrevalence 2aSus scrofa 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitologyxprevention & control. 2aTrichinellaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aTrichinellosisxepidemiologyxparasitologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aWolvesxparasitology 3aSerbia 0aSerbiaxepidemiology. 0aTrichinella species 0aDomestic pigs 0aWild animals 0aEpidemiology 0aControl1 aSofronic-Milosavljevic, Lj.1 aCvetkovic, J.1 aPozio, E.1 aInterisano, M.1 aPlavsic, B.1 aRadojicic, S.1 aKulisic, Z.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2013 May 20, v. 194, no. 2-4 p.136-138dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.01.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01274naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010000167300001400267520026700281592002800548650001300576650000900589650001300598650000700611650003800618700001800656700002100674700001500695700001500710773013200725856008200857852000900939655001200948IND60590905320221118040048.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059090532DNAL7 a10.1134/S00036838180100392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEprintsev, A.T.10aIsolation and Properties of Succinate Dehydrogenase Isozymes from Maize Scutellum (Zea mays L.)  ap. 34-37.  aFour electrophoretically homogeneous succinate dehydrogenase isoenzymes with specific activities of 0.041, 0.110, 0.030 and 0.037 U/mg protein were isolated and purified from maize scutellum (Zea mays L.).

They have a negative-sense, single-stranded unsegmented or bisegmented RNA genome. The number of plant-associated rhabdovirid sequences has grown in the last few years in concert with the extensive use of high-throughput sequencing platforms. Here, we report the discovery of 27 novel rhabdovirus genomes associated with 25 different host plant species and one insect, which were hidden in public databases. These viral sequences were identified through homology searches in more than 3000 plant and insect transcriptomes from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) using known plant rhabdovirus sequences as the query. The identification, assembly and curation of raw SRA reads resulted in sixteen viral genome sequences with full-length coding regions and ten partial genomes. Highlights of the obtained sequences include viruses with unique and novel genome organizations among known plant rhabdoviruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that thirteen of the novel viruses were related to cytorhabdoviruses, one to alphanucleorhabdoviruses, five to betanucleorhabdoviruses, one to dichorhaviruses and seven to varicosaviruses. These findings resulted in the most complete phylogeny of plant rhabdoviruses to date and shed new light on the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary landscape of this group of plant viruses. Furthermore, this study provided additional evidence for the complexity and diversity of plant rhabdovirus genomes and demonstrated that analyzing SRA public data provides an invaluable tool to accelerate virus discovery, gain evolutionary insights and refine virus taxonomy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Center for Biotechnology Information 3aRNA 3aRhabdoviridae 3ahost plants 3ainsects 3alandscapes 3aphylogeny 3ataxonomy 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aviral genome 3aviruses1 aDietzgen, Ralf G.1 aDebat, Humberto 0 tViruses.g2021 July 05, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130713043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009500176300001800271520134800289592002801637650002501665650001201690650001901702650003001721650002301751650002701774650002301801650002301824650001301847650002101860650002601881650002101907650001501928650002901943650001001972650001901982650002002001653001202021653002102033653001902054700001702073700002002090773014102110856008502251852000902336655001202345IND60627846820221120224513.0190128e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062784682DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2017.13758982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŚāha, Priyaṅkā,10aPhytoremediation of cyanide containing steel industrial wastewater by Eichhornia crassipes  ap. 1205-1214.  aWater pollution has become one of the serious problems of today's civilization. Free cyanide and complex cyanide, including HCN and CN⁻ is the most reactive and toxic substance of all industrial pollutants. R&D, Tata Steel preliminary investigation reports have established that cyanide in the blast furnace (BF) blows down water above permissible limit. Presently, chemical treatment has been applied to attenuate the cyanide level 0.2 ppm (permissible limit of free cyanide as per environmental norms). From the economic point of view, phytoremediation could be an attractive technology in dealing with this dangerous pollutant. Cyanide BF blow down water could possibly be removed by the water hyacinth because of its high biomass production, and tolerance to cyanide (CN). This investigation is related to the study of the potential of water hyacinth on the cyanide ion pollutant removal from BF water using cost-effective biological technology—Phytoremediation. The experimental results have shown that about 95% removal of cyanide from blast furnace water could be achieved by water hyacinth in 3 days in 6 L and also in 100 L water. Water hyacinth is also effective for reducing biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). This aquatic plant is also capable of reducing ammonia, TDS, and hardness of water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aammonia 3aaquatic plants 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiomass production 3achemical oxygen demand 3achemical treatment 3acost effectiveness 3afurnaces 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aindustrial wastewater 3aphytoremediation 3apollutants 3aresearch and development 3asteel 3awater hardness 3awater pollution 0aCyanide 0aPhytoremediation 0aWater hyacinth1 aMondal, Amit1 aSarkar, Supriya0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 20, no. 12 p.1205-1214dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2017.13758983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245016500176300001600341520182400357592002802181650002602209650002202235650001502257650001402272650001202286650002602298650002102324650001002345650001602355650001602371650002602387650002202413650001602435650001302451700001802464773011402482856005502596852000902651655001202660IND4510096520221122051942.0150730e200002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451009652DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01053.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiefenbach, JÃ¶rg13aThemembraneâbound DnaJ protein located at the cytosolic site of glyoxysomes specifically binds the cytosolic isoform 1 of Hsp70 but not other Hsp70 species  ap. 746-754.  aDnaJ proteins are located in various compartments of the eukaryotic cell. As previously shown, peroxisomes and glyoxysomes possess a membraneâanchored form of DnaJ protein located on the cytosolic face. Hints as to how the membraneâbound coâchaperone interacts with cytosolic soluble chaperones were obtained by examining the affinity between the DnaJ protein and various potential partners of the Hsp70 family. Two genes encoding cytosolic Hsp70 isoforms were isolated and characterized from cucumber cotyledons. In addition, cDNAs encoding Hsp70 forms attributed to the cytosol, plastids and the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum were prepared. Hisâtagged DnaJ proteins and glutathione SâtransferaseâHsp70 fusion proteins were constructed. Using these tools, it was demonstrated that the soluble Hisâtagged form of DnaJ protein exclusively binds the cytosolic isoform 1 of Hsp70. This interaction was further analyzed by characterizing the interaction between the glyoxysomeâbound form of the DnaJ protein and various isoforms of Hsp70. Specific binding to the glyoxysomal surface was only observed in the case of cytosolic isoform 1 of Hsp70. This interaction was strictly dependent on the presence of ADP. Glyoxysomes did not bind other cytosolic or plastidic isoforms or the BiPârelated form of Hsp70. Analyzing the enzymatic properties of cytosolic Hsp70s, we showed that the ATPaseâmodulating activity of DnaJ was highest when isoform 1 was assayed. Collectively, the data indicate that the partner of the DnaJ protein anchored at the glyoxysomal membrane is the cytosolic isoform 1 of Hsp70. In addition to the chaperones located at the surface of glyoxysomes, two isoforms of Hsp70 and one soluble form of DnaJ protein were detected in the glyoxysomal matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine diphosphate 3acomplementary DNA 3acotyledons 3acucumbers 3acytosol 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3aglutathione 3aglyoxysomes 3aheat-shock protein 70 3amembrane proteins 3aperoxisomes 3aplastids1 aKindl, Helmut0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2000 Feb., v. 267, no. 3 p.746-754dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01053.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245009500178300001800273520182700291592002802118650002302146650001002169650001302179650002302192650001202215650002102227650001502248650001202263650000702275650002602282650001202308650001402320650001802334650003802352650004402390650003102434650003302465650002702498650004802525700002502573700002302598773014402621852000902765856008202774655001202856IND4393266920221120073323.0200208e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439326692DNAL7 a174015632pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-007-0920-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei10aProduction of medium-chain-length hydroxyalkanoic acids from Pseudomonas putida in pH stat  ap. 1047-1053.  aPseudomonas putida GP01 cells that had accumulated medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAMCL) secreted 3-hydroxyoctanoate and 3-hydroxyhexanoate when incubated in alkaline buffers. The release of acids strongly decreased the pH resulting in less efficient secretion of 3HAMCL at neutral pH. To increase the yield of secreted MCL-hydroxyalkanoates, experiments at constant pH in a pH stat apparatus were performed. High acid releasing rates were recorded for the wild type GP01 at pH 9.2 (0.60 mmol acid h⁻¹ g⁻¹ cellular dry weight [cdw]). At more alkaline constant pH values (pH 9.3–11), the initial acid secretion rates were even higher but rapidly decreased by time. When acid secretion of PHA depolymerase mutant GPo500 was tested (pH 9.2), considerably lower rates compared to wild type were recorded (0.18 mmol acid h⁻¹ g⁻¹ cdw). Determination of dissolved oxygen during acid release indicated different respiratoric activity in wild type (low) and mutant (high). Acid release of mutant, but not of the wild type, could be enhanced by aeration. Determination of PHA content of cells after alkaline incubation showed that the wild type had lost most of its accumulated PHA, whereas the PHA content of the depolymerase mutant was not significantly reduced. Considerable amounts of 3HAMCL were secreted by the wild type, but only little 3HAMCL were found for the depolymerase mutant. In summary, 3HAMCL can be more efficiently produced at constant high pH than by incubation without pH control. High PHA depolymerase activity enabled the wild type to compensate for the high external pH by secretion of PHA hydrolysis products, whereas production of protons at aerobic conditions presumably was responsible for the major portion of the observed acid releasing rates in the depolymerase mutant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas putida 3aacids 3aaeration 3aaerobic conditions 3abuffers 3adissolved oxygen 3ahydrolysis 3amutants 3apH 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3aprotons 3asecretion 2aAcetophenones 2aCaprylatesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCarboxylic Ester Hydrolasesxphysiology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aHydroxybutyratesxmetabolism 2aPolyestersxmetabolism 2aPseudomonas putidaxenzymologyxmetabolism.1 aArmbruster, Wolfgang1 aJendrossek, Dieter0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2007 July, v. 75, no. 5 p.1047-1053dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-007-0920-13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02678naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012800161520127300289592002801562650002101590650001501611650001401626650002301640650002001663650003101683650003401714650001201748650001901760650001301779650001301792650001801805650003201823700002101855700001901876700002501895700002501920700003201945700002101977700003101998773012102029856007302150852000902223655001202232IND60745616820221119003440.0210723e20210705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074561682DNAL7 a10.3390/v130713032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCatto, Michael A.10aDefense-Related Gene Expression Following an Orthotospovirus Infection Is Influenced by Host Resistance in Arachis hypogaea  aPlanting resistant cultivars is the most effective tactic to manage the thrips-transmitted tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus (TSWV) in peanut plants. However, molecular mechanisms conferring resistance to TSWV in resistant cultivars are unknown. In this study, transcriptomes of TSWV-susceptible (SunOleic 97R) and field-resistant (Tifguard) peanut cultivars with and without TSWV infection were assembled and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were compared. There were 4605 and 2579 significant DEGs in SunOleic 97R and Tifguard, respectively. Despite the lower number of DEGs in Tifguard, an increased proportion of defense-related genes were upregulated in Tifguard than in the susceptible cultivar. Examples included disease resistance (R) proteins, leucine-rich repeats, stilbene synthase, dicer, and calmodulin. Pathway analysis revealed the increased downregulation of genes associated with defense and photosynthesis in the susceptible cultivar rather than in the resistant cultivar. These results suggest that essential physiological functions were less perturbed in the resistant cultivar than in the susceptible cultivar and that the defense response following TSWV infection was more robust in the resistant cultivar than in the susceptible cultivar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3acalmodulin 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3apeanuts 3aphotosynthesis 3aplanting 3atomatoes 3atranscriptome 3atrihydroxystilbene synthase1 aShrestha, Anita 1 aAbney, Mark R.1 aChampagne, Donald E.1 aCulbreath, Albert K.1 aLeal-Bertioli, Soraya C.

In this review, I provide a brief background to the topic, then highlight several methods for “relaxing” the assumptions of a strict molecular clock. I discuss the pros and cons of many of these methods. Finally, I discuss the various techniques for incorporating fossils in molecular studies to estimate absolute ages of clades.  aPublisher supplied data 3afossils 3amethodology 3aplant taxonomy 0aClade age estimation 0adivergence time analysis 0adiversification rates 0afossil calibration 0amolecular dating 0arate heterogeneity0 tSystematic botany.g2015 Feb., v. 40, no. 1 p.6-13dAmerican Society of Plant Toxonomistsx0363-64457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1600%2F036364415X6862973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01837naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245008000133300001600213520094100229592002801170653000901198653002201207653001101229653001801240653001601258700002301274700002101297700002101318700001701339700001801356700002701374773010101401852000901502655001201511IND60125301520221118145137.0151103e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012530152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorsuk, Robyn M.10aTo Name or Not to Name: The Effect of Changing Author Gender on Peer Review  ap. 985-989.  aThe peer review model is one of the most important tools used in science to assess the relative merit of research. We manipulated a published article to reflect one of the following four author designations: female, male, initial, and no name provided. This article was then reviewed by referees of both genders at various stages of scientific training. Name changing did not influence acceptance rates or quality ratings. Undergraduate referees were less critical than graduate students or postdoctoral researchers, independent of gender. However, female postdoctoral researchers were the most critical referees: Their rejection rates were the highest and quality ratings the lowest, regardless of the author name provided. Contrary to previous reports in the literature, there was no evidence of same-gender preferences. This study strongly suggests that female postgraduate biologists may apply different expectations to peer review.  aPublisher supplied data 0abias 0agraduate students 0agender 0aname changing 0apeer review1 aAarssen, Lonnie W.1 aBudden, Amber E.1 aKoricheva, Julia1 aLeimu, Roosa1 aTregenza, Tom1 aLortie, Christopher J.0 tBioScience.g2009 Dec., v. 59, no. 11 p.985-989dUniversity of California Pressx0006-35687nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009600167300001400263520121900277592002801496650001401524650001201538650002101550650001201571650001101583650001601594650001301610650000901623650001701632650001901649651001301668653002401681653001501705653002001720700001601740773007601756856008301832852000901915655001201924IND60096905320221118034707.0160903e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009690532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.08.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillada, Juan12aA simulation approach for analysis of short-term security of natural gas supply in Colombia  ap. 11-26.  aAchieving security of gas supply implies diversifying gas sources, while having enough supply, transportation, and storage capacity to meet demand peaks and supply interruptions. Devising a strategy for securing gas supply is not straightforward because gas supply depends on complex interactions of production, demand and infrastructure, and it is exposed to economic, regulatory, political, environmental and technical risks. To address this complexity, we propose a simulation approach that replicates the structure of the gas supply chain, including transportation constraints and demand fluctuations. We build and calibrate a computer model for the Colombian gas sector, and run the model to assess the impact of expanding transportation capacity and increasing market flexibility on the security of supply. Our analysis focuses on the operation and planned and proposed expansions of the transportation infrastructure because adequate regulation and development of this infrastructure can contribute to increase the security of supply in the gas sector. We find that proposed import facilities, specifically LNG import terminals at Buenaventura, increase system's security under the current market structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3aimports 3amarket structure 3amarkets 3amodels 3anatural gas 3apolitics 3arisk 3asupply chain 3atransportation 3aColombia 0aNatural gas markets 0aSimulation 0aSupply security1 aOlaya, Yris0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 Feb., v. 53 p.11-26dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.08.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011300156520125800269592002801527650001601555650000901571650001801580650001101598650001501609650001401624700001901638700001801657700002001675700001801695700001601713700001701729700001601746700001801762700001801780700001501798773012201813856007501935852000902010655001202019IND60769788220221121070426.0220310e20220305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076978822DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140510912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCong, Ruyi 10aAssessing the Causal Effects of Adipokines on Uric Acid and Gout: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study  aPrevious observational studies have highlighted associations between adipokines and hyperuricemia, as well as gout, but the causality and direction of these associations are not clear. Therefore, we attempted to assess whether there are causal effects of specific adipokines (such as adiponectin (ADP) and soluble leptin receptors (sOB-R)) on uric acid (UA) or gout in a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, based on summary statistics from large genome-wide association studies. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was performed as the primary analysis. Sensitivity analyses (including MR-Egger regression, weighted median, penalized weighted median, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier methods) were also performed, to ensure reliable results. In the IVW models, no causal effect was found for sOB-R (odds ratios (OR), 1.002; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.999–1.004; p = 0.274) on UA, or ADP (OR, 1.198; 95% CI, 0.865–1.659; p = 0.277) or sOB-R (OR, 0.988; 95% CI, 0.940–1.037; p = 0.616) on gout. The results were confirmed in sensitivity analyses. There was no notable directional pleiotropy or heterogeneity. This study suggests that these specific adipokines may not play causal roles in UA or gout development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiponectin 3agout 3ahyperuricemia 3aleptin 3apleiotropy 3auric acid1 aZhang, Xiaoyu 1 aSong, Zihong 1 aChen, Shanshan 1 aLiu, Guanhua 1 aLiu, Yizhi 1 aPang, Xiuyu 1 aDong, Fang 1 aXing, Weijia 1 aWang, Youxin 1 aXu, Xizhu 0 tNutrients.g2022 Mar. 05, v. 14, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140510913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01940naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245006300211300001600274506007600290520075600366592002801122506003701150650001501187650001501202650002001217650001201237650002201249650001901271650002001290650001401310700002101324773013301345856007901478852000901557655001201566IND60302178620221207050155.0150704e20140228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030217862DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12391762doi7 aPMC45475272pmcid7 a245785782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchultz, Danielle M.10aSolar Synthesis: Prospects in Visible Light Photocatalysis  ap. 1239176.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSynthesis in the Spotlight Most organic molecules absorb little or no visible light. Consequently, conventional organic photochemistry has relied on excitation in the ultraviolet regime, with the drawback that the high energy involved can lead to undesirable by-products. Over the past several years, an alternative strategy has emerged involving the visible excitation of metal complexes (primarily ruthenium and iridium) that can then engage in electron or energy transfer with organic compounds. The ensuing reactivity patterns complement thermally accessible outcomes without introducing detrimental quantities of excess energy.

Both BA15ΔcydCΔcydD and BA15ΔcydCΔpurD double-mutants exhibited significant attenuation of virulence when assayed in murine macrophages or in BALB/c mice. Both double-mutants were readily cleared from spleens by 4 weeks post-inoculation even when inoculated at the dose of 108 CFU per mouse. Moreover, the inoculated mice showed no splenomegaly, which indicates that the mutants are highly attenuated. Importantly, the attenuation of in vitro and in vivo growth did not impair the ability of these mutants to confer long-term protective immunity in mice against challenge with B. abortus strain 2308. Vaccination of mice with either mutant induced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, and provided significantly better protection than commercial B. abortus strain RB51 vaccine. These results suggest that highly attenuated BA15ΔcydCΔcydD and BA15ΔcydCΔpurD mutants can be used effectively as potential live vaccine candidates against bovine brucellosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3abovine brucellosis 3acell-mediated immunity 3agenes 3alive vaccines 3amacrophages 3amice 3amutants 3aspleen 3asplenomegaly 3avaccination 3avirulence 0aBrucella abortus 0aLive attenuated vaccine 0aAttenuation 0aImmune response 0aProtection1 aCho, Youngjae1 aPark, Soyeon1 aKim, Kiju1 aHahn, Tae-Wook0 tVaccine.g2016 Jan. 04, v. 34, no. 2 p.237-244dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.11.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01302naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010700160300001800267520023400285592002800519650001400547650002300561650002700584650002300611650002000634650001300654700002100667700002300688700001700711700001900728773013400747856007400881852000900955655001200964IND60659618420221122224510.0190823e20120723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065961842DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc33992g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoliner, Manuel10aCu–SSZ-39, an active and hydrothermally stable catalyst for the selective catalytic reduction of NOx  ap. 8264-8266.  aA Cu-exchanged SSZ-39 zeolite has been synthesized and tested for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx.

A total of 80 pigs were randomly divided into 8 groups (10 pigs per group). The pigs were administered the bivalent vaccine intramuscularly as a 2.0mL dose at 21 days of age based on the manufacturer's instructions. Three weeks after vaccination, the pigs were inoculated with either PCV2 (intranasal route) or M. hyopneumoniae (intratracheal route) or both. Regardless of the type of inoculation, vaccinated pigs after challenge exhibited effective reduction of clinical signs, PCV2 viremia levels and mycoplasma nasal shedding, and lung and lymphoid lesion when compared to unvaccinated challenged pigs. Vaccinated challenged pigs had significantly higher (P<0.05) levels of PCV2-specific neutralizing antibodies, and numbers of PCV2-and M. hyopneumoniae-specific interferon-γ secreting cells compared to unvaccinated challenged pigs. This study demonstrates that the bivalent vaccine is able to protect pigs against either PCV2 or M. hyopneumoniae infection or both based on clinical, microbiological, immunological, and pathological evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae 3aPorcine circovirus-2 3ainterferon-gamma 3aneutralizing antibodies 3anose 3aswine 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviremia 0aBivalent vaccine 0aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae 0aPorcine circovirus-associated disease 0aPorcine circovirus type 2 0aPorcine respiratory disease complex1 aJeong, Jiwoon1 aChoi, Kyuhyung1 aChae, Chanhee0 tVaccine.g2016 Jan. 04, v. 34, no. 2 p.270-275dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.11.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006500139245005200204300001800256500001900274500001100293520128700304592002801591596001401619596001401633596001601647596002101663650001601684650002901700650001401729650002501743650001801768650001701786650001101803650001501814650003001829650002001859650001501879650002101894700002901915700002701944700002101971773015001992856007302142852000902215655001202224IND60712169320221123033333.0201009e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071216932DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.89552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBello‐Perez, Luis A1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7286-237X10aStarch digestibility: past, present, and future  ap. 5009-5016.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aIn the last century, starch present in foods was considered to be completely digested. However, during the 1980s, studies on starch digestion started to show that besides digestible starch, which could be rapidly or slowly hydrolysed, there was a variable fraction that resisted hydrolysis by digestive enzymes. That fraction was named resistant starch (RS) and it encompasses those forms of starch that are not accessible to human digestive enzymes but can be fermented by the colonic microbiota, producing short‐chain fatty acids. RS has been classified into five types, depending on the mechanism governing its resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis. Early research on RS was focused on the methods to determine its content in foods and its physiological effects, including fermentability in the large intestine. Later on, due to the interest of the food industry, methods to increase the RS content of isolated starches were developed. Nowadays, the influence of RS on the gut microbiota is a relevant research topic owing to its potential health‐related benefits. This review summarizes over 30 years of investigation on starch digestibility, its relationship with human health, the methods to produce RS and its impact on the microbiome. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  cSIP‐IPN  cEDI‐IPN  cCOFAA‐IPN  cCONACYT‐Mexico 3aagriculture 3adigestible carbohydrates 3adigestion 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afood industry 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alarge intestine 3amicrobiome 3aresistant starch1 aFlores‐Silva, Pamela C1 aAgama‐Acevedo, Edith1 aTovar, Juscelino0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2020 Nov., v. 100, no. 14 p.5009-5016dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.89553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001600170245017800186300001600364520117800380592002801558650001601586650002901602650001101631650001501642650001501657650001801672650001801690650002901708650003701737650001301774650002101787650003901808650002801847650005301875651001101928700002501939700001901964700002001983700002002003700001802023773010102041856008702142852000902229655001202238IND4466538120221120064921.0141112e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446653812DNAL7 a225211692pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSur, Babita10aPhotochemical transformation of anionic 2-nitro-4-chlorophenol in surface waters: Laboratory and model assessment of the degradation kinetics, and comparison with field data  ap. 296-303.  aAnionic 2-nitro-4-chlorophenol (NCP) may occur in surface waters as a nitroderivative of 4-chlorophenol, which is a transformation intermediate of the herbicide dichlorprop. Here we show that NCP would undergo efficient photochemical transformation in environmental waters, mainly by direct photolysis and reaction with OH. NCP has a polychromatic photolysis quantum yield ΦNCP=(1.27±0.22)·10⁻⁵, a rate constant with OH kNCP, OH=(1.09±0.09)·10¹⁰M⁻¹s⁻¹, a rate constant with ¹O₂kNCP,₁O₂=(2.15±0.38)·10⁷M⁻¹s⁻¹, a rate constant with the triplet state of anthraquinone-2-sulphonate kNCP,₃AQ₂S*=(5.90±0.43)·10⁸M⁻¹s⁻¹, and is poorly reactive toward CO₃ ⁻. The kNCP,₃AQ₂S* value is representative of reaction with the triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter. The inclusion of photochemical reactivity data into a model of surface–water photochemistry allowed the NCP transformation kinetics to be predicted as a function of water chemical composition and column depth. Very good agreement between model predictions and field data was obtained for the shallow lagoons of the Rhône delta (Southern France).  aPublisher supplied data 3adichlorprop 3adissolved organic matter 3amodels 3aphotolysis 3aprediction 3asurface water 3awater quality 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aHerbicidesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aKinetics 2aModels, Chemical 2aNitrophenolsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aPhotochemical Processes 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 3aFrance1 aDe Laurentiis, Elisa1 aMinella, Marco1 aMaurino, Valter1 aMinero, Claudio1 aVione, Davide0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 June 1, v. 426 p.296-303dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245007700170300001500247520214100262592002802403650002202431650001402453650002002467650001802487650001502505650001402520650001902534650001902553650001402572650001702586650002202603650002202625650002502647650001202672650001302684650001602697653001602713653002202729653002402751653001402775653001202789653001902801773010202820856008302922852000903005655001203014IND60606544820221119233740.0180726e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060654482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2015.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuscombe, Daniel10aSpatially explicit spectral analysis of point clouds and geospatial data  ap. 92-108.  aThe increasing use of spatially explicit analyses of high-resolution spatially distributed data (imagery and point clouds) for the purposes of characterising spatial heterogeneity in geophysical phenomena necessitates the development of custom analytical and computational tools. In recent years, such analyses have become the basis of, for example, automated texture characterisation and segmentation, roughness and grain size calculation, and feature detection and classification, from a variety of data types. In this work, much use has been made of statistical descriptors of localised spatial variations in amplitude variance (roughness), however the horizontal scale (wavelength) and spacing of roughness elements is rarely considered. This is despite the fact that the ratio of characteristic vertical to horizontal scales is not constant and can yield important information about physical scaling relationships. Spectral analysis is a hitherto under-utilised but powerful means to acquire statistical information about relevant amplitude and wavelength scales, simultaneously and with computational efficiency. Further, quantifying spatially distributed data in the frequency domain lends itself to the development of stochastic models for probing the underlying mechanisms which govern the spatial distribution of geological and geophysical phenomena. The software package PySESA (Python program for Spatially Explicit Spectral Analysis) has been developed for generic analyses of spatially distributed data in both the spatial and frequency domains. Developed predominantly in Python, it accesses libraries written in Cython and C++ for efficiency. It is open source and modular, therefore readily incorporated into, and combined with, other data analysis tools and frameworks with particular utility for supporting research in the fields of geomorphology, geophysics, hydrography, photogrammetry and remote sensing. The analytical and computational structure of the toolbox is described, and its functionality illustrated with an example of a high-resolution bathymetric point cloud data collected with multibeam echosounder.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3adata collection 3ageomorphology 3ageophysics 3ahydrology 3aphotogrammetry 3aremote sensing 3aroughness 3aspatial data 3aspatial variation 3aspectral analysis 3astochastic processes 3atexture 3avariance 3awavelengths 0aPoint cloud 0aSpectral analysis 0aGeospatial analysis 0aRoughness 0aTexture 0aRemote sensing0 tComputers & geosciences.g2016 Jan., v. 86 p.92-108dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2015.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011700164300001800281520178900299592002802088650001602116650001502132650001902147650002502166650001802191650001402209650001102223650000902234650001102243650001002254650001502264650001702279650001702296650001502313650003302328650001902361650001002380650002202390650002502412650000902437700002302446700002102469700002002490700001902510700002402529773011602553856008102669852000902750655001202759IND60114279720221117063030.0141120e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011427972DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-014-6153-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Vilas10aCharacterization of the rumen microbiome of Indian Kankrej cattle (Bos indicus) adapted to different forage diet  ap. 9749-9761.  aPresent study described rumen microbiome of Indian cattle (Kankrej breed) to better understand the microbial diversity and largely unknown functional capacity of the rumen microbiome under different dietary treatments. Kankrej cattle were gradually adapted to a high-forage diet (four animals with dry forage and four with green forage) containing 50 % (K1), 75 % (K2) to 100 % (K3) forage, and remaining concentrate diet, each for 6 weeks followed by analysis of rumen fiber adherent and fiber-free metagenomic community by shotgun sequencing using ion torrent PGM platform and EBI-metagenomics annotation pipeline. Taxonomic analysis indicated that rumen microbiome was dominated by Bacteroidetes followed by Firmicutes, Fibrobacter, Proteobacteria, and Tenericutes. Functional analysis based on gene ontology classified all reads in total 157 categories based on their functional role in biological, molecular, and cellular component with abundance of genes associated with hydrolase activity, membrane, transport, transferase, and different metabolism (such as carbohydrate and protein). Statistical analysis using STAMP revealed significant differences (P < 0.05) between solid and liquid fraction of rumen (in 65 categories), between all three treatments (in 56 categories), and between green and dry roughage (17 categories). Diet treatment also exerted significant difference in environmental gene tags (EGTs) involved in metabolic pathways for production of volatile fatty acids. EGTs for butyrate production were abundant in K2, whereas EGTs for propionate production was abundant during K1. Principal component analysis also demonstrated that diet proportion, fraction of rumen, and type of forage affected rumen microbiome at taxonomic as well as functional level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFibrobacter 3aFirmicutes 3aProteobacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3abiotechnology 3abutyrates 3acattle 3adiet 3aforage 3agenes 3ametabolism 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiology 3amicrobiome 3aprincipal component analysis 3apropionic acid 3arumen 3asequence analysis 3avolatile fatty acids 3azebu1 aPatel, Amrutlal K.1 aParmar, Nidhi R.1 aPatel, Anand B.1 aReddy, Bhaskar1 aJoshi, Chaitanya G.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Dec., v. 98, no. 23 p.9749-9761dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-014-6153-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01323naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245015600164300001600320520017100336592002800507650002300535650002300558650002300581650001100604653002600615653002900641653004400670700002300714700002400737773015000761856007700911852000900988655001200997IND60522126520221121183327.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052212652DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1999-03182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeravi, Majid M.10aDirect Oxidative Deprotection of Trimethylsilyl and Tetrahydropyranyl Ethers Using Alumina-Supported lodobenzene Diacetate under Non-Aqueous Conditions  ap. 394-396.  aPrimary and secondary trimethylsilyl and tetrahydropyranyl ethers are converted to their carbonyl compounds efficiently using alumina-supported iodobenzene diacetate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonyl compounds 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aethers 0aTrimethylsilyl Ethers 0aTetrahydropyranyl Ethers 0aAlumina-Supported lodobenzene Diacetate1 aTajbakhsh, Mahmood1 aGhassemzadeh, Mitra0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 54, no. 3 p.394-396dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1999-03183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013000159520145700289592002801746650001401774650001401788650003301802650001501835650001201850650002701862650001701889651001501906651001001921651001301931700002801944700001901972773012701991856007402118852000902192655001202201IND60652565320221123033850.0190713e20180725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065256532DNAL7 a10.3390/su100826112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBae, Seong  Mi12aA Cross-Country Investigation of Corporate Governance and Corporate Sustainability Disclosure: A Signaling Theory Perspective  aThere is a dearth of research on corporate governance and total sustainability disclosure (economic, environmental, and social) in developing, particularly South Asian, countries. This is unique cross-country research on South Asian countries&rsquo; corporate governance elements and total sustainability disclosure practices. The study considers a set of insightful theories, namely, the signaling and agency theories of understanding the motives and drivers of sustainability reporting. Based on data from the Global Reporting Initiative database, the study analyzes Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. We have collected annual report and sustainability reports from the GRI database for the period between 2009 and 2016. Based on the signaling and agency theories, the study investigates how board and shareholding structures convey signals to the market and different stakeholders. Our empirical results find that total sustainability disclosure has a positive and significant relationship with foreign shareholding, institutional shareholding, board independence, and board size. On the other hand, we document that director shareholding is negatively but significantly associated with total sustainability disclosure. Therefore, we conclude that corporate governance elements have very strong influential power to send positive signals to the market that lead to reduced information asymmetry and ensuring honest signals from different stakeholders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3adatabases 3aenvironmental sustainability 3agovernance 3amarkets 3areports (publications) 3astakeholders 3aBangladesh 3aIndia 3aPakistan1 aMasud, Md.

Financialization of forestland ownership in the United States has diversified how companies profit from the land, whether through carbon sequestration, conservation easements, wind tower leases, or mechanized logging. These new sources of profit, though, create fewer jobs than the traditional woods products industries. Based on more than a year of ethnographic research in a forested region of northern New England, I describe an anti-establishment politics spurred by opposition to one of these development projects, an electrical transmission corridor proposed by an international energy company. I argue that the resistance to this project is a response to ‘behind closed doors’ negotiations and the accumulation of power in the hands of a small number of energy companies, timberland owners, politicians, government agencies and environmental NGOs. Scholarship on the resistance to neoliberalism's effects on the rural United States should thus not be limited to a left/right populism framework.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropology 3acapital 3acarbon sequestration 3aeconomic policy 3aenergy 3aenergy industry 3aforest land 3amechanization 3aownership 3apolitics 3awind 3aNew England region 0aRural politics 0aEnergy 0aForestland 0aEnvironmental governance 0aRural United States0 tJournal of rural studies.g2021 Feb., v. 82 p.294-302dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2021.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03395naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007300169300001600242520213400258592002802392650001602420650001402436650001502450650002202465650001402487650000902501650002102510650001702531650002002548650002202568650001002590650002502600650001602625650001502641650001502656653001702671653002002688653002102708653002002729773010902749856008202858852000902940655001202949IND60621454620221122151558.0181117e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062145462DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826504025004112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPennington, Jean10aGeneral Approaches to Estimation of Dietary Exposure to Contaminants  ap. 420-427.  aThe initial steps in estimating dietary exposure to contaminants include gathering the necessary expertise, clarifying the intent and purpose of the work, selecting a dietary exposure model, and gathering available pertinent information. Expertise is generally needed in chemistry, agriculture, toxicology, statistics, nutritional epidemiology, and computer software development. The goal might be to determine the average exposure of a population to contaminants, to identify demographic groups within a population that are especially vulnerable to a contaminant, to evaluate the regulation of agricultural and food-manufacturing practices, or to determine compliance with standards for local and/or imported foods. Examples of dietary exposure models include the core food model, directed core food model, large database model, raw agricultural commodity (RAC) model, regional diet model, duplicate diet model, and total diet composite model. Each model has advantages and disadvantages and different costs and resource requirements. Consideration of the sources and flow of selected contaminants though the food supply may help identify the best exposure model to use. Pertinent information that may already be available includes analytical data on contaminants in foods or commodities, government regulations pertaining to the levels of contaminants in foods, food-consumption data, data on the average body weights of age-gender groups (to express exposure on a body weight basis), and biochemical measures of contaminants or their residues/metabolites. Collecting available information helps to clearly define what critical information is missing so that the planned research can be most effective. Careful documentation of decisions and assumptions allows for recalculating exposure estimates with the same model using different decisions and assumptions; documentation also allows others to understand what was done and how to use the resulting intake estimates properly. Clearly identifying the limitations of the exposure model may provide justification for additional resources to further refine and improve the model.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3achemistry 3acompliance 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3adiet 3adietary exposure 3aepidemiology 3aexposure models 3afood availability 3afoods 3alaws and regulations 3ametabolites 3astatistics 3atoxicology 0acontaminants 0acore food model 0adietary exposure 0aexposure models0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 25, no. 4 p.420-427dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826504025004113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245007500162300001800237520163600255592002801891650002201919650001201941650001901953650002101972650001501993650001302008650001302021650001502034650001202049650001802061700006202079700005302141700005902194773014702253856007602400852000902476655001202485IND60603309820221122134630.0180713e20180223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060330982DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b134572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerman, Sean R.10aCritical Nuclei Size, Rate, and Activation Energy of H2 Gas Nucleation  ap. 4047-4053.  aElectrochemical measurements of the nucleation rate of individual H₂ bubbles at the surface of Pt nanoelectrodes (radius = 7–41 nm) are used to determine the critical size and geometry of H₂ nuclei leading to stable bubbles. Precise knowledge of the H₂ concentration at the electrode surface, CH₂ˢᵘʳᶠ, is obtained by controlled current reduction of H⁺ in a H₂SO₄ solution. Induction times of single-bubble nucleation events are measured by stepping the current, to control CH₂ˢᵘʳᶠ, while monitoring the voltage. We find that gas nucleation follows a first-order rate process; a bubble spontaneously nucleates after a stochastic time delay, as indicated by a sudden voltage spike that results from impeded transport of H⁺ to the electrode. Hundreds of individual induction times, at different applied currents and using different Pt nanoelectrodes, are used to characterize the kinetics of phase nucleation. The rate of bubble nucleation increases by four orders of magnitude (0.3–2000 s–¹) over a very small relative change in CH₂ˢᵘʳᶠ (0.21–0.26 M, corresponding to a ∼0.025 V increase in driving force). Classical nucleation theory yields thermodynamic radii of curvature for critical nuclei of 4.4 to 5.3 nm, corresponding to internal pressures of 330 to 270 atm, and activation energies for nuclei formation of 14 to 26 kT, respectively. The dependence of nucleation rate on H₂ concentration indicates that nucleation occurs by a heterogeneous mechanism, where the nuclei have a contact angle of ∼150° with the electrode surface and contain between 35 and 55 H₂ molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3abubbles 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ageometry 3ahydrogen 3amonitoring 3aprotons 3asulfuric acid1 aEdwards, Martin A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8072-361X1 aRen, Hang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9480-88811 aWhite, Henry S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5053-09960 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Feb. 23, v. 140, no. 11 p.4047-4053dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b134573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005900137245007600196300001800272500001100290520124600301592002801547596005301575596003801628650001301666650001801679650002301697650003101720650002101751700005701772700006201829700006201891700007201953700005802025700006202083773012702145856007102272852000902343655001202352IND60747117720221121091451.0210811e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074711772DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.63702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYassin, Mustafa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1010-653014aThe rise, fall and resurrection of chemical‐induced resistance agents  ap. 3900-3909.  aREVIEW  aSince the discovery that the plant immune system could be augmented for improved deployment against biotic stressors through the exogenous application of chemicals that lead to induced resistance (IR), many such IR‐eliciting agents have been identified. Initially it was hoped that these chemical IR agents would be a benign alternative to traditional chemical biocides. However, owing to low efficacy and/or a realization that their benefits sometimes come at the cost of growth and yield penalties, chemical IR agents fell out of favour and were seldom used as crop protection products. Despite the lack of interest in agricultural use, researchers have continued to explore the efficacy and mechanisms of chemical IR. Moreover, as we move away from the approach of ‘zero tolerance’ toward plant pests and pathogens toward integrated pest management, chemical IR agents could have a place in the plant protection product list. In this review, we chart the rise and fall of chemical IR agents, and then explore a variety of strategies used to improve their efficacy and remediate their negative adverse effects. © 2021 The Authors.

Under iron sufficient conditions, the expressions of iron uptake- and transport-related genes, i.e. FIT1, IRT1, CS1, FRD3 and NRMAP1, and the immanent leaf and root active iron contents were higher in M. xiaojinensis than those in M. baccata. However, on the first three days of low iron stress, the rhizospheric pH decreased and the root ferric chelate reductase (FCR) activity and the expression of ferrous uptake- and iron transport-related genes in the roots increased significantly only in M. xiaojinensis. Leaf chlorosis occurred on the 3rd and the 9th day after low-iron treatment in M. baccata and M. xiaojinensis, respectively. The expression of iron relocalization-related genes, such as NAS1, FRD3 and NRMAP3, increased after the 5th or 6th day of low iron stress in leaves of M. xiaojinensis, whereas the expression of NAS1, FRD3 and NRMAP3 in the leaves of M. baccata increased immediately after the onset of low iron treatment. Conclusively, the relative high active iron contents caused by the immanently active root ferrous uptake and the increased root ferrous uptake in response to low iron stress were the dominant mechanisms for the tolerance to iron deficiency in M. xiaojinensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus baccata 3achlorosis 3agene expression 3agenes 3airon 3aleaves 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient uptake 3apH 3aroots 3astress tolerance 0aBLAST 0aCTAB 0aDRPD 0aDW 0aFW 0aFCR 0aHPLC 0aIBA 0aIRT 0aMS 0aNA 0aNCBI 0aNRAMP 0aMalus xiaojinensis 0aMalus baccata 0aLow iron stress 0aRoot ferrous uptake 0aIron relocalization1 aWang, Yi1 aZhang, Xin-Zhong1 aHan, Zhen-Hai0 tPlant science.g2014 Jan., v. 214 p.47-56dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2013.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245007400166300001400240520119400254592002801448650001701476650001401493650000901507650001301516650001901529650001101548650001601559650002901575651001001604653002401614653003401638653002801672653002901700700001801729773010101747856008301848852000901931655001201940IND60606545020221119233843.0180726e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060654502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2015.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Yihui10aRecognition of geochemical anomalies using a deep autoencoder network  ap. 75-82.  aIn this paper, we train an autoencoder network to encode and reconstruct a geochemical sample population with unknown complex multivariate probability distributions. During the training, small probability samples contribute little to the autoencoder network. These samples can be recognized by the trained model as anomalous samples due to their comparatively higher reconstructed errors. The southwestern Fujian district (China) is chosen as a case study area. A variety of learning rates, iterations, and the size of each hidden layer are constructing and training the deep autoencoder networks on all the geochemical samples. The reconstruction error (or, anomaly score) of each training sample is used to recognize multivariate geochemical anomalies associated with Fe polymetallic mineralization. By comparing the results obtained with a continuous restricted Boltzmann machine, we conclude that the autoencoder network can be trained to recognize multivariate geochemical anomalies. Most of the known skarn-type Fe deposits are located in areas with high reconstruction errors or anomaly scores in the anomaly map, indicating that these anomalies may be related to Fe mineralization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputers 3airon 3alearning 3amineralization 3amodels 3aprobability 3aprobability distribution 3aChina 0aAutoencoder network 0aMultivariate geochemical data 0aGeochemical exploration 0aSkarn-type iron deposits1 aZuo, Renguang0 tComputers & geosciences.g2016 Jan., v. 86 p.75-82dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2015.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01273naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013900157300002000296520028800316592002800604650001600632650002100648650001400669650001300683650001300696700001800709700001200727700001300739773012400752856007400876852000900950655001200959IND60665743220221118045333.0190912e20140827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066574322DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra05100a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, Shuchen10aSynthesis of β-enaminodicarbonyl derivatives in the titanium(iv) chloride-promoted reactions of β-dicarbonyl compounds with nitriles  ap. 38055-38058.  aTitanium(iv) chloride selectively promoted the nucleophilic attack of ethyl acetoacetate with nitriles to give enaminoketoesters, which were valuable intermediates for the syntheses of 2,3,4-substituted heterocyclics.

We examined how inter- and intra-specific interactions between Abies alba Mill. and Picea abies (L.) Karst. varied with climate, site quality and stand density in the Black Forest of south-western Germany, using spatially explicit neighbourhood indices. The mixing response, a measure of complementarity, was quantified as the increase in growth of individual trees in a mixed-species neighbourhood compared to a mono-specific neighbourhood. Both species benefited from growing in mixed-species neighbourhoods, but this complementarity effect (−60% to >200%) depended on climatic conditions, site quality and stand density. Complementarity increased for A. alba with increasing mean maximum temperatures in August, those for P. abies increased with mean minimum temperatures in May and site quality, and in each case the magnitude of the effect was amplified with increasing stand density. Complementarity is often considered to become more important in less productive ecosystems, but this study showed that for the given pair of species, complementarity effects can increase as growing conditions improve. A simple model is proposed that describes how relationships between productivity and complementarity change depending on the resources limiting productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3atree growth 3asoil quality 3amodels 3aAbies alba 3aPicea abies 3astand density 3aecosystems 3atemperature 3aclimate 3aforests 3aGermany 0aCompetitive reduction 0aneighborhoods 0aPlant–plant interactions 0aIndividual tree model 0aCompetition index1 aKohnle, Ulrich1 aAlbrecht, Axel T.1 aBauhus, Jürgen,0 tForest ecology and management.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 304 p.233-242dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.04.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245014900160300001800309520140800327592002801735650001801763650001301781650002101794650001901815650002301834650002101857650002201878650002701900650001601927650001101943650001901954650001201973650001001985651001001995653001802005653002602023653002802049653002802077653001702105700001902122700001302141700001802154773012702172856007602299852000902375655001202384IND60517144320221121031439.0160328e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051714432DNAL7 a10.4141/cjps2013-0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shiyong10aAssessment of genetic diversity and differentiation of Elymus nutans indigenous to Qinghai–Tibet Plateau using simple sequence repeats markers  ap. 1089-1096.  aChen, S., Zhang, X., Ma, X. and Huang, L. 2013. Assessment of genetic diversity and differentiation ofElymus nutansindigenous to Qinghai–Tibet Plateau using simple sequence repeats markers. Can. J. Plant Sci. 93: 1089–1096. Elymus nutans Griseb., an important alpine forage grass, is widely distributed in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. A total of 50 E. nutans accessions from the eastern Qinghai–Tibet Plateau were analyzed using simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers from wheat and Elymus species. Our results show that a total of 144 reliable bands were generated, of which 132 (91.38%) were found to be polymorphic. Nei-Li's genetic similarity coefficients ranged from 0.515 to 0.870 with an average of 0.719, which shows a high level of genetic diversity and a broad genetic base among accessions. There was a low correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance (r=0.121, P=0.088) in the region, which is consistent with the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average cluster analysis of accessions. The mountain ridges and river valleys in the eastern Qinghai–Tibet region could serve as genetic barriers for pollinator movement and seed dispersal. The rule of the most genetic diversity at medium altitude of E. nutans in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau was also validated in the study. The implications of these results for the conservation of E. nutans are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElymus nutans 3aaltitude 3acluster analysis 3aforage grasses 3agenetic background 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apollinators 3arivers 3aseed dispersal 3avalleys 3awheat 3aChina 0aElymus nutans 0aQinghai-Tibet Plateau 0agenetic differentiation 0asimple sequence repeats 0aconservation1 aZhang, Xinquan1 aMa, Xiao1 aHuang, Linkai0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2013 Nov., v. 93, no. 6 p.1089-1096dAgricultural Institute of Canadax1918-18337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjps2013-0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012000170300001000290500001900300500001100319520158600330592002801916650001901944650001301963650001201976650001301988650001702001650002502018650001702043650001202060650001202072650001802084650002102102650001102123650001502134650002402149650001102173650001502184651002102199651001002220700001802230700001902248700002302267700005502290700001802345773015002363856008302513852000902596655001202605IND60730898420221120074221.0210323e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073089842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-021-09941-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheikh, Mehraj A.10aContribution of Cedrus deodara forests for climate mitigation along altitudinal gradient in Garhwal Himalaya, India  ap. 5.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aThe climatic and non-climatic stresses impacted adversely to the functioning and productivity of the forests, resulting in disturbing the existing carbon flow in the atmosphere. Cedrus deodara occurs in pure forest stands throughout the Western Himalayas and has high biomass and soil carbon sequestration potential. The present study aims to provide the contribution of the Cedrus deodara forests under the current stresses for climate mitigation by analysing the three elevation ranges of the Dhanaulti forest division of Garhwal Himalaya, India. The results report that soil organic carbon (SOC) was adversely and bulk density favourably related with elevation. Moreover, SOC as CO₂eq also decreased significantly with an increase in soil depths. Biomass carbon for various parts of the plant was also estimated for the three elevations of the Cedrus deodara forests. The trend in total carbon stock (bole, branch, twig, foliage and soil) decreased significantly with an increase in altitude. The carbon stock of Cedrus deodara forests was maximum (545 t ha⁻¹) at upper altitude (2350 m.a.s.l) and minimum (330 t ha⁻¹) at a lower altitude (2050 m.a.s.l). The difference in litter production between the seasons is significant with maximum production in summer followed by rainy and winter seasons. This study provides inputs for greenhouse gas (GHG) estimation for national communication to various platforms. The information on the soil is crucial for understanding about the ecology of the forests assisting prediction of functioning and productivity of forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCedrus deodara 3aaltitude 3abiomass 3abranches 3abulk density 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3aforests 3aglobal change 3agreenhouse gases 3aleaves 3aprediction 3asoil organic carbon 3asummer 3atree trunk 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia1 aKumar, Munesh1 aTodaria, N.

The PCR-Based Replicon Typing (PBRT), developed by Carattoli et al. in 2005, was an efficient method for plasmid identification and typing in Enterobacteriaceae. The 2005 PBRT scheme detected 18 replicons in 8 PCR reactions. Recently, the identification of novel replicons and plasmid types requested an update of the PBRT scheme. A commercial PBRT-KIT was devised for the identification of 28 different replicons in 8 multiplex PCRs. Here we report sensitivity and specificity of the PBRT-KIT carried out in comparison with the 2005 PBRT. The analysis of plasmid content was performed on forty-two enterobacterial strains from different sources, containing different replicon content. The 2005 PBRT identified replicons in 76.2% of the strains. The PBRT-KIT detected replicons in 100% of the analyzed strains, demonstrating increasing sensitivity and specificity of the commercial test with respect to the former 2005 PBRT scheme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aantibiotic resistance 3aevolution 3agenes 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areplicon 3avirulence 0aPBRT 0aWGS 0aPCR-Based Replicon Typing 0aPlasmids 0aResistance 0aEnterobacteriaceae1 aAndreoni, Francesca1 aOmiccioli, Enrica1 aVilla, Laura1 aMagnani, Mauro1 aCarattoli, Alessandra0 tPlasmid.g2017 Mar., v. 90 p.10-14dElsevier Inc.x0147-619X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plasmid.2017.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245016800156300001800324520153000342592002801872650001701900650001101917650001601928650001801944650001301962650001901975650001401994650000902008650000902017650001902026650001502045650002102060650001902081650002102100700001602121700001702137773014002154856007402294852000902368655001202377IND60671243220221119013816.0191002e20150506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067124322DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb00075k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Ming10aSelf-healable, super tough graphene oxide–poly(acrylic acid) nanocomposite hydrogels facilitated by dual cross-linking effects through dynamic ionic interactions  ap. 4001-4008.  aHere we propose a facile, one-pot in situ free radical polymerization strategy to prepare self-healable, super tough graphene oxide (GO)–poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) nanocomposite hydrogels by using Fe³⁺ ions as a cross-linker. The 3-dimensional network structure of the GO–PAA nanocomposite hydrogels is facilitated by dual cross-linking effects through dynamic ionic interactions: (i) the first cross-linking points are Fe³⁺ ions creating ionic cross-linking among PAA chains; (ii) the second cross-linking points are GO nanosheets linking PAA chains through Fe³⁺ coordination. When the GO–PAA nanocomposite hydrogels are under stretching conditions, the ionic interactions among PAA chains can dynamically break and recombine to dissipate energy, while the GO nanosheets coordinated to the PAA chains maintain the configuration of the hydrogels and work as stress transfer centers transferring the stress to the polymer matrix. In this regard, the GO–PAA nanocomposite hydrogels exhibit superior toughness (tensile strength = 777 kPa, work of extension = 11.9 MJ m⁻³) and stretchability (elongation at break = 2980%). Furthermore, after being treated at 45 °C for 48 h, the cut-off GO–PAA nanocomposite hydrogels exhibit good self-healing properties (tensile strength = 495 kPa, elongation at break = 2470%). The self-healable, super tough GO–PAA nanocomposite hydrogels lay a basis for developing advanced soft materials holding potential applications in modern biomedical engineering and technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3aenergy 3aengineering 3afree radicals 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogels 3aions 3airon 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolymerization 3atensile strength1 aLiu, Yi-Tao1 aXie, Xu-Ming0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 May 6, v. 3, no. 19 p.4001-4008dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb00075k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245006500167300001600232500002000248520111900268592002801387596007701415596004501492650001001537650001601547650002601563650001601589650002201605650000901627650001701636650002001653650001501673650001201688650000701700650001001707650002301717700001801740700002201758700001901780700006201799773011601861856007801977852000902055655001202064IND60693222720221122052159.0200505e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069322272DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2019004092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Sankha Shuvra10aAnomalous diffusion in an electrolyte saturated paper matrix  ap. 678-683.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDiffusion of colored dye on water saturated paper substrates has been traditionally exploited with great skill by renowned water color artists. The same physics finds more recent practical applications in paper‐based diagnostic devices deploying chemicals that react with a bodily fluid yielding colorimetric signals for disease detection. During spontaneous imbibition through the tortuous pathways of a porous electrolyte saturated paper matrix, a dye molecule undergoes diffusion in a complex network of pores. The advancing front forms a strongly correlated interface that propagates diffusively but with an enhanced effective diffusivity. We measure this effective diffusivity and show that it is several orders of magnitude greater than the free solution diffusivity and has a significant dependence on the solution pH and salt concentration in the background electrolyte. We attribute this to electrically mediated interfacial interactions between the ionic species in the liquid dye and spontaneous surface charges developed at porous interfaces, and introduce a simple theory to explain this phenomenon.  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology  cIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adiagnostic techniques 3adiffusivity 3adisease detection 3adyes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrophoresis 3aimbibition 3aliquids 3apH 3apaper 3asalt concentration1 aKumar, Sumeet1 aGhosal, Sambuddha1 aGhosal, Sandip1 aChakraborty, Suman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5454-97660 tElectrophoresis.g2020 May, v. 41, no. 9 p.678-683dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2019004093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012600155520151200281592002801793650002001821650001201841650001601853650001101869650002401880650002901904650001001933650001701943650002801960700001301988773012702001856007402128852000902202655001202211IND60652565720221123034008.0190713e20180811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065256572DNAL7 a10.3390/su100828572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Yang10aExternal Intervention or Internal Coordination? Incentives to Promote Sustainable Development through Green Supply Chains  aTo encourage firms to engage in green production, two different types of investment funding, namely external funds from agencies outside the supply chain (e.g., government subsidy), and internal funds from supply chain partners (e.g., greening cost-sharing with the retailer), are investigated in this paper. Based on game theory, the decision-making behavior and profits of a competitive supply chain consisting of a green manufacturer, a regular manufacturer, and a retailer are analyzed under both funding schemes. The results show that while both government subsidy and greening cost-sharing contract can achieve the goals of increasing a product&rsquo;s degree of greenness and increasing the sales of green products, there are differences between these two methods in reaching these goals. Further, both via theoretical and numerical analysis, we find that although both the green manufacturer and the retailer can greatly benefit from government subsidy and greening cost-sharing contract, they may have different preferences regarding these two methods, which are mainly related to the size of the government subsidy, the fraction of greening cost-sharing with the retailer, the Research and Development (R&amp;D) cost coefficient, the greenness sensitivity coefficient, and price sensitivity coefficient. Finally, the supply chain members&rsquo; behaviors (including the production and pricing decisions and, the choice of funds investment) are largely affected by the government subsidy mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3afunding 3agame theory 3aprices 3aprofits and margins 3aresearch and development 3asales 3asupply chain 3asustainable development1 aLi, Yina0 tSustainability.g2018 Aug. 11, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100828573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245009500173300001600268520136100284592002801645650001401673650001801687650001401705650001601719650002501735653001901760653002801779653002501807653002501832653002701857653003201884700002101916700001901937700001601956700001601972700001701988773010202005856008302107852000902190655001202199IND60606545520221119232027.0180726e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060654552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2015.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillaret, Catherine10aFirst-order uncertainty analysis using Algorithmic Differentiation of morphodynamic models  ap. 144-151.  aWe present here an efficient first-order second moment method using Algorithmic Differentiation (FOSM/AD) which can be applied to quantify uncertainty/sensitivities in morphodynamic models. Changes with respect to variable flow and sediment input parameters are estimated with machine accuracy using the technique of Algorithmic Differentiation (AD). This method is particularly attractive for process-based morphodynamic models like the Telemac-2D/Sisyphe model considering the large number of input parameters and CPU time associated to each simulation.The FOSM/AD method is applied to identify the relevant processes in a trench migration experiment (van Rijn, 1987). A Tangent Linear Model (TLM) of the Telemac-2D/Sisyphe morphodynamic model (release 6.2) was generated using the AD-enabled NAG Fortran compiler. One single run of the TLM is required per variable input parameter and results are then combined to calculate the total uncertainty.The limits of the FOSM/AD method have been assessed by comparison with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Similar results were obtained assuming small standard deviation of the variable input parameters. Both settling velocity and grain size have been identified as the most sensitive input parameters and the uncertainty as measured by the standard deviation of the calculated bed evolution increases with time.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3alinear models 3asediments 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 0aMorphodynamics 0aProcess-based modelling 0aUncertainty analysis 0aSensitivity analysis 0aMonte Carlo simulation 0aAlgorithmic Differentiation1 aKopmann, Rebekka1 aWyncoll, David1 aRiehme, Jan1 aMerkel, Uwe1 aNaumann, Uwe0 tComputers & geosciences.g2016 May, v. 90 p.144-151dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2015.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245011200168520145700280592002801737650001901765650001701784650001901801650002301820650001701843650002901860650002101889650001501910650000901925650001901934651001201953700001501965700002001980700002302000773012702023856007402150852000902224655001202233IND60652565920221123033821.0190713e20180811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065256592DNAL7 a10.3390/su100828592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSäynäjoki, Eeva-Sofia10aGHG Emissions Reduction through Urban Planners’ Improved Control over Earthworks: A Case Study in Finland  aMost climate change mitigation schemes in urban planning concentrate on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the distant future by altering the urban form and encouraging more sustainable behaviour. However, to reach climate change mitigation targets, a more immediate reduction in GHG emissions is also needed as well as a reduction in GHG emissions in other fields. This article evaluates the important role of earthworks in the prompt and substantial reduction required for GHG emissions. The research includes a single case study and three focus group interviews. The results of the case study reveal the magnitude of possible emission reductions through urban planners&rsquo; control over earthworks, whereas the findings of the focus groups shed light on the relevance of the findings beyond the single case. Three urban planning solutions were implemented in the case area to reduce GHG emissions from earth construction, resulting in the saving of 2360 tonnes of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Notable savings were also achieved in other emission categories. Such a successful management of rock and soil material flows requires a strong vision from the urban planner, cooperation among many different actors, and smart decisions in multiple planning phases. Furthermore, numerical data is needed to confirm the environmental benefits if the coordination of earthworks is to be widely included in regional climate change mitigation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3afocus groups 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ainterviews 3asoil 3aurban planning 3aFinland1 aKorba, Pia1 aKalliala, Elina1 aNuotio, Aino-Kaisa0 tSustainability.g2018 Aug. 11, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100828593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245010200169300001600271520141300287592002801700650001601728650001401744650001301758650002001771650001301791650001001804650002801814653003601842653002801878653002601906653002501932700002101957700002501978700002102003700002002024700002102044700001502065773010302080856008302183852000902266655001202275IND60606545620221119232139.0180726e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060654562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2015.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChauhan, Swarup10aProcessing of rock core microtomography images: Using seven different machine learning algorithms  ap. 120-128.  aThe abilities of machine learning algorithms to process X-ray microtomographic rock images were determined. The study focused on the use of unsupervised, supervised, and ensemble clustering techniques, to segment X-ray computer microtomography rock images and to estimate the pore spaces and pore size diameters in the rocks. The unsupervised k-means technique gave the fastest processing time and the supervised least squares support vector machine technique gave the slowest processing time. Multiphase assemblages of solid phases (minerals and finely grained minerals) and the pore phase were found on visual inspection of the images. In general, the accuracy in terms of porosity values and pore size distribution was found to be strongly affected by the feature vectors selected. Relative porosity average value of 15.92±1.77% retrieved from all the seven machine learning algorithm is in very good agreement with the experimental results of 17±2%, obtained using gas pycnometer. Of the supervised techniques, the least square support vector machine technique is superior to feed forward artificial neural network because of its ability to identify a generalized pattern. In the ensemble classification techniques boosting technique converged faster compared to bragging technique. The k-means technique outperformed the fuzzy c-means and self-organized maps techniques in terms of accuracy and speed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acomputers 3aminerals 3aneural networks 3aporosity 3arocks 3asupport vector machines 0aMicro-X-ray computer tomography 0aUnsupervised clustering 0aSupervised clustering 0aEnsemble classifiers1 aRühaak, Wolfram1 aK̲h̲ān, Faiṣal,1 aEnzmann, Frieder1 aMielke, Philipp1 aKersten, Michael1 aSass, Ingo0 tComputers & geosciences.g2016 Jan., v. 86 p.120-128dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2015.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002600147245009500173300001600268500001500284520142000299592002801719650002101747650001101768650002201779650001201801650002101813650001301834650001801847650001901865650000801884650001001892650001801902650001501920650001501935650002701950650001601977651001001993653001202003653001502015700002502030700001302055700001802068700001702086773009702103856008302200852000902283655001202292IND4446659020221122232725.0141112e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444665902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2010.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReszkowska, Agnieszka10aInfluence of grazing on soil water and gas fluxes of two Inner Mongolian steppe ecosystems  ap. 180-189.  a2019-12-06  aIntensive overgrazing, practiced for the last decades in Inner Mongolia, has led to serious grassland degradation and deterioration of soil structure. As a consequence, the soil gas and water fluxes and therefore soil functions were affected by grazing. We investigated two steppe ecosystems characterized by two plant communities: Stipa grandis (SG) and Leymus chinensis (LCh) and different grazing intensities: ungrazed since 1979 (UG79), continuously grazed (CG, at the SG site) and winter grazed (WG, at the LCh site). The undisturbed soil samples, for determination of saturated (kₛ) and unsaturated (kᵤ) hydraulic conductivities and air conductivities (kₐ), were collected in vertical and horizontal direction from two soil horizons. The coefficients of anisotropy were calculated as ratios of the values obtained for the samples taken in horizontal direction to the values of the vertical samples. The results indicated a good recovery of soil structure at the sites ungrazed for more than 30 years. Furthermore, the recovery was more pronounced at the LCh site compared with the SG site. The results suggested that grazing causes significant changes in anisotropy of soil functions related to rearrangement of aggregates and creation of a platy soil structure. The results of the coefficients of anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity showed that they depend on the matric potential for both treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeymus chinensis 3awinter 3aplant communities 3asteppes 3asoil degradation 3asoil air 3asoil horizons 3asoil structure 3aair 3aStipa 3asoil sampling 3asoil water 3aecosystems 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aovergrazing 3aChina 0agrazing 0agrasslands1 aKrümmelbein, Julia,1 aGan, Lei1 aPeth, Stephan1 aHorn, Rainer0 tSoil & tillage research.g2011 Jan., v. 111, no. 2 p.180-189dElsevier B.V.x0167-19877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2010.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009400173300001400267520145200281592002801733650000801761650002101769650002301790650001701813650002001830650001701850650001901867650001701886650001801903650001201921650001801933650001501951650002201966650001301988650001402001650002802015650002502043650001402068650002502082650002302107650002102130650001602151650001902167650001402186653001702200653001302217653002602230653001802256653001002274653001902284700001402303700002302317773010702340856008702447852000902534655001202543IND60541218820221119214400.0190318e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054121882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2013.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtwell, Brian J.10aCould abiotic stress tolerance in wild relatives of rice be used to improve Oryza sativa?  ap. 48-58.  aOryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima have been selected to acquire and partition resources efficiently as part of the process of domestication. However, genetic diversity in cultivated rice is limited compared to wild Oryza species, in spite of 120,000 genotypes being held in gene banks. By contrast, there is untapped diversity in the more than 20 wild species of Oryza, some having been collected from just a few coastal locations (e.g. Oryza schlechteri), while others are widely distributed (e.g. Oryza nivara and Oryza rufipogon). The extent of DNA sequence diversity and phenotypic variation is still being established in wild Oryza, with genetic barriers suggesting a vast range of morphologies and function even within species, such as has been demonstrated for Oryza meridionalis. With increasing climate variability and attempts to make more marginal land arable, abiotic and biotic stresses will be managed over the coming decades by tapping into the genetic diversity of wild relatives of O. sativa. To help create a more targeted approach to sourcing wild rice germplasm for abiotic stress tolerance, we have created a climate distribution map by plotting the natural occurrence of all Oryza species against corresponding temperature and moisture data. We then discuss interspecific variation in phenotype and its significance for rice, followed by a discussion of ways to integrate germplasm from wild relatives into domesticated rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aOryza glaberrima 3aOryza meridionalis 3aOryza nivara 3aOryza rufipogon 3aOryza sativa 3aabiotic stress 3aarable soils 3abiotic stress 3aclimate 3adomestication 3agene banks 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3ainterspecific variation 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3asequence diversity 3astress tolerance 3atemperature 3awild relatives 3awild rice 0aBiogeography 0aBreeding 0aClimatic distribution 0aIntrogression 0aOryza 0aWild relatives1 aWang, Han1 aScafaro, Andrew P.0 tPlant science.g2014 Feb., v. 215-216 p.48-58dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2013.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011600173300001600289520129600305592002801601650003001629650002001659650001401679650002701693650002501720650001401745650002001759650003401779653002001813653002001833653003101853653002301884700002001907700002401927773011701951856008202068852000902150655001202159IND60621455120221121005755.0181117s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062145512DNAL7 a10.1177/15648265040251S1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnyango, Adelheid W.10aManaging Data for a Multicountry Longitudinal Study: Experience from the who Multicentre Growth Reference Study  ap. S46-S52.  aThe World Health Organization (WHO) Multicentre Growth Reference (MGRS) data management protocol was designed to create and manage a large data bank of information collected from multiple sites over a period of several years. Data collection and processing instruments were prepared centrally and used in a standardized fashion across sites. The data management system contained internal validation features for timely detection of data errors, and its standard operating procedures stipulated a method of master file updating and correction that maintained a clear trail for data auditing purposes. Each site was responsible for collecting, entering, verifying, and validating data, and for creating site-level master files. Data from the sites were sent to the MGRS Coordinating Centre every month for master file consolidation and more extensive quality control checking. All errors identified at the Coordinating Centre were communicated to the site for correction at source. The protocol imposed transparency on the sites’ data management activities but also ensured access to technical help with operation and maintenance of the system.

Free bacteria are often sensitive to some biotic and abiotic factors in the environment to the extent that their ability to effect biodegradation of organic pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, is hampered. Consequently, it is imperative to carry out investigations into biological systems that will obviate or aid tolerance of bacteria to harsh environmental conditions. Chitosan/alginate bio-microcapsules produced using layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly method were tested for pyrene (PYR) biodegradation under harsh environmental conditions. Morphology observation indicated that the flake bio-microcapsules could be successfully prepared through LBL assembly method. Surface analysis showed that the bio-microcapsules had large fractions of mesopores. The results of the biodegradation experiments revealed that the 95% of 10mgL−1 PYR could be removed by the bacteria encapsulated chitosan/alginate bio-microcapsules in 3 days, which was higher than that of the free bacteria (59%). Compared to the free cells, the bacteria encapsulated chitosan/alginate bio-microcapsules produced 1–6 times higher PYR biodegradation rates at a high initial PYR concentration (50mgL−1) and extremely low pH values (pH =3) or temperatures (10°C or 40°C), as well as high salt stress. The results indicated that bacteria in microcapsules treatment gained a much higher tolerance to environmental stress and LBL bio-microcapsule could be promising candidate for remediating the organic pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3abiotechnology 3achitosan 3aenvironmental factors 3apH 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asalt stress 3atemperature 0aLayer-by-layer assembly 0aBio-microcapsules 0aPyrene 0aBiodegradation 0aEnvironmental stress 0aEnvironmental tolerance1 aZhang, Zhengfang1 aYang, Chen1 aGuo, Chuling1 aLu, Guining1 aDang, Zhi0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2017 Apr., v. 138 p.9-15dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245006500161300001800226520170800244592002801952650002201980650001602002650001602018650002302034650001402057650001302071650001302084650001902097650001902116650002702135650001702162650001102179650001502190700002002205700001702225700001702242700001202259773011602271856008102387852000902468655001202477IND60114280420221117063442.0141120e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011428042DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-014-5923-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xia10aPPCPs removal by aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor  ap. 9843-9848.  aAn aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor (GMBR) was applied to the treatment of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) wastewater. The influence of granular sludge on five antibiotic and antiphlogistic PPCPs wastewater and the removal effect of methyl alcohol and conventional organic matter were investigated while constantly reducing the density of inflow organic matter. The results showed that the sludge granulation process in the system was rapid but unstable, and that the system exhibits a dissolution–reunion dynamic equilibrium. The reactor demonstrated varying removal effects of PPCPs on different objects. The use of a GMBR was more effective for the removal of prednisolone, naproxen, and ibuprofen; the first two drugs were lower the average removal rate of which reached 98.46 and 84.02 %, respectively; whereas the average removal rate of ibuprofen was 63.32 %. By contrast, the GMBR has an insignificant degradation effect on antibiotics such as amoxicillin, indicating that such antibiotic medicine is not easily degraded by microorganisms, which plays different roles in system operation. Because of the different chemical structures and characteristics of drugs that result in various degradation behavior. During the GMBR granulation process, the value of mixed liquor volatility suspended solids (MLVSS) gradually increases from 1.5 to 4.1 g/L during the GMBR granulation process, and the removal rate of CODCᵣ reaches up to 87.98 %. After reducing the density of organic matter is reduced, the removal rates of NH₃-N and TP both reach more than 90 %, respectively. Moreover, the proposed technique is considerably effective in the removal of methanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3aamoxicillin 3abioreactors 3achemical structure 3aibuprofen 3amedicine 3amethanol 3amicroorganisms 3aorganic matter 3apersonal care products 3aprednisolone 3asludge 3awastewater1 aChen, Zhong-lin1 aWang, X.

Insect farming is considered as an alternative feed due to its low land and water requirements, its low ecological footprint, and circular economy contribution by converting biowaste into high-quality feed ingredients. While there is growing research on the technical feasibility and nutritional performance of insect-based feed, its potential beneifts are not quanitified. Using experimental and secondary data, we assess the potential socio-economic benefits of black soldier fly larvae meal (BSFLM) to the Kenyan poultry sector. We find that replacing 5–50% of the conventional feed sources (fishmeal, maize, and soya bean meal) by BSFLM can generate a potential economic benefit of 69–687 million USD (0.1–1% of the total GDP) and 16–159 million USD (0.02–0.24% of the GDP) if the entire poultry sector (the commercial poultry sector) adopts BSFLM. These could translate to reducing poverty by 0.32–3.19 million (0.07–0.74 million) people, increasing employment by 25,000–252,000 (3300–33,000) people, and recycling of 2–18 million (0.24–2 million) tonnes of biowaste. Further, our findings show that replacing the conventional feeds by 5–50% BSFLM in the commercial poultry sector would increase the availability of fish and maize that can feed 0.47–4.8 million people at the current per capita of fish and maize consumption in Kenya. Similarly, the foreign currency savings can increase by 1–10 million USD by reducing feed and inorganic fertilzer importation. These findings suggest that greater investment to promote BSFLM could boost economic, environmental and social sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHermetia illucens 3acircular economy 3acorn 3aecological footprint 3aemployment 3afarming systems 3afeeds 3afinancial economics 3afish 3afish meal 3aingredients 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3apeople 3apoultry 3apoverty 3arecycling 3asocial sustainability 3asocioeconomics 3asoybean meal 3awastes 3awater requirement 3aKenya 0aBlack soldier fly 0aInsect-based feed 0aSocio-economic benefits 0aCircular economy 0aPoultry 0aClimate-smart farming 0aKenya1 aKassie, Menale1 aTanga, Chrysantus1 aBeesigamukama, Dennis1 aDiiro, Gracious0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 20, v. 265 p.121871-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1218713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245009000154300001600244500002000260520136100280592002801641650002001669650001901689650001401708650001201722650001101734650001401745650001601759650001201775650001801787650001201805650001101817650001301828650002101841650001001862650002101872650001501893650002201908651001001930700001801940700001601958700001501974700001301989700002102002773011502023856007302138852000902211655001202220IND60592403020221117225133.0180403e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059240302DNAL7 a10.1111/pbr.125672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Tang10aTransgene introgression from Brassica napus to different varieties of Brassica juncea  ap. 171-180.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTransgene introgression from transgenic rapeseed (Brassica napus) to different varieties of B. juncea was assessed in this study. Crossability between a transgenic rapeseed line Z7B10 (pollen donor) and 80 cultivars of 16 B. juncea varieties (including two wild accessions) was estimated by artificial pollination in a greenhouse. As a result, interspecific crossability between the transgenic Z7B10 line and the 80 B. juncea cultivars varied considerably, with seeds per flower from 0.00–10.67. Seed germination rates of the interspecific F₁ hybrids ranged from 49.0%–89.3%. The estimated frequencies of natural gene flow from the transgenic Z7B10 line to 10 B. juncea cultivars with different uses in the experiment field varied from 0.08% to 0.93%. The natural F₁ hybrids were highly sterile, with seeds per silique ranging from 0.27 to 1.03. In addition, seeds per flower of hybrid descendants varied from 0.02 to 0.22 when F₁ hybrids were self‐pollinated, and those ranged from 0.03 to 0.30 when F₁ hybrids were backcrossed with their corresponding B. juncea parents. Results of this study suggest a low level of transgene introgression from transgenic rapeseed to different B. juncea varieties, which provides a sound scientific basis for the safety management of coexisting transgenic B. napus and B. juncea varieties in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aBrassica napus 3acultivars 3aflowers 3afruits 3agene flow 3agreenhouses 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3aparents 3apollen 3arapeseed 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3aself-pollination 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3aChina1 aChen, Guimin,1 aBu, CuiPing1 aLiu, FuXia1 aLiu, Lei1 aZhao, XiangXiang0 tPlant breeding.g2018 Apr., v. 137, no. 2 p.171-180dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl40712x0179-95417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbr.125673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001900139245010600158300001600264520192000280592002802200650002202228650002002250650001502270650003002285650003002315650002102345650001002366650002102376650002302397650002802420650001402448650002302462651001302485653002502498700002002523700002202543700002302565773010302588856007702691852000902768655001202777IND4403822420221117225636.0151127e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440382242DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-07-114.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHite, Grace A.10aDifferential Response of a Virginia Common Lambsquarters (Chenopodium Album) Collection to Glyphosate  ap. 203-209.  aControl of common lambsquarters with POST applications of glyphosate in glyphosate-resistant crops generally has been effective. In 2002, common lambsquarters plants from Westmoreland County, VA, were identified after not being controlled with a POST glyphosate application in glyphosate-resistant soybean. Plants from this site that survived glyphosate were collected in both 2002 and 2004. The objective of this research was to evaluate the susceptibility of F1 and F2 progeny from these common lambsquarters plants, relative to the susceptibility of common lambsquarters collected in Montgomery County, VA. F1 progeny of the Westmoreland plants from both the 2002 and 2004 collections showed reduced response to glyphosate relative to the Montgomery collection. Vigor reduction of F1 progeny from three 2004 Westmoreland source plants with 0.84 kg ae ha⁻⁻¹ of glyphosate ranged from 66 to 85%% at 28 d after treatment (DAT), compared with 89%% for the Montgomery collection. Evaluation of four Westmoreland F2 common lambsquarters lines derived from 2002 collections indicated significant differences in glyphosate sensitivity. Fifteen F2 lines were generated from 2004 collections from each of three Westmoreland source plants and from the Montgomery source. For the least sensitive Westmoreland source, vigor reduction ranged from only 24 to 36%% across F2 lines in response to 1.68 kg ha⁻⁻¹ of glyphosate at 28 DAT relative to 55 to 100%% for the Montgomery source. I₅₀ estimates for fresh weight reduction were 0.91 and 0.32 kg ha⁻⁻¹, for these sources, respectively. Sequential treatments of 0.42, 1.26, and 1.68 kg ha⁻⁻¹ applied at 3-wk intervals to the least susceptible 2004 Westmoreland F2 line resulted in only 37%% vigor reduction and no mortality among 360 treated plants.Nomenclature: Glyphosate; common lambsquarters, Chenopodium album L.

Satellite data provide critical information across space and time, yet how satellite indices relate to individual measures of burn severity on the ground (e.g., tree mortality or surface charring) and how these relationships change across biophysical gradients remain unclear. To address these knowledge gaps, we used Bayesian hierarchical zero‐one‐inflated beta (ZOIB) regression models with nearly 600 plots of individual field measures of burn severity distributed across the U.S. Rocky Mountains. We asked the following: How do three commonly used satellite indices of burn severity relate to individual field measures of canopy burn severity and forest‐floor burn severity (Q1)? Then, using the highest ranked satellite index, how is reliability affected by biophysical gradients that can be captured in accessible geospatial data (e.g., latitude, slope) (Q2) and stand‐structure data typically available only with field data (Q3)? The Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) outperformed the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and the Relative Burn Ratio (RBR) across canopy and forest‐floor measures of burn severity, but differences among index performances were minor. Overall, indices performed better for field measures of canopy burn severity than for forest‐floor measures. The relationship between RdNBR and individual field measures of burn severity changed across several biophysical gradients. For example, the same value of RdNBR corresponded to different field levels of burn severity depending on latitude, pre‐fire forest structure, and pre‐fire beetle outbreaks—and effects of biophysical gradients were often different for canopy vs. forest‐floor measures of burn severity. We show that estimating field measures of burn severity using satellite indices can be improved by including biophysical information, but if variables that are difficult to obtain without field data (e.g., pre‐fire beetle outbreak severity) are lacking, we suggest caution in interpreting satellite indices of burn severity across gradients of pre‐fire biophysical conditions. Finally, using an example fire, we illustrate contrasting maps of burn severity that arise from differences in the relationship between individual field measures of burn severity and RdNBR after accounting for error in those relationships.  aPublisher supplied data  a# 12‐3‐01‐3cU.S. Joint Fire Science Program  cU.S. National Park Service—George Melendez Wright Climate Change Fellowship  cLaurel Salton Clark Memorial Research Fellowship from the Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium  cDavid H.

Mark-recapture methods play a vital role in the process of estimating population size, and in the monitoring and conservation of mobile species. A variety of marking techniques are routinely used in a range of crayfish species for ecological research. The majority of information on the effects of these marking techniques on the physiology of crayfish species focuses on survivability and growth, whereas information is scarce on the effects on crayfish behaviour. This study investigates the behavioural changes of crayfish in reaction to five commonly used marking techniques in laboratory conditions. The marking techniques used were internal and external passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, visible implant elastomer (VIE) tags, cauterisation and ablation. Effects of marking technique on behaviour were evaluated immediately after marking, and over a 14-day period, on 78 crayfish. Results indicated that the internal passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags negatively affected crayfish behaviour by increasing resting levels. Ablation and cauterisation also increased grooming levels, while marking reduced activity levels in general. These effects on behaviour occurred immediately after marking, but quickly dissipated. These results suggest that the use of internal PIT tags for marking white-clawed crayfish may need to be avoided as increased resting levels could lead to increased exposure out of refuge and predation. This may have a detrimental impact on the welfare and conservation of white-clawed crayfish and also lead to biased population estimates during mark-recapture projects. The remaining marking techniques (external PIT tag, VIE tag, ablation, cauterisation) may be used, as changes in behaviour will not have a detrimental impact and therefore should not lead to biased population estimates.  aPublisher supplied data  cGalway-Mayo Institute of Technology  cMarine and Freshwater Research Centre 3abehavior change 3acrayfish 3alaboratory experimentation 3alaws and regulations 3amark-recapture studies 3amonitoring 3aphysiology 3apopulation size 3apredation 3atransponders 0aWhite-Clawed Crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) 0amark-recapture 0amarking techniques 0aanimal behaviour1 aO’Brien, Joanne1 aNelson, Brian,d1946-1 aGammell, Martin0 tMarine and freshwater behaviour and physiology.g2019 July 4, v. 52, no. 4 p.181-197dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12223x1029-03627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10236244.2019.16597363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014200166300001600308500001900324520099500343592002801338650003501366650001201401650001101413650001101424650000901435650001001444650001201454650001401466650000901480650002001489650001401509650001501523650001401538650001301552650001101565650000901576650001101585650000901596653003401605653001301639653002501652653001201677700001801689773014401707856008101851852000901932655001201941IND60689310220221121032852.0200421e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068931022DNAL7 a10.1080/096374807016255802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGüler, >Zehra14aThe essential mineral concentration of Torba yoghurts and their wheys compared with yoghurt made with cows’, ewes’ and goats’ milks  ap. 153-164.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aComparative studies on yoghurts made from cows’, ewes’ and goats’ milks with respect to mineral concentrations are limited and warrant further investigation. The objective of this study was to analyse the gross chemical composition as well as the concentration of essential minerals in concentrated (torba) yoghurts made from cows’, ewes’ and goats’ milk compared with those in regular yoghurts and wheys. The elements were determined by simultaneous inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Ewe torba yoghurt was significantly higher in calcium, sodium, phosphorus, magnesium, selenium, zinc, cobalt, copper and iron concentrations compared with goat and cow torba yoghurts. It is recommended that torba yoghurts made from different types of milk may be considered an important source of phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, selenium and zinc over the regular yoghurts and wheys.

Within this genus, Gerbillus nanus is a species often considered to have a wide geographic distribution ranging from northwest India to the Mauritanian coast. Some authors, however, have suggested that other species, namely Gerbillus amoenus and/or Gerbillus garamantis, may replace G. nanus over a part of, or over the whole of its African area of occurrence. Here, we bring together new karyological data and molecular analyses of cytochrome b mitochondrial gene sequences of G. nanus specimens from various parts of the alleged extended distribution of the species: Pakistan and Israel in Asia, and Libya, Mali, and Mauritania in Africa. The karyotypes of Asian and African specimens appear similar, while a rather important genetic distance was found between samples of specimens from the two continents. This last finding suggests that at least two distinct species exist, G. nanus being the species of Asian distribution, and G. garamantis and/or G. amoenus being the one(s) with African distribution(s). Similar comparative analyses on larger samples are now needed to determine the precise taxonomic situation in this group, as well as the distribution limits of each species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGerbillus 3aanimal taxonomy 3abiogeography 3acoasts 3acytochrome b 3agenetic distance 3ageographical distribution 3akaryotyping 3arodents 3asequence analysis 3aIndia 3aIsrael 3aLibya 3aMali 3aMauritania 3aPakistan 0acytochrome b gene 0aGerbillus 0akaryotypes 0anomenclature 0avicariance1 aShanas, Uri1 aChevret, Pascale1 aGranjon, Laurent0 tMammalia.g2012 Sept. 01, v. 77, no. 1 p.105-111dDe Gruyterx1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mammalia-2012-00393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011900165300001600284520176200300592002802062650002002090650002702110650002602137650001102163650001202174650002202186650001502208650001002223650001202233650001802245650002202263650001202285650001802297650001002315650001102325650001602336651001102352700001702363700001802380700001802398773012602416856008202542852000902624655001202633IND60439453820221120140709.0220202e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043945382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-005-9102-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLara-Ruiz, P.10aExtensive hybridization in hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) nesting in Brazil revealed by mtDNA analyses  ap. 773-781.  aBahia state hosts over 90% of hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) nests registered in the main nesting sites monitored by Projeto Tamar-IBAMA in Brazil. The genetic diversity of this hawksbill population (n=119) was assayed through the analyses of 752 bp of the mitochondrial DNA control region in nesting females. Seven distinct haplotypes, defined by 125 polymorphic sites, were found. Most of the individuals (n=67) display four typical hawksbill haplotypes, 50 individuals display two haplotypes characteristic of the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) and two individuals had a haplotype affiliated with the olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea). These results demonstrate hybridization between the hawksbills and two species that nest along the Bahia coast. Of special interest is the high occurrence of loggerhead × hawksbill hybrids (42%), which display loggerhead mtDNA haplotypes but are characterized morphologically as hawksbills. The true hawksbill haplotypes present only three variable sites and low genetic diversity values (h=0.358±0.069; π=0.0005±0.0001). The occurrence of several nesting individuals with identical mtDNA from another species may also suggest a long history of introgression between species producing likely F2 or further generation hybrids. Marine turtle hybrids have been previously reported, but the high frequency observed in Bahia is unprecedented. Such introgression may influence evolutionary pathways for all three species, or may introduce novel morphotypes that develop apart from the parental species.

Tailoring crystal surfaces to a specific reaction has demonstrated to be a very effective way in increasing the catalyst’s specific activity. Shape controlled nanoparticles with specific crystal facets are usually grown kinetically and are highly susceptible to morphological changes during the reaction due to agglomeration, metal dissolution, or Ostwald ripening. A strong interaction of the catalytic material to the support is thus crucial for successful stabilization. Taken both points into account, a general catalyst design is proposed, combining the enhanced activity of shape-controlled nanoparticles with a pore-confinement approach for high stability. Hollow graphitic spheres with narrow and uniform bimodal mesopores serve as model system and were used as support material. As catalyst, different kinds of particles, such as pure platinum (Pt), platinum/nickel (Pt₃Ni) and Pt₃Ni doped with molybdenum (Pt₃Ni–Mo), have exemplarily been synthesized. The advantages, limits and challenges of the proposed concept are discussed and elaborated by means of time-resolved, in and ex situ measurements. It will be shown that during catalysis, the potential boundaries are crucial especially for the proposed catalyst design, resulting in either retention of the initial activity or drastic loss in shape, size and elemental composition. The synthesis and catalyst design can be adapted to a wide range of catalytic reactions where stabilization of shape-controlled particles is a focus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstwald ripening 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelemental composition 3amodels 3amolybdenum 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3aplatinum1 aPaciok, Paul1 aGöhl, Daniel1 aJalalpoor, Daniel1 aPizzutilo, Enrico1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2733-74071 aMingers, Andrea M.1 aHeggen, Marc1 aDunin-Borkowski, Rafal E.1 aMayrhofer, Karl J.

In this work, the coupling of vortex sheets with different structures in chemical–turbulent agglomeration was proposed to generate a more disordered flow field for better particle agglomeration and removal effect. Three turbulent agglomerators containing different vortex sheets were designed and manufactured, and the particle number concentration, size distribution, and particle removal efficiency after chemical–turbulent agglomeration with different turbulent agglomerators were investigated by experiments. The results showed that the turbulent agglomerator with the coupling of different vortex sheets can effectively promote the agglomeration and removal effect of fine particles, the number of fine particles below 0.1 μm decreased significantly, and the number and mass concentration of fine particles after the electrostatic precipitator also decreased. In addition, the flow field distribution, motion, and residence time of fine particles in different turbulent agglomerators were simulated using the computational fluid dynamics method to explore the promotion mechanism by different vortex sheets. The results proved that the coupling of vortex sheets with different structures in chemical–turbulent agglomeration can make the turbulent flow field more disordered, enhance the relative movement of fine particles, and extend their residence time in the flow field, to promote the agglomeration and removal effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aenergy 3aturbulent flow1 aYang, Linjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7302-43781 aMa, Xiuwei1 aWu, Xin1 aWu, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5128-13060 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 June 22, v. 34, no. 8 p.10019-10029dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c015673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245016200165520166500327592002801992650003402020650002602054650002302080650002002103650002402123650001302147650001102160650001202171650001802183650001502201650000902216650001102225650001402236650001102250650002002261650001702281650000902298650001402307650003302321650001502354650002102369650002102390650001602411653002102427653002602448653002302474653002402497653001402521700001702535700001802552700001302570700001702583773011402600856008602714852000902800655001202809IND60692628820221122225338.0201025e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069262882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1218852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Lele10aFabrication of a high tensile and antioxidative film via a green strategy of self-growing needle-like quercetin crystals in cassia gum for lipid preservation  aAlthough active packaging materials have attracted many attentions, weak mechanical and barrier properties from active-ingredient addition need to be resolved. Here, a bio-degradable and anti-oxidative packaging film with a high tensile strength and a low permeability was prepared by self-growing needle-like quercetin in cassia gum solution during drying. Stereoscopic (SM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the quercetin was distributed evenly in needle-like ∼50-nm-diameter crystals in the film for an addition lower than 3.0%; and formed an urchin-like crystal when the addition was equal to or greater than 3.0% and the distribution was uneven. The needle-like quercetin crystal could enhance the mechanical and barrier properties, however, the urchin-like crystals contributed negatively. As quercetin dosage increased from 0% to 2.5%, tensile strength (TS) increased from 22.08 to 47.19 MPa, water vapor permeability (WVP) decreased from 2.16 to 1.45 g m⁻¹ s⁻¹ Pa⁻¹ and oxygen permeability (OP) decreased from 1.69 to 1.20 cm³ mm m⁻² day⁻¹, respectively. The composite film exhibited an excellent ultraviolet resistance and antioxidative performances for DPPH, ABTS•⁺, •HO and O₂•⁻ free radicals, and the corresponding scavenging activities were 80.07%, 92.15%, 124.42% and 96.92% in ethanol simulant, respectively. Its practical application in packaging pork lard showed that the cassia gum–quercetin film could delay oxidation and extend storage life. Therefore, the films prepared may provide guidelines for active packaging films that simultaneously with high mechanical and barrier properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aactive food packaging 3aactive ingredients 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3acrystals 3adrying 3aethanol 3afree radicals 3aguidelines 3alard 3alipids 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apackaging films 3apermeability 3apork 3aquercetin 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashelf life 3asuperoxide anion 3atensile strength 3awater vapor 0aActive packaging 0aMechanical properties 0aBarrier properties 0aNeedle-like crystal 0aQuercetin1 aFeng, Huiyan1 aMeng, Fansong1 aLi, Jian1 aWang, Lijuan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 266 p.121885-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1218853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010000169520138500269592002801654650000801682650001101690650001901701650001601720650001101736650002101747650002101768650001101789650001101800653004601811653002701857653003201884653002601916653002401942653002101966653000901987653000801996653000902004653000902013653000702022700001402029700001602043700001202059773009802071856008702169852000902256655001202265IND60753764320221117194532.0211213e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075376432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1180102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiaoqin10aOptimized design of a distributed photovoltaic system in a building with phase change materials  aBuilding decarbonization is one of the most important ways to stop or reverse climate change. Phase change materials (PCMs) were embedded into a building wall to reduce air conditioning energy consumption and related carbon emissions in this article. Moreover, a distributed photovoltaic (PV) system was designed to provide electricity for the building. The thermal and electrical performance of the building with four different amounts of PCMs and a PV system was simulated and compared with a building using PV system only. To validate the simulated results, an experimental apparatus for buildings with PCMs and a PV system was designed and constructed. Results show that the peak demand load is reduced by maximum of 47% using 5.2 vol% PCMs and shifted by one hour in summer. However, the demand load is 1.3% higher during daytime in winter. Three different optimizations were conducted with the aim of highest building self-balance and PV self-consumption as well as minimum interactions between buildings and grid. The economic benefits for the building with PCMs are higher because of the reduction of peak demand load. However, the payback period is 0.5 year longer for the building with PCMs than the reference building. The carbon emissions are reduced by 11.58 kg more using 5.2 vol% PCMs in a building with an area of 6.25 m², compared to the reference building.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aphase transition 3asolar collectors 3asummer 3awinter 0aDistributed photovoltaic power generation 0aPhase change materials 0aBuilding energy consumption 0aBuilding self-balance 0aPV self-consumption 0aCarbon emissions 0aBIPV 0aBSB 0aHDPE 0aPCMs 0aPV1 aLin, Yian1 aZhu, Ziyang1 aLi, Jie0 tApplied energy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 306 p.118010-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1180103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015000168300001600318500001900334520123400353592002801587650002101615650002201636650001201658650001401670650002301684653003201707653003101739653001701770653002101787653002401808700001801832700001701850700002601867700001801893700002001911773014401931856008102075852000902156655001202165IND60689310620221121023519.0200421e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068931062DNAL7 a10.1080/096374807016638542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖztürk, Ahmet,10aCross-sectional reference values for mid-upper arm circumference, triceps skinfold thickness and arm fat area of Turkish children and adolescents  ap. 267-281.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of the study was to establish cross-sectional reference values for the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), triceps skinfold thickness (TSF) and arm fat area (AFA) of Turkish children and adolescents. In total 5,553 students aged between 6 and 17 years were selected by a multistage sampling method from schools representing city centre, rural and urban areas of Kayseri, Central Anatolia. The MUAC and TSF were measured, and the arm muscle area, arm area, AFA and fat percentage (%) were calculated. The LMS method was employed to calculate the MUAC, TSF and AFA curve parameters. The MUAC, TSF, AFA and fat percentage in each age group were significantly higher in girls than in boys. In boys, the TSF 50th percentile ranged from 7.6 mm at 17 years to 9.0 mm at 11 years; whereas in girls this ranged from 9.4 mm at 6 years to 14.6 mm at 17 years. The MUAC 50th percentile ranged from 17.0 to 23.6 cm in boys, and from 15.6 cm to 20.9 cm in girls. The AFA 50th percentile measurements ranged from 4.5 cm at 6 years to 5.8 cm at 12–14 years in boys; and ranged from 7.2 cm at 6 years to 14.8 cm at 17 years in girls.

Because microbial processes are extremely sensitive to change in temperature below freezing, overwinter warming strongly stimulates decomposition and nutrient mineralization and ultimately promotes the conversion of sedge‐dominated tussock tundra into shrub tundra. We characterized the responses of decomposition in shrub tundra and tussock tundra soils to changes in the rate and extent of freezing using laboratory simulations to study a range of active layer freeze‐up scenarios that included variation in time held above 0°C (an acclimation period) and final temperature (−2°C to −20°C). We hypothesized that shrub soil decomposers would be more sensitive to the rate of the freezing process than tussock soil decomposers, but less sensitive to the extent of freezing. Although freezing strongly influenced microbial processes, the effects of freezing tended to not significantly vary across the range freezing regimes tested. Unexpectedly, the tussock‐derived soil decomposer community was more sensitive than shrub‐derived soil to the freezing treatments. Freezing conditions stimulated tussock soil to release more water‐extractable organic carbon (WEOC) that was composed of a greater proportion of microbially derived materials than shrub soil under the same conditions. Freezing‐driven changes in the tussock WEOC pool coincided with reduced microbial decomposer biomass, while the shrub decomposer biomass was relatively insensitive to the freezing treatments. These findings suggest that the microbial community of shrub‐dominated soils is more resistant to the soil freezing process than the tussock‐dominated decomposer community and increases available soil N while reducing labile C release as the soils freeze. Because autumn nutrient dynamics set the stage for overwinter tundra biogeochemical conditions, increasing shrub dominance in tussock tundra may therefore promote both plant N availability and decomposer C limitation during thaw.  aPublisher supplied data  aARC‐0902038cNational Science Foundation 3aacclimation 3aautumn 3abiomass 3aecosystems 3afreezing 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3aorganic carbon 3aplant communities 3ashrubs 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3atundra 3atundra soils 3awinter1 aSchaeffer, Sean1 aSchimel, Joshua P.0 tEcosphere.g2019 Feb., v. 10, no. 2 p.e02608-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.26083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009400170300001600264520059100280536064900871592002801520596007301548596009801621596012601719596015201845596016901997596008202166596008602248596007902334650001902413650001502432650001702447650001102464650001302475650002202488650003602510653001602546653004102562653002702603653003002630653002702660700001302687700001202700700001802712700001602730700001802746700001502764700001702779773014102796856008502937852000903022655001203031IND60666267620221121150121.0190917e20191003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066626762DNAL7 a10.1080/10286020.2018.14828812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Shi-Ming10aAnti-inflammatory diterpenes from the fruits of Vitex trifolia L. var. simplicifolia Cham  ap. 985-991.  aTwo new labdane-type diterpenes, named viterotulin C (1) and vitexilactone D (2), together with five known diterpenes (3–7), were isolated from the fruits of Vitex trifolia L. var. simplicifolia Cham.

One of the most significant challenges is that expensive catalysts prepared through complex processes are usually used. Herein, gram-scale cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) nanoparticles are prepared through a top-down ball-milling approach from low-priced 3C-SiC powders. This facile mechanical milling strategy ensures large-scale production of 3C-SiC nanoparticles with an amorphous silicon oxide (SiOₓ) shell and simultaneously induces abundant surface states. The surface states are demonstrated to trap the photogenerated carriers, thus remarkably enhancing the charge separation, while the thin SiOₓ shell prevents 3C-SiC from corrosion under visible light. The unique electronic structure of 3C-SiC tackles the challenge associated with low selectivity of photocatalytic CO₂ reduction to C₁ compounds. In conjugation with efficient water oxidation, 3C-SiC nanoparticles can reduce CO₂ into CH₄ with selectivity over 90%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acorrosion 3airradiation 3alight 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3asilica 3asilicon carbide 0aCO2 reduction 0a3C-SiC 0aselectivity 0aCH41 aSun, Jianwu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6403-37200 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Jan. 22, v. 13, no. 4 p.5073-5078dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c199453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012800168300001600296520185000312592002802162650001202190650001402202650002202216650001202238650001202250650000902262650002702271650002202298650001402320650001902334650001502353650001202368651001402380651001602394700001702410773012002427856008202547852000902629655001202638IND60439454220221120161542.0220202e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043945422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-005-9068-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFunk, Stephan M.10aPhylogeography of the endemic St. Lucia whiptail lizard Cnemidophorus vanzoi: Conservation genetics at the species boundary  ap. 651-663.  aVicariance and isolation leading to speciation of reptiles on islands is well exemplified in a number of taxa in the Caribbean. The St. Lucia whiptail (Cnemidophorus vanzoi), considered a single species, is found on two small islets (Maria Major and Maria Minor) off the main island of St. Lucia. From lizards collected from both localities, we gathered morphological measurements and analysed the genetic divergence between populations, using a molecular survey of ∼ ∼2800 mtDNA base pairs and 8 microsatellites. There are significant differences in body size and general form and fixed but small mtDNA differences between island populations. Microsatellites reveal low diversity within populations but very high differentiation between islands with non-overlapping allele size ranges at all except one microsatellite and two loci exhibiting single-base polymorphism, fixed between islands. Based on these results, we examine published criteria to determine whether the studied island forms could be considered true species. According to the phylogenetic species concept and Moritz’s evolutionary significant unit (ESU) criteria, the two lizard populations can be considered separate entities. Crandall et al.’s (2000, Trends Ecol. Evol., 15, 290–295) broader categorization of population distinctiveness, based on concepts of ecological and genetic exchangeability, produces conflicting results depending on the interpretation of the observed ecological data. Following Fraser and Bernatchez’s (2001, Mol. Ecol., 10, 2741–2752) framework for management decisions when ecological data are not sufficient we propose that the lizard populations on the Maria islands are on differing evolutionary trajectories and thus at the species boundary. The populations are of high priority to conservation, thus meriting separate management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abody size 3agenetic variation 3aislands 3alizards 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3apopulation 3asurveys 3aCaribbean 3aSaint Lucia1 aFa, Julia E.0 tConservation genetics.g2006 Oct., v. 7, no. 5 p.651-663dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870040x1566-06217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-005-9068-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03627naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245015800175300001800333520158800351592002801939650001301967650001801980650001001998650002102008650001202029650001002041650001402051650001602065650001202081650001402093650002002107650001602127650001702143650001002160650000902170650001002179650001602189650002802205653001002233653000902243653000802252653000702260653000702267653000802274653000802282653000902290653000802299653000802307653000902315653000802324653000702332653000802339653001302347653000802360653001402368653000802382653000802390653000802398653000802406653000802414653000802422653000702430653001702437653001502454653001302469653001702482653001002499653002002509700002302529700002502552700002302577773010302600856008502703852000902788655001202797IND60553314920221119084022.0161021e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055331492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuriancik, David M.10aHigh levels of fish oil enhance neutrophil development and activation and influence colon mucus barrier function in a genetically susceptible mouse model  ap. 1261-1272.  aDietary fatty acids influence immunologic homeostasis, but their effect on initiation of colitis, an immune-mediated disease, is not well established. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that high doses of dietary fish oil (FO) increased colon inflammation and dysplasia in a model of infection-induced colitis. In the current study, we assessed the effects of high-dose dietary FO, 6% by weight, on colon inflammation, neutrophil recruitment and function, and mucus layer integrity in a genetically susceptible, colitis-prone mouse model in the absence of infection. FO-fed SMAD3−/− mice had increased colon inflammation evidenced by increased numbers of systemic and local neutrophils and increased neutrophil chemoattractant and inflammatory cytokine gene expression in the colon. Mucus layer thickness in the cecum and goblet cell numbers in the cecum and colon in FO-fed mice were reduced compared to control. FO consumption affected colitis in male and female mice differently. Compared to female control mice, neutrophils from FO-fed female mice had reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon ex vivo stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate while FO-fed male mice produced increased ROS compared to control-fed male mice. In summary, dietary FO impaired mucus layer integrity and was associated with colon inflammation characterized by increased neutrophil numbers and altered neutrophil function. High-dose FO may have detrimental effects in populations genetically susceptible for inflammatory bowel disease and these effects may differ between males and females.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aanimal models 3acecum 3achemoattractants 3acolitis 3acolon 3acytokines 3adietary fat 3afemales 3afish oils 3agene expression 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3amales 3amice 3amucus 3aneutrophils 3areactive oxygen species 0aAPRIL 0aBAFF 0aDCF 0aCD 0aCt 0aCON 0aDHA 0aCdh1 0aEPA 0aFBS 0aFITC 0aIBD 0aIL 0aMUC 0an-3 PUFA 0aPNA 0aPen/Strep 0aPMA 0aPBS 0aROS 0aSEM 0aTGF 0aTNF 0aUC 0aInflammation 0aNeutrophil 0aFish oil 0aB lymphocyte 0aColon 0aMucosal barrier1 aComstock, Sarah S.1 aLangohr, Ingeborg M.1 aFenton, Jenifer I.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2015 Nov., v. 26 p.1261-1272dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02104naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009900167300001600266520095800282592002801240650003801268650001601306650001401322650001201336650002401348650002201372650002401394650002101418653003101439653003801470653003201508700002401540773008801564856008101652852000901733655001201742IND60584300020221121035708.0171024e20171110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058430002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2017.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanchal, Hardik10aNumerical validation of the liquid-phase decomposition mechanism of guanidinium azotetrazolate  ap. 209-213.  aThe objective of this work is to numerically validate a previously formulated detailed chemical kinetics mechanism for the liquid phase decomposition of guanidinium azotetrazolate (GzT). GzT is of keen interest to researchers because of its energetic properties therefore it is critical to thoroughly understand the chemistry involved in its decomposition. The present work is a step in this direction. The reaction mechanism used in the present model, which consists of 76 species and 107 elementary reactions along with their kinetic parameters, was compiled from two previously published works. Simulations of the mass loss in thermogravimetric analysis and heat flow in differential scanning calorimetry were carried out using a numerical model. Results of the simulations were found to match satisfactorily with those from the experiments. Critical pathways in the GzT reaction mechanism were also identified by carrying out a sensitivity analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aguanidinium 3aheat flow 3aliquids 3amathematical models 3areaction kinetics 3areaction mechanisms 3athermogravimetry 0aGuanidinium azotetrazolate 0aHigh nitrogen energetic materials 0aChemical kinetics mechanism1 aKumbhakarna, Neeraj0 tThermochimica acta.g2017 Nov. 10, v. 657 p.209-213dElsevier B.V.x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2017.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01986naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008100165300001600246520062600262592002800888650000800916650002200924650001200946650001300958650001300971650000900984650004300993650002101036650001201057650001001069651001001079653001001089653001701099653004301116653001501159700001801174700001801192700002201210700001501232700001901247700001901266700002101285773010701306856008201413852000901495655001201504IND60526332620221117232956.0190405e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052633262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2016.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuta, Shiro10aDevelopment of a LAMP marker of the Puroindoline a-D1b allele in bread wheat  ap. 264-266.  aGrain hardness of wheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most important characteristics for end-use properties.

In the LAMP method, Pina-D1b allele was easily detected using the simple NaOH extraction method and visualization of DNA amplification by hydroxynaphthol blue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aTriticum aestivum 3aalleles 3agenotype 3ahardness 3aloci 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3asodium hydroxide 3atexture 3awheat 3aJapan 0aWheat 0aPuroindoline 0aLoop-mediated isothermal amplification 0aDNA marker1 aTsuji, Takako1 aSuzuki, Ryoji1 aMatsumoto, Yūho,1 aIto, Kouji1 aKataoka, Kouji1 aKawara, Satomi1 aMiyake, Noriyuki0 tJournal of cereal science.g2016 May, v. 69 p.264-266dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2016.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245008500168300001800253500001900271520181600290592002802106650001502134650001902149650001102168650004402179650001002223650001402233650002102247650001802268700001602286700005502302700001802357773011902375856008702494852000902581655001202590IND60707700920221118181610.0200820e20200723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070770092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c016142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Feng10aAdsorption Behavior of CH₄, C₂H₆, and CO₂ on Moisture-Equilibrated Shale  ap. 9492-9497.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInvestigation on the influence of CO₂ on adsorption behavior of CH₄ and C₂H₆ in moisture-equilibrated shale is important for understanding the mechanism of CO₂ injection for shale gas recovery. In this study, the adsorption capacities of CH₄, C₂H₆, and CO₂ on shale samples are first compared using the thermogravimetric method. The low-field nuclear magnetic resonance technique is then used to investigate the influence of CO₂ on the behavior of adsorbed CH₄ and C₂H₆ on shale, and the performance of CO₂ introduction for CH₄ and C₂H₆ recovery is thus evaluated. Test results show that the adsorption capacity is measured in sequence of C₂H₆ > CO₂ > CH₄ for dry shale; interestingly, the adsorption capacity of CO₂ can be stronger than C₂H₆ on the moisture-equilibrated shale, indicating the potential of CO₂ for enhancing C₂H₆ recovery. On the basis of the NMR results, the T₂ spectrum decreases in the adsorbed CH₄ region for the dry and moisture-equilibrated shale samples after injecting CO₂. On the contrary, the T₂ spectrum of the adsorbed C₂H₆ is almost unchanged for the dry shale, while it decreases remarkably for the moisture-equilibrated sample, indicating the potential of CO₂ for enhancing C₂H₆ recovery for water saturated shale gas reservoirs. It is found that the recovery of CH₄ and C₂H₆ from the dry cores is always lower than that for the moisture-equilibrated shale cores, suggesting that the moisture content in shale is beneficial for shale gas recovery during CO₂ injection. This study inspires new understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of applying a CO₂ injection method for shale gas development; more importantly, it provides new strategies that could be employed for shale resource production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ashale 3ashale gas 3athermogravimetry 3awater content1 aLi, Tiantai1 aHuang, Xing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5537-21411 aDang, Hailong0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 July 23, v. 34, no. 8 p.9492-9497dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c016143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245009200203300001600295520131700311592002801628650001301656650001901669650001201688650002001700650001401720650001601734650001301750650003901763650002201802650001301824650001101837650001801848650001001866650002001876650001301896653002001909653002901929653003001958653001801988653000802006653000802014653000902022653000802031653000702039653000702046653000802053653000702061653000802068700001902076700001802095700005702113700002202170700002302192700002302215700005802238700002202296773010702318856008202425852000902507655001202516IND60526332820221117233123.0190405e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052633282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2016.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFares, Clara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9583-261610aIncreasing atmospheric CO2 modifies durum wheat grain quality and pasta cooking quality  ap. 245-251.  aThe present study focused on the quality traits of durum wheat grains (protein and content, gluten content, yellow pigment content), semolina (gluten index and yellow index) and pasta (firmness, yellow index, cooking time) obtained from 12 durum wheat genotypes grown under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration in an open field Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment. The aims were to evaluate the impact of elevated CO2 on durum wheat pasta making related traits as well as investigate genetic differences existing in a panel of old and modern cultivars. The protein content showed a not significant decrease (7%), the GC decreased significantly (13.3%), while the GI showed an increasing significant tendency (14%). The overall pasta quality (firmness and weight) worsened in ELE. Correlation between all traits and pasta firmness demonstrated that the decrease in pasta firmness under ELE was correlated with GPC and GC while it was not with the GI. All varieties, although to different extent, showed lower pasta firmness values compared to the ambient condition. Among the varieties tested, some were more sensitive than others to the increased atmospheric CO2 concentration, a finding that can be exploited by breeding for designing novel genotypes with lower sensitivity to increased atmospheric CO2.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3acarbon dioxide 3acooking 3acooking quality 3acultivars 3adurum wheat 3afirmness 3afree air carbon dioxide enrichment 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agluten 3agrain quality 3apasta 3aprotein content 3asemolina 0aFACE experiment 0aResponse to elevated CO2 0aDurum wheat grain quality 0aPasta quality 0aAMB 0aELE 0aFACE 0aGPC 0aGC 0aGI 0aYPC 0aYI 0aSDS1 aMenga, Valeria1 aBadeck, Franz1 aRizza, Fulvia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2933-54801 aMiglietta, Franco1 aZaldei, Alessandro1 aCodianni, Pasquale1 aIannucci, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2891-64351 aCattivelli, Luigi0 tJournal of cereal science.g2016 May, v. 69 p.245-251dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2016.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024003000121040001800151100006300169245010500232500002000337520131900357592002801676596005901704650001001763650002301773650001601796650002301812650001801835650001501853650001801868650001001886650001901896650001101915650002201926650001001948650002501958651001501983651002701998700002302025700001902048700001902067773010602086856007302192961001202265852000902277655001202286IND60632457520221121033339.0190314e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063245752DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.25732doi7 a10.1002/ecs2.25732chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKennedy, Maureen C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4670-330210aHow big is enough? Vegetation structure impacts effective fuel treatment width and forest resiliency  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFuel treatments are designed with multiple management goals, including improving suppression capacity and restoring the historical structure of dry forests. Fuelbreaks are a class of fuel treatment that remove fuels within a wide strip of land, with an overarching objective to reduce fire behavior and provide safe access for suppression. In an empirical analysis of shaded fuelbreaks that burned during the 2014 Bald Fire (15,950 ha on the Lassen National Forest, California, USA), we found that overall fire severity was reduced in the treated areas relative to untreated. A non‐linear mixed effects model estimates that the reduction was detected more than 400 m into the treated area, greater than the standard width of the prescribed fuelbreak. Both pre‐ and post‐fire species composition differed between treated and untreated forest, with few living stems remaining in the measured untreated areas. In the post‐fire treated area, we documented a mixed conifer forest dominated by larger diameter Pinus, implying that the fuelbreak did result in a more resilient post‐fire structure and composition. These results indicate that fuelbreak design may need to be wider than generally prescribed and that even during extreme fire conditions fuel treatments can result in resilient forest structures.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station 3aPinus 3aconiferous forests 3adry forests 3aempirical research 3afire behavior 3afire break 3afire severity 3afuels 3ahistoric sites 3amodels 3aspecies diversity 3astems 3avegetation structure 3aCalifornia 3aLassen National Forest1 aJohnson, Morris C.1 aFallon, Kendra1 aMayer, Deborah0 tEcosphere.g2019 Feb., v. 10, no. 2 p.e02573-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.25733Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle01927naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008800162500002200250520070200272592002800974650002101002650000901023650001501032650002001047650002101067650001301088650001801101653002301119653004801142653002201190653002401212653003201236700001301268700001401281700001701295700001401312700002501326773006401351856008101415852000901496655001201505IND60584300520221121022642.0171024s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058430052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2017.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Siyu12aA new evidence for the interaction between the two components in PANI/La composites  aPre-press version  aWe found a new way to prove the interaction between the two components in polyaniline (PANI-DTA)/La composites by studying the specific heat. It is firstly found that PANI-DTA has a phase transition peak at −50°C. The composites (PLa) have no phase transition at −50°C, so the thermal, magnetic and electrochemical properties are different from PANI-DTA. The heat capacities of the composites are higher than that of PANI-DTA and La complex. the magnetic field dependence of magnetization (M–H) curves of PANI-DTA and PLa-2 exhibit saturation magnetization and a hysteresis loop.

Moving beyond existing literature that pays more attention to environmental effects of industrial development, this paper focuses on how industrial development path changes due to environmental pollution. Using the data from Chinese Customs Trade Statistics (CCTS) which covers the export trade data of prefecture level cities in China during 2002–2006 and 2012 to 2016, this paper probes into the effect of air pollution on industrial dynamics. Econometric model and instrumental variable (IV) regression are used in empirical analysis given the potential endogeneity issue. Results suggest that the interaction term between air pollution and density is negatively related to new industries entry. It means that air pollution can reduce the effect of relatedness on industrial diversification and lead to path breaking. Further, a channel for how air pollution affects industrial dynamics is examined. In order to respond to air pollution, local government conducts environmental regulation to lower the negative influence of air pollution, which can lead to path breaking during industrial diversification process. Finally, this paper seeks to bridge two strands of literature: environmental economic geography and evolutionary economic geography.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3acities 3aeconometric models 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental law 3aexports 3ageography 3aindustrialization 3aindustry 3alocal government 3atrade statistics 3aChina 0aIndustrial dynamics 0aPath breaking 0aAir pollution 0aRegional response 0aEnvironmental regulation1 aZhu, Shengjun0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 20, v. 265 p.121917-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1219173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03563naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245007900165300001800244520169100262592002801953650001801981650002801999650001102027650002102038650001702059650002302076650002102099650001702120650001802137650001402155650002302169650001002192650001102202650000902213650001902222650001602241650002102257650001402278650001402292653000802306653000702314653000902321653000702330653000902337653000802346653000702354653000902361653001802370653002202388653001502410653002102425653002502446653002002471700001902491700002102510700001502531700001402546700001402560700001702574700001602591700001702607700002002624773010302644856008502747852000902832655001202841IND60553315320221119083801.0161021e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055331532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Yujie10aActivity of the antiestrogenic cajanin stilbene acid towards breast cancer  ap. 1273-1282.  aAntiestrogenic therapy is a mainstay for estrogen receptor (ERα)-positive breast cancer. Due to the development of resistance to established antihormones such as tamoxifen, novel compounds are required. The low abundant cajanin stilbene acid (CSA) recently isolated by us from Pigeon Pea (Cajanus cajan) has structural similarities with estrogen. We analyzed the cytotoxic and anticancer activity of CSA in ERα-positive and -negative human breast cancer cells in vitro, in vivo and in silico. CSA exerts anticancer and antiestrogenic activities towards ERα-positive breast cancer, and it showed cytotoxicity towards tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells, implying that CSA may be active against tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. CSA showed low cytotoxicity in ERα-negative breast tumor cells as expected. Comparable cytotoxicity was observed towards p53 negative MCF-7 cells, implying that CSA is effective independent of the p53 status. Xenografted MCF-7 cells in nude mice were better inhibited by CSA than by cyclophosphamide. Testing of 8 primary cell cultures derived from human breast cancer biopsies showed that cell cultures from ER-positive tumors were more sensitive than from ER-negative ones. Dose-dependent decrease in ERα protein levels was observed upon CSA treatment. Synergistic effect with tamoxifen was observed in terms of increased p53 protein level. CSA affected pathways related to p53, cancer and cell proliferation. Gene promoter analyses supported the ERα regulation. CSA bound to the same site as 17β-estradiol and tamoxifen on ERα. In conclusion, CSA exerts its anticancer effects in ERα-positive breast cancer cells by binding and inhibiting ERα.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCajanus cajan 3aantineoplastic activity 3abiopsy 3abreast neoplasms 3acell culture 3acell proliferation 3acyclophosphamide 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3aestradiol 3aestrogen receptors 3agenes 3ahumans 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3apigeon peas 3apromoter regions 3asynergism 3atamoxifen 0aCSA 0aE2 0aERα 0aPR 0aEREs 0aMRI 0aGA 0aESR1 0aBreast cancer 0aEstrogen receptor 0aMicroarray 0aPharmacogenomics 0aTamoxifen resistance 0aXenograft tumor1 aKadioglu, Onat1 aWiench, Benjamin1 aWei, Zuofu1 aWang, Wei1 aLuo, Meng1 aYang, Xiaohe1 aGu, Chengbo1 aZu, Yuangang1 aEfferth, Thomas0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2015 Nov., v. 26 p.1273-1282dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245015300201300001800354500001900372520146700391592002801858650002401886650002201910650001401932650001501946650001201961650001401973650002201987650001802009650001602027650001002043650001302053650002302066650001402089650002302103653002002126653002702146653002502173653002302198653002902221700002602250700002002276700002802296700005702324700002102381700005602402773013902458856007802597852000902675655001202684IND60726267020221119090608.0210203e20210125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072626702DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c200632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUthaman, Saji1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6387-751010aTumor Microenvironment-Regulating Immunosenescence-Independent Nanostimulant Synergizing with Near-Infrared Light Irradiation for Antitumor Immunity  ap. 4844-4852.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe combination of photothermal therapy (PTT) and toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated immunotherapy can elicit antitumor immunity and modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Unlike other TLRs, TLR-5 is a promising target for immune activation, as its expression is well-maintained even during immunosenescence. Here, we developed a unique tumor microenvironment-regulating immunosenescence-independent nanostimulant consisting of TLR-5 adjuvant Vibrio vulnificus flagellin B (FlaB) conjugated onto the surface to an IR 780-loaded hyaluronic acid-stearylamine (HIF) micelles. These HIF micelles induced immune-mediated cell death via PTT when irradiated with a near-infrared laser. In comparison with PTT alone, the combination of in situ-generated tumor-associated antigens produced during PTT and the immune adjuvant FlaB demonstrated enhanced vaccine-like properties and modulated the TME by suppressing immune-suppressive regulatory cells (Tregs) and increasing the fraction of CD103⁺ migratory dendritic cells, which are responsible for trafficking tumor antigens to draining lymph nodes (DLNs). This combinatorial strategy (i.e., applying a TLR-5 adjuvant targeted to immunosenescence-independent TLR-5 and the in situ photothermal generation of tumor-associated antigens) is a robust system for next-generation immunotherapy and could even be applied in elderly patients, thus broadening the clinical scope of immunotherapy strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptors 3aVibrio vulnificus 3aadjuvants 3acell death 3aelderly 3aflagellin 3aimmunosuppression 3aimmunotherapy 3airradiation 3alymph 3amicelles 3amigratory behavior 3aneoplasms 3aphotothermotherapy 0ain situ vaccine 0atumor microenvironment 0atoll-like receptor-5 0aantitumor immunity 0aimmunological cell death1 aPillarisetti, Shameer1 aHwang, Hye-suk,1 aMathew, Ansuja Pulickal1 aHuh, Kang Moo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2406-66591 aRhee, Joon Haeng1 aPark, In-Kyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1616-91530 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Jan. 25, v. 13, no. 4 p.4844-4852dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c200633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03557naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011500171520199400286592002802280650001202308650002502320650001902345650002102364650002302385650002602408650001402434650001902448650001102467650000902478650002402487650001602511650002302527650001802550651001002568653001202578653002402590653001802614653002502632653001602657653001302673700001702686700001302703700001802716700002202734700001802756700001402774700001902788773011302807856008602920852000903006655001203015IND60692630020221122055822.0201025e20200820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069263002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1219212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKan, Zheng-Rong10aTemperature and moisture driven changes in soil carbon sequestration and mineralization under biochar addition  aSequestering more carbon in soil is an effective approach to mitigate climate change. The temporal variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) that reflects its loss and accumulation potential is important to model SOC sequestration under climate change, but it is still poorly understood under biochar addition. To identify the temporal variability of SOC, induced by climate conditions (i.e. precipitation and temperature) under biochar addition, a field experiment with the biochar addition rates of 0 (CK), 1.8 (BL), 3.6 (BM), and 7.2 (BH) mega gram (Mg) ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ and a laboratory incubation under controlled conditions at 20, 40, and 70% moisture under 10 and 20 °C in CK and BH soils was conducted. The results showed that biochar addition increased average annual SOC sequestration rates by 31.8–47.8% (369.8–556.6 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹), and led to higher stock compared with CK. However, the annual sequestration rates of biochar addition showed a decreasing trend from 2014 (0.8–4.0 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) to 2018 (−7.1 to −3.5 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹), and BH had the lowest sequestration rate from 2017 to 2018 compared with CK. Because the coefficients of variation of SOC concentration under biochar addition (1.2–11.0%) were significantly higher than those of CK (0.8–2.9%), indicating that biochar enhanced the temporal variability of SOC. The incubation study also confirmed that higher temporal variability under biochar addition resulted from increased sensitivity of SOC mineralization to temperature at 0–10 cm and to moisture at 10–20 cm layer. The high temporal variability was not conducive to the rates of carbon inputs retention in soil, and BH decreased by 20.4% compared with CK. Therefore, higher temporal variability induced by biochar addition constrains the potential for SOC sequestration, and middle and low rates (1.8–3.6 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) of biochar addition are promising and cost-effective options in the North China Plain.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acost effectiveness 3afield experimentation 3amagnesium 3amineralization 3amodels 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3awater content 3aChina 0aBiochar 0aSoil organic carbon 0aSequestration 0aTemporal variability 0aTemperature 0aMoisture1 aLiu, Qiu-Yue1 aWu, Gong1 aMa, Shou-Tian1 aVirk, Ahmad Latif1 aQi, Jian-Ying1 aZhao, Xin1 aZhang, Hai-Lin0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 20, v. 265 p.121921-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1219213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011300172300001800285520160100303592002801904650000801932650003501940650001601975650002601991650002702017650002402044650001302068650001002081650001902091650001302110650001602123650001102139650002102150650001702171650002202188650000902210650002802219650001602247650003602263653002802299653001602327653001102343653001602354653001202370653002102382653000902403700001902412700001902431700002402450773010302474856008502577852000902662655001202671IND60553315520221119083639.0161021e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055331552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBagul, Pankaj K.10aResveratrol ameliorates cardiac oxidative stress in diabetes through deacetylation of NFkB-p65 and histone 3  ap. 1298-1307.  aResveratrol, a phytoalexin, has recently gained attention for protective effects against metabolic and cardiac diseases. The beneficial effects of resveratrol have been linked to sirtuin-1 (SIRT-1) activation. However, little is known about the effect of resveratrol in cardiac complications associated with diabetes. Here, we have demonstrated that resveratrol ameliorates cardiac hypertrophy, electrocardiographic abnormalities and oxidative stress in the fructose-fed diabetic rat heart. Mechanistic studies revealed that fructose feeding to Sprague–Dawley rats over a period of 8 weeks leads to cardiac hypertrophy and increased oxidative stress through increased activity of NADPH oxidase (NOX) and reactive oxygen species production. We found increased activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) p-65 along with decreased SIRT-1 activity in the diabetic heart. Resveratrol activates SIRT-1, which deacetylates NFkB-p65 at lysine 310 and histone 3 (H3) at lysine 9 position. SIRT1 activation leads to decreased binding of NFkB-p65 to DNA and attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and oxidative stress through reduced transcription of NADPH oxidase subunits. In vitro analysis also revealed that SIRT-1 activation by resveratrol is associated with decreased NFkB-p65 activity and NOX transcription. Similarly, knockdown or inhibition of SIRT1 in H9C2 cells increased acetylation of NFkB-p65 K310 and H3K9. Overall, our data demonstrated that SIRT-1 activation by resveratrol leads to deacetylation of both NFkB-p65 and H3, thereby attenuating cardiac oxidative stress and complications in diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aacetylation 3aanimal disease models 3adiabetic complications 3aelectrocardiography 3afructose 3aheart 3aheart diseases 3ahistones 3ahypertrophy 3alysine 3aoxidative stress 3aphytoalexins 3aprotective effect 3arats 3areactive oxygen species 3aresveratrol 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aDiabetic cardiomyopathy 0aAcetylation 0aSIRT-1 0aResveratrol 0aHistone 0aOxidative stress 0aNFkB1 aDeepthi, Nancy1 aSultana, Razia1 aBanerjee, Sanjay K.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2015 Nov., v. 26 p.1298-1307dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01725naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245017900176300001600355520057700371592002800948650001900976650001500995651001701010651001301027651001101040653002401051653002001075653001401095653002601109700002101135700002301156773008101179856008201260961001201342852000901354655001201363IND60520288920221119164212.0160519e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052028892DNAL7 a10.1515/mammalia-2012-00612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarbino, Guilherme S.T.10aSecond record of the pale brown ghost bat Diclidurus isabella (Thomas, 1920) (Chiroptera, Emballonuridae) from Brazil and range extension into southwestern Brazilian Amazonia  ap. 231-234.  aWe present a new record of Diclidurus isabella from Brazil and an updated distribution map of the species.

Lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) are demersal predators that trophically link nearshore rocky reefs with offshore pelagic habitats through consumption of pelagic fishes. We quantified lingcod habitat use and movement patterns to make inferences about the temporal and spatial conditions under which lingcod may acquire pelagic prey. Lingcod maintained small home ranges (21,272Â Â±Â 13,630Â m2) within a rocky reef in the San Juan Archipelago, Washington; eight of nine individuals used rocky habitat exclusively. Depths occupied by lingcod (0â50Â m) coincided with pelagic fish distribution on the rocky reef; however, diel patterns in lingcod activity varied inversely with occurrence of pelagic fishes on the reef. Our findings suggest that the pelagic subsidy to lingcod is not strongly mediated through directed off-reef foraging by lingcod.  aPublisher supplied data 3apelagic fish 3acommunity structure 3areefs 3aenergy transfer 3apredators 3asubsidies 3aforaging 3ahabitats 0aWashington1 aEssington, T.

However, only a limited number of transcription regulators and their target genes have been identified in the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has greatly impeded our understanding of its pathogenesis and virulence. In this study, we constructed a genome-wide transcription regulatory network of M. tuberculosis H37Rv using a high-throughput bacterial one-hybrid technique. A transcription factor skeleton network was derived on the basis of the identification of more than 5400 protein–DNA interactions. Our findings further highlight the regulatory mechanism of the mammalian cell entry 1 (mce1) module, which includes mce1R and the mce1 operon. Mce1R was linked to global negative regulation of cell growth, but was found to be positively regulated by the dormancy response regulator DevR. Expression of the mce1 operon was shown to be negatively regulated by the virulence regulator PhoP. These findings provide important new insights into the molecular mechanisms of several mce1 module-related hypervirulence phenotypes of the pathogen. Furthermore, a model of mce1 module-centered signal circuit for dormancy regulation in M. tuberculosis is proposed and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aanimal pathogens 3adormancy 3amammals 3amodels 3aoperon 3apathogenesis 3aphenotype 3aproteome 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranslation (genetics) 3avirulence 0aM. tuberculosis 0atranscription regulation network 0aMce1 0aDevR1 aCui, Tao1 aHe, Zheng-Guo0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2012 Sept. 07, v. 11, no. 9 p.4682-4692dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fpr30062333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012400170300001600294520133100310592002801641650002301669650002001692650001201712650001701724650003701741650002301778650001301801650002601814650001001840650001501850650001201865650001601877650001501893650001201908650002001920650001401940700002101954700001801975700002301993773012602016856008202142852000902224655001202233IND60439455020221120161546.0220202e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043945502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-005-9107-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakagawa, Shinichi10aInfluence of inbreeding depression on a lake population of Nymphoides peltata after restoration from the soil seed bank  ap. 705-716.  aThe negative effects of inbreeding depression on fragmented small populations are likely to be expressed more strongly after restoration efforts if regeneration processes have been highly restricted in degraded habitats. We examined the potential influences of inbreeding depression on a population of Nymphoides peltata (Menyanthaceae) restored from the remnant soil seed bank. A hand-pollination experiment demonstrated self-compatibility of a single remaining homostyle genet and significant inbreeding depression in selfed progeny, especially in parameters related to seedling growth ([Formula: see text]–0.6 for biomass, and [Formula: see text]–0.4 for relative growth rate). Our genetic analysis indicated that the presumed number of parents contributing to the current soil seed bank was only 2–8 genets and that a single sib-family dominated at each of three sampling sites. The results also showed that the selfed progeny of the homostyle genet were overwhelmingly dominant at two sites (86.8 and 94.7%). As a result, the growth performance of the seed bank seedlings was significantly reduced, to a level as low as that of the selfed progeny. Active restoration efforts to minimize the negative effects of the genetic bottleneck and continuous monitoring based on genetic and demographic study are recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNymphoides peltata 3aadverse effects 3abiomass 3aburied seeds 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agrowth performance 3ahabitats 3ainbreeding depression 3alakes 3amonitoring 3aparents 3apollination 3apopulation 3aprogeny 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings1 aWashitani, Izumi1 aUesugi, Ryuji1 aTsumura, Yoshihiko0 tConservation genetics.g2006 Oct., v. 7, no. 5 p.705-716dKluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl3870040x1566-06217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-005-9107-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245008500208300001800293500001900311520163100330592002801961650000801989650001401997650001302011650000902024650000902033650001102042650001302053650001202066650001402078650001502092700001202107700001702119700005702136700001802193700001902211700001802230700001902248700002402267700001902291773011902310856008702429852000902516655001202525IND60707701420221118180828.0200820e20200713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070770142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c016812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Junjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8142-829210aSite Trials and Demonstration of a Novel Pilot Ventilation Air Methane Mitigator  ap. 9885-9893.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVentilation air methane (VAM) mitigation has been challenging to the coal mining industry because (1) VAM represents the largest proportion of coal mine methane emissions, (2) its air volume flow rate is large and the methane concentration is dilute and variable, and (3) it is almost 100% moisture saturated, and contains dust. This paper presents a novel pilot-scale VAM mitigator (VAMMIT) with a newly structured regenerative bed consisting of honeycomb monolith ceramic blocks for VAM destruction. The bed is designed to process 0.5–1 N·m³/s ventilation air. For the first time, a series of site trials of the VAMMIT prototype unit using actual ventilation air (VA) with 0.25–1.0 vol % methane was successfully carried out at an Australian coal mine site. The site trial results showed that the VAMMIT unit was able to operate as a thermal flow reversal reactor and was self-sustainable at VAM concentrations between 0.3 and 1.0 vol %. The pressure drop across the regenerative bed was 853–923 Pa, implying the potential to significantly reduce the energy consumption and VAM abatement cost. Regardless of the inlet VAM concentrations, less than 0.02% CH₄ was measured in the flue gas. On average, over 96% of methane oxidation efficiency was achieved through the novel regenerative bed. The influence of dust on the mitigator’s performance was found negligible through a 2-week site trial with actual VA only. The VAMMIT unit is the first of its kind in the world, possessing significant advantages over other packed-bed mitigators in terms of no dust deposition, less footprint, and lower energy consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acatalysts 3aceramics 3acoal 3adust 3aenergy 3aflue gas 3amethane 3aoxidation 3aprototypes1 aSu, Shi1 aYu, Xinxiang1 aBae, Jun-Seok1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1518-33911 aJin, Yonggang1 aVillella, Alex1 aJara, Maurice1 aAshby, Michael1 aCunnington, Michael1 aLoney, Michael0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 July 13, v. 34, no. 8 p.9885-9893dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c016813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001200180245011700192300001600309506007600325520135700401592002801758506003701786650002901823650001201852650001501864650002601879650001201905650001301917650002001930650001301950650002401963650002901987650001502016650001402031653002402045653001002069653002002079653002802099653002202127700002302149700002202172700002402194700002402218773011602242856007502358852000902433655001202442IND60568266820221207121538.0170503e20130104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056826682DNAL7 a10.1021/pr300408v2doi7 aPMC37390592pmcid7 a231814312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yun10aNovel Phosphorylation Sites in the S. cerevisiae Cdc13 Protein Reveal New Targets for Telomere Length Regulation  ap. 316-327.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe S. cerevisiae Cdc13 is a multifunctional protein with key roles in regulation of telomerase, telomere end protection, and conventional telomere replication, all of which are cell cycle-regulated processes. Given that phosphorylation is a key mechanism for regulating protein function, we identified sites of phosphorylation using nano liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS). We also determined phosphorylation abundance on both wild type (WT) and a telomerase deficient form of Cdc13, encoded by the cdc13-2 allele, in both G1 phase cells, when telomerase is not active, and G2/M phase cells, when it is. We identified 21 sites of in vivo phosphorylation, of which only five had been reported previously. In contrast, phosphorylation of two in vitro targets of the ATM-like Tel1 kinase, S249 and S255, was not detected. This result helps resolve conflicting data on the importance of phosphorylation of these residues in telomerase recruitment. Multiple residues showed differences in their cell cycle pattern of modification. For example, phosphorylation of S314 was significantly higher in the G2/M compared to the G1 phase and in WT versus mutant Cdc13, and a S314D mutation negatively affected telomere length. Our findings provide new targets in a key telomerase regulatory protein for modulation of telomere dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalleles 3ainterphase 3aliquid chromatography 3amutants 3amutation 3aphosphorylation 3aproteome 3aregulatory proteins 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atelomerase 3atelomeres 0atelomere regulation 0aCdc13 0aphosphorylation 0aquantitative proteomics 0amass spectrometry1 aDiMaggio, Peter A.1 aPerlman, David H.1 aZakian, Virginia A.1 aGarcia, Benjamin A.0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2013 Jan. 04, v. 12, no. 1 p.316-327dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fpr300408v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245010600176500001900282520165300301592002801954650002601982650001602008650002002024650002102044650001102065650001802076650001802094650000902112650001002121650001702131650001402148650001202162650001502174650001402189650001402203650001002217650001302227650001402240650001602254653001802270653001802288653001602306653003902322700002802361700002102389700006502410700002502475700002602500773011002526856008502636852000902721655001202730IND60730706720221122040545.0210428e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073070672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1169052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro, Bárbara M.M.10aIngestion and effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles on Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the biological and nutritional characteristics of Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), an arthropod pest widely distributed in agricultural regions, after exposure to nano-CeO₂ via an artificial diet and to investigate the presence of cerium in the body of this insect through X-ray fluorescence mapping. Nano-CeO₂, micro-CeO₂, and Ce(NO₃)₃ were incorporated into the diet (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mg of Ce L⁻¹). Cerium was detected in caterpillars fed with diets containing nano-CeO₂ (1, 10 and 100 mg of Ce L⁻¹), micro-CeO₂ and Ce(NO₃)₃, and in feces of caterpillars from the first generation fed diets with nano-CeO₂ at 100 mg of Ce L⁻¹ as well. The results indicate that nano-CeO₂ caused negative effects on S. frugiperda. After it was consumed by the caterpillars, the nano-CeO₂ reduced up to 4.8% of the pupal weight and 60% of egg viability. Unlike what occurred with micro-CeO₂ and Ce(NO₃)₃, nano-CeO₂ negatively affected nutritional parameters of this insect, as consumption rate two times higher, increase of up to 80.8% of relative metabolic rate, reduction of up to 42.3% efficiency of conversion of ingested and 47.2% of digested food, and increase of up to 1.7% of metabolic cost and 8.7% of apparent digestibility. Cerium caused 6.8–16.9% pupal weight reduction in second generation specimens, even without the caterpillars having contact with the cerium via artificial diet. The results show the importance of new ecotoxicological studies with nano-CeO₂ for S. frugiperda in semi-field and field conditions to confirm the toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3aX-radiation 3aarthropod pests 3aartificial diets 3acerium 3adigestibility 3aecotoxicology 3aeggs 3afeces 3afluorescence 3aingestion 3ainsects 3ametabolism 3ananoceria 3apollution 3apupae 3atoxicity 3aviability 3aweight loss 0aNanomaterials 0aFall armyworm 0aBiotransfer 0aBiological and nutricional aspects1 aSantos-Rasera, Joyce R.1 aAlves, Dejane S.1 aMarucci, Rosangela C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9103-01031 aCarvalho, Geraldo A.1 aCarvalho, Hudson W.P.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 June 15, v. 279 p.116905-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1169053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03576naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016400167300001800331520150800349592002801857650002501885650001401910650001301924650001301937650001101950650002201961650001601983650002101999650002002020650001002040650001602050650001402066650001702080650001402097650002102111650002102132650004302153650000902196650001102205650002502216650002602241653000802267653000902275653000702284653000802291653000902299653000702308653000802315653000902323653000802332653000902340653000802349653000802357653000902365653002202374653002902396653001802425653001802443653002102461700002002482700001802502700001802520700001702538700001702555700001902572700001802591773010302609856008502712852000902797655001202806IND60553315720221119084002.0161021e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055331572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Kai On10aEffects of EGCG content in green tea extract on pharmacokinetics, oxidative status and expression of inflammatory and apoptotic genes in the rat ocular tissues  ap. 1357-1367.  aGreen tea extract (GTE) exerts antioxidative activities in ocular tissues of rats, but high levels of (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) can induce oxidative stress. In this study, pharmacokinetics, diurnal variation of oxidative status, antioxidation and transcription factors changes in ocular tissues of rats were investigated. Rats were fed intragastrically with GTE and catechin mixtures containing different amounts of EGCG. Plasma and various ocular tissues were taken for pharmacokinetic analysis, oxidation marker testings and gene expression assays. Effects of EGCG on ocular oxidation status were assessed by 8-isoprostane level and reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio. Oxidation, inflammation and apoptosis regulations in retina were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Epicatechin, epigallocatechin and EGCG were dominant in various ocular tissues except vitreous humor, where gallocatechin was predominant. Diurnal variation of oxidative status was found in some compartments. GTE caused oxidative stress increase in the plasma, aqueous humor, vitreous humor, cornea and retina but decrease in the lens and choroid–sclera. Catechins mixture containing half dose of EGCG lowered 8-isoprostane in the retina and lens. GTE treatment induced superoxide dismutase 1 and glutathione peroxidase-3 expressions but suppressed catalase in the retina. Our results reveal pro-oxidation of GTE with high EGCG content to the ocular tissues. Optimal EGCG level is needed for protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3acatalase 3acatechin 3acornea 3adiurnal variation 3aepicatechin 3aepigallocatechin 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglutathione 3agreen tea 3ainflammation 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3apharmacokinetics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3aretina 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription factors 0aAUC 0aCmax 0aEC 0aEGC 0aEGCG 0aGC 0aGCG 0aGPx3 0aGSH 0aGSSG 0aGTE 0aSOD 0aTmax 0aGreen tea extract 0aEpigallocatechin gallate 0aDosage effect 0aOcular tissue 0aOxidative stress1 aChan, Kwok Ping1 aYang, Ya Ping1 aQin, Yong Jie1 aLi, Wai Ying1 aChan, Sun On1 aWang, Chi Chiu1 aPang, Chi Pui0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2015 Nov., v. 26 p.1357-1367dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010600158300001600264500001900280520096000299592002801259650003001287650001801317650001601335650001901351650001001370650002001380650001301400650001701413653000801430653000901438653002101447700002001468773018201488856007401670852000901744655001201753IND60692054120221123031757.0200502e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069205412DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.68.5452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIWAKI, Tomoko12aA Set of loxP Marker Cassettes for Cre-mediated Multiple Gene Disruption in Schizosaccharomyces pombe  ap. 545-550.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFor functional analysis, the presence of gene families and isoenzymes often makes it necessary to delete more than one gene, while the number of marker genes is limited in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here we describe a loxP-flanked ura4 ⁺ cassette and Cre recombinase vector for a Cre-loxP-mediated marker removal procedure in S. pombe. This loxP-ura4-loxP cassette can be used for disruption of hmt1 ⁺ as a model target gene. We have constructed two vectors which express Cre recombinase under the control of the nmt1 or nmt41 promoter. Excisive recombination at loxP sites in the chromosome was promoted efficiently and accurately when the Cre recombinase was expressed under the control of the nmt41 promoter. In addition, ura4 ⁺ could be excised from the genome by Cre recombinase, when a single loxP site was adjacent to ura4. The use of the Cre-loxP system proved to be a practical strategy to excise a marker gene for repeated use in S. pombe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3abiotechnology 3achromosomes 3agene targeting 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aisozymes 3arecombinases 0aCre 0aloxP 0amarker recycling1 aTAKEGAWA, Kaoru0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2004 Jan. 1, v. 68, no. 3 p.545-550dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.68.5453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245011100174300001600285520166100301592002801962650001201990650001402002650001502016650001202031650002002043650001502063650002002078650001402098650001102112650001202123650001902135650001402154650001102168650001202179651002002191653001502211653001402226653002502240653002002265653003002285653002002315700001502335700001602350700001602366773008502382856008802467852000902555655001202564IND60562531020221121161008.0170208e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056253102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2015.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Hongxiang10aMethane seepage intensities traced by biomarker patterns in authigenic carbonates from the South China Sea  ap. 109-119.  aAuthigenic carbonate rocks from an active seep (Site F) located in the South China Sea (SCS) at a water depth of 1120m were studied using mineralogical and lipid biomarker analyses. Carbonate mineral compositions, in specific samples, were predominantly aragonite, high-Mg calcite (HMC), or a mixture of both. Abundant 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers diagnostic for archaea provide evidence that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), mediated by anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea (ANME) and their bacterial partners, are the major processes leading to formation of the carbonates. High Methane Index, dominance of ANME-2 assemblages and the predominant contribution of AOM-related biomarkers in the aragonitic carbonate point to the strong impact of AOM communities during its precipitation, which is likely caused by high seepage intensities. The relatively low Methane Index and abundant allochthonous input of the HMC carbonate are a result of the weak impact of AOM microbial communities under conditions of low methane seepage. Evidence for this interpretation also comes from relatively higher carbonate content, lesser contribution of allochthonous organic matter and lower pyrite content in the aragonitic carbonate than in the HMC carbonate. High concentrations of 13C-depleted hopanoids were observed in the aragonitic sample which may be a result of the intermittent presence of oxic conditions in an overall anoxic condition, possibly induced by changing seepage intensities. Our data suggests that lipid biomarkers in authigenic carbonate from seep sites can be helpful for improving assessments of the fluid dynamics in such a complex system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aaragonite 3abiomarkers 3acalcite 3acarbonate rocks 3acarbonates 3afluid mechanics 3ahopanoids 3alipids 3amethane 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3apyrite 3aseepage 3aSouth China Sea 0aBiomarkers 0aCold seep 0aAuthigenic carbonate 0aStable isotopes 0aMethane seepage intensity 0aSouth China Sea1 aFeng, Dong1 aWu, Nengyou1 aChen, Duofu0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2016 Jan., v. 91 p.109-119dElsevier Ltdx0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2015.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04100naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245011000211500001400321520190100335592002802236650002402264650001202288650001902300650001402319650001102333650002202344650001602366650001602382650001102398650001102409650001002420650001802430650001702448650001502465650001302480650000902493650001002502651001002512653000802522653000802530653001002538653000802548653001002556653000902566653000802575653001002583653000802593653001002601653000802611653000802619653000902627653000702636653000802643653000902651653000802660653000802668653001002676653000902686653000802695653000802703653000702711653000902718653000802727653000802735653001302743653000802756653000902764653000902773653000802782653000802790653001002798653000902808653000802817653003302825653001102858653001302869653001902882653002002901700001802921700002402939773010802963856008203071852000903153655001203162IND60725398120221121164453.0210215e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072539812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2021.1080762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Durgesh Singh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3896-152010aOzone flux-effect relationship for early and late sown Indian wheat cultivars: Growth, biomass, and yield  aNAL-light  aPrecise ozone (O₃) flux models remain helpful to identify the sensitivity of crops and their cultivars under high O₃ levels by assessing biomass and yield losses under natural climate and future O₃ levels. In this study, we have evaluated the effects of O₃ on growth, biomass, and yield of four Indian wheat cultivars by exposure-linked as well as through flux-effect relationship-based analysis using two years of empirical data. Early and late sown cultivars were exposed to ambient O₃ (AO₃) and elevated O₃ i.e., ambient+20 ppb (EO₃). The POD₆SPEC (species-specific phytotoxic O₃ dose above a threshold of 6 nmol m⁻² PLA s⁻¹) on flag leaves for each cultivar and treatment was derived by using DO₃SE (Deposition of Ozone for Stomatal Exchange) model. Above-ground biomass was reduced more in early sown cultivars (26.1 %) than late sown (21.3 %) because of the larger negative impacts on plant growth under EO₃ treatment. Loss of grain yield under EO₃ exposure was high in early sown cultivars (30.5 %) compared to late sown (23 %) due to high stomatal O₃ uptake during the O₃ exposure period. Based on model outputs, early sown cultivars showed higher accumulated POD₆SPEC (1.6–3.75 mmol O₃ m⁻²) compared to late sown cultivar (0.65 to 1.97 mmol m⁻²). A negative linear relationship was obtained in above-ground biomass and grain yield concerning POD₆SPEC. The relationship showed that 0.284 mmol O₃ m⁻² accumulated POD₆SPEC is responsible for a 5% reduction of grain yield in early sown cultivars, while 0.393 mmol O₃ m⁻² accumulation is required for a 5% reduction in yield of late sown cultivars. The results also suggest that O₃ flux-effect relationship could be a valuable tool for assessing and predicting the risk of O₃ on wheat cultivars in India and for crop productivity models for predicting climate change impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3adosage 3aexposure duration 3afield crops 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3amodels 3aozone 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant growth 3aprediction 3aresearch 3arisk 3awheat 3aIndia 0aAGB 0aAGR 0aANOVA 0aAO3 0aAOT40 0aAsat 0aDAG 0aDO3SE 0aEO3 0aEOTCP 0aFst 0aGHG 0agmax 0ags 0aIGP 0aJmax 0aLAR 0aNAR 0aNCLAN 0aNFCs 0aNOx 0aNPK 0aO3 0aOTCs 0aPAR 0aPLA 0aPOD6SPEC 0aPOD 0aPODy 0aRAGB 0aRGR 0aRGY 0aVcmax 0aVOCs 0aVPD 0aO3 flux-effect relationships 0aGrowth 0aPOD6SPEC 0aO3 sensitivity 0aWheat cultivars1 aAgrawal, S.B.1 aAgrawal, Madhoolika0 tField crops research.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 263 p.108076-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.1080763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245011800158300001600276520142700292592002801719650002301747650001601770650001101786650002201797650001101819650002401830650001001854650002101864650002401885650002401909650003701933650002101970650001201991650001202003650002902015653002002044653001202064653001202076653000902088653001802097653001202115700002002127700002002147700001302167700002202180700001902202773012602221856007602347852000902423655001202432IND60517141420221122054550.0160328e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051714142DNAL7 a10.4141/cjps2012-3122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, De-Long10aIdentification of cotton SKP1-like gene GhSKP1 and its function in seed germination and taproot growth in tobacco  ap. 817-825.  aHu, D-L., Chen, Q-Z., Zhang, C-J., Wang, Y., Zhang, B-J. and Tang, C-M. 2013. Identification of cottonSKP1-like geneGhSKP1and its function in seed germination and taproot growth in tobacco. Can. J. Plant Sci. 93: 817–825. The SKP1 (S-phase kinase-associated-protein1) protein, a key component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, has been reported to play many important roles in many organisms, including regulation of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, seed germination, taproot growth and auxin signaling, though no study of this gene in cotton has been performed. In this study, a SKP1 gene was isolated from upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method and was named Gossypium hirsutumSKP1 (GhSKP1). The cDNA sequence of GhSKP1 was 813 bp containing a 474 bp open reading frame, encoding a protein of 156 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 17.63 kDa. The deduced amino acid of GhSKP1 had a conserved SKP1 domain. GhSKP1 expression was tested in all organs of cotton plants, and the strongest expression was observed in stamens and radicles that have actively dividing cells. Overexpression of the full-length GhSKP1 cDNA in tobacco caused delayed seed germination and shortened taproots. Our results suggest that the presence of functional conservation between GhSKP1 and SKP1 in plant developmental processes may exist.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aamino acids 3aauxins 3acomplementary DNA 3acotton 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3amolecular weight 3aopen reading frames 3aprotein degradation 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3aseed germination 3astamens 3atobacco 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 0aGene expression 0aGhSKP1i 0ahormone 0aSKP1 0aupland cotton 0atobacco1 aChen, Quan-Zhan1 aZhang, Chao-Jun1 aWang, Ye1 aZhang, Bian-Jiang1 aTang, Can-Ming0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2013 Sept., v. 93, no. 5 p.817-825dAgricultural Institute of Canadax1918-18337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjps2012-3123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245010400160300001800264520129100282592002801573650001801601650001201619650001701631650001401648700002001662700005701682773014701739856007601886852000901962655001201971IND60603307920221122060025.0180713e20180212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060330792DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b126632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBing, Tan Yan10aLigand-to-Ligand Interactions That Direct Formation of D2-Symmetrical Alternating Circular Helicate  ap. 3683-3689.  aThis work demonstrates that ligand-to-ligand interactions between achiral bis-β-diketonate (BTP) and chiral bis(4-phenyl-2-oxazolinyl)pyridine [(R)- or (S)-Ph-Pybox] are successfully directed to the fabrication of a D₂-symmetrical alternating circular helicate with the general formula [(R)- or (S)-Ph-Pybox]₄(Lnᴵᴵᴵ)₄(BTP)₆. The lanthanide(III) Lnᴵᴵᴵ assemblies (Lnᴵᴵᴵ₄-RRRR and Lnᴵᴵᴵ₄-SSSS) have a nanometer-size squarelike grid (interatomic distances > 10 Å). X-ray structure analysis revealed that the circular helicate contains two double helicate Lnᴵᴵᴵ₂L₂ units, where both show (M)-helicity for Lnᴵᴵᴵ₄-RRRR and (P)-helicity for Lnᴵᴵᴵ₄-SSSS, where π–π stacking interaction is present between the side arm of (R)-Ph-Pybox (Ph₁) and the adjacent BTP ligand around the Euᴵᴵᴵ metal center (dππ = 3.636 Å: the diketonate plane···Ph₁ distance). The newly obtained circular lanthanide(III) helicate exists as single and homochiral diastereomers in solution (Lnᴵᴵᴵ₄-RRRR and Lnᴵᴵᴵ₄-SSSS), exhibiting circularly dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Conversely, the circular helicate favors the heterochiral arrangement (i.e., Lnᴵᴵᴵ₄-RRRR/Lnᴵᴵᴵ₄-SSSS).  aPublisher supplied data 3adiastereomers 3aligands 3aluminescence 3apyridines1 aKawai, Tsuyoshi1 aYuasa, Junpei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1117-79040 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Feb. 12, v. 140, no. 10 p.3683-3689dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b126633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01827naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010900167300001600276520074500292592002801037650002801065650002501093650001101118650001101129653001501140653002801155653003401183653001901217700001801236700001601254773012501270856008501395852000901480655001201489IND60541216320221119215046.0190318e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054121632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2015.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaundy, B.J.10aExtracting the parameters of the single-dispersion Cole bioimpedance model using a magnitude-only method  ap. 153-157.  aAffordable and portable indirect impedance measurement techniques with minimum hardware and post-processing requirements are necessary for various applications, and in particular for bioimpedance measurements.

An empirical analysis in dolichos bean [Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet var.

It is hypothesized that in a given location, genotypes’ multi-year performance are more predictive of their performance in the next/future years. However, only a few researchers have examined this hypothesis. To test this hypothesis, we predicted genotypes’ present-year’s performance based on their previous 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-years’ performance using fresh pod yield data from 53 dolichos bean genotypes evaluated across 5 years. We used two statistics, namely yield relative to environment (year) maximum (YREM) and best linear unbiased predictors (BLUP) as measures of genotypes’ performance for fresh pod yield in dolichos bean. Correlation coefficients of genotypes’ present-year’s performance with previous 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-years’ performance were used as measures of predictive power. The results of our study provided adequate evidence to show that that single-year dolichos bean genotypes’ YREM and BLUP have sufficient power to predict their future 1-year/multiple-years’ performance and to identify superior genotypes.

We examined the effect of a graded dose of TA on the absorption of Fe and compared with that of zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and manganese (Mn) in rats. We also investigated the effect of TA on cecal fermentation which plays a role in absorption. In Experiment 1, to set the optimum dose of Fe, male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 70–90 g) after acclimatization were fed with different levels of dietary Fe (5, 10, 20, 30 and 35 mg/kg). We observed that the hematocrit (Ht), serum Fe concentration and transferrin saturation (%) were each reduced in those rats fed less than 20 mg/kg Fe in a dose-dependant manner. In Experiment 2, the rats were fed with test diets containing the minimum required level of Fe, 30 mg/kg diet, with (5, 10, 15 and 20 g/kg diet) or without TA for a period of three weeks. Feeding a diet containing more than 10 g TA/kg diet, but not 5 g TA/kg diet, reduced the hemoglobin concentration (Hb), Ht and serum Fe concentration due to decreased Fe absorption. In contrast, the Zn, Cu and Mn absorption was not affected by TA feeding. It is also demonstrated that liver Fe, but not the Zn, Cu and Mn contents, were lower in the TA groups than in the TA-free control group. Feeding TA slightly decreased the pH value of the cecal contents with an increase in the major short-chain fatty acid pool. About 15% of the ingested TA were recovered in the feces of each TA-fed group. Our results demonstrate that more than 10 g TA/kg diet induced anemia by reducing the Fe absorption, although there was no effect on the absorption of other important trace minerals. Our findings suggest that the usual intake of polyphenols is relatively safe, but that a high intake by supplementation or by dietary habit of tannin affects only the Fe level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacclimation 3aanemia 3abiotechnology 3ablood serum 3acopper 3aeating habits 3afeces 3afermentation 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3airon 3aliver 3amales 3amanganese 3apH 3apolyphenols 3ashort chain fatty acids 3atannins 3atransferrin 3azinc 0atannic acid 0amineral element 0aintestinal absorption1 aSHIGA, Kazuki1 aISHIZUKA, Satoshi1 aHara, Hiroshi,0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2004 Jan. 1, v. 68, no. 3 p.584-592dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.68.5843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03763naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012900166300001800295520171400313592002802027596004502055596006502100596006502165596007302230596006902303650002102372650002002393650001502413650001302428650002302441650001402464650001202478650002202490650001102512650001302523650001402536650001802550650001402568650001202582650001102594650004202605650001602647700002202663700003102685700002602716700001302742700006102755700006202816700007102878773013602949856008203085961000903167852000903176655001203185IND60730896120221120063316.0210313e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073089612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-020-01076-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Dongying10aValSten: a new wild species derived allotetraploid for increasing genetic diversity of the peanut crop (Arachis hypogaea L.)  ap. 1471-1485.  aIntrogression of desirable traits from wild relatives plays an important role in crop improvement, as wild species have important characters such as high resistance to pests and pathogens. However, use of wild peanut relatives is challenging because almost all wild species are diploid and sexually incompatible with cultivated peanut, which is tetraploid (AABB genome type; 2n = 4x = 40). To overcome the ploidy barrier, we used 2 wild species to make a tetraploid with the same allotetraploid genome composition as cultivated peanut. Crosses were made between 2 diploid wild species, Arachis valida Krapov. and W.C. Greg. (BB genome; 2n = 2x = 20) and Arachis stenosperma Krapov. and W.C. Greg. (AA genome; 2n = 2x = 20). Cuttings from the diploid F₁ AB hybrid were treated with colchicine to induce chromosome doubling thus generating an induced allotetraploid. Chromosome counts confirmed polyploidy (AABB genome; 2n = 4x = 40). We named the new allotetraploid ValSten. Plants had well-developed fertile pollen, produced abundant seed and were sexually compatible with cultivated peanut. ValSten exhibits the same high resistance to early and late leaf spot and rust as its diploid parents. Notably, we observed morphological variations, including flower width and branch angles in the earliest generation (S₀) of allotetraploids. A SNP array was used to genotype 47 S₀ allotetraploids. The great majority of markers showed the additive allelic state from both parents (AABB). However, some loci were AAAA or BBBB, indicating homeologous recombination. ValSten provides a new, vigorous, highly fertile, disease resistant germplasm for peanut research and improvement.  aPublisher supplied data  aMCB-1543922cNational Science Foundation  a2018-67013-28139cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  aPeanut FoundationcUniversity of Georgia Research Foundation  aGeorgia Peanut CommissioncUniversity of Georgia Research Foundation  aNational Peanut BoardcUniversity of Georgia Research Foundation 3aArachis hypogaea 3aallotetraploidy 3acolchicine 3adiploidy 3adisease resistance 3aevolution 3aflowers 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3aintrogression 3aleaf spot 3apeanuts 3apollen 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism arrays 3atetraploidy1 aAraujo, Ana C.

This work establishes the benefits of combining nanotubular TiO₂ with conductive graphene to achieve a significant enhancement in capacitive energy storage. The TiO₂ nanotubes possess a porous structure and a higher surface area compared with its bulk material. The graphene sheets play an important role in the conductive substrate for charge collection. In the preparation process, amorphous TiO₂ colloids coated on graphene oxide (GO) sheets serve as the seeds to realize the growth of nanotubes, and ensure the robust contact between graphene and TiO₂ nanotubes to benefit charge transfer. When used as anodes for lithium ion batteries, the graphene–TiO₂ nanotubes (Gr–TNTs) manifest excellent rate capability and cycling performance, indicating that the nanotubes, graphene and their synergistic effect can prompt fast charge transfer in such a composite structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acolloids 3aenergy 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3alithium batteries 3ananotubes 3aseeds 3asurface area 3asynergism 3atitanium dioxide1 aLiu, Zhanqiang1 aLü, Xujie1 aWang, Baofeng1 aHuang, Fuqiang0 tRSC advances.g2014 Aug. 19, v. 4, no. 68 p.36372-36376dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra05027d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245019300170300001600363500001500379520168200394592002802076650002302104650002202127650002502149650002502174650001902199650001002218650001702228650001002245650001802255650002702273650002002300651001102320653002902331700002802360700003502388700002102423700001702444773011102461856004802572852000902620655001202629IND4479422420221122033234.0120416e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447942242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-011-9704-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanckaert, Isabelle10aEthnobotanical, morphological, phytochemical and molecular evidence for the incipient domestication of Epazote (Chenopodium ambrosioides L.: Chenopodiaceae) in a semi-arid region of Mexico  ap. 557-573.  a2019-12-06  aUse and management of wild and weedy species may involve artificial selection, which can determine morphological, physiological, reproductive, and genetic divergences between wild and managed populations, resulting in the initial or incipient phases of plant domestication. In this study we combined ethnobotanical, morphological, phytochemical and genetic information for analyzing differences between managed and unmanaged populations of the Mexican edible weed, Epazote (Chenopodium ambrosioides L.), in Santa María Tecomavaca, Oaxaca, a rural community within the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. Our hypothesis was that differences in morphology (e.g. leave dimensions and density of pubescence), phytochemistry (e.g. flavor, odor, and amount of strong scented and toxic compounds) and/or molecular genetic markers, between managed and wild populations of Epazote in Santa María Tecomavaca, would indicate that managed populations have been and/or are under a process of incipient domestication. Our results revealed the existence in the study area of morphological variants associated with a gradient of management intensity, which involved apparent improved palatability correlated with a lowering of chemical defense. Most remarkably, we found agreement in the groupings defined by the cluster analyses of morphological and genetic data. Although Epazote is considered a weed or, at best, a minor crop, the results from four lines of evidence (cultural differentiation patterns, gigantism, reduction in chemical defenses, toxic compounds and inheritance of adaptive traits) suggest the existence of an incipient domestication process in the study zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant biochemistry 3arural communities 3acultural differences 3aartificial selection 3asemiarid zones 3aweeds 3apalatability 3aodors 3adomestication 3aDysphania ambrosioides 3agenetic markers 3aMexico 0aChenopodium ambrosioides1 aParedes-Flores, Martín1 aEspinosa-García, Francisco J.1 aPiñero, Daniel,1 aLira, Rafael0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2012 Apr., v. 59, no. 4 p.557-573dSpringer-Verlagx0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-011-9704-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245013500165520152700300592002801827650001501855650001901870650002101889650001701910650001801927650001601945650002301961650001701984650002202001650001002023650001202033650002302045650002202068650002402090650002702114650001602141651001002157700002602167700003002193700002702223773012702250856007402377852000902451655001202460IND60652563620221120025106.0190713e20180809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065256362DNAL7 a10.3390/su100828382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez Neira, David,10aEnergy Assessment of Pastoral Dairy Goat Husbandry from an Agroecological Economics Perspective. A Case Study in Andalusia (Spain)  aThis paper presents a methodological proposal of new energy sustainability indicators according to a novel accounting that follows agroecological and ecological economics criteria. Energy output is reformulated to include manure and thus consider the contribution to fertilization made by pastoral livestock farming to agroecosystems. Energy inputs calculations include the grazing resources. These new definitions and calculations allow for new formulations of the energy return on investment (EROI) as measures of the energy efficiency of livestock farming systems (final EROI and food/feed EROI). The environmental benefit of manure is estimated from the avoided energy cost of using this alternative to inorganic fertilizers (AEC<inf>M</inf>). The environmental benefit of grazing is measured through the energy cost of avoiding cultivated animal feed (AEC<inf>P</inf>) and its impact in terms of non-utilized agricultural area (ALC<inf>P</inf>). The comparative analysis of different livestock breeding systems in three pastoral dairy goat farms in the Sierra de C&aacute;diz in Andalusia, southern Spain, reveals the analytical potential of the new energy sustainability indicators proposed, as well as the potential environmental benefits derived from territorial-based stockbreeding and, more specifically, grazing activities. Those benefits include gains in energy efficiency, a reduction of the dependence on non-renewable energy, and environmental costs avoided in terms of energy in extensive pastoral systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3aagroecosystems 3aanimal husbandry 3acase studies 3adairy farming 3adairy goats 3aecosystem services 3aenergy costs 3aenergy efficiency 3afeeds 3agrazing 3alivestock breeding 3alivestock farming 3amineral fertilizers 3anonrenewable resources 3apastoralism 3aSpain1 aSoler Montiel, Marta,1 aGutiérrez-Peña, Rosario1 aMena-Guerrero, Yolanda0 tSustainability.g2018 Aug. 09, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100828383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245014300171300001600314520104900330592002801379650001201407650001301419650002501432650001801457650002001475650001601495650001201511650002301523650001701546650001401563650002301577650001601600651001001616653002701626653001101653653001001664653001101674700001901685700002201704700002601726700001501752700001701767700002301784773010901807856008201916852000901998655001202007IND60621453020221122115158.0181117s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062145302DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826504025003012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevinson, F.

The original 1971 study had found a high prevalence of mortality and malnutrition and the worst gender difference in nutritional status ever recorded in an Indian study. The 2001 follow-up study found dramatic reductions in child mortality, child malnutrition, gender-based imbalances in child well-being and care, and family size, the result of participatory economic growth coupled with broad-based educational, health, and family-planning services. Despite overall improvements in caloric intake, however, 40% of lower-class children in 2001 were still consuming less than 50% of their caloric allowance. With minimal gender-based abortion and significantly reduced neglect and mortality of female children, gender balance among children in this area of rural Punjab improved markedly over the 30-year period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorinda 3achildren 3aeconomic development 3aenergy intake 3afamily planning 3afamily size 3afemales 3agender differences 3amalnutrition 3amortality 3anutritional status 3arural areas 3aIndia 0aChildhood malnutrition 0agender 0aIndia 0aPunjab1 aMehra, Sucheta1 aLevinson, Dorothy1 aChauhan, Anita Kumari1 aKoppe, Guy1 aBence, Brian1 aAlmedom, Astier M.0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 25, no. 3 p.221-227dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826504025003013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012000171520101100291592002801302650002301330650002501353650002201378650001601400650001001416650001801426650001901444650001701463650001801480650001901498650001301517650002501530653001501555653002301570653001201593653002001605653002201625653001701647700002301664700002401687700007001711773010801781856008601889852000901975655001201984IND60730479720221119102147.0220606e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073047972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1179052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemeyer, Salita10aDevelopment of mangiferin loaded chitosan-silica hybrid scaffolds: Physicochemical and bioactivity characterization  aDevelopment of hybrid materials with molecular structure of organic-inorganic co-network is a promising method to enhance the stability and mechanical properties of biopolymers. Chitosan-silica hybrid nanocomposite scaffolds loaded with mangiferin, a plant-derived active compound possessing several bioactivities, were fabricated using the sol-gel synthesis and the freeze-drying processes. Investigation on the physicochemical and mechanical properties of the fabricated scaffolds showed that their properties can be improved and tailored by the formation of 3-dimensional crosslinked network and the addition of ZnO nanoparticles. The scaffolds possessed porosity, fluid uptake, morphology, thermal properties and mechanical strength suitable for bone tissue engineering application. Investigation on the biomineralization and cell viability indicated that the inclusion of bioactive mangiferin further promote potential use of the hybrid nanocomposite scaffolds in guided bone regeneration application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3abioactive properties 3abiomineralization 3abiopolymers 3abones 3acarbohydrates 3acell viability 3acrosslinking 3afreeze drying 3ananocomposites 3aporosity 3astrength (mechanics) 0aMangiferin 0aChitosan composite 0aSol-gel 0aHybrid material 0aBone regeneration 0aCytotoxicity1 aAthipornchai, Anan1 aPabunrueang, Pariya1 aTrakulsujaritchok, Thanida1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0404-46520 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 June 01, v. 261 p.117905-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1179053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245009800165520162100263592002801884650001101912650001601923650001901939650001401958650000901972650001501981650002101996650001102017650001302028650002902041650001302070650002202083650001802105650001302123650002102136650001402157650001402171650003002185650001002215650002502225650001102250700002102261700002102282700002602303700002402329700001602353700001602369700001902385700002102404700002802425773012702453856007402580852000902654655001202663IND60652563820221120021905.0190713e20180810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065256382DNAL7 a10.3390/su100828402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGnanaraj, Joseph  S.10aSustainable Waste Tire Derived Carbon Material as a Potential Anode for Lithium-Ion Batteries  aThe rapidly growing automobile industry increases the accumulation of end-of-life tires each year throughout the world. Waste tires lead to increased environmental issues and lasting resource problems. Recycling hazardous wastes to produce value-added products is becoming essential for the sustainable progress of society. A patented sulfonation process followed by pyrolysis at 1100 &deg;C in a nitrogen atmosphere was used to produce carbon material from these tires and utilized as an anode in lithium-ion batteries. The combustion of the volatiles released in waste tire pyrolysis produces lower fossil CO<inf>2</inf> emissions per unit of energy (136.51 gCO<inf>2</inf>/kW&middot;h) compared to other conventional fossil fuels such as coal or fuel&ndash;oil, usually used in power generation. The strategy used in this research may be applied to other rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, catalysts, and other electrochemical devices. The Raman vibrational spectra observed on these carbons show a graphitic carbon with significant disorder structure. Further, structural studies reveal a unique disordered carbon nanostructure with a higher interlayer distance of 4.5 &Aring; compared to 3.43 &Aring; in the commercial graphite. The carbon material derived from tires was used as an anode in lithium-ion batteries exhibited a reversible capacity of 360 mAh/g at C/3. However, the reversible capacity increased to 432 mAh/g at C/10 when this carbon particle was coated with a thin layer of carbon. A novel strategy of prelithiation applied for improving the first cycle efficiency to 94% is also presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3aautomobiles 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acoal 3acombustion 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3agraphene 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aindustry 3alithium batteries 3ananomaterials 3anitrogen 3apower generation 3apyrolysis 3arecycling 3asustainable manufacturing 3atires 3avalue-added products 3awastes1 aLee, Richard J.,1 aLevine, Alan M.,1 aWistrom, Jonathan  L.1 aWistrom, Skyler  L.1 aLi, Yunchao1 aLi, Jianlin1 aAkato, Kokouvi1 aNaskar, Amit K.,1 aParanthaman, M.

XRD, FE-SEM, EDS, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were used to characterize the samples. The results show that the CdMoO₄:Ln³⁺ can be directly indexed to the tetragonal CdMoO₄ phase with high purity. The influence of the reaction time and reactants on the size and shapes of the CdMoO₄ microspheres has been studied, and the results revealed that the ultrasonication time and reactants play a crucial role in determining the final morphologies of the samples. Additionally, the PL properties of the CdMoO₄ and CdMoO₄:Ln³⁺ (Ln = Pr, Sm, Eu, Dy, Ho and Er) microspheres were investigated in detail. It can be seen that the CdMoO₄:Pr³⁺, Sm³⁺, Eu³⁺, Dy³⁺, Ho³⁺ and Er³⁺ samples are located in the red, yellow, red, white, yellow and green regions, respectively. Simultaneously, this novel and efficient pathway could open new opportunities for further investigating the properties of molybdate materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3adysprosium 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aerbium 3aeuropium 3aholmium 3amicroparticles 3amolybdates 3aoptical properties 3aphotoluminescence 3asamarium 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3aultrasonic treatment1 aZhang, Nannan1 aZou, Lianchun1 aGan, Shucai0 tRSC advances.g2014 Aug. 27, v. 4, no. 72 p.38455-38465dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra05038j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03571naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245008600176300001600262520208000278592002802358650002202386650002502408650001802433650002102451650001202472650001502484650001202499650001602511650001902527650001302546650002602559650001102585650001702596650002302613650001402636650000902650650002202659650002002681650001002701650001002711653001402721653003802735653001602773653002202789700006002811773008502871856008802956852000903044655001203053IND60562531720221121161102.0170208e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056253172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2016.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOakes, Abigail M.10aTemporal variations in the δD of leaf n-alkanes from four riparian plant species  ap. 122-130.  aThe hydrogen isotopic composition of terrestrial plant leaf waxes is widely used as a proxy for the isotopic composition of ambient water at the time of plant growth, yet there is considerable uncertainty about how environmental or plant-specific factors impact apparent hydrogen isotope fractionation. We sampled leaves from four riparian plant species (Pinus strobus, Tsuga canadensis, Phalaris arundinacea and Corylus americana) during the 2013 growing season (April to October) to evaluate the controls of hydrogen isotope fractionation in plant-derived n-alkanes. Our data show that plants from different taxonomic classes produce distinct seasonal patterns of isotopic change that could reflect differences in stomatal regulation, soil versus groundwater uptake and timescales of wax synthesis. These patterns are distinct even for plants from the same functional group (i.e. angiosperms versus gymnosperms). P. strobus (gymnosperm tree) and P. arundinacea (angiosperm grass) are characterized by a significant increase in apparent fractionation during the growing season (>50‰ change). In contrast, n-alkanes from C. americana (angiosperm) show a decrease in ε value from −145±8‰ during early season growth to −111±6‰ late in the season. T. canadensis (gymnosperm) exhibits a constant ε of −123±10‰ throughout the growing season with minimal temporal change. Sedimentary n-alkanes collected from the stream channel adjacent to our plant sample locality show minor changes over the sampling period with a mean ε value of −130±6‰. Apparent fractionation differences between plant species greatly exceed variations in stream composition throughout the growing season, indicating that differences in the timing of wax production or groundwater δD cannot alone explain the variation in ε between different plant types. In contrast to individual plant leaves, fluvial sediments represent a time-integrated ecosystem average of n-alkane δD that yields a more consistent isotopic record of changes in ambient ecosystem water than individual plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorylus americana 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3aPinus strobus 3aTsuga canadensis 3aalkanes 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3agroundwater 3agrowing season 3ahydrogen 3aisotope fractionation 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3aseasonal variation 3asediments 3asoil 3astomatal movement 3astream channels 3atrees 3awaxes 0aBiomarker 0aCompound-specific stable isotopes 0aPlant waxes 0aHydrogen isotopes1 aHren, Michael T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2866-88920 tOrganic geochemistry.g2016 July, v. 97 p.122-130dElsevier Ltdx0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2016.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01713naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245012100165300001800286520050600304592002800810650002100838650000900859650002200868650001800890650001300908650002400921650002800945700002000973700002100993700002201014700002201036700006101058773014701119856007601266852000901342655001201351IND60603308420221121003405.0180713e20180305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060330842DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b128452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurakami, Noritake10aEnhanced Photosensitized Hydrogen Production by Encapsulation of Ferrocenyl Dyes into Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes  ap. 3821-3824.  aDye-encapsulated single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were employed for the construction of a coaxial three-component dye/SWCNT/C₆₀ heterojunction.

Owing to its various characteristics, Surfactin is one of the most studied biosurfactants. Since its discovery, several Surfactin producers have been identified, but their capacity to produce Surfactin has not been evaluated in a comparison. Six different Bacillus strains were analyzed regarding their ability to produce Surfactin in model fermentations with integrated foam fractionation, for in situ product enrichment and removal. Three of the investigated strains are commonly used in Surfactin production (ATCC 21332, DSM 3256, DSM 3258), whereas two Bacillus strains are described for the first time (DSM 1090, LM43a50°C) as Surfactin producers. Additionally, the Bacillus subtilis type strain DSM 10ᵀ was included in the evaluation. Interestingly, all strains, except DSM 3256, featured high values for Surfactin recovered from foam in comparison to other studies, ranging between 0.4 and 1.05 g. The fermentation process was characterized by calculating procedural parameters like substrate yield Y X/S, product yield Y P/X, specific growth rate μ, specific productivity q Sᵤᵣfₐcₜᵢₙ, volumetric productivity q Sᵤᵣfₐcₜᵢₙ, Surfactin and bacterial enrichment as well as Surfactin recovery. The strains differ most in specific and volumetric productivity; nevertheless, it is evident that it is not possible to name a Bacillus strain that is the most appropriate for the production of Surfactin under these conditions. In contrast, it becomes apparent that the choice of a specific strain should depend on the applied fermentation conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3abiosurfactants 3abiotechnology 3afermentation 3afoams 3afractionation 3amicrobiology 3aspecific growth rate 3asurfactin1 aZwick, Michaela1 aMohr, Teresa1 aSchmid, Ferdinand1 aSyldatk, Christoph1 aHausmann, Rudolf0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Dec., v. 98, no. 23 p.9623-9632dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-014-6010-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245008300165300001600248500001400264520104000278592002801318650001601346650001801362650001801380650001401398650001001412650001801422650002501440650001501465650001401480650002101494653001501515653002001530653002601550653003201576653001901608700002001627700001801647700002301665773018201688856007401870852000901944655001201953IND60692055420221120203808.0200502e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069205542DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.68.6312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakajima, Masatoshi,10aGibberellin Induces α-Amylase Gene in Seed Coat of Ipomoea nil Immature Seeds  ap. 631-637.  aNAL-light  aTwo full-length cDNAs encoding gibberellin 3-oxidases, InGA3ox1 and InGA3ox2, were cloned from developing seeds of morning glory (Ipomoea nil (Pharbitis nil) Choisy cv.

In situ hybridization showed the signals of InGA3ox2 mRNA in the seed coat, suggesting that active gibberellins (GAs) were synthesized in the tissue, although no active GA was detected there by immunohistochemistry. In situ hybridization analysis for InAmy1 (former PnAmy1) mRNA showed that InAmy1 was also synthesized in the seed coat. Both InGA3ox2 and InAmy1 genes were expressed spatially overlapped without a clear time lag, suggesting that both active GAs and InAmy1 were synthesized almost simultaneously in seed coat and secreted to the integument. These observations support the idea that GAs play an important role in seed development by inducing α-amylase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIpomoea nil 3aalpha-amylase 3abiotechnology 3aflowering 3agenes 3ahybridization 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aintegument 3aseed coat 3aseed development 0aα-amylase 0adeveloping seed 0ain situ hybridization 0aIpomoea nil (Pharbitis nil) 0agibberellin(s)1 aNAKAYAMA, Akira1 aXU, Zheng-Jun1 aYAMAGUCHI, Isomaro0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2004 Jan. 1, v. 68, no. 3 p.631-637dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.68.6313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013300155300001800288520130300306592002801609650004401637650001501681650001501696650002201711650002001733650001401753650001701767650003901784650000901823650001201832650001301844650001501857650003301872650001101905650002301916650001701939650003701956650003701993700001302030700001402043700001602057700001302073700001802086773014102104856007402245852000902319655001202328IND60671241220221119013544.0191002e20150408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067124122DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb00038f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Zebin10aMultifunctional fibrous silica composite with high optical sensing performance and effective removal ability toward Hg²⁺ ions  ap. 3201-3210.  aA multifunctional organic–inorganic hybrid sensing material (RB-KCC-1) was prepared by the immobilization of a rhodamine-based receptor (RB-Si) within the channels of fibrous silica spheres (KCC-1), and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, N₂ adsorption–desorption, and UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. This multifunctional sensor exhibits high surface area, large open pores and a flexible fibrous structure, and excellent optical sensing properties that allow for highly selective, sensitive and “naked eye” Hg²⁺ detection. The fluorescence enhancement responses of RB-KCC-1 are associated with the spirolactam ring opening of the rhodamine group, and a detection limit of 9.05 × 10⁻⁷ M is obtained. In additional, it is also an excellent adsorbent for the removal of Hg²⁺ from aqueous solution. The adsorption process of Hg²⁺ on RB-KCC-1 is well described by the Langmuir isotherm equation, and the equilibrium adsorption capacity is 115.47 mg g⁻¹. These results indicate that these multifunctional composites may have good potential as favorable materials for the facile detection and effective removal of Hg²⁺ in biological, environmental, and industrial fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3adetection limit 3aequations 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aions 3amercury 3anitrogen 3arhodamines 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aGuo, Dan1 aZhang, Li1 aLi, Haizhen1 aYang, Bo1 aYan, Shiqiang0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 Apr. 8, v. 3, no. 16 p.3201-3210dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb00038f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03882naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001700150245008600167300001600253520235300269592002802622650002302650650003302673650002702706650000802733650001302741650002002754650001302774650001202787650001402799650002302813650001502836650002002851650001202871650002802883650001402911650001202925650001602937650001902953650001302972650002202985650001503007650001203022650001803034650001103052700001803063700002103081700003103102700001803133773008203151856008603233852000903319655001203328IND4461460520221122043830.0141111e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446146052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2010.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLehto, Marja10aHygienic level and surface contamination in fresh-cut vegetable production plants  ap. 469-475.  aThe number of vegetable processing plants has increased during recent years in many countries. At the same time, fresh vegetable products have been implicated by epidemiologic investigations as sources of infection. Fresh vegetables are susceptible to microbial contamination after harvest due to their high water and nutrient contents. Contamination may occur at all stages during production. The aim of this study was to determine the level of surface contamination after cleaning in several fresh-cut vegetable processing plants, and to identify the critical points in the processes and operating rooms. Surface and environmental samples were taken from the plants after cleaning of the processing devices and surfaces. The levels of surface and air hygiene in the vegetable processing factories were determined with different rapid hygiene monitoring methods. The amounts of total aerobic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and β-glucuronidase-positive bacteria, yeasts and moulds on surfaces were measured using Hygicult® contact plates. ATP bioluminescence was measured luminometrically with an HY-LiTE®2 equipment. The number of microbes in air was measured with an MAS-100 sampler. The highest levels of total aerobic bacteria, yeasts, Enterobacteriaceae and β-glucuronidase-positive bacteria were detected on machines (cutters, peeling machines etc.). High mean values of ATP were detected e.g. on packaging surfaces (due to high values of wooden boxes) and on cutters. Most of the bacterial counts measured on the surfaces were unacceptable when using the Finnish surface hygiene guidelines as criteria. However, the results should be examined in the context of the type of production and the stage of operation also must be taken into account. Different hygiene areas (FDA, 2008) should be separate enough to allow maintenance of good hygiene in cleaner areas while accepting lower hygiene levels e.g. in primary (early) washing steps. Despite this, the results show that there is a clear need to improve cleaning and hygiene practices in vegetable production. Several practical recommendations were given e.g. concerning cleaning, design of production areas, training of employees and self monitoring of surface hygiene. The information obtained will be used for improvement of practices in the cleaning of vegetable processing factories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aair 3abacteria 3abioluminescence 3acleaning 3acutters 3afactories 3afood contamination 3aguidelines 3ahuman resources 3ahygiene 3amicrobial contamination 3apackaging 3apeeling 3aplate count 3araw vegetables 3asamplers 3avegetable growing 3avegetables 3awashing 3awater content 3ayeasts1 aKuisma, Risto1 aMäättä, Jenni1 aKymäläinen, Hanna-Riitta1 aMäki, Maarit0 tFood control.g2011 , v. 22, no. 3-4 p.469-475dElsevier Ltdx0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2010.09.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006900151245016800220520099500388592002801383650001701411650002701428650001501455650001301470650001601483650002601499650001801525650001701543650001701560650001801577650001301595650002101608650001501629650000701644650001801651650001901669653001301688653002201701653001901723653001601742653001201758653001701770700002901787700007401816700002301890773010801913856008602021852000902107655001202116IND60730479920221119102254.0220606e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073047992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1179072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSathiyaseelan, Anbazhagan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6154-736610apH-controlled nucleolin targeted release of dual drug from chitosan-gold based aptamer functionalized nano drug delivery system for improved glioblastoma treatment  aThis study developed the pH, and over-expressed nucleolin receptor responsive nano-drug delivery system (nDDS) composed by bio-synthesized gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), chitosan (CS) with aptamer (Apt) to deliver the 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and doxorubicin (Dox) for the improved glioblastoma treatment.

In addition, the internalization of Apt-Dox-CS-Au-5FU NPs in cell organelles was affirmed by bio-TEM analysis. Overall, this work revealed the newly designed drug-loaded smart nDDS improved the glioblastoma treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosynthesis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell death 3achitosan 3adoxorubicin 3adrug delivery systems 3aencapsulation 3afluorouracil 3aglioblastoma 3ahydrodynamics 3ananogold 3aoligonucleotides 3aorganelles 3apH 3aparticle size 3azeta potential 0aChitosan 0aGold nanoparticle 0a5-Fluorouracil 0aDoxorubicin 0aAptamer 0aGlioblastoma1 aSaravanakumar, Kandasamy1 aMariadoss, Arokia Vijaya Anand1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6154-73661 aWang, Myeong-Hyeon0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 June 15, v. 262 p.117907-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1179073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014600166300001800312520119300330592002801523650004401551650002201595650001501617650001501632650001101647650002701658650001901685650001301704650001301717650002301730650001101753650001301764650000901777650001501786650001101801650002101812650002001833653001801853653002001871653001501891653001601906653002901922700002801951700001501979700002001994700002602014700002002040700001702060773011502077856008602192852000902278655001202287IND60557382420221120114031.0180831e20170120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055738242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.10.1642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamseu, E.10aSubstitution of sodium silicate with rice husk ash-NaOH solution in metakaolin based geopolymer cement concerning reduction in global warming  ap. 3050-3060.  aRice husk ash (RHA), a by-product from the rice industry, was used as principal source of amorphous silica for the production of sodium silicate solution (MR ∼ 3) used for the replacement of standard commercial sodium silicate in the mix-design of metakaolin based geopolymer composites. Three initial concentrations of NaOH were considered (8, 10 and 12 M) with the aim to investigate on the optimum dissolution and formation of silica oligomers capable to act as binder during the geopolymerization. Results (FT-IR and XRD) showed that RHA-NaOH sodium silicate solutions have characteristics similar to that of standard commercial sodium silicate and the residual carbonates present in the viscous pastes can be monitored during the preparation of geopolymers using the mix-design. Combined 25 vol% standard sodium silicate solution with ∼75 vol% of RHA-NaOH based sodium silicate solution conducted to good polycondensation, densification, high flexural strength (∼8 MPa) and low porosity similar to that of the standard matrix of metakaolin based composites. The new approach is found promising for the significant reduction of the Global Warming Potential of Geopolymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abyproducts 3acarbonates 3acement 3acondensation reactions 3aglobal warming 3ahusk ash 3aindustry 3amodulus of rupture 3apastes 3aporosity 3arice 3arice hulls 3asilica 3asodium hydroxide 3asodium silicate 0aRice husk ash 0aSodium silicate 0aGeopolymer 0aSustainable 0aGlobal warming potential1 aBeleuk à Moungam, L.M.1 aCannio, M.1 aBillong, Ndigui1 aChaysuwan, Duangrudee1 aMelo, U.

The objective of this study is to investigate the factors that influence the management of natural resources and the conservation of river ecology by the indigenous people in the Nongchaiwan wetland. We conducted in-depth interviews with 5 key informants and quantitative surveys with 158 households in two phases over a period of 3 years. Ancestral spiritual beliefs that are still salient in the Lower Songkhram River Basin influence natural resources management because they traditionally link people and natural resources. Such spiritual beliefs in the Lower Songkhram River Basin supported the indigenous people to continue conserving the natural resources in their territory. In addition, property rights granted to indigenous people also contribute to the conservation of natural resources. Our findings suggest that policy makers should engage with local beliefs in order to achieve sustainable resource management and, therefore, such practices should be recognized and included in the government&rsquo;s policies on natural resources management in locations, where indigenous people live for generations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecology 3ahouseholds 3aindigenous peoples 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3anatural resources conservation 3aproperty rights 3aresource management 3arivers 3asurveys 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aThailand1 aSasaki, Nophea1 aGrünbühel, Clemens1 aKuwornu, John K.

Here, we propose a novel synthesis approach whereby TiO₂ not only promotes 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) polymerization but also acts as a templating agent for the formation itself. Hybrid TiO₂–DHICA melanin nanostructures have been produced, showing biocide activity even under visible light conditions (activation). Hybrid nanostructures have been analyzed and characterized by multiple techniques, proving that both organic and inorganic phases strongly affect each other during in situ formation, as far as it concerns both morphology and microstructure, conferring unique biocide properties to the resulting nanomaterials. This strategy ensures much more far-reaching implementation in the synthesis of hybrid nanosystems, opening new perspectives in the design of multifunctional materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocides 3acarboxylic acids 3alight 3amelanin 3amicrostructure 3ananomaterials 3apolymerization 3atitanium dioxide1 aPezzella, Alessandro1 aZanfardino, Anna1 aVarcamonti, Mario1 aSilvestri, Brigida1 aCostantini, Aniello1 aBranda, Francesco1 aLuciani, Giuseppina0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 Mar. 25, v. 3, no. 14 p.2808-2815dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb00039d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245011900176300001400295520170500309592002802014650001102042650002202053650001102075650002902086650001102115650002602126650001602152650000802168650001802176650002202194650001102216650001102227650001402238650001802252651001802270653002902288653001502317653005402332653001702386700002402403700001902427700002202446773008302468856008802551852000902639655001202648IND60562531920221121122803.0170208e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056253192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2016.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossel, Pamela E.10aDissolved organic matter in pore water of Arctic Ocean sediments: Environmental influence on molecular composition  ap. 41-52.  aMarine organic matter (OM) sinks from surface water to the seafloor via the biological pump. Benthic communities, which use this sedimented OM as an energy and carbon source, produce dissolved OM (DOM) in the process of degradation, enriching the sediment pore water with fresh DOM compounds. In the oligotrophic deep Arctic basin, particle flux is low but highly seasonal. We hypothesized that the molecular signal of freshly deposited, primary produced OM would be detectable in surface sediment pore water, which should differ in DOM composition from bottom water and deeper sediment pore water. The study focused on (i) the molecular composition of the DOM in sediment pore water of the deep Eurasian Arctic basins, (ii) the signal of marine vs. terrigenous DOM represented by different compounds preserved in the pore water and (iii) the relationship between Arctic Ocean ice cover and DOM composition. Composition based on mass spectrometric information, obtained via 15T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, was correlated with environmental parameters with partial least square analysis. The fresh marine detrital OM signal from surface water was limited to pore water from <5cm sediment depth. The productive ice margin stations showed a higher abundance of peptide, unsaturated aliphatic and saturated fatty acid molecular formulae, indicative of recent phytodetritus deposition, than the multiyear ice-covered stations, which had a stronger aromatic signal. The study contributes to the understanding of the coupling between Arctic Ocean productivity and its depositional regime, and how it may be altered in response to sea ice retreat and increasing river runoff.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abenthic organisms 3acarbon 3adissolved organic matter 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3afatty acids 3aice 3aleast squares 3amass spectrometry 3arivers 3arunoff 3asediments 3asurface water 3aArctic region 0aDissolved organic matter 0aPore water 0aFourier-transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry 0aArctic Ocean1 aBienhold, Christina1 aBoetius, Antje1 aDittmar, Thorsten0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2016 July, v. 97 p.41-52dElsevier Ltdx0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2016.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013900170520103300309592002801342650001801370650002201388650001601410650001301426650001701439650000901456650001301465650001201478650001301490650001601503653002301519653001801542653001301560653001401573653002401587700005801611700002601669773010801695856008601803852000901889655001201898IND60730480020221119095310.0220606e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073048002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1179082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLtaief, Syrine10aImmobilization of copper oxide nanoparticles onto chitosan biopolymer: Application to the oxidative degradation of Naphthol blue black  aIn this study, copper oxide nanoparticles, prepared using pistacia vera hull extract, were immobilized onto chitosan.

We report a facile, general, low-temperature, and size tunable (4–28 nm) solution phase synthesis of ternary APnE₂ semiconductors based on Earth-abundant and biocompatible elements (A = Na, Pn = Bi, E = S or Se). The observed experimental band gaps (1.20–1.45 eV) fall within the ideal range for solar cells. Computational investigation of the lowest energy superstructures that result from “coloring”, caused by mixed cation sites present in their rock salt lattice, agrees with other better-known members of this family of materials. Our synthesis unlocks a new class of low cost and environmentally friendly ternary semiconductors that show properties of interest for applications in energy conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abismuth 3acadmium 3acations 3aenergy conversion 3alead 3amanufacturing 3aselenium 3asemiconductors 3asodium 3asolar cells 3asulfur 3atoxicity1 aWhite, Miles A.1 aVela, Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5124-68930 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Feb. 16, v. 140, no. 10 p.3736-3742dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b128733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013500157300002000292520153600312592002801848650001101876650003501887650002301922650002001945650001801965650001701983650001902000650001602019650002202035650000902057650002402066650001902090650001402109650000702123650002602130650001302156650002602169700001902195700001802214700002102232700002202253773012402275856007402399852000902473655001202482IND60665741520221118045453.0190912e20140822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066574152DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra05047a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Guangyi,10aImmobilization of iron hydroxide/oxide on reduced graphene oxide: peroxidase-like activity and selective detection of sulfide ions  ap. 37705-37713.  aWe prepared nanocomposites of amorphous iron hydroxide/oxide immobilized on reduced graphene oxide (FeOₓH–rGO) with peroxidase-like activity for the detection of sulfide (S²⁻) ions. FeOₓH–rGO nanocomposites were prepared by reaction of GO (size ∼ 300 nm) partially reduced by ultraviolet irradiation with Fe²⁺ in Tris–borate solution (5.0 mM, pH 7.0). The amorphous FeO(OH) and Fe(OH)₂ were immobilized on rGO to form FeOₓH–rGO nanocomposites. The as-prepared FeOₓH–rGO nanocomposites exhibited peroxidase-like catalytic activity in the H₂O₂-mediated oxidation of Amplex Red (AR) to fluorescent resorufin. Our AR/FeOₓH–rGO probe allowed the detection of H₂O₂ down to 50 nM within 10 min under microwave irradiation (170 W). The catalytic activity of FeOₓH–rGO was significantly suppressed in the presence of S²⁻ because of the formation of FeS on the FeOₓH–rGO nanocomposites' surfaces. The H₂O₂/AR–FeOₓH–rGO probe provided a limit of detection (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) of 50 nM for S²⁻ with high selectivity (>100-fold) with respect to other anions. Taking advantage of their high stability and selectivity, we employed our H₂O₂/AR–FeOₓH–rGO probe for the detection of S²⁻ in hot spring samples (75.1–619.5 μM) and the results showed good correlation (r = 0.98) with results from inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. This label-free, rapid, and simple sensing system shows great potential for the detection of S²⁻ ions in real samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acatalytic activity 3adetection limit 3aferrous oxide 3afluorescence 3agraphene oxide 3ahot springs 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3amicrowave radiation 3ananocomposites 3aoxidation 3apH 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3asulfides 3aultraviolet radiation1 aLien, Chia-Wen1 aLin, Chia-Hua1 aZhang, Huanzong,1 aHuang, Chih-Ching0 tRSC advances.g2014 Aug. 22, v. 4, no. 71 p.37705-37713dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra05047a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245012000159300001800279520147500297592002801772650002101800650003501821650002101856650001201877650002501889650001801914650001901932650001701951650001901968650002401987650001602011650002802027650001102055650001502066650001702081650001302098650001602111650001302127650001702140650003002157700001602187700001602203700001502219700001502234700001702249773011602266856008102382852000902463655001202472IND60114278320221117062811.0141120e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011427832DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-014-6021-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Rui10aTAT-RhoGDI2, a novel tumor metastasis suppressor fusion protein: expression, purification and functional evaluation  ap. 9633-9641.  aRho GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (RhoGDI2) was identified as a functional metastasis suppressor in human bladder cancer, suggesting that increasing the RhoGDI2 level may represent a promising therapeutic strategy. It has been shown that the transactivator of transcription (TAT) protein from HIV-1 is able to efficiently deliver various biological molecules into several cell types. In this study, TAT peptide was fused with the N-terminus of RhoGDI2, and the resulting TAT-RhoGDI2 fragment was inserted into the pGEX-6p-1 plasmid and expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST)/TAT-RhoGDI2 fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. A two-step purification strategy involving glutathione sepharose chromatography and PreScission protease cleavage was developed to purify TAT-RhoGDI2; subsequently, the identification of the involved macromolecules was achieved by Western blot. The final product, TAT-RhoGDI2, was obtained at a concentration of 112 mg/L. This is the first report on the efficient production of bioactive TAT-RhoGDI2 through a gene-engineering approach in E. coli. Using flow cytometry, we found that the TAT-RhoGDI2 fusion proteins could penetrate into bladder cancer cells with an extremely high efficiency. In vitro scratch and transwell assay and the migration/invasion behavior of UMUC3 cells were strongly reduced by the treatment with TAT-RhoGDI2. These studies support the use of the TAT-RhoGDI2 protein in tumor metastasis therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aWestern blotting 3aagarose 3abioactive properties 3abiotechnology 3achromatography 3adissociation 3aflow cytometry 3agenetic engineering 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3ahumans 3ametastasis 3amicrobiology 3aplasmids 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3atherapeutics 3aurinary bladder neoplasms1 aDong, Yuguo1 aWang, Lihua1 aTao, Xinyi1 aSun, Aiyou1 aWei, Dongzhi0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Dec., v. 98, no. 23 p.9633-9641dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-014-6021-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245011400164300001600278500001500294520183700309592002802146650001902174650001102193650001002204650002502214650002002239650002202259650001502281650001102296650002202307650001302329650001702342650002302359650001502382650001502397650002102412651001602433653001002449700002202459700002102481773010302502856004802605852000902653655001202662IND4478417820221122043925.0120517e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447841782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-012-9810-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCraggs, Rupert10aHectare-scale demonstration of high rate algal ponds for enhanced wastewater treatment and biofuel production  ap. 329-337.  a2019-12-06  aHigh rate algal ponds (HRAPs) are shallow, paddlewheel-mixed open raceway ponds that are an efficient and cost-effective upgrade for the conventional wastewater treatment ponds used by communities and farms the world over. HRAPs provide improved natural disinfection and nutrient removal and can be further enhanced by carbon dioxide (CO2) addition to promote algal growth which is often carbon limited. This paper discusses the construction and operation of a 5-ha demonstration HRAP system treating primary settled wastewater at the Christchurch wastewater treatment plant, New Zealand. The system consisted of four 1.25-ha HRAPs that were constructed from an existing conventional pond. Algae were harvested from the HRAP effluent in specially designed settlers, which concentrated the algal/bacterial biomass to 1–2% organic solids for conversion to bio-crude oil following dewatering. Performance data from the first 15 months of HRAP operation (without CO2 addition) are presented. The four demonstration HRAPs had reasonable replication of both treatment performance and algal/bacterial productivity with similar annual average wastewater treatment efficiency (~50% removal of BOD5, ~87% removal of fBOD5, ~65% removal of ammoniacal-N, ~19% removal of dissolved reactive phosphorus and ~2 log removal of Escherichia coli), algal species composition and algal/bacterial biomass production (~8 g m−2 day −1 volatile suspended solids). These results were in good agreement with the results for pilot-scale HRAP without CO2 addition in New Zealand. This study provides further indication of the potential for energy efficient and effective wastewater treatment using HRAP, while biofuel conversion of the harvested algal bacterial biomass could provide a valuable niche distributed energy source for local communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aponds 3awastewater treatment 3afarming systems 3amicrobial biomass 3adewatering 3acarbon 3aspecies diversity 3abiofuels 3adisinfection 3abiomass production 3aphosphorus 3awastewater 3aEscherichia coli 3aNew Zealand 0aAlgae1 aSutherland, Donna1 aCampbell, Helena0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2012 June, v. 24, no. 3 p.329-337dSpringer-Verlagx0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-012-9810-8  aDNAL 7aarticle04182naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002000183245006900203300001800272506007600290520215000366592002802516506003702544650001602581650001602597650001402613650002502627650001502652650001402667650002102681650002102702650001302723650002102736650002402757650001902781650001102800650000702811650001302818650002102831650001702852700002302869700002702892700001902919700002402938700001902962700002002981700002303001700001803024700002203042700006203064700006203126700006703188700006903255773014703324856007603471852000903547655001203556IND60603308720221207112026.0180713e20180223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060330872DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b128742doi7 aPMC58805092pmcid7 a294737442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatos, Maria J.10aChemo- and Regioselective Lysine Modification on Native Proteins  ap. 4004-4017.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSite-selective chemical conjugation of synthetic molecules to proteins expands their functional and therapeutic capacity. Current protein modification methods, based on synthetic and biochemical technologies, can achieve site selectivity, but these techniques often require extensive sequence engineering or are restricted to the N- or C-terminus. Here we show the computer-assisted design of sulfonyl acrylate reagents for the modification of a single lysine residue on native protein sequences. This feature of the designed sulfonyl acrylates, together with the innate and subtle reactivity differences conferred by the unique local microenvironment surrounding each lysine, contribute to the observed regioselectivity of the reaction. Moreover, this site selectivity was predicted computationally, where the lysine with the lowest pKₐ was the kinetically favored residue at slightly basic pH. Chemoselectivity was also observed as the reagent reacted preferentially at lysine, even in those cases when other nucleophilic residues such as cysteine were present. The reaction is fast and proceeds using a single molar equivalent of the sulfonyl acrylate reagent under biocompatible conditions (37 °C, pH 8.0). This technology was demonstrated by the quantitative and irreversible modification of five different proteins including the clinically used therapeutic antibody Trastuzumab without prior sequence engineering. Importantly, their native secondary structure and functionality is retained after the modification. This regioselective lysine modification method allows for further bioconjugation through aza-Michael addition to the acrylate electrophile that is generated by spontaneous elimination of methanesulfinic acid upon lysine labeling. We showed that a protein–antibody conjugate bearing a site-specifically installed fluorophore at lysine could be used for selective imaging of apoptotic cells and detection of Her2+ cells, respectively. This simple, robust method does not require genetic engineering and may be generally used for accessing diverse, well-defined protein conjugates for basic biology and therapeutic studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLewis acids 3aLewis bases 3aacrylates 3aamino acid sequences 3aantibodies 3aapoptosis 3achemical bonding 3achemoselectivity 3acysteine 3afluorescent dyes 3agenetic engineering 3aimage analysis 3alysine 3apH 3aproteins 3aregioselectivity 3atherapeutics1 aOliveira, Bruno L.1 aMartínez-Sáez, Nuria1 aGuerreiro, Ana1 aCal, Pedro M.

Understanding and predicting the dynamics resulting from these complex interactions is crucial for the sustainable stewardship of ecosystems, particularly in the context of rapidly changing environmental conditions. Here we present iLand (the individual-based forest landscape and disturbance model), a novel approach to simulating forest dynamics as an emergent property of environmental drivers, ecosystem processes and dynamic interactions across scales. Our specific objectives were (i) to describe the model, in particular its novel approach to simulate spatially explicit individual-tree competition for resources over large scales within a process-based framework of physiological resource use, and (ii) to present a suite of evaluation experiments assessing iLands ability to simulate tree growth and mortality for a wide range of forest ecosystems. Adopting an approach rooted in ecological field theory, iLand calculates a continuous field of light availability over the landscape, with every tree represented by a mechanistically derived, size- and species-dependent pattern of light interference. Within a hierarchical multi-scale framework productivity is derived at stand-level by means of a light-use efficiency approach, and downscaled to individuals via local light availability. Allocation (based on allometric ratios) and mortality (resulting from carbon starvation) are modeled at the individual-tree level, accounting for adaptive behavior of trees in response to their environment. To evaluate the model we conducted simulations over the extended environmental gradient of a longitudinal transect in Oregon, USA, and successfully compared results against independently observed productivity estimates (63.4% of variation explained) and mortality patterns in even-aged stands. This transect experiment was furthermore replicated for a different set of species and ecosystems in the Austrian Alps, documenting the robustness and generality of our approach. Model performance was also successfully evaluated for structurally and compositionally complex old-growth forests in the western Cascades of Oregon. Finally, the ability of our approach to address forest ecosystem dynamics at landscape scales was demonstrated by a computational scaling experiment. In simulating the emergence of ecosystem patterns and dynamics as a result of complex process interactions across scales our approach has the potential to contribute crucial capacities to understanding and fostering forest ecosystem resilience under changing climatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimatic factors 3aeven-aged stands 3aforest ecosystems 3amodel validation 3amortality 3aold-growth forests 3asimulation models 3astarvation 3atree growth 3atrees 3aAlps region 3aOregon1 aRammer, Werner1 aScheller, Robert M.1 aSpies, Thomas A.0 tEcological modelling.g2012 Apr. 24, v. 231 p.87-100dElsevier B.V.x0304-38007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2012.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010900153300002000262520118700282592002801469650001401497650002101511650002201532650000901554650001301563650001101576650001401587650001701601650002001618650002101638700001601659700001701675700001301692700001301705700001701718700001701735700001501752773012401767856007401891852000901965655001201974IND60641987820221119155640.0190506e20170614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064198782DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04647b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jie10aCathodic shift of a photo-potential on a Ta₃N₅ photoanode by post-heating a TiO₂ passivation layer  ap. 30650-30656.  aTa₃N₅ is a promising photoanode material for solar water splitting due to its suitable band gap and high theoretical solar energy conversion. A high onset potential of Ta₃N₅ limits its photoelectrochemical performance due to serious surface charge recombination. In a previous study, a TiO₂ passivation layer was usually coated on the surface of Ta₃N₅ to reduce the surface recombination and improve the performance of a sample. However, to date, there are no studies on the effect of conductivity of the TiO₂ passivation layer on the photoelectrochemical properties of a Ta₃N₅ photoanode. In this work, for the first time, the conductivity of TiO₂ is increased by post-heating of a TiO₂ passivation layer, leading to a 90 mV cathodic shift of the photo-potential of Ta₃N₅. After further loading with a Ni(OH)ₓ/FeOOH bi-layer electrocatalyst, the Ta₃N₅ photoanode achieves a current density of 6.4 mA cm⁻² at 1.23 VRHE and a HC-STH (half-cell solar to hydrogen efficiency) of 0.72% under a sunlight simulator (100 mW cm⁻²), which are the highest values among the Ta₃N₅ photoanodes prepared by thermal oxidation and nitridation of Ta foil.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3afoil 3ahydrogen 3anickel 3aoxidation 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3atitanium dioxide1 aLuo, Wenjun1 aZhu, Kaijian1 aWen, Xin1 aXiu, Fei1 aYuan, Jiajie1 aZou, Zhigang1 aHuang, Wei0 tRSC advances.g2017 June 14, v. 7, no. 49 p.30650-30656dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra04647b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245010200212500001900314520162200333592002801955650001901983650002402002650001202026650001702038650001002055650001102065650002902076650001002105650001802115650002002133650002102153650000802174650002902182650001702211650001702228653001502245653000802260653001502268653001702283653001702300700005302317700001702370700001602387700001402403700005602417700005602473700001902529773012002548856008802668852000902756655001202765IND60697917120221122174056.0210114e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069791712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1049212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScherhaufer, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9737-305110aEnvironmental assessment of the valorisation and recycling of selected food production side flows  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResidues from the food manufacturing industry require management options with the best overall environmental outcome. The identification of sustainable solutions depends however, on many influencing factors such as energy input, transport distance, and substituted product. This study shows the influence of the choice of substituted products on the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for three specific food side-flows and their treatment in the European Union: animal blood, apple pomace and brewers’ spent grain (BSG). In a direct comparison of possible treatment options, it is notable that the conversion to food ingredients (valorisation) does not always result in reduced environmental net impacts (GHG savings), which means that other options at lower levels of the waste hierarchy might be more beneficial to the environment. The further use of apple pomace or BSG for the production of food ingredients is only advantageous if the processing emissions are smaller than the emissions from the substituted products. The use of food side-flows as animal feed shows environmental advantages in all scenarios, as the use of conventional feed, such as soybean meal or hay, is reduced and so are the GHG emissions. The anaerobic digestion of food side-flows is associated with significant GHG emissions, but alternative energy also display a high GHG factor when based on fossil resources. The measuring of circularity in the food sector is a challenge in itself due to the complexity of renewable materials. This study shall help to understand the interwoven influences of certain parameters to the results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aanaerobic digestion 3aanimals 3aapple pomace 3ablood 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3afeeds 3afood industry 3afood production 3agreenhouse gases 3ahay 3arenewable energy sources 3asoybean meal 3aspent grains 0aFood waste 0aLCA 0aAllocation 0aSubstitution 0aValorisation1 aDavis, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3703-90941 aMetcalfe, P.1 aGollnow, S.1 aColin, F.1 aDe Menna, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8551-02771 aVittuari, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4327-15751 aÖstergren, K.0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2020 Oct., v. 161 p.104921-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1049213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245010900164300001600273520158000289592002801869653001701897653001301914653002501927653001701952653002301969653001901992653001902011653001402030700002102044773012402065856007702189852000902266655001202275IND60130732320221121233224.0151127e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013073232DNAL7 a10.3159/07-RA-008.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcinko, Sarah E.10aProtandry, mating systems, and sex expression in the federally endangered Ptilimnium nodosum (apiaceae)1  ap. 178-188.  aKnowledge of plant mating system attributes is essential to the conservation of endangered species. The purpose of this study was to examine the functional consequences and conservation implications of protandry, andromonoecy, and mating patterns in the critically endangered and clonal plant, Ptilimnium nodosum. We conducted intra- and interfloral phenological observations to quantify opportunities for geitonogamy and calculated floral sex ratios of sequentially blooming umbel orders. We also provide information on P. nodosum's mating system. Flowers are self-compatible, but strong intrafloral protandry precludes autonomous selfing (< 1%% seed set). Weak interfloral protandry combined with vegetative reproduction, however, provided multiple opportunities for geitonogamy which characteristically decreased with umbel order. Although low, mean seed set was comparable among open pollinated (25%%), manually outcrossed (26%%), and geitonogamously selfed (21%%) pollination treatments, suggesting a mixed-mating system dependent on insect-mediated pollination.The significant decrease in mean seed set among higher umbel orders in open-pollinated plants is likely a consequence of low floral density and lack of pollinators late in the flowering season. Moderate reproductive output and high seed germinability suggest that environmental conditions, not mating system, regulate the distribution and abundance of P. nodosum and high immediate fitness gained by self-compatibility and vegetative reproduction plays a critical role to the species' short-term persistence.  aPublisher supplied data 0aandromonoecy 0aApiaceae 0aasexual reproduction 0aconservation 0aendangered species 0amating systems 0aNorth Carolina 0aprotandry1 aRandall, John L.0 tjournal of the Torrey Botanical Society.g2008 Apr., v. 135, no. 2 p.178-188dTorrey Botanical Societyx1095-56747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3159%2F07-RA-008.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008400169520143200253592002801685650001201713650001201725650001301737650001301750650001101763650002301774650001701797650001401814650000901828650001201837650001801849650001101867650000901878653002001887653001701907653001901924653001001943653001801953700001801971700001701989700001702006773011302023856008602136852000902222655001202231IND60783487920221116164933.0220914e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078348792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1331362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHölzle, Ingo10aHeavy metals in soil-like material from landfills – Resource or contaminants?  aIn the last decade landfill mining (LFM) has gained particular attention due to the possibility of resource recovery from landfills. However, landfills consist mainly of soil-like material (SLM) which is of little or no economic value. The aim of the present study is to provide a global overview of SLM in terms of heavy metal concentrations and its resource potential. As references for the resource assessment served metal concentrations in ores, thresholds for compost and earthworks, and abundance in Earth's crust. The preparation of a meta-analysis included 573 chemical analyses from 59 landfills in 12 countries. Average concentrations of arsenic, zinc and nickel turned out to be quite similar worldwide, whereas those of lead, copper and mercury showed remarkable differences between the landfills. Chromium, nickel, lead and zinc concentrations proved to exceed most likely compost, while arsenic and mercury concentrations remained usually below thresholds. With regard to a reuse of SLM in earthworks, elevated zinc concentrations were most of concern, followed by lead, copper, chromium and cadmium. However, chromium and nickel concentrations were found to be most similar to abundances in Earth's crust. Heavy metal concentrations in SLM were worldwide not comparable to those found in ores. Moreover, we observed that the option of multiple metal recovery did not improve significantly the resource potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acomposts 3acopper 3aeconomic valuation 3aheavy metals 3alandfills 3alead 3amercury 3ameta-analysis 3anickel 3azinc 0aLandfill mining 0aHeavy metals 0aSoil recycling 0aFines 0aMeta-analysis1 aSomani, Mohit1 aRamana, G.V.1 aDatta, Manoj0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 369 p.133136-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1331363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001900183245007100202300001800273506007600291520146200367592002801829506003701857650002201894650001501916650001501931650002401946650001401970650002001984650001802004650001402022650002402036650001302060700002002073700002002093773013102113856007802244852000902322655001202331IND60541880020221207113337.0160823e20160518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054188002DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b029542doi7 aPMC53322222pmcid7 a271152492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoran, Todd M.10aChemical Tools To Monitor and Manipulate Adaptive Immune Responses  ap. 6076-6094.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMethods to monitor and manipulate the immune system are of enormous clinical interest. For example, the development of vaccines represents one of the earliest and greatest accomplishments of the biomedical research enterprise. More recently, drugs capable of “reawakening” the immune system to cancer have generated enormous excitement. But, much remains to be done. All drugs available today that manipulate the immune system cannot distinguish between “good” and “bad” immune responses and thus drive general and systemic immune suppression or activation. Indeed, with the notable exception of vaccines, our ability to monitor and manipulate antigen-specific immune responses is in its infancy. Achieving this finer level of control would be highly desirable. For example, it might allow the pharmacological editing of pathogenic immune responses without restricting the ability of the immune system to defend against infection. On the diagnostic side, a method to comprehensively monitor the circulating, antigen-specific antibody population could provide a treasure trove of clinically useful biomarkers, since many diseases expose the immune system to characteristic molecules that are deemed foreign and elicit the production of antibodies against them. This Perspective will discuss the state-of-the-art of this area with a focus on what we consider seminal opportunities for the chemistry community to contribute to this important field.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadaptive immunity 3aantibodies 3abiomarkers 3abiomedical research 3achemistry 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3aneoplasms 3avaccine development 3avaccines1 aSarkar, Mohosin1 aKodadek, Thomas0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 May 18, v. 138, no. 19 p.6076-6094dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b029543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245013400164300001600298520168100314592002801995650001902023650001802042650001602060650001902076650001102095650001102106650001902117650002102136650001102157650003102168650002902199650002102228650001302249650002202262650002002284650001702304650002202321650001902343651001002362653002802372653003902400653002302439653002602462653002102488700001902509700001902528773011202547856008602659852000902745655001202754IND60592478120221118040406.0201209e20180520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059247812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.2772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jun10aExploring the driving forces of energy consumption and environmental pollution in China's cement industry at the provincial level  ap. 274-285.  aIdentifying strategies for reducing energy consumption and environmental pollution in China's cement industry requires a comprehensive analysis of the sector on various scales, taking into account, in particular, the heterogeneity of abatement options. We develop a spatial and temporal decomposition analysis to quantitatively examine the driving forces of energy consumption and emissions of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and air pollutant emissions in China's cement industry at the national and provincial scales during the period 2005–2012. The results show that, nationally, due to the rapid growth of cement and clinker production, CO₂ emissions experienced a substantial increase. While the emissions of Sulphur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) were found to initially decrease (due to stringent air pollution standards), and then rose due to the increase of cement production. At the provincial level, we also observe that the developing regions (e.g. Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Sichuan) have a large share of total emissions of CO₂ and air pollutants, while the megacities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin contributed less to the total emissions. From spatial decomposition perspective, the energy intensity and emission factor affect CO₂ emissions largely but have a negative linear relationship primarily in developing regions. The findings in this study can directly be used to narrow down the projection of GHG mitigation and air pollution abatement on economic and technical perspectives and help policy maker to identify priority options for tackling the issues of global climate change and improve regional air quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acarbon dioxide 3acement 3acities 3aclimate change 3aemissions factor 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3anitrogen oxides 3aparticulates 3apollution control 3asulfur dioxide 3aChina 0aChinese cement industry 0aSpatial and temporal decomposition 0aEnergy consumption 0aCO2 and air pollution 0aProvincial scale1 aZhang, Shaohui1 aWagner, Fabian0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 May 20, v. 184 p.274-285dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.2773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010000173300001600273520132700289536006901616592002801685596002001713650001901733650002101752650001001773650001301783650001101796650001401807650001301821650001801834650001301852651001201865653002001877653001501897653001501912653001401927653001401941653001401955653001401969700002201983700002202005700002402027700002502051773013902076856008502215852000902300655001202309IND60750582220221123040310.0210915e20210903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075058222DNAL7 a10.1080/10256016.2021.19705482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvetisyan, Khoren10aEutrophication leads to the formation of a sulfide-rich deep-water layer in Lake Sevan, Armenia  ap. 535-552.  aLake Sevan is a meso-eutrophic water body, which was severely impacted by anthropogenic level decrease, pollution and eutrophication during the last century. Starting in the 1970s, these processes resulted in the formation of an oxygen-depleted hypolimnion during summer–autumn stratification of the lake. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that eutrophication of the lake leads not only to the full depletion of oxygen and nitrate in the hypolimnion but as well to the presence of sulfate-reducing microorganisms and toxic hydrogen sulfide. Concentrations of hydrogen sulfide in the hypolimnion of Major and Minor Sevan in October were as high as 9 and 39 μM, respectively. In October 2019, 66 % of lake's bottom was covered by sulfidic waters, while the fraction of sulfidic water volume reached 19 %. Values of δ³⁴S for hypolimnetic sulfide are lower by only 7–12 ‰ compared to epilimnetic sulfate, while δ³³S values of sulfide are similar to the δ³³S values of sulfate. These isotopic fingerprints are not consistent with microbial sulfate reduction as the sole source of hydrogen sulfide in the hypolimnion. We attribute the formation of a sulfidic deep-water layer to a combination of microbial sulfate reduction in the water column and diffusion of hydrogen sulfide from the sediments.  aWe would like to thank FAST Foundation for funding the research.  aPublisher supplied data  cFAST Foundation 3aeutrophication 3ahydrogen sulfide 3alakes 3anitrates 3aoxygen 3apollution 3asulfates 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3aArmenia 0abiogeochemistry 0adeep-water 0aLake Sevan 0anutrients 0asulfur-32 0asulfur-33 0asulfur-341 aMirzoyan, Natella1 aPayne, Rayford B.1 aHayrapetyan, Vardan1 aKamyshny Jr., Alexey0 tIsotopes in environmental and health studies.g2021 Sept. 03, v. 57, no. 5 p.535-552dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12222x1477-26397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2021.19705483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01929naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245011300165300001400278520080900292592002801101650001201129650001101141650001201152650001301164650001501177650001501192650001201207650001701219650001801236651001101254653001901265653001601284653002201300700001801322773011701340856007701457852000901534655001201543IND60519988920221120104028.0160512e20140925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051998892DNAL7 a10.2478/ffp-2014-00072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaliszewski, Adam10aPredictions on Availability and Possibilities of the use of Wood for Energy Purposes in Europe and in Poland  ap. 71-78.  aThe paper presents the results of studies concerning the availability and possibilities of the use of wood for energy purposes in Europe and in Poland.

So as to be effective, wood resources management should give a priority to wood-based production of the greatest added value, and energy generation should be a closing-down stage in the wood value chain  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aenergy 3aforests 3afuelwood 3aharvesting 3aprediction 3asociety 3asupply chain 3awood industry 3aPoland 0aclimate policy 0aenergy wood 0awood-based sector1 aGołos, Piotr0 tFolia forestalia Polonica.g2014 Sept. 25, v. 56, no. 2 p.71-78dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:14917x2199-59077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ffp-2014-00073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245015500181300001800336520120900354592002801563650001701591650001801608650001401626650002001640650001201660650001101672650001901683650002101702650001301723650001101736650002801747650002101775650001901796650001901815650001001834650001201844650002101856650002901877650006901906650002401975650006401999650007102063650002702134650003302161650002202194650002202216700001802238773009802256856008102354852000902435655001202444IND4469799520221118173359.0160225e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446979952DNAL7 a220650632pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-011-2709-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Seon-Mi10aLarvicidal activity of medicinal plant extracts and lignan identified in Phryma leptostachya var. asiatica roots against housefly (Musca domestica L.)  ap. 1849-1853.  aMedicinal plant extracts from 27 plant species in 20 families were tested for their larvicidal activity against housefly, Musca domestica (L.). Responses varied with plant material and concentration. Among plant species tested, Phryma leptostachya var. asiatica showed 100% larvicidal activity against M. domestica at 10 mg/g concentration. Larvicidal activities of Atractylodes japonica, Saussurea lappa, Asiasarum sieboldi, and Gleditsia japonica var. koraiensis were 89.3%, 85.3%, 93.3%, and 96.6% at 10 mg/g concentration, respectively. Extracts of Prunus persica, Curcuma longa, and Paeonia moutan produced moderate activity. Larvicidal activity of other plant extracts was less than 50%. Among test plant species, P. leptostachya var. asiatica showed the most potent larvicidal activity. The active constituent of P. leptostachya var. asiatica roots was identified as the leptostachyol acetate by spectroscopic analysis. The LC₅₀ values of leptostachyol acetate against M. domestica larvae were 0.039 mg/g. Naturally occurring medicinal plant extracts and P. leptostachya var. asiatica root-derived compounds merit further study as potential housefly larval control agents or lead compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtractylodes 3aCurcuma longa 3aGleditsia 3aMusca domestica 3aPaeonia 3aPhryma 3aPrunus persica 3aSaussurea costus 3aacetates 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aplant response 3aroots 2aAnimals 2aFernsxchemistry 2aHousefliesxdrug effects 2aInsecticidesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aLignansxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPlant Rootsxchemistry 2aPlants, Medicinalxchemistry 2aSpectrum Analysis 2aSurvival Analysis1 aPark, Il-Kwon0 tParasitology research.g2012 May, v. 110, no. 5 p.1849-1853dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2709-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245011100161300001600272500001900288520152500307592002801832650002701860650002601887650001601913650002701929650002801956650001901984650001702003650001002020650002002030650001102050650002002061650001702081650001802098650002202116653002502138653002502163653001802188653001602206653001702222700002002239773012302259856007702382852000902459655001202468IND60726122820221119044231.0210201s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072612282DNAL7 a10.1139/cjm-2020-01422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapil, Shikha10ad-Amino acids in antimicrobial peptides: a potential approach to treat and combat antimicrobial resistance  ap. 119-137.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAntimicrobial resistance is one of the leading challenges in the human healthcare segment. Advances in antimicrobial resistance have triggered exploration of natural alternatives to stabilize its seriousness. Antimicrobial peptides are small, positively charged oligopeptides that are as potent as commercially available antibiotics against a wide spectrum of organisms, such as Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, viruses, and fungal strains. In addition to their antibiotic capabilities, these peptides possess anticancer activity, activate the immune response, and regulate inflammation. Peptides have distinct modes of action and fall into various categories due to their amino acid composition. Although antimicrobial peptides specifically target the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, they can also target the cell nucleus and protein synthesis. Owing to the increasing demand for novel treatments against the threat of antimicrobial resistance, naturally synthesized peptides are a beneficial development concept. Antimicrobial peptides are pervasive and can easily be modified using de-novo synthesis technology. Antimicrobial peptides can be isolated from natural resources such as humans, plants, bacteria, and fungi. This review gives a brief overview of antimicrobial peptides and their diastereomeric composition. Other current trends, the future scope of antimicrobial peptides, and the role of d-amino acids are also discussed, with a specific emphasis on the design and development of new drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid composition 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantineoplastic activity 3acell membranes 3acell nucleus 3afungi 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3aoligopeptides 3aprotein synthesis 0abacterial resistance 0acytoplasmic membrane 0ad-amino acids 0aenantiomers 0aTrojan horse1 aSharma, Vipasha0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2021, v. 67, no. 2 p.119-137dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44722x1480-32757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2020-01423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02093naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141245013300167300001600300520106200316592002801378653002401406653001901430653002401449653001501473653001401488653001901502700002301521700002501544773012401569856007701693852000901770655001201779IND60130732820221121233043.0151127e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013073282DNAL7 a10.3159/07-RA-045.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Shan––Shan14aThe capitate and peltate glandular trichomes of Lavandula pinnata L.

(Lamiaceae) glandular trichomes were studied in order to prepare for work on calcium distribution in normal and heat stressed plants. The secretory process was observed in both light and dark-grown plants. The secretion of the capitate glandular trichomes consists of both lipophilic and polysaccharidic substances (mainly the latter), while peltate glandular trichomes only secrete lipophilic substances. Our ultrastructural results are consistent with the finding that plastids are the main organelle that synthesizes the lipophilic substances, especially terpenes, while dictyosomes synthesize polysaccharides. The essential oil is most likely transported directly by the RER, while the polysaccharides reach the plasma membrane via Golgi-derived vesicles. Exocytosis is the main way that secretory products move from the cell to the subcuticular space. There are no differences in gland development or secretion between the light and dark-grown plants.  aPublisher supplied data 0aglandular trichomes 0ahistochemistry 0aLavandula pinnata L 0amorphology 0asecretion 0aultrastructure1 aKirchoff, Bruce K.1 aLiao, Jing––Ping0 tjournal of the Torrey Botanical Society.g2008 Apr., v. 135, no. 2 p.155-167dTorrey Botanical Societyx1095-56747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3159%2F07-RA-045.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245010700162300001600269520153600285592002801821650001301849650001501862650002201877650001501899650002201914650001201936650003501948650001901983650002102002650001502023650001302038650001702051650001802068650002802086650001302114650001202127651001102139653002102150653001202171653004002183653001402223653002502237700002202262773011902284856007702403852000902480655001202489IND60519989220221120113144.0160512e20140925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051998922DNAL7 a10.2478/ffp-2014-00102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrach, Michał10aApplication of Network Analysis for Development and Promotion of Sustainable Tourism in Public Forests  ap. 105-112.  aThe issue of sustainable tourism within valuable natural areas has been extensively discussed ever since the emergence of sustainable development philosophy in the 1990s. In view of growing public interest in nature recreation and tourism development, the importance of addressing this subject matter has hitherto increased significantly. The main objective of the present paper was to offer a tool for supporting development and promotion of sustainable tourism in Poland’s forests managed by the State Forests - National Forest Holding. GIS technology, and specific tools for network analysis were used in the project. During task realization, only free and open software sources were used. The work was performed based on the example of the Forest District Żołędowo (Regional Directorate of State Forests in Toruń, Poland) with the use of District’s spatial data resources. A web application was created to present information about tourist attractions and infrastructure on an interactive map with tools for route planning. As a result, there has been developed the web mapping application which provides general access to tourism related information and enables planning touristic routes by pre-specified criteria. Implemented routing algorithms can help traffic management and further protection of the areas vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures. The system created not only promotes attractive tourist sites but also, supports targeting tourist traffic, and accordingly - adds to the progress of sustainable tourism  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3aecotourism 3aforest recreation 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3ainfrastructure 3anational forests 3aphilosophy 3aplanning 3aspatial data 3astate forests 3asustainable development 3atourists 3atraffic 3aPoland 0anetwork analysis 0atourism 0ageographic information system (GIS) 0ageoportal 0aopen source software1 aGórski, Dariusz,0 tFolia forestalia Polonica.g2014 Sept. 25, v. 56, no. 2 p.105-112dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:14917x2199-59077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ffp-2014-00103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245010100207520181300308592002802121650001902149650002502168650001502193650001002208650002602218650001002244650002102254650001102275651001002286653002102296653002602317653001902343653001502362653002302377700006302400700002102463773011402484856008602598852000902684655001202693IND60783488620221116164941.0220830e20220925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078348862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1331452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9287-810912aA comparison of different waste collection methods: Environmental impacts and occupational risks  aMunicipal waste management, especially in developed countries, has a significant impact on the environment and humans that need to be quantified and mitigated. This study aims to investigate and compare the environmental impact and occupational risks of the following three municipal waste collection methods in Italy: street bins, door-to-door collection, and a smart bins system. Six waste categories (paper, plastics, glass, metal, organic materials, and residual waste) are analysed. Environmental performances are calculated by the life cycle assessment (LCA) and material and flow analysis (MFA) methodologies. The ergonomic analysis is based on direct observation of municipal waste collectors and the application of standard assessment methods as RULA, NIOSH, and Snook Ciriello. show that the smart bins collection method is environmentally more effective in all the impact categories considered, thanks to the better quality of collected waste. The residual waste flow directed to landfills has a lower value in the case of smart bins (36.63%) in comparison with door-to-door (52.90%) and street bins (89.56%). The use of smart bins allows higher environmental benefits, passing for the Climate Change impact category from −2.80E+01 kg of CO2eq. of the door-to-door system and −2.74E+01 kg of CO2eq. of street bins to −7.13E+01 kg of CO2eq. of smart bins. Regarding the transport phase, the smart bins system determines a reduction of the impact of about 60% if compared with the door-to-door system for all the impact categories considered. On the other hand, acceptable occupational risks result in street and smart waste collection methods, while poor ergonomics conditions are observed during the door-to-door collection. Containers lifting and emptying are the most critical tasks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental impact 3aergonomics 3aglass 3alife cycle assessment 3apaper 3awaste management 3awastes 3aItaly 0aWaste collection 0aLife cycle assessment 0aSustainability 0aErgonomics 0aOccupational risks1 aPapetti, Alessandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1020-60751 aGermani, Michele0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 25, v. 368 p.133145-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1331453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01933naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245018200153300002000335520074900355592002801104650001601132650001401148650002001162650001801182650001301200650002701213650001401240650001101254700001501265700001601280700001701296700001601313700002201329773012501351856007401476852000901550655001201559IND60641988620221119155810.0190506e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064198862DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04680d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapp, M.10aMono- and double carbonylation of aryl iodides with amine nucleophiles in the presence of recyclable palladium catalysts immobilised on a supported dicationic ionic liquid phase  ap. 44587-44597.  aSilica modified with organic dicationic moieties proved to be an excellent support for palladium catalysts used in the aminocarbonylation of aryl iodides.

Few studies have evaluated the influence of both environmental factors and disturbance history on invasive species distributions, or assessed synthetically the importance of landscape-level disturbances like historical land-use, forest harvesting, and contemporary forest fragmentation. We analyzed vegetation, soils, and recent and historical land-use and landscape context for forests across central and western Massachusetts to identify controls on invasive species distributions. Almost half (49.3%%) of 148 randomly selected sites had at least one non-native invasive plant present, and invasive species occurred more frequently on former agricultural sites than in continuous woodlands. We used logistic regression to model the probability of finding the four most common species: Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii DC), glossy buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula L.), multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora Thunb. ex Murr.), and oriental bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculata Thunb.). Soil richness was the most important predictor of invasive presence, with rich soils (i.e., lower C:N) being more likely to have these species. The structure of the current forested landscape (i.e., the amount of forest within a 10 km buffer around a site) is also important, with sites that are surrounded by more forest being less likely to have invasives. After accounting for variation in C:N ratios and the structure of the current forested landscape, historical land-use was not a significant predictor of non-native species occurrence; however, C:N ratios may be influenced by historical land-use and by current vegetation, thus complicating interpretations of this edaphic variable. Recent forest harvesting increased the likelihood of invasive occurrence for some but not all species. Overall, our results suggest that regional patterns of invasive plant distributions result from a complex function of edaphic conditions, and present and historical land-uses.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBerberis thunbergii 0aCelastrus orbiculata 0adisturbance 0aedge effects 0aforest management 0aglossy buckthorn 0ainvasive plant species 0aJapanese barberry 0aland-use legacies 0aMassachusetts 0amultiflora rose 0aoriental bittersweet 0aRhamnus frangula 0aRosa multiflora1 aMotzkin, Glenn1 aFoster, David R.0 tjournal of the Torrey Botanical Society.g2008 Apr., v. 135, no. 2 p.260-271dTorrey Botanical Societyx1095-56747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3159%2F08-RA-012.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03608naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009800165520214500263592002802408650001602436650002602452650001402478650001902492650001502511650001402526650000902540650002002549650001102569650002202580650002302602650002902625650001502654650002102669650001502690653002902705653002102734653001002755653002402765653002202789700001802811700001502829700001302844700001602857700002002873773011402893856008603007852000903093655001203102IND60783488720221116164823.0220830e20220925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078348872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1331462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Chen10aRefined landslide susceptibility analysis based on InSAR technology and UAV multi-source data  aLandslide susceptibility analysis at the regional scale is the focus of landslide risk management. To obtain more accurate and guiding significance results of landslide susceptibility, it is necessary to conduct a refined analysis on the basis of regional scale. Therefore, we proposed a refined method for landslide susceptibility assessment. This method comprehensively considered the geological and dynamic surface deformation information, and was applied in some areas of Maoxian County. We selected twelve influencing factors (elevation, slope, relief amplitude, curvature, aspect, engineering geological rock group, distance to fault, distance to river, land type, vegetation type, and topographic wetness index, rainfall) and used the traditional machine learning method for landslide susceptibility. Then, the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology was introduced to modify the unsuitable zoning of the traditional landslide susceptibility. Based on the improved landslide susceptibility mapping, field investigation and UAV models were used to verify. The results showed that the introduction of InSAR technology and UAV multi-source data can rationalize the inappropriate zoning in traditional landslide susceptibility, and landslides (L1 and L7) with very high susceptibility were identified. The field investigation and spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of typical landslides indicated that both L1 and L7 were severely damaged and in the deformation stage. L1 showed significant deformation during road construction. However, the deformation of L1 reacted on the pavement, resulting in many tensile cracks. The deformation of L7 was mainly affected by rainfall and presented the characteristics of seasonal variation, and the deformation was accelerated in the rainy season. Therefore, the proposed method had a better performance in landslide susceptibility and improved the accuracy. It can realize the refined analysis of landslide susceptibility in a large area and provide technical support for geological hazard susceptibility assessment and reference for disaster prevention and mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3adisaster preparedness 3aevolution 3ainterferometry 3alandslides 3apavements 3arain 3arisk management 3arivers 3aroad construction 3aseasonal variation 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atopography 3avegetation types 3awet season 0aLandslide susceptibility 0aMachine learning 0aInSAR 0aField investigation 0aMulti-source data1 aZhu, Kuanxing1 aXu, Peihua1 aShan, Bo1 aYang, Guang1 aSong, Shengyuan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 25, v. 368 p.133146-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1331463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006500168300001800233520125800251592002801509650001301537650000901550650002501559650001001584650001501594650001301609650001801622650001001640650000901650650002101659653001701680653001001697653002101707700001901728700001501747700001801762700001901780700002101799700001901820700002201839700002201861700002101883773010701904856008502011852000902096655001202105IND60537053120221120033953.0160807e20160728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053705312DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2015.10221862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmara, Peter10aHand planter for maize (Zea mays L.) in the developing world  ap. 1233-1239.  aThird world maize (Zea mays L.) production is characterized by having extremely low yields, attributed in part to the poor planting methods employed. Maize planting in most third world countries involves placing 2–3 seeds per hill, with hills being roughly 30 cm apart. The variability in seeds per hill and distance between hills result in heterogeneous plant stands that are directly responsible for lower yields. Oklahoma State University (OSU) has developed a durable hand planter with a reciprocating internal drum that delivers single maize seeds per strike and that can also be used for mid-season application of urea fertilizer. The hand planter is 1.4 m in length, 5.8 cm in diameter, and weighs 1.9 kg when empty. The seed hopper has the capacity to hold 1 kg of seed and the tip has a sharp pointed shovel which can deliver seed to a planting depth of 5 cm in no-till and tilled soils. The current prototype has been comprehensively tested and evaluated to deliver at least 80% single seeds (singulation), with 0% misses and work well across varying seed sizes (2652–4344 seeds/kg) and different operators. Using the OSU hand planter, third world maize producers with average yields of 2.0 Mg ha ⁻¹ could increase yields by 20%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3adeveloping countries 3ahills 3ano-tillage 3aplanting 3aplanting seed 3aseeds 3asoil 3aurea fertilizers 0aHand planter 0amaize 0aplant population1 aAula, Lawrence1 aRaun, Bill1 aTaylor, Randy1 aKoller, Adrian1 aLam, E.q(Eric),1 aRinger, Joshua1 aMullock, Jeremiah1 aDhital, Sulochana1 aMacnack, Natasha0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2016 July 28, v. 39, no. 9 p.1233-1239dTaylor & Francisx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2015.10221863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003200112245009200144300001600236520129100252592002801543650001001571650001301581650001001594650001001604650001201614650001401626773012801640852000901768655001201777IND60445632920221117002506.0151029e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044563292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVabishchevich, Anastasia P.10aTwo Strategies of between-Season Changes in the Song Composition of the Pied Flycatcher  ap. 219-230.  aIn Oscine species, changes in songs are age-dependent: some species do not change their singing repertoires after a short sensitive period, whereas others may include new songs throughout their lives. In many cases, changes in singing repertoires are more pronounced between the first and second years of life. I describe changes in song composition from one year to the next in 23 pied-flycatcher males, which differed in breeding plumage coloration. Eight yearling birds showed profound between-season syllable repertoire turnover whereas seven yearlings and eight older males retained their previous song composition. Males with profound changes in their repertoire were significantly paler, arrived later and had smaller first-year repertoires than other males. Although additional studies are needed to clarify the relationship between these factors, it seems plausible that dark- and pale-coloured pied-flycatcher males have different patterns of between-season repertoire turnover: pale males change their syllable repertoire sufficiently between the first and second years of life but not thereafter, whereas dark males develop a rather stabilised repertoire by the first year of life. This agrees with the finding that pale and dark birds exhibit different breeding strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3abreeding 3acolor 3amales 3aplumage 3ayearlings0 tAnnales zoologici Fennici.g2012 Aug., v. 49, no. 4 p.219-230dFinnish Zoological and Botanical Publishingx0003-455X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245011400162300001600276520165400292592002801946650002001974650002201994650002902016650001202045650001102057650002902068650001802097650001702115650001502132650002802147650002202175650002202197650001202219650002002231650001902251650001402270650000702284650002202291650003302313650001002346651000902356653001502365653002602380653001602406653000902422653001902431700002302450700001902473700003402492700002202526773011802548856007702666852000902743655001202752IND60519989420221120113251.0160512e20141230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051998942DNAL7 a10.2478/ffp-2014-00132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeydari, Mehdi10aEarthworms as indicators for different forest management types and human disturbance in Ilam oak forest, Iran  ap. 121-134.  aThere has been observed widespread destruction of natural ecosystems around the world due to population growth, land use change and clear cutting which have affected soil properties. Different management strategies have been so far implemented to reduce this crisis in various regions of the world, such as e.g. short-term and long-term conservation management in the Zagros region. However, any management approach should be evaluated with appropriate measures to determine how managed areas respond. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential of earthworms as an indicator for different forest management strategies and human disturbances in Zagros oak (Quercus persica Jaub. and Spach) forest. The sites selected included undisturbed one as the control (Un), the sites under five-year conservation management (FCM) and twenty-year conservation management (TCM) as well as the disturbed site (D). The results of principal component analysis (PCA) showed that different regions separated into the components: PC1 and PC2. Un and TCM sites gathered together and represented higher values of the factors such as pH, Kₐᵥₐᵢₗₐbₗₑ, OC, clay content, Pₐᵥₐᵢₗₐbₗₑ, CEC, overstory tree canopy, Nₜₒₜ, biomass and abundance of earthworms. The positive direction of the first axis reflected a gradient of EC, BD and Pₜₒₜ. According to the logistic model, NH₄-N and EC played the most important role in earthworm presence and absence in Zagros forest ecosystem. Earthworm abundance and biomass could be a good indicator to evaluate different forest management strategies in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus brantii 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass 3acanopy 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay fraction 3aclearcutting 3aearthworms 3aelectrical conductivity 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest management 3aforests 3aland use change 3alogit analysis 3aoverstory 3apH 3apopulation growth 3aprincipal component analysis 3atrees 3aIran 0aearthworms 0amanagement strategies 0adisturbance 0asoil 0alogistic model1 aPoorbabaei, Hassan1 aBazgir, Masoud1 aṢāliḥī, ʻAlīc(actor)1 aEshaghirad, Javad0 tFolia forestalia Polonica.g2014 Dec. 30, v. 56, no. 3 p.121-134dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:14917x2199-59077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ffp-2014-00133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245006600158300001600224500001900240520130900259592002801568650002801596650001501624650001001639650001801649650001701667650001101684650001101695650001601706650001401722650002801736650001501764650001101779653001401790653001901804700002401823773009701847856007801944852000902022655001202031IND60726123220221119044139.0210202s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072612322DNAL7 a10.1139/gen-2019-02072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPridie, C.14aThe role of Peroxin 7 during Drosophila embryonic development  ap. 119-137.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPeroxisomes are organelles in eukaryotic cells responsible for processing several types of lipids and management of reactive oxygen species. A conserved family of peroxisome biogenesis (Peroxin, Pex) genes encode proteins essential to peroxisome biogenesis or function. In yeast and mammals, PEROXIN7 (PEX7) acts as a cytosolic receptor protein that targets enzymes containing a peroxisome targeting signal 2 (PTS2) motif for peroxisome matrix import. The PTS2 motif is not present in the Drosophila melanogaster homologs of these enzymes. However, the fly genome contains a Pex7 gene (CG6486) that is very similar to yeast and human PEX7. We find that Pex7 is expressed in tissue-specific patterns analogous to differentiating neuroblasts in D. melanogaster embryos. This is correlated with a requirement for Pex7 in this cell lineage as targeted somatic Pex7 knockout in embryonic neuroblasts reduced survival. We also found that Pex7 over-expression in the same cell lineages caused lethality during the larval stage. Targeted somatic over-expression of a Pex7 transgene in neuroblasts of Pex7 homozygous null mutants resulted in a semi-lethal phenotype similar to targeted Pex7 knockout. These findings suggest that D. melanogaster has tissue-specific requirements for Pex7 during embryo development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3abiogenesis 3adeath 3aembryogenesis 3ahomozygosity 3ahumans 3alarvae 3aperoxisomes 3aphenotype 3areactive oxygen species 3atransgenes 3ayeasts 0aPeroxin 7 0aCRISPR-TRiP-KO1 aSimmonds, Andrew J.0 tGenome.g2021, v. 64, no. 2 p.119-137dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl41235x1480-33217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-2019-02073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245008400203300002000287506007600307520166400383592002802047506003702075650001202112650002802124650001702152650001402169650001202183650001202195650001602207700002102223700002002244700001902264700002402283700002602307773017602333856008302509852000902592655001202601IND4481145120221207110400.0120502e20110906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448114512DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11087851082doi7 aPMC31691342pmcid7 a218732192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeary, Greg P.13aThecentral cavity in trimeric glutamate transporters restricts ligand diffusion  ap. 14980-14985.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA prominent aqueous cavity is formed by the junction of three identical subunits in the excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) family. To investigate the effect of this structure on the interaction of ligands with the transporter, we recorded currents in voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes expressing EAATs and used concentration jumps to measure binding and unbinding rates of a high-affinity aspartate analog that competitively blocks transport (Î²-2-fluorenyl-aspartylamide; 2-FAA). The binding rates of the blocker were approximately one order of magnitude slower than L-Glu and were not significantly different for EAAT1, EAAT2, or EAAT3, but 2-FAA exhibited higher affinity for the neuronal transporter EAAT3 as a result of a slower dissociation rate. Unexpectedly, the rate of recovery from block was increased by L-Glu in a saturable and concentration-dependent manner, ruling out a first-order mechanism and suggesting that following unbinding, there is a significant probability of ligand rebinding to the same or neighboring subunits within a trimer. Consistent with such a mechanism, coexpression of wild-type subunits with mutant (R447C) subunits that do not bind glutamate or 2-FAA also increased the unblocking rate. The data suggest that electrostatic and steric factors result in an effective dissociation rate that is approximately sevenfold slower than the microscopic subunit unbinding rate.

The inland propagation of the resulting pulses in groundwater levels is consistent with an analytical model (without recharge) based on shallow aquifer theory (Nash Sutcliffe model efficiencies of >0.7, maximum water-table level estimates within 0.1 m of observations). Infiltration of precipitation results in approximately a threefold increase in the groundwater level relative to the amount of rainfall. The analytical model (with recharge) driven with estimated ocean shoreline water levels (based on the 36-hr-averaged offshore tide, surge, and wave height) and measured precipitation predicts the maximum water-table height within 0.15 m of that observed across the barrier island during Hurricane Matthew, which was the only wave event during the 3-yr data set with more than 0.1 m rainfall.Citizen-science reports from a smartphone app (iFlood) are used to evaluate the regional application of the model. Twenty-five ocean-side reports associated with 7 ocean storms (6 of which had minimal rainfall) between Sept 2019 and Feb 2020 showed flooding on natural (permeable) land surfaces along 70 km of the northern Outer Banks barrier island, from Corolla to Rodanthe, NC. The analytical model (with recharge) predicts flooding that is consistent with the timing and location for 19 of the 25 reports. Applying the model regionally suggests that more than 10% of the land area on the ocean side of the northern Outer Banks would be inundated by coastal groundwater even in the absence of rainfall for an ocean storm that generates a 2.25 m increase in the shoreline water level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acorolla 3adata collection 3agroundwater 3ahurricanes 3aislands 3amobile telephones 3amodels 3arain 3ashorelines 3awater table 0aCoastal hydrogeology 0aFlooding 0aLand-sea connection 0aStorms 0aCompound events 0aCitizen science1 aRaubenheimer, Britt1 aElgar, Steve1 aCross, Sandy1 aLegner, Christian1 aRyan, David0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Dec., v. 603 p.126920-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1269203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245012500166300001600291520114900307592002801456650001001484650001601494650001301510650001201523650002201535650001901557650002501576650001401601650001801615650001201633650001201645650001901657650001401676650001401690650001301704650000701717650001401724650001101738650002001749650001201769650001301781650002201794650001501816651002201831651001101853653001801864653002001882653002401902700002501926700001901951700002101970700001901991773011802010856007702128852000902205655001202214IND60519989620221120124326.0160512e20141230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051998962DNAL7 a10.2478/ffp-2014-00152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMałek, Stanisław10aEffect of deforestation on stream and spring water chemistry in Malinowski and Czyrna catchments in Beskid Âlàski Mts.  ap. 141-148.  aDieback of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst) which has been observed in the Western Carpathians is of interest to scientists from many disciplines.. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of deforestation on water chemical composition in mountainous streams and springs. The research was carried out in 2004 and 2013 in two catchments of the Skrzyczne massif in the Silesian Beskid Mountains. Field studies included measurements of water pH and conductivity. Under laboratory conditions, there were determined concentrations: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, NH₄⁺, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻, SO₄² in each water sample. The results of physical and chemical analyses of water collected within the Malinowski catchment (covered mainly with spruce stands) and on northern slopes of the Skrzyczne massif - within the Czyrna catchment (covered mainly with beech stands), showed higher contents of base cations when compared to deforested areas. The highest concentrations of the ions analysed were recorded within the Czyrna catchment. Such phenomena should be taken into consideration during forest reconstruction after spruce dieback.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aPicea abies 3aammonium 3acalcium 3achemical analysis 3achemical bases 3achemical composition 3achlorides 3adeforestation 3adieback 3aforests 3ahydrochemistry 3amagnesium 3amountains 3anitrates 3apH 3apotassium 3asodium 3asprings (water) 3astreams 3asulfates 3atopographic slope 3awatersheds 3aCarpathian region 3aPoland 0aafforestation 0awater chemistry 0aWestern Carpathians1 aKrakowian, Katarzyna1 aJasik, Michał1 aDudek, Katarzyna1 aBátor, Martin0 tFolia forestalia Polonica.g2014 Dec. 30, v. 56, no. 3 p.141-148dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:14917x2199-59077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ffp-2014-00153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04055naa a2200985 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014000170520162600310592002801936650001401964650001301978650002001991650001502011650002402026650001002050650002002060650001302080650001802093650002202111650001902133650002602152650002202178650001902200650002002219650001102239650001502250650001902265650001902284650001602303653002202319653002102341653002702362653003102389653001202420653000802432653001402440653000902454653000802463653000802471653000802479653000802487653000802495653000802503653000802511653000802519653001002527653001002537653001102547653001102558653001002569653001002579653000802589653000802597653000802605653001102613653001102624653001102635653000702646653000702653653000702660653000802667653000802675653000902683653000802692653000802700653000802708700001802716700001702734700001802751700001702769700001402786700001902800700001602819700001702835700001902852773009202871856008502963852000903048655001203057IND60683451120221116165809.0200210e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068345112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1206392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Hyun-Deok12aA novel dried blood spots analysis combined with on-spot reaction for determination of trimethylamine N-oxide and its related compounds  aThe application of dried blood spots in clinical research is becoming increasingly popular owing to its convenient collection, storage, and transportation compared to that of conventional biological samples. The potential of trimethylamine N-oxide and its related compounds as biomarkers for various cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, stroke, thrombosis, and heart failure, was recently highlighted, which was the driving force behind the development of an analytical method to identify trimethylamine N-oxide and eight related compounds in dried blood spots. In the proposed method, a novel “on-spot reaction” approach was introduced to overcome the low loading efficiency of trimethylamine in dried blood spots. Upon the addition of 50 μL of blood onto the filter paper pretreated with dilute HCl, an acid–base neutralization reaction in the blood spots transformed the volatile trimethylamine to a salt. Next, a punched disc with a diameter of 6.0 mm was eluted by agitation with 20 mM ammonium formate for 10 min and derivatized with 1.0 M ethyl bromoacetate at 80 °C for 60 min. A surrogate analyte approach was employed for quantification of these endogenous compounds in the complex matrix. Analysis was carried out using zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry. The established method was validated and applied to monitor real samples from 30 clinical cases. The proposed new methodology based on dried blood spots could greatly improve the convenience, analytical sensitivity, and selectivity of cardiovascular disease testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagitation 3aammonium 3aatherosclerosis 3abiomarkers 3abiomedical research 3ablood 3adetection limit 3aformates 3aheart failure 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrophilicity 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aneutralization 3anitrogen oxides 3astroke 3athrombosis 3atransportation 3atrimethylamine 3azwitterions 0aDried blood spots 0aOn-spot reaction 0aTrimethylamine N-oxide 0aSurrogate analyte approach 0aLC–MS 0aDBS 0aLC–HRMS 0aTMAO 0aTMA 0aCAR 0aCHL 0aBET 0aGBB 0aTML 0aDMG 0aHCY 0aMeBAc 0aEtBAc 0aiPrBAc 0atBuBAc 0aPhBAc 0aBzBAc 0aDSS 0aDMS 0a903 0aDMPK-A 0aDMPK-B 0aDMPK-C 0aAA 0aSA 0aRF 0aNTS 0aMMS 0aLLOQ 0aHct 0aPBS 0aDTT1 aKim, Junghyun1 aLee, Ji-Youn1 aKim, Ye-Yeong1 aLee, Yeoreum1 aJo, Eunji1 aSuh, Joon Hyuk1 aLee, Jaeick1 aCha, Sangwon1 aHan, Sang Beom0 tTalanta.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 210 p.120639-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1206393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006300144245016000207300001800367500001900385520172300404592002802127650001102155650001402166650001402180650002102194650001702215650001202232650001402244650002202258650001302280653001402293653002102307653001602328653002202344653001302366653003002379653002002409700005502429700005902484700006702543773013902610856007802749852000902827655001202836IND60728776420210831000000.0210224e20210216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072877642DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c195792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKopač Lautar, Anja1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8945-576X10aBuilding Ab Initio Interface Pourbaix diagrams to Investigate Electrolyte Stability in the Electrochemical Double Layer: Application to Magnesium Batteries  ap. 8263-8273.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInsights into the electrochemical processes occurring at the electrode–electrolyte interface are a crucial step in most electrochemistry domains and in particular in the optimization of the battery technology. However, studying potential-dependent processes at the interface is one of the biggest challenges, both for theoreticians and experimentalists. The challenge is pushed further when stable species also depend on the concentration of specific ligands in the electrolyte, such as chlorides. Herein, we present a general theoretical ab initio methodology to compute a Pourbaix-like diagram of complex electrolytes as a function of electrode potential and anion’s chemical potential, that is, concentration. This approach is developed not only for the bulk properties of the electrolytes but also for electrode–electrolyte interfaces. In the case of chlorinated magnesium complexes in dimethoxyethane, we show that the stability domains of the different species are strongly shifted at the interface compared to the bulk of the electrolyte because of the strong local electric fields and charges occurring in the double layer. Thus, as the interfacial stability domains are strongly modified, this approach is necessary to investigate all interface properties that often govern the reaction kinetics, such as solvent degradation at the electrode. Interface Pourbaix diagram is used to give some insights into the improved stability at the Mg anode induced by the addition of chloride. Because of its far-reaching insights, transferability, and wide applicability, the methodology presented herein should serve as a valuable tool not only for the battery community but also for the wider electrochemical one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3achlorides 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aligands 3amagnesium 3areaction kinetics 3asolvents 0ainterface 0aPourbaix diagram 0aelectrolyte 0amagnesium battery 0achloride 0adensity functional theory 0agrand canonical1 aBitenc, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0109-81211 aDominko, Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6673-44591 aFilhol, Jean-Sébastien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3681-92670 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Feb. 16, v. 13, no. 7 p.8263-8273dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c195793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008800175300001800263500001500281520102000296592002801316650002101344650003701365650002201402650000901424650002701433650000901460650002401469650000901493650002001502650002701522650001601549650002101565650002901586650001501615651000901630653001601639653004201655653002401697653002401721700002301745700002801768700002201796700001901818773010701837856008501944852000902029655001202038IND60537053520221120033843.0160807e20160728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053705352DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2015.10867972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavaran Hagh, Elnaz10aOptimizing phosphorus use in sustainable maize cropping via mycorrhizal inoculation  ap. 1348-1356.  a2019-12-06  aMore details have yet to be indicated on the interactions between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and phosphorus (P) chemical fertilization under field conditions.

At the corners of epithelia, the tricellular junction (TCJ) is formed by three adjacent epithelial cells and generates a functional barrier. In Drosophila, a key TCJ protein is Gliotactin (Gli) where loss of Gli disrupts barrier formation and function. Conversely, overexpressed Gli spreads away from the TCJ and triggers apoptosis, delamination, and cell migration. Thus, Gli protein levels are tightly regulated and by two mechanisms, at the protein levels by tyrosine phosphorylation and endocytosis and at the mRNA level through microRNA-184. Regulation of Gli mRNA is mediated through a Gli–BMP–miR184 feedback loop. Excessive Gli triggers BMP signaling pathway through the activation of Tkv type-I BMP receptor and Mad. Elevated level of pMad induces micrRNA-184 expression which in turn targets the Gli 3′UTR and mRNA degradation. Gli activation of Tkv is not through its ligand Dpp but rather through the inhibition of Dad, an inhibitory-Smad. Here, we show that ectopic expression of Gli interferes with Tkv–Dad association by sequestering Dad away from Tkv. The reduced inhibitory effect of Dad on Tkv results in the increased Tkv–pMad signaling activity, and this effect is continuous through larval and pupal wing formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aapoptosis 3acell adhesion 3acell movement 3adelamination 3aendocytosis 3aepithelium 3agenome 3alarvae 3aligands 3apermeability 3aphosphorylation 3apupae 3atyrosine 0aGliotactin 0aDad 0aTkv 0aBMP 0atricellular junction1 aAuld, Vanessa J.0 tGenome.g2021, v. 64, no. 2 p.97-108dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl41235x1480-33217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-2020-00263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245009700208300001600305506007600321520170100397592002802098506003702126650005302163650002502216650001702241650001802258650001802276650002302294650001602317650001202333650002202345650001102367650001402378650001402392650002202406650000902428650001102437651001802448700002202466700002402488700001502512700002002527773015502547856007902702852000902781655001202790IND60114881120221207141729.0141124e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011488112DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.113.0684372doi7 aPMC44413182pmcid7 a241964032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Yoon-Hyeong10aAntioxidant vitamins and magnesium and the risk of hearing loss in the US general population  ap. 148-155.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: The protective effects of antioxidant vitamins on hearing loss are well established in animal studies but in few human studies. Recent animal studies suggest that magnesium intake along with antioxidants may act in synergy to prevent hearing loss.Objective: We examined associations between intake of antioxidant vitamins (daily β-carotene and vitamins C and E) and magnesium and hearing thresholds and explored their joint effects in US adults.Design: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 2592 participants aged 20–69 y from NHANES 2001–2004. Hearing thresholds as pure tone averages (PTAs) at speech (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) and high frequencies (3, 4, and 6 kHz) were computed.Results: When examined individually, modeled as quartiles, and after adjustment for potential confounders, higher intakes of β-carotene, vitamin C, and magnesium were associated with lower (better) PTAs at both speech and high frequencies. High intakes of β-carotene or vitamin C combined with high magnesium compared with low intakes of both nutrients were significantly associated with lower (better) PTAs at high frequencies (−14.82%; 95% CI: −20.50% to −8.74% for β-carotene + magnesium and −10.72%; 95% CI: −16.57% to −4.45% for vitamin C + magnesium). The estimated joint effects were borderline significantly larger than the sums of the individual effects [high β-carotene/low magnesium (−4.98%) and low β-carotene/high magnesium (−0.80%), P-interaction = 0.08; high vitamin C/low magnesium (−1.33%) and low vitamin C/high magnesium (2.13%), P-interaction = 0.09].Conclusion: Dietary intakes of antioxidants and magnesium are associated with lower risks of hearing loss.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abeta-carotene 3aclinical nutrition 3afood intake 3ahearing 3ahearing disorders 3ahumans 3amagnesium 3anutrients 3aprotective effect 3arisk 3aspeech 3aUnited States1 aMiller, Josef M.,1 aTucker, Katherine L1 aHu, Howard1 aPark, Sung Kyun0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2014 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.148-155dAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:jnl45206x0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.113.0684373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002100157245014000178300001400318520140700332592002801739650001401767650002001781650000901801650002301810650001101833650001101844650001301855650001001868653002401878653001601902653002401918653002701942653002201969653003301991653003602024653003602060653002302096653001502119653001502134653001302149653000802162653001202170653001102182773010502193856009102298852000902389655001202398IND60728275920221121172217.0210219e20171214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072827592DNAL7 a10.3897/natureconservation.23.136022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMöckel, Stefan,14aThe assessment of significant effects on the integrity of “Natura 2000” sites under Article 6(2) and 6(3) of the Habitats Directive  ap. 57-85.  aThis article investigates the question of how the significance of potential adverse effects on Natura 2000 sites – comprising sites of Community importance (SCI) and special protection areas (SPA) – can be determined legally and methodologically within the scope of appropriate assessments for projects and plans in accordance with Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC¹ (HD) and whether the results can be transferred to the prohibition of disturbance and deterioration stipulated in Article 6(2) HD. The assessment of significance is important as, according to the European Court of Justice (ECJ)² and the German Federal Administrative Court (BVerwG)³, a project or plan is only permissible if, in the light of the best scientific knowledge in the field and without reasonable scientific doubt, the plan or project will not have lasting significant adverse effects on the integrity of that site. In this process, all aspects of the plan or project have to be identified which may, either independently or in combination with other plans or projects, affect the conservation objectives of the site concerned. This also includes a specialist forecast. Furthermore, closer specification is required of the threshold above which a non-significant adverse effect turns into a significant adverse effect and whether thresholds for bagatelles can be attributed to the proposed development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropeans 3aadverse effects 3aarea 3aconservation areas 3acourts 3afields 3ahabitats 3awills 0aEuropean Union (EU) 0aNatura 2000 0asignificant effects 0aappropriate assessment 0aimpact assessment 0aprohibition of deterioration 0aArticle 6(2) Habitats Directive 0aArticle 6(3) Habitats Directive 0acumulative impacts 0athresholds 0abagatelles 0acase law 0aECJ 0aGermany 0aBVerwG0 tNature conservation.g2017 Dec. 14, v. 23 p.57-85dPensoft PublisherswJournal:6152x1314-33017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/natureconservation.23.136023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013400163300001600297500001500313520095900328592002801287650001601315650001301331650001101344650002001355650001201375650002201387650001801409650002401427650001901451650002001470650002101490653000801511653000801519653001401527653003301541653002801574653000701602653000901609653000801618653000601626653000701632653000801639653000801647653003101655653001001686653000801696653000701704653001701711653000701728653000801735653002301743653000801766700001701774700001601791700001501807700001601822700001601838700001701854773013701871856008302008852000902091655001202100IND60113893720221122055052.0190405e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011389372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pmpp.2013.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Lihua10aResistance of Malus plants to Diplocarpon mali infection is associated with the antioxidant system and defense signaling pathways  ap. 146-152.  a2019-12-04  aMarssonina apple blotch is one of the most severe diseases of apple. Using Malus sieversii and Malus prunifolia cv. Donghongguo, we investigated the levels of hydrogen peroxide, activities of both antioxidant and pathogenesis-related enzymes, and expression of marker genes for salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET) in pathways for defense regulation during incompatible and compatible interactions. In incompatible interaction, as the key enzymes of antioxidant system coordinated work, a ROS burst and associated SA-signaling were activated within 10 days post inoculation. This was followed by activation of JA-mediated defense signaling. Levels of pathogenesis-related enzymes were induced more strongly by Diplocarpon mali than in compatible interaction. Suppression of the ET pathway was associated with the resistance response. Our findings provide important clues for designing strategies to curb the effects of this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplocarpon 3aethylene 3aapples 3aMalus sieversii 3aenzymes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ajasmonic acid 3asignal transduction 3asalicylic acid 3agenetic markers 3aMalus prunifolia 0adpi 0aCAT 0aROS burst 0aPathogenesis-related enzymes 0aMarssonina apple blotch 0aFW 0aPAMP 0aROS 0ad 0aSA 0aSOD 0aACC 0aDefense signaling pathways 0aMalus 0aAPX 0aET 0aantioxidants 0aJA 0aETI 0aDisease resistance 0aPTI1 aZou, Yangjun1 aLi, Mingjun1 aKe, Xiwang1 aLi, Cuiying1 aLiang, Dong1 aMa, Fengwang0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g2013 Oct., v. 84 p.146-152dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.wJournal:jnl39032x0885-57657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2013.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245008900160300001600249520169500265592002801960650001601988650002002004650002302024650001202047650002102059650001102080650003102091650000902122651001402131651001602145700002302161700002102184700002402205700002402229700003002253700001702283700001602300700002202316700002102338700002002359773015502379856007902534852000902613655001202622IND60114881220221118143627.0141124e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011488122DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.113.0632712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, Bich10aEffect of vitamin D supplementation on antibiotic use: a randomized controlled trial  ap. 156-161.  aBackground: Observational data suggested that supplementation with vitamin D could reduce risk of infection, but trial data are inconsistent.Objective: We aimed to examine the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on antibiotic use.Design: We conducted a post hoc analysis of data from pilot D-Health, which is a randomized trial carried out in a general community setting between October 2010 and February 2012. A total of 644 Australian residents aged 60–84 y were randomly assigned to receive monthly doses of a placebo (n = 214) or 30,000 (n = 215) or 60,000 (n = 215) IU oral cholecalciferol for ≤12 mo. Antibiotics prescribed during the intervention period were ascertained by linkage with pharmacy records through the national health insurance scheme (Medicare Australia).Results: People who were randomly assigned 60,000 IU cholecalciferol had nonsignificant 28% lower risk of having antibiotics prescribed at least once than did people in the placebo group (RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.48, 1.07). In analyses stratified by age, in subjects aged ≥70 y, there was a significant reduction in antibiotic use in the high-dose vitamin D compared with placebo groups (RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.90), whereas there was no effect in participants aged <70 y (RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.58, 1.97) (P-interaction = 0.1).Conclusion: Although this study was a post hoc analysis and statistically nonsignificant, this trial lends some support to the hypothesis that supplementation with 60,000 IU vitamin D/mo is associated with lower risk of infection, particularly in older adults.

Current synthetic methods produce these materials as either insoluble, microcrystalline powders or as oriented thin films on various substrates, including single‐layer graphene (SLG). Under these conditions, COF thin films form on both the graphene‐coated and bare regions of the substrate, suggesting uncontrolled nucleation processes that occur either in solution or nonselectively on different surfaces. Here, we describe modified polymerization conditions that provide COF films selectively on SLG. This finding enables COF films to be grown on lithographically patterned SLG substrates, which provide insight into the uniformity of film growth across the substrate and factors relevant to their nucleation and growth. The ability to grow COF films selectively on lithographically patterned SLG will facilitate their integration into devices. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

However, the detection of the RbInSe₂ phase on the surface of chalcopyrite absorbers is very challenging due to its nanometric thickness and the limited information available about its fundamental properties. In this context, this work expounds a detailed analysis of the vibrational properties of RbInSe₂ that combines first-principle calculations with multiwavelength Raman scattering spectroscopy and provides a methodology for the detection and identification of very thin layers of this material employing solely optical measurements. As a result, here, we present the classification of the different vibrational modes together with the fingerprint Raman spectra of RbInSe₂ thin films measured under five different excitations (close to and far from resonance). The employment of a 442 nm excitation wavelength is found to be the most adequate strategy for the detection and characterization of the RbInSe₂ phase in view of its resonance with the band gap of the material and its low penetration depth. Additionally, the purity of the deposited thin films as well as the possible influence of the subjacent layers on the Raman spectra of the compound are also investigated by analyzing the presence of secondary phases and by measuring RbInSe₂ thin films deposited onto Mo-coated soda-lime glass, respectively. These results set the basis for the future evaluation of the suitability of Raman spectroscopy as a fast and nondestructive characterization technique for the reliable identification and characterization of the nanometric layers of RbInSe₂ in Cu(In,Ga)Se₂-based solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3afilms (materials) 3aglass 3aphysical chemistry 3asalts 3aselenides 3asemiconductors 3asolar cells 3avibrational properties 3awavelengths1 aKodalle, Tim1 aKormath Madam Raghupathy, Ramya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4667-97441 aMirhosseini, Hossein1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6179-15451 aKühne, Thomas D.1 aBecerril-Romero, Ignacio1 aPérez-Rodríguez, Alejandro1 aKaufmann, Christian A.1 aIzquierdo-Roca, Victor0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Dec. 21, v. 124, no. 2 p.1285-1291dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b087813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005400146245013600200300002000336520110400356592002801460650001601488650001801504650002601522650001401548650002001562650001501582650000901597650001601606650002201622650001101644650001701655650001801672650001701690650002101707650000701728650002001735650002001755650001601775653001301791653002401804653002201828653001701850653001701867700001701884700001701901700001501918700001701933700001501950700002001965700001401985773015001999856008002149852000902229655001202238IND60604227120221123044748.0180716e20171227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060422712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b044282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Zhuang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1826-363X10aChronic Heat Stress Impairs the Quality of Breast-Muscle Meat in Broilers by Affecting Redox Status and Energy-Substance Metabolism  ap. 11251-11258.  aWe investigated the molecular mechanisms by which chronic heat stress impairs the breast-meat quality of broilers. Broilers were assigned to three groups: the normal control (NC) group, heat-stress (HS) group, and pair-fed (PF) group. After 7 days of heat exposure (32 °C), the high temperature had caused oxidative stress; elevated the activity of citrate synthase (CS), the mRNA expression of M-CPT1, and the phosphorylation level of AMPKα; and reduced the mRNA expression of avUCP. After 14 days of heat exposure, the heat stress had increased the lightness and drip loss and decreased the pH and shear force of the breast meat. Additionally, the heat exposure had increased the mRNA expressions of FAS, ACC, and PDK4; the content of lipids; and the activities of lactic dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, and it had decreased the mRNA expression of M-CPT1 and the activity of CS. In conclusion, chronic heat stress impairs meat quality by causing mitochondria to malfunction and affecting energy-substance aerobic metabolism, resulting in increased glycolysis and intramuscular fat deposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast meat 3abreast muscle 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3adrip loss 3agene expression 3aglycolysis 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aintramuscular fat 3alipids 3ameat quality 3amessenger RNA 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3aphosphorylation 3apyruvate kinase 3atemperature 0abroilers 0achronic heat stress 0aenergy metabolism 0ameat quality 0amitochondria1 aHe, Xiaofang1 aMa, Bingbing1 aZhang, Lin1 aLi, Jiaolong1 aJiang, Yun1 aZhou, Guanghong1 aGao, Feng0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Dec. 27, v. 65, no. 51 p.11251-11258dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b044283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011900167300001600286520094100302592002801243650002201271650001401293650002001307650001601327650003101343650001501374650001801389653001301407653002401420653002101444653002301465653001901488653002201507700001901529700001701548773010401565856008401669852000901753655001201762IND60590467620221118091127.0200601e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059046762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2017.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamacho, A.G.10aPAF: A software tool to estimate free-geometry extended bodies of anomalous pressure from surface deformation data  ap. 235-243.  aWe present a software package to carry out inversions of surface deformation data (any combination of InSAR, GPS, and terrestrial data, e.g., EDM, levelling) as produced by 3D free-geometry extended bodies with anomalous pressure changes. The anomalous structures are described as an aggregation of elementary cells (whose effects are estimated as coming from point sources) in an elastic half space. The linear inverse problem (considering some simple regularization conditions) is solved by means of an exploratory approach. This software represents the open implementation of a previously published methodology (Camacho et al., 2011). It can be freely used with large data sets (e.g. InSAR data sets) or with data coming from small control networks (e.g. GPS monitoring data), mainly in volcanic areas, to estimate the expected pressure bodies representing magmatic intrusions.

Diet was first assessed in 1986 for men and in 1980 for women with a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and then repeatedly every 2–4 y. Cumulative consumption was calculated with all available FFQs from the diagnosis of CVD to the end of the follow-up in 2008.Results: During a median follow-up of 7.7 y (IQR: 4.2–11.8) for men and 5.8 y (IQR: 3.8–8.0) for women, we documented 1982 deaths (1142 from CVD and 344 from cancer) among men and 1468 deaths (666 from CVD and 197 from cancer) among women. In multivariable Cox regression models, the pooled RR of all-cause mortality from a comparison of the top with the bottom quintiles of the aMED score was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.91; P-trend < 0.001). The corresponding pooled RR for CVD mortality was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67, 1.09; P-trend = 0.30), for cancer mortality was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.11; P-trend = 0.10), and for other causes was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.97; P-trend = 0.01). A 2-point increase in adherence to the aMED score was associated with a 7% (95% CI: 3%, 11%) reduction in the risk of total mortality.Conclusion: Adherence to a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern was associated with lower all-cause mortality in individuals with CVD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMediterranean diet 3aclinical nutrition 3afood frequency questionnaires 3amen 3amortality 3amyocardial infarction 3anurses 3aregression analysis 3arisk reduction 3astroke 3awomen1 aRodriguez-Artalejo, Fernando1 aLi, Tricia Y1 aFung, Teresa T1 aLi, Shanshan1 aWillett, Walter,1 aRimm, Eric B1 aHu, Frank B.,0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2014 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.172-180dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.113.0681063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04664naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002300169245016300192300001300355520222600368592002802594650001802622650002502640650001702665650001902682650001602701650001402717650001902731650001702750650001702767650001302784650001502797650001102812650002302823650002002846650001502866650001102881650001202892650001902904650002502923650002202948650001102970650001002981650001702991650002803008650004003036650002803076650001603104650001303120650001303133650002303146650004303169650004503212650002103257650003503278650007003313650003103383650005303414650005203467650002403519650003403543650002603577700002103603700002303624700002503647700002703672773010203699856008403801852000903885655001203894IND60113893920221123044145.0141112e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011389392DNAL7 a228858952pmid7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetridis, Antonios10aEffect of water deficit on leaf phenolic composition, gas exchange, oxidative damage and antioxidant activity of four Greek olive (Olea europaea L.) cultivars  ap. 1-11.  aThe olive tree (Olea europaea L.) is often exposed to severe water stress during the summer season. In this study, we determined the changes in total phenol content, oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol in the leaves of four olive cultivars (‘Gaidourelia’, ‘Kalamon’, ‘Koroneiki’ and ‘Megaritiki’) grown under water deficit conditions for two months. Furthermore, we investigated the photosynthetic performance in terms of gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence, as well as malondialdehyde content and antioxidant activity. One-year-old self-rooted plants were subjected to three irrigation treatments that received a water amount equivalent to 100% (Control, C), 66% (Field Capacity 66%, FC₆₆) and 33% (Field Capacity 33%, FC₃₃) of field capacity. Measurements were conducted 30 and 60 days after the initiation of the experiment. Net CO₂ assimilation rate, stomatal conductance and Fᵥ/Fₘ ratio decreased only in FC₃₃ plants. Photosynthetic rate was reduced mainly due to stomatal closure, but damage to PSII also contributed to this decrease. Water stress induced the accumulation of phenolic compounds, especially oleuropein, suggesting their role as antioxidants. Total phenol content increased in FC₃₃ treatment and oleuropein presented a slight increase in FC₆₆ and a sharper one in FC₃₃ treatment. Hydroxytyrosol showed a gradual decrease as water stress progressed. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased due to water stress, mostly after 60 days, while antioxidant activity increased for all cultivars in the FC₃₃ treatment. ‘Gaidourelia’ could be considered as the most tolerant among the tested cultivars, showing higher phenolic concentration and antioxidant activity and lower lipid peroxidation and photochemical damage after two months of water stress. The results indicated that water stress affected olive tree physiological and biochemical parameters and magnitude of this effect depended on genotype, the degree of water limitation and duration of treatment. However, the severity as well as the duration of water stress might exceed antioxidant capacity, since MDA levels and subsequent oxidative damage increased after two months of water deficit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3afield capacity 3afluorescence 3agas exchange 3agenotype 3airrigation 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3aoleuropein 3aolives 3aphenols 3aphotosystem II 3astomatal conductance 3astomatal movement 3asummer 3atrees 3awater stress 2aAgricultural Irrigation 2aAntioxidantsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aDehydration 2aGenotype 2aIridoids 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aMalondialdehydexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aOleaxchemistryxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aOxidative Stress 2aPhenolsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPhenylethyl Alcoholxanalogs & derivativesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxchemistryxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPlant Transpiration 2aPyransxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aStress, Physiological1 aTherios, Ioannis1 aSamouris, Georgios1 aKoundouras, Stefanos1 aGiannakoula, Anastasia0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2012 Nov., v. 60 p.1-11dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01790naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010900164300001800273520080800291592002801099650001101127650002601138650001901164650001301183650002101196650001301217700001401230700001301244700001501257773010201272856008101374852000901455655001201464IND60572484620221119131636.0170717e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057248462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-017-1015-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Y.

The microstructure investigation shows that the core–shell structure with an obvious boundary within a grain is constructed in light of different solid solution levels of nitrogen in grain boundary and grain inner. The mechanical behaviors have been experimentally assessed through compressive testing. The compacts exhibit a much enhanced strength while retaining a reasonable ductility, which can be attributed to their novel core–shell structure. With an increasing N content as well as shell thickness, the strength increases and the ductility decreases, in accordance with the morphology observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3atitanium1 aZhang, W.1 aWang, X.1 aHuo, W.

Vitamins B6, B12, and C and anthocyanin-rich black chokeberry pomace extract were added in the inner water phase and vitamins A and D3 were added in the oil phase of the double emulsion. The loaded emulsion showed excellent creaming stability (<96%), even distribution of droplet size, and high viscosity during 30 days of storage. The fair encapsulation efficiency (75.00–99.37%) and the encapsulation stability (74.00–95.98%) of the bioactives during storage for 30 days indicate the successful protection of vitamins and anthocyanin-rich black chokeberry pomace extract from environmental factors. For all vitamins, controlled release during digestion of double emulsion was observed. At the end of the duodenal phase, approximately 100% of the vitamins were released from the loaded emulsions. However, the release kinetics of vitamins under gastric conditions differed: 71.75% of vitamin C, 37.5% of vitamin B9, 20% of vitamin B12, 70% of vitamin D3, and 50% of vitamin A were released at the end of the gastric stage of digestion. 26.38% of the black chokeberry pomace extract was released in the gastric fluids and 46.95% of the extract was found in the soluble part of the digesta at the end of the duodenal phase. The study demonstrates that a multiple bioactives-loaded double emulsion can be successfully used for formulations for elderly people's diets to deliver priority bioactives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAronia melanocarpa 3aascorbic acid 3abioactive compounds 3acholecalciferol 3acreaming 3adiet 3adigesta 3adigestion 3adroplet size 3aelderly 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3aenvironmental factors 3afolic acid 3agastric juice 3aoils 3apomace extracts 3astorage time 3aviscosity 3avitamin A 3avitamin B121 aJasutienė, Ina1 aEisinaitė, Viktorija1 aVenskutonis, Petras Rimantas1 aLeskauskaitė, Daiva0 tFood & function.g2020 Mar. 26, v. 11, no. 3 p.2195-2207dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo00021c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245017600159300001600335520140100351592002801752650001701780650001401797650001301811650003601824650003001860650004601890650001601936650002301952650002001975650001101995650002102006650002102027650003102048650002702079650004402106650002102150650002102171650002802192650002202220653002102242653001802263653001602281653001202297653001402309653001302323700001802336700001902354700001402373700001302387700001802400700002102418700006002439773014502499856008002644852000902724655001202733IND60604227220221123045154.0180716e20180110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060422722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b044302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Le10aNeuroprotective Effects of 1,2-Diarylpropane Type Phenylpropanoid Enantiomers from Red Raspberry against H2O2-Induced Oxidative Stress in Human Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y Cells  ap. 331-338.  aRed raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is an edible fruit-producing species belonging to the Rosaceae family. In our search for the health-promoting constituents from this fruit, four pairs of enantiomeric phenylpropanoids (1a/1b–4a/4b), including three new compounds (1a and 2a/2b), were isolated from red raspberry. Their structures were elucidated by a combination of the extensive NMR spectroscopic data analyses, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and comparison between the experimental measurements of electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and calculated ECD spectra by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). In addition, their neuroprotective effects against H₂O₂-induced oxidative stress in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were investigated, and the results showed enantioselectivity, in which that 3a exhibited noticeable neuroprotective activity, while its enatiomer 3b exhibited no obvious protective effect. Further study demonstrated that 3a could selectively inhibit the apoptosis induction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation by enhancing the activity of catalase (CAT) in H₂O₂-treated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. These findings shed much light on a better understanding of the neuroprotective effects of these enantiomers and provide new insights into developing better treatment of neurodegenerative diseases in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRubus idaeus 3aapoptosis 3acatalase 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3aenzyme activity 3afruits 3ahealth promotion 3ahuman cell lines 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneuroprotective effect 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidative stress 3aphenylpropanoids 3areactive oxygen species 3aspectral analysis 0aoxidative stress 0ared raspberry 0aenantiomers 0aSH-SY5Y 0aapoptosis 0acatalase1 aYao, Guo-Dong1 aSong, Xiao-yu,1 aWang, Jie1 aLin, Bin1 aWang, Xiao-Bo1 aHuang, Xiao-Xiao1 aSong, Shao-Jiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9074-24670 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 66, no. 1 p.331-338dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b044303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012500167300001800292520073200310592002801042650002101070650001401091650001801105650001201123650001901135650001901154650002001173650003701193700001701230700001701247700001901264700001901283700001701302700001701319773010201336856008101438852000901519655001201528IND60572484720221119131511.0170717e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057248472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-017-1003-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNürnberger, F.10aSurface modification of an austenitic stainless steel wire by a multi-pulse treatment with a high-power electric current  ap. 8007-8015.  aThe skin effect caused by high-power electric pulses can be used for modification of the surface microstructure in metallic materials.

This novel peptide was screened from silkworm pupa using an Fe-doped porous biocarbon (FL/Z-SE) derived from silkworm excrement. FL/Z-SE possessed magnetic properties and specific selection for peptides due to Fe’s dual functions. The selected RYL, which has moderate hydrophilicity (LogP = −0.22), exhibited a comparatively high ACE-inhibitory activity (IC₅₀ = 3.31 ± 0.11 μM). The inhibitory kinetics and docking-simulation results show that, as a competitive ACE inhibitor, RYL formed five hydrogen bonds with the ACE residues in the S1 and S2 pockets. In this work, both the screening carbon material and the selected ACE-inhibitory peptide were derived from agricultural waste (silkworm excrement and pupa), which offers a new way of thinking about the development of advanced uses of the silkworm byproducts and wastes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophilicity 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3airon 3amagnetic properties 3apeptides 3apupae 3ascreening 3asilkworms 0asilkworm pupa protein 0asilkworm excrement 0amoderately hydrophilic peptide 0aACE-inhibitory activity 0aultrafast screening 0amolecular docking1 aWei, Yanan1 aChang, Qing1 aSun, Huaju1 aChai, Kungang1 aHuang, Zuqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0727-80161 aZhao, Zhenxia1 aZhao, Zhongxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3664-34760 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Dec. 27, v. 65, no. 51 p.11202-11211dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b044423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245010100164300001600265520093100281592002801212650004401240650001101284650003801295650001801333650002301351650003101374650001201405650002101417650002201438650004401460650001301504650001701517650002101534650001301555700002001568700002401588700002201612700001801634700002001652700001901672700002801691773009301719856007401812852000901886655001201895IND60132966620221121020913.0150513e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013296662DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.274342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolitakos, Nikolaos10aComparing linear and cyclic synthetic homopolypeptides: Synthesis and molecular characterization  ap. 393-404.  aThe synthesis and molecular characterization of a linear and a cyclic homopolypeptide of protected l‐tyrosine are reported.

Dihydrochalcone compounds are important in plant growth and response to stresses and, thus, can have large impacts on agricultural activity. In recent years, these compounds have also received increased attention from the biomedical community for their potential as anticancer treatments and other benefits for human health. However, they are typically produced at relatively low levels in plants. Therefore, an attractive alternative is to express the plant biosynthetic pathway genes in microbial hosts and to engineer the metabolic pathway/host to improve the production of these metabolites. In the present review, we discuss in detail the functions of genes and enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of the dihydrochalcones and the recent strategies and achievements used in the reconstruction of multi-enzyme pathways in microorganisms in efforts to be able to attain higher amounts of desired dihydrochalcones.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical pathways 3aenzymes 3agenes 3ahosts 3ahuman health 3ametabolic engineering 3ametabolites 3amicroorganisms 3aplant growth 0adihydrochalcones 0abiosynthesis 0abiological activity 0ametabolic engineering1 aMartens, Stefan1 aGang, David R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Nov. 24, v. 66, no. 10 p.2273-2280dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b044453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245005800170300001800228520141400246592002801660650002301688650000901711650002601720650001001746650001101756650001801767650002001785650002201805650001801827650002301845650001401868650002701882773015701909856007902066852000902145655001202154IND60114881820221118143545.0141124e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011488182DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.113.0667532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProud, Christopher G10aControl of the translational machinery by amino acids  ap. 231S-236S.  aAmino acids are the precursors for the synthesis of proteins. In humans, approximately half of the 20 different amino acids are essential, ie, must be obtained from the diet. Cells must therefore take account of amino acid availability to achieve sustainable rates of protein synthesis. One of the major mechanisms involved in this is signaling through a complex of proteins termed mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC) 1, which is activated by amino acids. In turn, mTORC1 regulates the production of ribosomes, the molecular machines that make proteins, and the activity of other cellular components required for protein synthesis. mTORC1 signaling promotes the transcription of the genes for ribosomal RNAs and many other components involved in ribosome production. It also positively regulates the translation of the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for ribosomal proteins. Indeed, recent studies have shown that mammalian target of rapamycin signaling drives the translation of mRNAs for many anabolic enzymes and other proteins involved in diverse cellular functions. The translational machinery is also regulated by the absence of amino acids through the protein kinase GCN2 (general control nonrepressed 2), which phosphorylates and in end-effect inhibits the translation initiation factor eIF2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2). This process shuts down general protein synthesis to conserve amino acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical nutrition 3adiet 3aessential amino acids 3agenes 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein kinases 3aprotein synthesis 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomal proteins 3aribosomes 3atranslation (genetics)0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2014 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.231S-236SdAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:jnl45206x0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.113.0667533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245011500168300001600283520115300299592002801452650001101480650002801491650001701519650001801536650001701554650001401571650001801585650002101603650001101624650002301635653001601658653003401674653000801708653001101716653001401727700006201741773014501803856008001948852000902028655001202037IND60604227520221123045156.0180716e20180124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060422752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b044502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRonningen, Ian G.10aIdentification of Aging-Associated Food Quality Changes in Citrus Products Using Untargeted Chemical Profiling  ap. 682-688.  aChemometric techniques have seen wide application in biological and medical sciences, but they are still developing in the food sciences. This study illustrated the use of untargeted LC/MS chemometric methods to identify features (retention time_m/z) associated with food quality changes as products age (freshness). Extracts of three citrus fruit varietals aged over four time points that corresponded to noted changes in sensory attributes were chemically profiled and modeled by two discriminatory multivariate statistical techniques, projection partial least-squares discrimant analysis (PLS-DA) and machine learning random forest (RF). Age-associated compounds across the citrus platform were identified. Varietal was treated as a nuisance variable to emphasize aging chemistry, and further variable selection using age-related piecewise model generation and meta filtering to emphasize features associated with general aging chemistry common to all the citrus extracts. The identified features were further replicated in a validation study to illustrate the validity and persistence of these markers for applications in citrus food platforms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aartificial intelligence 3achemometrics 3acitrus fruits 3afood quality 3afreshness 3aleast squares 3amedical sciences 3amodels 3asensory properties 0aflavoromics 0auntargeted chemical profiling 0aMVA 0aflavor 0afreshness1 aPeterson, Devin G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6090-82270 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Jan. 24, v. 66, no. 3 p.682-688dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b044503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013100168300001500299520191500314592002802229650001702257650001402274650002902288650001602317650001302333650002802346650001302374650001502387650002002402650001302422650001602435651001402451653001902465653003302484653001902517653002102536653001302557700002202570773010302592856008402695852000902779655001202788IND60590468020221118090811.0181010e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059046802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2017.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhammad, Ario10aImpact of earthquake source complexity and land elevation data resolution on tsunami hazard assessment and fatality estimation  ap. 83-100.  aThis study investigates the impact of model complexity in source characterization and digital elevation model (DEM) resolution on the accuracy of tsunami hazard assessment and fatality estimation through a case study in Padang, Indonesia. Two types of earthquake source models, i.e. complex and uniform slip models, are adopted by considering three resolutions of DEMs, i.e. 150 m, 50 m, and 10 m. For each of the three grid resolutions, 300 complex source models are generated using new statistical prediction models of earthquake source parameters developed from extensive finite-fault models of past subduction earthquakes, whilst 100 uniform slip models are constructed with variable fault geometry without slip heterogeneity. The results highlight that significant changes to tsunami hazard and fatality estimates are observed with regard to earthquake source complexity and grid resolution. Coarse resolution (i.e. 150 m) leads to inaccurate tsunami hazard prediction and fatality estimation, whilst 50-m and 10-m resolutions produce similar results. However, velocity and momentum flux are sensitive to the grid resolution and hence, at least 10-m grid resolution needs to be implemented when considering flow-based parameters for tsunami hazard and risk assessments. In addition, the results indicate that the tsunami hazard parameters and fatality number are more sensitive to the complexity of earthquake source characterization than the grid resolution. Thus, the uniform models are not recommended for probabilistic tsunami hazard and risk assessments. Finally, the findings confirm that uncertainties of tsunami hazard level and fatality in terms of depth, velocity and momentum flux can be captured and visualized through the complex source modeling approach. From tsunami risk management perspectives, this indeed creates big data, which are useful for making effective and robust decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputers 3adigital elevation models 3aearthquakes 3ageometry 3ahazard characterization 3amomentum 3aprediction 3arisk management 3atsunamis 3auncertainty 3aIndonesia 0aDEM resolution 0aEarthquake source complexity 0aTsunami hazard 0aTsunami fatality 0aBig data1 aGoda, Katsuichiro0 tComputers & geosciences.g2018 Mar., v. 112 p.83-100dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2017.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245015200206300002000358520104300378592002801421650002401449650002001473650001401493650001701507650002801524650002401552650000701576650003101583650001301614650001601627650002001643650002401663650001201687650000801699653001201707653002501719653002001744653002901764653002001793700001301813700001401826700001301840700001901853700005901872773015001931856008002081852000902161655001202170IND60604227620221120132642.0180716e20171220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060422762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b044562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Guangliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4988-891510aEffect of Fermentation pH on Protein Bioaccessibility of Soymilk Curd with Added Tea Polyphenols As Assessed by in Vitro Gastrointestinal Digestion  ap. 11125-11132.  aThe aim of this study was to compare the effect of fermentation pH on protein bioaccessibility of four soymilk curds enriched with tea polyphenols (TP). The curds were generated by fermentation with Weissella hellenica D1501 and the fermentation terminated at different pH values, namely at pH 5.7, 5.4, 5.1, and 4.8 (SMTP-5.7, SMTP-5.4, SMTP-5.1, SMTP-4.8). Particle-size distribution, soluble protein content, gel electrophoresis, and peptides content were monitored at oral, gastric, and intestinal levels. Results showed that SMTP-4.8 was the matrix most resistant to protein digestion in the gastric phase according to the soluble protein content. Similar particle size distribution and protein degradation patterns were observed for these curds in gastric and intestinal phase. However, there was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the content of small peptides (<10 kDa) at the end of intestinal digestion among the four curds. Overall, terminating fermentation at pH 5.4–5.7 of soymilk curds enriched with TP is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWeissella hellenica 3abioavailability 3adigestion 3afermentation 3agastrointestinal system 3agel electrophoresis 3apH 3aparticle size distribution 3apeptides 3apolyphenols 3aprotein content 3aprotein degradation 3asoymilk 3atea 0asoymilk 0alactic acid bacteria 0aelectrophoresis 0aprotein bioaccessibility 0apeptide content1 aRui, Xin1 aWang, Dan1 aLiu, Mei1 aChen, Xiaohong1 aDong, Mingsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7454-45160 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Dec. 20, v. 65, no. 50 p.11125-11132dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b044563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245009300164520168000257592002801937650001101965650001501976650001701991650002402008650002302032650001502055650001502070650002202085650001502107650001102122650001502133650002002148650001802168650002302186651001102209653001602220653001402236653001402250653001002264653001202274653001502286700001902301700002202320700002002342700001802362773010102380856007902481852000902560655001202569IND60728276520221121132858.0210219e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072827652DNAL7 a10.3897/oneeco.2.e140142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStange, Erik E10aEcosystem services mapping for municipal policy: ESTIMAP and zoning for urban beekeeping  aPollinating insects are an integral part of cities’ natural capital and perform an important ecosystem function with a high degree of relevance to many cultural ecosystem services. Consequently, pollinators serve as a useful proxy for assessing urban biodiversity. Beekeeping has recently emerged as a popular activity in many urban areas and a good deal of the motivation for urban beekeeping for many stems from the cultural and non-consumptive aspects of beekeeping. Yet the recent increases in domestic honeybee densities in urban landscapes has raised concern regarding the potential threat that honeybees might pose to local populations of threatened bumblebee and solitary bee species. This issue constitutes a trade-off between the cultural ecosystem services associated with urban beekeeping and the regulation and maintenance ecosystem services of maintaining nursery populations of rare and threatened species. Municipal authorities in Oslo, Norway have proposed establishing eight “precautionary zones”, within which placement of honeybee hives could be more strictly regulated. We propose a mapping and assessment approach for informing zoning decisions regarding urban honeybees, utilising a model of an urban landscape’s biophysical capacity to support pollinating insects (ESTIMAP). Together with an additional model describing the approximate distrubtion of honeybees in Oslo, we identify areas in the city where domestic honeybees may be more likely to exhaust floral resources. This case also tests the policy relevance of ecosystem service mapping tools beyond awareness raising, with broader general lessons for ecosystem mapping and assessment .  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus 3aapiculture 3abiodiversity 3aecological function 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3ahoney bees 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amotivation 3anatural capital 3asolitary bees 3athreatened species 3aNorway 0aPollination 0aHoneybees 0aWild bees 0aUrban 0aMapping 0aTrade-offs1 aZulian, Grazia1 aRusch, Graciela M1 aBarton, David N1 aNowell, Megan0 tOne Ecosystem.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 2 p.e14014-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:27343x2367-81947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/oneeco.2.e140143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001600192245012600208300001600334520172900350592002802079650001902107650001902126650001802145650001402163650002002177650002502197650001602222650002002238650001702258650001802275650004402293650003702337650003402374650002002408650002402428700001902452700001402471700002002485700002402505773009202529856008502621990002302706852000902729655001202738IND60098213420221118045316.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009821342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.08.0132doi7 aPMC35862062pmcid7 a208075682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLue, Hongqi10aActivation of the JNK signalling pathway by macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and dependence on CXCR4 and CD74  ap. 135-144.  ac-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and controls essential processes such as inflammation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. JNK signalling is triggered by extracellular signals such as cytokines and environmental stresses. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine with chemokine-like functions in leukocyte recruitment and atherosclerosis. MIF promotes MAPK signalling through ERK1/2, while it can either activate or inhibit JNK phosphorylation, depending on the cell type and underlying stimulation context. MIF activities are mediated by non-cognate interactions with the CXC chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4 or by ligation of CD74, which is the cell surface expressed form of the class II invariant chain. ERK1/2 signalling stimulated by MIF is dependent on CD74, but the receptor pathway involved in MIF activation of the JNK pathway is unknown. Here we comprehensively characterize the stimulatory effect of MIF on the canonical JNK/c-Jun/AP-1 pathway in fibroblasts and T cell lines and identify the upstream signalling components. Physiological concentrations of recombinant MIF triggered the phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun and rapidly activated AP-1. In T cells, MIF-mediated activation of the JNK pathway led to upregulated gene expression of the inflammatory chemokine CXCL8. Activation of JNK signalling by MIF involved the upstream kinases PI3K and SRC and was found to be dependent on CXCR4 and CD74. Together, these data show that the CXCR4/CD74/SRC/PI3K axis mediates a rapid and transient activation of the JNK pathway as triggered by the inflammatory cytokine MIF in T cells and fibroblasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCXCR2 receptor 3aCXCR4 receptor 3aT-lymphocytes 3aapoptosis 3aatherosclerosis 3acell differentiation 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-8 3amacrophage migration inhibitory factors 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction1 aDewor, Manfred1 aLeng, Lin1 aBucala, Richard1 aBernhagen, Jürgen,0 tCellular signalling.g2011 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.135-144dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.08.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008400162300001800246520192100264592002802185650001802213650001102231650001302242650001102255650000902266650001502275650002002290650001802310650001002328700001802338700001702356700002402373773010202397856008102499852000902580655001202589IND60572485320221119131602.0170717e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057248532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-017-1022-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Jihye10aGeometric impact of void space in woven fabrics on oil resistance or repellency  ap. 8149-8158.  aAn oil-repellent surface is challenging to achieve due to the low surface tension of oil. The critical factor is to create void spaces at multiple scales (i.e., macro, micro, and nano) to increase the energy barrier that the liquid–vapor interface must overcome to transit from the Cassie–Baxter state to the Wenzel state, in which the surface is completely wet. To obtain an oil-resistant or repellent surface, one must create a structural geometry with void spaces, and the solid surface energy must be low relative to the oil. Knowing the impact of void space is important to enable a rational design of such surfaces. Woven fabric inherently consists of multiscale structures by its construction: nanoscale in fiber, microscale in yarn, and macroscale in fabric. In this study, theoretical modeling and experiments with actual fabric samples were utilized to determine the impact of void space in woven fabric. The ratio of the void space between two adjacent yarns to the yarn diameter, T y, was integrated into the lenticular Cassie–Baxter model of woven fabric (i.e., plain structure). Then, the role of void space resisting or repelling oil was quantified by measuring the contact angle of dodecane (γ LV = 25.3 mN/m) on the surface of the fabric samples with varied void spaces. The theoretical model predicted that the fabric’s oil resistance or repellence increases as the void space increases, and the role of void space at the macroscale was more important than at the micro- or nanoscale. The predicted tendency of a fabric’s apparent contact angle with oil, θ F, was in good agreement with experiment and showed the value of incorporating T y in the prediction of the liquid-resistant or repellent behavior. Contrary to the prediction, increasing T y further caused the liquid drop on the surfaces to have a reduced contact angle, θ F, due to the sagging of liquid into the void space.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3aenergy 3ageometry 3amodels 3aoils 3aprediction 3asurface tension 3awoven fabrics 3ayarns1 aPowell, Nancy1 aLee, Hoonjoo1 aMichielsen, Stephen0 tJournal of materials science.g2017 July, v. 52, no. 13 p.8149-8158dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-017-1022-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245006400174300001600238520108300254592002801337650001401365650001301379650001701392650001001409650002601419650001901445650003701464650001101501650002001512650001701532650001401549700002601563700002001589700002301609773009201632856008501724990002301809852000901832655001201841IND60098213620221118045347.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009821362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHessenauer, Andrea10aCK2 inhibition induces apoptosis via the ER stress response  ap. 145-151.  aProtein kinase CK2 is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase consisting of two catalytic α/α′ and two regulatory β subunits. Expression of CK2 is highly elevated in tumor cells where it protects cells from apoptosis. Accordingly inhibition of CK2 is known to induce programmed cell death, making it a promising target for cancer therapy. In the present study we investigated apoptosis induction by the CK2 inhibitor 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB) in prostate tumor cells. In contrast to PC-3 cells LNCaP cells respond to CK2 inhibition with apoptosis. Most interestingly we found the mitochondrial pathway induced in LNCaP as well as in PC-3 cells as monitored by down-regulation of bcl-2 and subsequent cytochrome c release. In both cell lines activation of caspase 9 was not detected. Instead, an activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response in LNCaP cells after treatment with the CK2 inhibitor TBB was found. We show that this ER stress response led to an up-regulation of the death receptor DR5 and subsequent apoptosis in LNCaP cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3acytochrome c 3adeath 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aneoplasm cells 3aprotein-serine-threonine kinases 3aserine 3astress response 3atherapeutics 3athreonine1 aSchneider, Carolin C.1 aGötz, Claudia,1 aMontenarh, Mathias0 tCellular signalling.g2011 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.145-151dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.08.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245015300165300001800318520162800336592002801964650003001992650001502022650002502037650002302062650002302085650001902108650001702127650001602144650001902160650002502179700001802204700001802222700001802240700006502258773013502323856008002458852000902538655001202547IND60681728420221119015342.0200117e20191224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068172842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b093962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Arunima10aImportance of Many-Body Dispersion in the Stability of Vacancies and Antisites in Free-Standing Monolayer of MoS₂ from First-Principles Approaches  ap. 1390-1397.  aDefects in MoS₂ monolayer play a vital role in altering the electric and optical properties, which is a crucial factor in various semiconducting and optoelectronic devices. In the present work, we have investigated the thermodynamic stability of point defects in MoS₂ monolayer by means of first-principles-based density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio atomistic thermodynamics. We have considered three vacancies and five antisites in our system, viz., Mo vacancy (VMₒ), SMₒ antisite, S₂Mₒ antisite, S vacancy (VS), MoS antisite, S₂ vacancy (VS₂), MoS₂ antisite, and 2MoS₂ antisite. Our approach includes (i) the two-body van der Waals interaction under Tkatchenko–Scheffler scheme and (ii) many-body dispersion to account the effect of polarization on the defects’ stability. The many-body dispersion has posed a significant change in the pattern of stable defects. Hence, we report the stable defect states as observed by hybrid DFT with many-body dispersion as VS–², VMₒ–², and SMₒ–² in n-type MoS₂ monolayer and VS⁺², VMₒ⁺², and S₂Mₒ⁺² in p-type MoS₂ monolayer. Among these stable defect states, SMₒ–² and S₂Mₒ⁺² states have tuned the band gap of MoS₂ monolayer in the range of 1.1–1.8 eV. Therefore, their optical response in comparison to pristine has inferred their applicability in photovoltaics. Finally, we obtain that these defects have significant concentration in the finite temperature range of 50–1000 K. Our results, therefore, predict the p-type defect states in MoS₂ monolayer that would be helpful in device fabrications.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3amolybdenum 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aoptical properties 3aphysical chemistry 3asemiconductors 3asolar energy 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3avan der Waals forces1 aBasera, Pooja1 aSaini, Shikha1 aManish Kumar,1 aBhattacharya, Saswata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4145-48990 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Dec. 24, v. 124, no. 2 p.1390-1397dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b093963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245015500176300001400331520179900345592002802144650001802172650002202190650001802212650001202230650001402242650001802256650002302274650002002297650001002317650002602327650001502353650001902368650001402387650002302401650001502424653002202439653002102461653001502482653001502497653002602512653002502538700001702563700001902580700002502599773011902624856008802743852000902831655001202840IND60590468420221118090746.0190318e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059046842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2017.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimancas, Bárbara10aReprint to: Phosphate starvation during the transition phase increases the sex ratio and 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid contents in females of Urtica dioica  ap. 45-53.  aThe transition phase in plants, which is marked by the onset of flowering and seed production, is very sensitive to the physical environment. Moreover, dimorphic plant species can show important sex-related differences in the response to nutrient availability. How availability of inorganic phosphate (Pi) during the transition phase influences sex ratios and whether or not male and female plants respond differently to nutrient stress is still however very poorly understood. Here, we examined whether contrasting Pi availability during the transition phase may influence sexual differentiation in stinging nettle (U. dioica L.) plants. We also evaluated to what extent males and females respond differently to varying Pi concentrations in terms of nutrient accumulation, C and N isotopic composition, photo-oxidative stress and hormone profiling. Results showed that reduced Pi availability delays plant maturation in males, causing as well an increase in the sex ratio towards females. Females showed enhanced lipid peroxidation (as indicated by higher lipid hydroperoxide contents) compared to males under Pi starvation, but sexes did not differ in photosystem II efficiency. Furthermore, reduced Pi availability led to enhanced 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid contents, the immediate precursor of jasmonic acid, particularly in females. This increase was, however, not accompanied by increases in other jasmonates, neither free nor conjugated jasmonic acid, thus suggesting a specific role for 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid in chemical defense in females under Pi starvation. Sex biased ratios in favour of females over males and enhanced 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid contents in the former under Pi starvation illustrate the great adaptive capacity of dimorphic species to reduced nutrient availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrtica dioica 3achemical defenses 3afemale plants 3afemales 3aflowering 3ajasmonic acid 3alipid peroxidation 3alipid peroxides 3amales 3anutrient availability 3aphosphates 3aphotosystem II 3asex ratio 3asexual development 3astarvation 0aSexual dimorphism 0achemical defence 0ajasmonates 0asex ratios 0anutrient availability 0aPhosphate starvation1 aCotado, Alba1 aMüller, Maren1 aMunné-Bosch, Sergi,0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2018 Feb., v. 146 p.45-53dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2017.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245018700153520164900340592002801989650001802017650002002035650001602055650001702071650001902088650002102107650001502128650001302143650002102156650001402177650001302191650002402204650001202228650002602240650001202266650001102278650001202289651001202301700001702313773012602330856007302456852000902529655001202538IND60651941820221118033737.0190712e20170406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065194182DNAL7 a10.3390/su90405582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jie10aMeasuring the Spatial Dimension of Automobile Ownership and Its Associations with Household Characteristics and Land Use Patterns: A Case Study in Three Counties, South Florida (USA)  aMotorization and increased levels of car ownership have partly contributed to traffic congestion and air pollution, which is a prime concern in the era of climate change. Therefore, vehicle ownership-related topics have been extensively explored by transportation scholars, economists, and planning researchers. However, relatively fewer scientists have investigated the spatial patterns and socioeconomic factors of car ownership simultaneously within a large geographic scale. Thus, the goal of this article is to illuminate how high levels of auto ownership may cluster spatially and what factors relate to such phenomena by developing an integrative framework and applying it in three counties in South Florida (US). Specifically, this study first evaluated whether vehicle ownership is spatially autocorrelated using Global and Local Moran’s I statistics. It then justified significant factors associated with car ownership by employing Poisson and Corrected Poisson regression models. The findings, using raw data, show that there exist locally spatial clusters of the households with high levels of automobile ownership, while globally the patterns of auto ownership are statistically random. Furthermore, the results suggest that the number of drivers, the number of workers, household income level, housing tenure, the proximity to schools, and net house density significantly influence car ownership levels. The results can assist urban planners and local governments in developing planning schemes that aim at transit, cycling, walking, and other non-motorized travel modes, thereby furthering environmentally friendly communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aautocorrelation 3aautomobiles 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3aland use 3alocal government 3aownership 3aplanning 3aregression analysis 3aschools 3asocioeconomic factors 3atraffic 3atravel 3awalking 3aFlorida1 aWang, Ruoniu0 tSustainability.g2017 Apr. 06, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90405583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03563naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100003000186245017600216300001300392506007600405520173700481592002802218506003702246650002002283650001602303650002002319650000902339650001602348650001302364650002302377650001902400650003502419650001002454650001802464650001202482650001202494650003002506650002402536650002402560650001902584650001002603651001802613700002202631700002202653700002302675700002402698700001602722700001902738773015202757856007902909852000902988655001202997IND60114882320221207143016.0141124e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011488232DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.113.0667202doi7 aPMC38624592pmcid7 a241533492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang-Péronard, Jeanett L10aAssociation between prenatal polychlorinated biphenyl exposure and obesity development at ages 5 and 7 y: a prospective cohort study of 656 children from the Faroe Islands  ap. 5-13.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Chemicals with endocrine-disrupting abilities may act as obesogens and interfere with the body's natural weight-control mechanisms, especially if exposure occurs during prenatal life.Objective: We examined the association between prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and subsequent obesity at 5 and 7 y of age.Design: From 1997 to 2000, 656 pregnant Faroese women were recruited. PCB and DDE were measured in maternal serum and breast milk, and children's weight, height, and waist circumference (WC) were measured at clinical examinations at 5 and 7 y of age. The change in body mass index (BMI) from 5 to 7 y of age was calculated. Analyses were performed by using multiple linear regression models for girls and boys separately, taking into account maternal prepregnancy BMI.Results: For 7-y-old girls who had overweight mothers, PCB was associated with increased BMI (β = 2.07, P = 0.007), and PCB and DDE were associated with an increased change in BMI from 5 to 7 y of age (PCB: β = 1.23, P = 0.003; DDE: β = 1.11, P = 0.008). No association was observed with BMI in girls with normal-weight mothers. PCB was associated with increased WC in girls with overweight mothers (β = 2.48, P = 0.001) and normal-weight mothers (β = 1.25, P = 0.04); DDE was associated with increased WC only in girls with overweight mothers (β = 2.21, P = 0.002). No associations were observed between PCB or DDE and BMI in 5-y-old girls. For boys, no associations were observed.Conclusions: Results suggest that prenatal exposure to PCB and DDE may play a role for subsequent obesity development. Girls whose mothers have a high prepregnancy BMI seem most affected.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDDE (pesticide) 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3aboys 3abreast milk 3achildren 3aclinical nutrition 3acohort studies 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3agirls 3alinear models 3amothers 3aobesity 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aregression analysis 3awaist circumference 3aweight control 3awomen 3aFaroe Islands1 aHeitmann, Berit L1 aAndersen, Helle R1 aSteuerwald, Ulrike1 aGrandjean, Philippe1 aWeihe, Pál1 aJensen, Tina K0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2014 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.5-13dAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:jnl45206x0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.113.0667203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03936naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245010500179300001600284520182400300592002802124650002102152650001502173650002802188650001602216650001902232650001402251650002402265650001902289650001602308650001102324650002202335650006602357650003702423650001902460650002002479650002202499650001502521650002202536650002902558650002702587653002702614653001902641653001902660653003002679653001002709653000802719653000702727653000802734653001002742653000902752653000902761653001102770653000802781653000902789700002202798700002402820700001802844700002202862700002102884700002802905700002302933700002902956700001802985700001803003773007603021856008403097852000903181655001203190IND60529775120221120160308.0161020e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052977512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2015.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Stadio, Chiara Stella10aAMP18 interacts with the anion exchanger SLC26A3 and enhances its expression in gastric cancer cells  ap. 151-160.  aAMP18 is a stomach-specific secreted protein expressed in normal gastric mucosa but absent in gastric cancer. AMP18 plays a major role in maintaining gastric mucosa integrity and is characterized by the presence of a BRICHOS domain consisting of about 100 amino acids, present also in several unrelated proteins, and probably endowed with a chaperon-like activity.In this work, we exploited a functional proteomic strategy to identify potential AMP18 interactors with the aim to add knowledge on its functional role within gastric cell lines and tissues.To this purpose, recombinant biotinylated AMP18 was purified and incubated with protein extract from human normal gastric mucosa by applying an affinity chromatography strategy. The interacting proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The pool of interacting proteins contained SLC26A3, a protein expressed in the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells, supposed to play a critical role in Cl− absorption and fluid homeostasis. The interaction was also confirmed by Western blot with anti-SLC26A3 on transfected AGS cell extract following AMP18 pull-down. Furthermore, the interaction between AMP18 and SLC26A3 was also validated by confocal microscopy that showed a co-localization of both proteins at plasma membrane level. More importantly, for the first time, we showed that SLC26A3 is down-regulated in gastric cancer and that the overexpression of AMP18 in AMP-transfected gastric cancer cells up-regulated the expression of SLC26A3 both at transcriptional and translational level, the latter probably through the activation of the MAP kinases pathway. These findings strongly suggest that AMP18 might play an anti-inflammatory role in maintaining mucosal integrity also by regulating SLC26A3 level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aabsorption 3aaffinity chromatography 3aamino acids 3ablood proteins 3achlorides 3aconfocal microscopy 3agastric mucosa 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aintestinal mucosa 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneoplasm cells 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein secretion 3aproteomics 3astomach neoplasms 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics) 0aAntrum mucosal protein 0aGastric cancer 0aBrichos domain 0aDown-Regulated in Adenoma 0aAPM18 0aAPP 0aGC 0aDRA 0aGAPDH 0aGKN1 0aMAPK 0arAMP18 0aTCA 0aTPCK1 aAltieri, Filomena1 aMiselli, Giuseppina1 aElce, Ausilia1 aSeverino, Valeria1 aChambery, Angela1 aQuagliariello, Vincenzo1 aVillano, Valentina1 ade Dominicis, Gianfranco1 aRippa, Emilia1 aArcari, Paolo0 tBiochimie.g2016 Feb., v. 121 p.151-160dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2015.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014400167300001800311520142200329592002801751650001501779650001501794650001401809650001301823650002101836650001901857650001301876650001201889650001501901650001301916650001501929650001101944700001801955700001301973700001501986773010202001856008102103852000902184655001202193IND60572485620221119133708.0170717e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057248562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-017-1029-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xiangyang10aRational design of graphene @ nitrogen and phosphorous dual-doped porous carbon sandwich-type layer for advanced lithium–sulfur batteries  ap. 7719-7732.  aLithium sulfur (Li–S) batteries show great prospect as a next generation high energy density rechargeable battery systems. However, the practical utilization of Li–S batteries is still obstructed by the shuttle effects which inducing the fast capacity fading and the loss of active sulfur. Herein, a special graphene @ nitrogen and phosphorous dual-doped porous carbon (N–P–PC/G) is presented to modify a commercial separator for an advanced Li–S battery. The N–P–PC/G nanosheet employs graphene layer as an excellent conductive framework covered with uniform layers of N, P dual-doped porous carbon on both sides which possessing massive interconnected meso-/micropores. It is demonstrated that the N–P–PC/G-modified separator can suppress the shuttle effects by coupling interactions including physical absorption, chemical adsorption and interfacial interaction. With the aid of the N–P–PC/G-modified separator, the pure sulfur cathode with high-sulfur loading of 3 mg cm⁻² offers a high initial discharge capacity of 1207 mA h g⁻¹ at 0.5 C (1 C = 1675 mA h g⁻¹), and a maintained capacity of 635 mA h g⁻¹ (fading rate of only 0.095% per cycle), after 500 cycles. This work suggests that combining hybrid nanocarbon with multi-heteroatom doping to modify the commercial separator is an effective approach to obtain high electrochemical performance Li–S batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3abatteries 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy density 3agraphene 3alithium 3ananosheets 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3asulfur1 aLiao, Qunchao1 aBai, Tao1 aYang, Juan0 tJournal of materials science.g2017 July, v. 52, no. 13 p.7719-7732dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-017-1029-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03678naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100001900194245009900213300001400312500001500326506007600341520187500417592002802292506003702320650001402357650001902371650001902390650001402409650000902423650001702432650001402449650001002463650000902473650001102482650001302493650001102506650001702517650001202534650001102546650001402557650001302571650001002584650001902594650000902613650001402622650001102636653001302647653001602660653001202676653001902688653000902707653002102716700002202737700003202759700002202791773011802813856008802931852000903019655001203028IND60590468620221207141246.0190318e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059046862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.02.0072doi7 aPMC60851012pmcid7 a301006432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPunshon, Tracy10aElemental distribution in developing rice grains and the effect of flag-leaf arsenate exposure  ap. 51-58.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe measured the bulk grain concentrations of arsenic (As), along with rubidium (Rb) and strontium (Sr) as indicators of phloem and xylem transport respectively, in rice (Oryza sativa cv. Italica Carolina) pulsed with arsenate (As(V)) at two exposure concentrations for 5 day periods at progressively later stages of grain fill, between anthesis and maturity, via the cut flag leaf. We compared these to unexposed (negative) controls and positive controls (pulsed with dimethylarsinic acid (DMA)), the most efficiency transported As species in rice. We collected elemental maps of As and micronutrient elements (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu and Ni) from developing grains. Exposures were 25 or 100 μg/ml As(V). We used the spatial distribution of arsenic in the grain to infer the presence of As transporters. By exposing grains via the flag leaf rather than the roots, we were able to measure arsenic transport into the grain during filling under controlled conditions. Exposure to 100 μg/ml As(V) resulted in widespread As localization in both embryo and endosperm, especially in grains exposed to As at later stages of panicle development. This suggests loss of selective transport, likely to be the result of As toxicity. At 25 μg/ml As(V), As colocalized with Mn in the ovular vascular trace (OVT). Exposure to either As(V) or DMA reduced grain Fe, an effect more pronounced when exposure occurred earlier in grain development. The abundance of Cu and Zn were also reduced by As. Arsenic exposure later in grain development caused higher grain As concentrations, indicating the existence of As transporters whose efficiency increases during grain fill. We conclude that localization of As in the grain is a product of both As species and exposure concentration, and that high As(V) translocation from the flag leaf can result in high As concentrations in the endosperm.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amanganese 3afilling period 3ainflorescences 3aflowering 3arice 3aOryza sativa 3astrontium 3aroots 3airon 3aleaves 3arubidium 3acopper 3atransporters 3aarsenic 3aphloem 3aarsenates 3atoxicity 3axylem 3acacodylic acid 3azinc 3aendosperm 3anickel 0aArsenate 0aSynchrotron 0aArsenic 0aElemental maps 0aRice 0aseed development1 aCarey, Anne-Marie1 aRicachenevsky, Felipe Klein1 aMeharg, Andrew A.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2018 May, v. 149 p.51-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01392naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008900164300001800253520042400271592002800695650001600723650001200739650001900751653001400770653001500784653001200799653004200811653002300853653001200876773008800888856008100976852000901057655001201066IND60520963820221117040328.0160527e20120419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052096382DNAL7 a10.2478/v10058-012-0016-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlymenko, S.10aMorphological Characteristics of Male Genitalia in Some Species in the Genus Torymus  ap. e-41-e-43.  aMorphology of male genitalia in some species in the genus Torymus Dalman is studied for the first time.

The enzyme inhibition kinetics data showed that MEL-A at a low concentration (< critical micelle concentration (CMC), 20.0 ± 5.0 μM) enhanced β-glucosidase activity, whereas it inhibited the enzyme activity at higher concentrations more than 20.0 μM, followed by a decreased Vₘₐₓ and Kₘ of β-glucosidase. The thermodynamics and structural data demonstrated that the midpoint temperature (Tₘ) and unfolding enthalpy (ΔH) of β-glucosidase was shifted to high values (76.6 °C, 126.3 J/g) in the presence of MEL-A, and the secondary structure changes of β-glucosidase, including the increased α-helix, β-turn, or random coil contents, and a decreased β-sheet content were caused by MEL-A at a CMC concentration. The further ITC and docking simulations suggested the bindings of MEL-A toward β-glucosidase were driven by weak hydrophobic interactions happened between the amino acid residues of β-glucosidase and the fatty acid residues of MEL-A, in addition to hydrogen bonds between amino acids and hydroxyl in glycosyl residues of this biosurfactant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abeta-glucosidase 3abiosurfactants 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenthalpy 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3afatty acids 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amicelles 3atemperature 3atitration 0aprotein−biosurfactant 0aβ-glucosidase 0amannosylerythritol lipids 0aisothermal titration calorimetry 0adocking simulation1 aXie, Pujun1 aWang, Ying1 aHuang, Zisu1 aZhou, Jianzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6975-09080 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 66, no. 1 p.238-246dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b044693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013300166300001400299520172600313592002802039650001502067650001602082650002602098650001502124650002202139650002502161650002402186650002302210650001902233650002902252651001002281653004002291653003702331653003002368653001902398700001902417700001102436773011102447856008402558852000902642655001202651IND50060648020221120180329.0190403e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006064802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2012.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoxi10aHow physical and social factors affect village-level irrigation: An institutional analysis of water governance in northern China  ap. 10-18.  aThe paper analyzes village-level irrigation management in water scarce northern China in which farmers’ livelihood is highly dependent on the appropriation of water due to limited livelihood alternatives and demographic structure with the elderly as the majority. Most scholarly works have focus on the organizational dimension of irrigation systems in China, while empirical researches relating to irrigation management so far have not paid enough attention to its institutional arrangements. We examine two cases studies – one with both surface and groundwater irrigation, and the other only with groundwater irrigation – to explore how sets of rules, physical attributes of irrigation systems, and social characteristics of communities jointly shape village-level irrigation management. Institutions of Sustainability framework is employed to facilitate the institutional analysis, through which we further discuss the emergency of self-organizing behaviors and origination of specific irrigation forms. We draw the conclusion that the organization of irrigation should fit not only the physical environment but also the institutional context and there is no one-for-all solution for governing irrigation in the field. In addition, we highlight the importance of the participation of locals in irrigation management as the research indicates the capability of locals to organize them for better use of natural resources on which their livelihoods are highly dependent. Finally, we suggest that irrigation management could be improved in future by introducing water users associations into surface irrigation management and devolving this management directly to water users along with participatory land planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3agovernance 3agroundwater 3airrigation management 3alivelihood 3anatural resources 3apsychosocial factors 3aresearch management 3asurface irrigation 3awater analysis 3awater users associations 3aChina 0aVillage-level irrigation management 0aPhysical attributes of resources 0aAttributes of communities 0aNorthern China1 aOtto, Ilona M.1 aYu, Lu0 tAgricultural water management.g2013 Mar., v. 119 p.10-18dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2012.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245012200199300001800321520147100339592002801810650001501838650001401853650002301867650002601890650003001916650002101946650001101967650001501978650001501993650001202008650001102020650001302031650001502044650001102059700001902070700001702089700005502106773013502161856008002296852000902376655001202385IND60681728720221119015047.0200117e20191227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068172872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b096472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5120-198310aModifications of Metal and Ligand to Modulate the Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity of Two-Dimensional MOF Catalysts  ap. 1413-1420.  aMetal–organic framework catalysts have attracted particular interest in recent years due to their good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in fuel cells. Herein, four Ni₃(HITP)₂ analogs (Co-THT, Ni-THT, Co-CAT, and Ni-CAT) as ORR catalysts were systematically studied by density functional theory calculation. Possible adsorption sites of O-containing species on the four catalysts were explored, and top of the metal atomic site (TM) and top of the sulfur/oxygen atomic site (TS/O) are found. Adsorption strength of O-containing species on TM is approximately decreased in the order of Co-THT > Co-CAT > Ni-THT > Ni-CAT. Namely, Co-THT and Co-CAT show relatively strong adsorption to O-containing species, which is consistent with the prediction results of IP (ionization potential) and Egₐₚ (energy difference between highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)) evaluation. For Co-THT and Ni-THT, both TCₒ and TS sites can spontaneously catalyze 2e– and 4e– ORR processes, but the 4e– process is more energetically beneficial. For Co-CAT and Ni-CAT, only TM can effectively catalyze the entire ORR, and the favorable ORR pathway of the former is the 4e– process and the latter is the 2e– process. Among the four studied catalysts, Co-CAT has the highest ORR catalytic performance, and the reaction energy of the rate-determining step is −0.86 eV, which is competitive with that on Pt(111).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoordination polymers 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3aionization 3aligands 3aoxygen 3aplatinum 3aprediction 3asulfur1 aHuang, Shihong1 aSun, Fanghua1 aLai, Nanjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7881-028X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Dec. 27, v. 124, no. 2 p.1413-1420dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b096473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245010200165300001400267520163600281592002801917650002701945650002801972650001702000650000902017650002302026650002602049650002002075650001102095650001502106650001202121650000902133650001402142650001302156650002102169650001202190650001402202650001802216650001902234650001102253700001702264700002202281700002202303700002102325700002202346700001902368700001502387700001602402700003002418773015302448856007902601852000902680655001202689IND60114882520221118141252.0141124e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011488252DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.112.0389272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Groof, Femke10aBranched-chain amino acid requirements for enterally fed term neonates in the first month of life  ap. 62-70.  aBackground: Knowledge of essential amino acid requirements in infants is important because excessive intake of protein can lead to increased long-term morbidity such as obesity. A deficient intake may lead to suboptimal growth and impaired neurodevelopment. The current recommended branched-chain amino acid requirements in infants aged 0–1 mo are based on the amino acid content of human milk.Objective: We quantified the requirements for isoleucine, leucine, and valine for term neonates by using the indicator amino acid oxidation method with [1-13C]phenylalanine as the indicator.Design: Fully enterally fed term infants received randomly graded amounts of isoleucine (5–216 mg · kg−1 · d−1), leucine (5–370 mg · kg−1 · d−1), or valine (5–236 mg · kg−1 · d−1) as part of an elemental formula. Data are expressed as means ± SDs.Results: Eighty-three Asian, term neonates (mean ± SD birth weight: 3.3 ± 0.4 kg; gestational age: 39.4 ± 1.3 wk) were studied at a postnatal age of 13 ± 5 d. Mean requirements for isoleucine, leucine, and valine (measured in boys only) were 105 mg · kg−1 · d−1 (r2 = 0.61, P < 0.001), 140 mg · kg−1 · d−1 (r2 = 0.26, P < 0.01), and 110 mg · kg−1 · d−1 (r2 = 0.35, P = 0.001), respectively.Conclusions: Current human milk–based recommendations for isoleucine and valine in term infants aged 0–1 mo are correct. However, the current recommendation for leucine (166 mg · kg−1 · d−1) is higher than the mean requirement of 140 mg · kg−1 · d−1 that we determined in this study.

In both species, these tumours display epithelial and stromal components. HMBCs are rare malignant tumours, but CMMTs are one of the most common mammary tumours in dogs and are more often benign than malignant. In this study, benign (n = 88) and malignant (n = 13) CMMTs were characterized using specific antibodies against oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, cytokeratin 5/6, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, vimentin, Ki67, E-cadherin and p63. Cartilage and bone matrices associated with benign and malignant CMMTs were characterized using specific antibodies against BMP4, Runx2, Sox9 and osteopontin. The current study suggested that CMMTs are of epithelial origin, but display a myoepithelial-like differentiation. The findings suggest key roles for Sox9, Runx2 and BMP4 in chondrogenesis and bone formation in CMMTs. The high expression of osteopontin in CMMTs appears to be unrelated to tumour malignancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abone formation 3abreast neoplasms 3acadherins 3acartilage 3achondrogenesis 3adogs 3aepithelium 3aerbB-2 receptor 3aestrogen receptors 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3ametaplasia 3amodels 3aosteopontin 3aprogesterone receptors 3arisk factors 3avimentin 0adog 0ahuman breast cancer 0aimmunohistochemistry 0amixed mammary tumour1 aMilley, K.M.1 aAl-Khan, A.A.1 aNimmo, J.S.1 aBacci, B.1 aTayebi, M.1 aDay, M.J.1 aRichardson, S.J.1 aDanks, J.A.0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2017 May, v. 156, no. 4 p.352-365dElsevier LtdwJournal:1946x0021-99757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2017.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03876naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245026000169300001600429520169700445592002802142650001602170650002502186650002002211650001902231650001302250650001102263650001602274650002002290650001302310650002002323650003102343650001002374650001502384650001102399650001702410650001702427650001502444650001802459650002002477650002202497653001602519653001902535653002002554653001702574653001702591653001802608653001402626653001102640653001002651653000902661653000902670653001102679653001302690653000702703653000702710653000902717653000802726653000702734700003402741700003002775700002802805700001902833700001702852700003002869700001602899700002202915773007602937856008403013852000903097655001203106IND60529775420221121125408.0161020e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052977542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2015.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Pavitra10aHarvesting clues from genome wide transcriptome analysis for exploring thalidomide mediated anomalies in eye development of chick embryo: Nitric oxide rectifies the thalidomide mediated anomalies by swinging back the system to normal transcriptome pattern  ap. 253-267.  aThalidomide, the notorious teratogen is known to cause various developmental abnormalities, among which a range of eye deformations are very common. From the clinical point of view, it is necessary to pinpoint the mechanisms of teratogens that tune the gene expression. However, to our knowledge, the molecular basis of eye deformities under thalidomide treatmenthas not been reported so far. Present study focuses on the possible mechanism by which thalidomide affects eye development and the role of Nitric Oxide in recovering thalidomide-mediated anomalies of eye development using chick embryo and zebrafish models with transcriptome analysis. Transcriptome analysis showed that 403 genes were up-regulated and 223 genes were down-regulated significantly in thalidomide pre-treated embryos. 8% of the significantly modulated genes have been implicated in eye development including Pax6, OTX2, Dkk1 and Shh. A wide range of biological process and molecular function was affected by thalidomide exposure. Biological Processes including structural constituent of eye lens and Molecular functions such as visual perception and retinal metabolic process formed strong annotation clustersindicating the adverse effects of thalidomide on eye development and function. Here, we have discussed the whole embryo transcriptome with the expression of PAX6, SOX2, and CRYAAgenes from developing eyes. Our experimental data showing structural and functional aspects includingeye size, lens transparency and optic nerve activity and bioinformatics analyses of transcriptome suggest that NO could partially protect thalidomide treated embryos from its devastating effects on eye development and function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aabnormal development 3aadverse effects 3abioinformatics 3achickens 3achicks 3adeformation 3aembryo (animal) 3aeye lens 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aharvesting 3amodels 3anerve tissue 3anitric oxide 3ateratogens 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3avisual perception 0aThalidomide 0aTeratogenicity 0aEye development 0aChick embryo 0aNitric oxide 0aTranscriptome 0aDAR-4M-AM 0aDAF-FM 0acPTIO 0aYC 1 0aSpNO 0al-NAME 0aSQRT-PCR 0aSC 0aNO 0aDMEM 0aPBS 0aON1 aKasiviswanathan, Dharanibalan1 aSundaresan, Lakshmikirupa1 aKathirvel, Priyadarshan1 aVeeriah, Vimal1 aDutta, Priya1 aSankaranarayanan, Kavitha1 aGupta, Ravi1 aChatterjee, Suvro0 tBiochimie.g2016 Feb., v. 121 p.253-267dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2015.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245012900176300001400305520143400319592002801753650001901781650002501800650002701825650001701852650002001869650001201889650001901901650001501920650001501935650002401950650002201974650001701996650001602013650002202029650002702051650002102078653000802099653000902107653000802116653001302124653000802137653000802145653000802153653000802161653000702169653001302176653000702189653000702196653000802203653001802211653000802229653003502237653002602272653001302298653001602311700002302327700002402350773011102374856008702485852000902572655001202581IND60590468920221118090748.0180313e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059046892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2017.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSampath, Charanyaa10aEnhancement of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid glycerides in Sardine oil by a bioimprinted cross-linked Candida rugosa lipase  ap. 20-29.  aConsidering the advantages of bioimprinting and carrier free immobilization, cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEA) were prepared by using bioimprinted Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) with Bovine serum albumin (BSA), Polyethyleneimine and glutaraldehyde. Effect of various factors such as CRL-Oleic acid ratio, CRL-BSA ratio, CRL- Polyethyleneimine ratio, glutaraldehyde loading, cross-linking time etc., on lipase activity recovery and aggregate yield were studied and optimized. This immobilized lipase (CRL-CLEA) was used for the selective hydrolysis of ester linkages of non-PUFA glycerides, with an aim to concentrate EPA and DHA glycerides in the Sardine oil. Imprinting with oleic acid in the presence of ethanol and Tween 60, and further immobilization with co-aggregates and cross-linking agent showed 10.4 times higher degree of hydrolysis compared to free enzyme. As result, 2.83-fold increase of n-3 PUFA content in deacidified oil was obtained by using CRL-CLEA. The resultant oil had negligible di- and triglycerides content, proving higher efficiency in hydrolysing ester bonds of fatty acids, other than n-3 PUFA. Reusability studies showed CRL-CLEA could be reused up to 5 runs without a substantial reduction in its performance. Improvement in degree of hydrolysis, thermostability, efficiency of hydrolysis and reusability were achieved due to bioimprinting and subsequent immobilization of CRL in the form of CLEA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida rugosa 3abovine serum albumin 3across-linking reagents 3acrosslinking 3aenzyme activity 3aethanol 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahydrolysis 3aoleic acid 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apolyethyleneimine 3apolysorbates 3asardine oil 3athermal stability 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3atriacylglycerols 0aBSA 0aCLEA 0aCRL 0aCRL-CLEA 0aDHA 0aDOH 0aEPA 0aFFA 0aMA 0an-3 PUFA 0aOA 0aPA 0aPEI 0aBioimprinting 0aBSA 0aCross-linked enzyme aggregates 0aCandida rugosa lipase 0an-3 PUFA 0aSardine oil1 aBelur, Prasanna D.1 aIyyasami, Regupathi0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2018 Mar., v. 110 p.20-29dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12419x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2017.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03578naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010100172300001800273520102000291536088901311592002802200596015702228596005502385596014202440650002202582650001002604650001402614650002002628650002202648650002202670650001102692650002302703650002202726650001302748650001902761653001802780653001402798653001302812653002402825653001602849700002202865773012602887856008603013852000903099655001203108IND60699837420221119194921.0200708e20191225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069983742DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2020.17518892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuranelli, R.

Our aim was to compare the genetic differentiation of mangrove crabs coexisting along the western Atlantic in order to verify if there are common barriers, using two mitochondrial DNA markers to quantify genetic differentiation, variance and diversity. In addition, we included a mismatch distribution to check demographic history. Our data revealed that species with similar pelagic larval duration had either high genetic differentiation or the absence of genetic structure. These results can be explained by factors that contribute to genetic differentiation, such as the presence of large estuarine areas (acting as barriers), ocean currents, and larval behaviour. Also, historical events that promoted the isolation of some areas in the past, such as glacial cycles during the Pleistocene, could have caused the observed high levels of genetic divergence in some species.  aThis article was part of a PhD thesis by RCB supported by scientific fellowship from São Paulo Research Foundation – FAPESP (DD 2012/06299-5 and BEPE 2014/11659-6).

Our prospective follow-up study included only men who were nondiabetic at baseline and who had data available at the 5-y follow-up visit (n = 735).Results: Our study showed that, after adjustment for confounding factors, palmitoleic acid (16:1n–7; P = 2.8 × 10−7), dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (20:3n−6; P = 2.3 × 10−4), the ratio of 16:1n–7 to 16:0 (P = 1.6 × 10−8) as a marker of stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase 1 activity, and the ratio of 20:3n−6 to 18:2n−6 (P = 9.4 × 10−7) as a marker of Δ6-desaturase activity significantly predicted the worsening of hyperglycemia (glucose area under the curve in an oral-glucose-tolerance test). In contrast, linoleic acid (18:2n−6; P = 0.0015) and the ratio of 18:1n–7 to 16:1n–7 (P = 1.5 × 10−9) as a marker of elongase activity had opposite associations. Statistical significance persisted even after adjustment for baseline insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and glycemia. Palmitoleic acid (P = 0.010) and the ratio of 16:1n–7 to 16:0 (P = 0.004) nominally predicted incident type 2 diabetes, whereas linoleic acid had an opposite association (P = 0.004), and n−3 polyunsaturated fatty acids did not show any associations.Conclusion: EMFAs and their ratios are associated longitudinally with changes in glycemia and the risk type 2 diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3abody mass index 3aclinical nutrition 3aerythrocytes 3aglucose 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin secretion 3alinoleic acid 3amen 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apalmitoleic acid 3arisk1 aÅgren, Jyrki1 aUusitupa, Matti1 aCederberg, Henna1 aVangipurapu, Jagadish1 aStančáková, Alena1 aSchwab, Ursula1 aKuusisto, Johanna1 aLaakso, Markku0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2014 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.79-85dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.113.0697403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04223naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008400164300001600248520269500264592002802959650002602987650000903013650001403022650002203036650001303058650001603071650001303087650000903100650002103109650002403130650001103154650001403165650002603179650001403205650000903219650001203228650000903240650001103249653002003260653001203280653001503292653002603307700001403333700001803347700001703365700001603382700001703398700001803415700001403433773011803447856008303565852000903648655001203657IND60566283220221121232108.0190312e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056628322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2017.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBomberg, E.14aThe Financial Costs, Behaviour and Psychology of Obesity: A One Health Analysis  ap. 310-325.  aPeople who are overweight or have obesity are estimated to comprise 30% of the global population and up to 59% of companion dogs and cats are estimated to be above their optimal body weight. The prevalence of human and companion obesity is increasing. The direct and indirect costs of obesity and associated comorbidities are significant for human and veterinary healthcare.There are numerous similarities between obesity in people and companion animals, likely related to the shared environmental and lifestyle elements of this multifactorial disease. While the study of human obesity is relatively robust, research conducted in pets is generally limited to small studies, studies with cross-sectional designs or reports that have yet to be replicated. Greater understanding of human obesity may elucidate some of the factors driving the more recent rise in pet obesity. In particular, there are overlapping features of obesity in children and pets that are, in part, related to dependency on their ‘parents’ for care and feeding. When feeding is used in a coercive and controlling fashion, it may lead to undesirable feeding behaviour and increase the risk for obesity. A ‘responsive parenting’ intervention teaches parents to respond appropriately to hunger–satiety cues and to recognize and respond to others' distress. Such interventions may impact on childhood overweight and obesity and have the potential to be adapted for use with companion animals.Social behaviour towards people with obesity or owners of pets with obesity is often driven by beliefs about the cause of the obesity. Educating healthcare professionals and the public about the multifactorial nature of this complex disease process is a fundamental step in reducing the bias and stigma associated with obesity. Children living in low-income households have particularly high rates of obesity and as household income falls, rates of obesity also rise in pets and their owners. There are risk regulators (i.e. dynamic components of interconnected systems that influence obesity-related behaviours) and internal factors (i.e. biological determinants of obesity) that may influence the development of both childhood and pet obesity, and poverty may intersect with these variables to exacerbate obesity in low-income environments. This review discusses the costs, behaviours and psychology related to obesity in people and pets, and also proposes potential techniques that can be considered for prevention and treatment of this disease in pets. A ‘One Health’ approach to obesity suggests that an understanding of human obesity may elucidate some of the factors driving the more recent rise in pet obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOne Health initiative 3acats 3achildhood 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3acomorbidity 3adistress 3adogs 3afeeding behavior 3ahealth care workers 3ahumans 3alifestyle 3alow income households 3aparenting 3apets 3apoverty 3arisk 3astigma 0afinancial costs 0aobesity 0aone health 0asocioeconomic factors1 aBirch, L.1 aEndenburg, N.1 aGerman, A.J.1 aNeilson, J.1 aSeligman, H.1 aTakashima, G.1 aDay, M.J.0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2017 May, v. 156, no. 4 p.310-325dElsevier LtdwJournal:1946x0021-99757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2017.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03406naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245016500178300001800343520135000361536063701711592002802348596001802376650001902394650001202413650001902425650002102444651001102465653002002476653002602496653002902522653001402551653004402565700001802609700003002627700002102657700002602678700002202704700002502726773012602751856008602877852000902963655001202972IND60699837520221119195005.0200708e20191225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069983752DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2020.17524062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Wilson J.

One of them, T. nigricans, is the type species of the genus, involved in taxonomic problems for over 150 years. A detailed historical review, accompanied by examination of type specimens and recent collections, revealed that the correct type locality of T. nigricans is in the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro, not Santa Catarina as commonly appears in the literature; specimens previously misidentified as T. nigricans from Santa Catarina belong to a possibly undescribed species of the genus Cambeva; T. paquequerensis is a synonym of T. immaculatus, and T. florensis is a synonym of T. santaeritae; and the hypothesis that T. santaeritae is closely related to the Amazon Sarcoglanidinae is refuted. The three valid species are redescribed. These species are members of a clade also including T. caipora that is highly supported by molecular data, diagnosed by a pronounced posterior maxillary process and caudal fin emarginate at least in larger specimens. A subclade comprising T. caipora, T. nigricans and T. santaeritae is diagnosed by a long maxilla and a bifid anterior extremity of hypobranchial 3.  aThis work was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq; grant 307349/2015-2 to WJEMC and 153329/2015-7 to AMK), Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ; grant E-26/202.328/2018 to JLOM) and Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES; grant 88882.461696/2019-01 to PJV and grant 88882.425731/2019-01 to BOM).

The role and synthesis of this compound are very well documented in bacteria, fungi and mammals. On the contrary, although the presence of carnitine in plant tissue has been reported four decades ago and information about its biological implication are available, nothing is known about its synthesis in plants. We designed experiments to determine if the carnitine biosynthetic pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana is similar to the pathway in mammals and in the fungi Neurospora crassa and Candida albicans. We first checked for the presence of trimetyllysine (TML) and γ-butyrobetaine (γ-BB), two precursors of carnitine in fungi and in mammals, using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Both compounds were shown to be present in plant extracts at concentrations in the picomole range per mg of dry weight. We next synthesized deuterium-labeled TML and transferred A. thaliana seedlings on growth medium supplemented with 1 mM of the deuterated precursor. LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of plant extracts clearly highlighted the synthesis of deuterium labeled γ-BB and labeled carnitine in deuterated-TML fed plants. The similarities between plant, fungal and mammalian pathways provide very useful information to search homologies between genomes. As a matter of fact the analysis of A. thaliana protein database provides homology for several enzymes responsible for carnitine synthesis in fungi and mammals. The study of mutants affected in the corresponding genes would be very useful to elucidate the plant carnitine biosynthetic pathway and to investigate further the role of carnitine in plant physiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCandida albicans 3aNeurospora crassa 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3acarnitine 3aculture media 3adatabases 3adeuterium 3aenzymes 3afungi 3agenes 3aionization 3amammals 3amutants 3aplant extracts 3aplant tissues 3aseedling growth 3atandem mass spectrometry 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBetainexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aBiosynthetic Pathways 2aCarnitinexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aDeuteriumxmetabolism 2aFungixmetabolism 2aLipid Metabolism 2aLysinexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aMammalsxmetabolism 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aSeedlingsxmetabolism. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aVitamin B Complexxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aZhao, Yingjuan1 aMerlier, Franck1 aCharrier, Aurélie1 aPerrin, Yolande0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2012 Nov., v. 60 p.109-114dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01534naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245011500163300001800278520060600296592002800902650001600930650002400946650002700970700002300997700001801020773013101038856007801169852000901247655001201256IND60541878220221116150230.0160823e20160518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054187822DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b017532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagase, Masahiro10a4-Position-Selective C–H Perfluoroalkylation and Perfluoroarylation of Six-Membered Heteroaromatic Compounds  ap. 6103-6106.  aThe first 4-position-selective C–H perfluoroalkylation and perfluoroarylation of six-membered heteroaromatic compounds were achieved using nucleophilic perfluoroalkylation and perfluoroarylation reagents. The regioselectivity was controlled by electrophilically activating the heteroaromatic rings, while sterically hindering the 2-position, with a sterically bulky borane Lewis acid. The reaction proceeded in good yield, even in gram scale, and by a sequential reaction without isolating the intermediates.

This modified SIEPDP-LDH was used as a novel nanoflame-retardant for bisphenol epoxy resins and compared with unmodified pristine LDH. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis justified that intercalation of SIEPDP into LDH increased the interlayer distance to 2.95 nm. Morphological analysis (XRD and TEM) revealed that the SIEPDP-LDH was dispersed well in the epoxy matrix in a partially exfoliated manner. Results from the cone calorimeter tests showed that even a low loading of SIEPDP-LDH into epoxy resin led to a significant decrease in heat release rate and total heat release compared to unmodified LDH/epoxy composites. More interestingly, SIEPDP-LDH/epoxy's UL-94 classification passed V-0 with only 8 wt% loading. Moreover, the addition of SIEPDP-LDH enabled the increase in the impact strength and modulus of the cured epoxy. These data indicated that SIEPDP-LDH could serve as not only a nanoflame retardant but a good reinforcing agent as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaluminum 3acalorimeters 3achemistry 3aepoxides 3aeugenol 3aflame retardants 3aheat 3aimpact strength 3amagnesium 3aphosphorus 3aresins 3asilicon 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aWan, Jintao1 aKalali, Ehsan Naderi1 aFan, Hong1 aWang, De-Yi0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Feb. 3, v. 3, no. 7 p.3471-3479dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta05740f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245012800165300001600293500002000309520142100329592002801750596005201778650002101830650001301851650002001864650001001884650003301894650001801927650002101945651002101966700001701987700002002004700001902024700005902043773013102102856007902233852000902312655001202321IND60750580020221123030534.0210915e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075058002DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.129762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Ki Hyeong10aDifferent patterns of belowground fungal diversity along altitudinal gradients with respect to microhabitat and guild types  ap. 649-658.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFungi are key components of belowground ecosystems with various ecological roles in forests. Although the changes in the richness and composition of belowground fungi across altitudinal gradients have been widely reported, only a few studies have focused on the microhabitat types along altitudinal gradients. Here, we analysed the effect of altitude on the ectomycorrhizal and non‐ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in belowground microhabitats. We collected root and soil samples from 16 Pinus densiflora forests at various altitudes across Korea, and measured the soil properties as potential factors. Fungal communities were analysed by high‐throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region. We found that altitude negatively affected the species richness of root‐inhabiting fungi but did not influence that of soil‐inhabiting fungi. In addition, the composition of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi was less influenced by altitude than non‐ECM fungi. Most of the soil properties did not show a significant relationship with altitude, but the effect of soil properties was different across microhabitat types and ecological roles of fungi. Our results reveal that microhabitat types and altitudinal gradients differently affect the richness and composition of fungal communities associated with P. densiflora, providing a better understanding of plant‐associated fungal communities.  aPublisher supplied data  aKNA1‐1‐25, 19‐2cKorea National Arboretum 3aPinus densiflora 3aaltitude 3aectomycorrhizae 3afungi 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicrohabitats 3aspecies richness 3aKorean Peninsula1 aYoo, Shinnam1 aPark, Myung Soo1 aKim, Chang Sun1 aLim, Young Woon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2864-34490 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2021 Oct., v. 13, no. 5 p.649-658dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.129763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005200144245012700196300001800323500001900341520165600360592002802016650001702044650001502061650001502076650001202091650002102103650001602124650001102140650001502151650002602166653009602192653002402288653002102312653002502333653004102358653004802399700001302447700001902460700001502479700001502494700001802509773013902527856007802666852000902744655001202753IND60728773620221118024151.0210224e20210216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072877362DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c177782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9420-060610aFacile Strategy to Fabricate the Flame Retardant Polyamide 66 Fabric Modified with an Inorganic–Organic Hybrid Structure  ap. 9122-9133.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecently, traditional flame retardant finishing with a single metal compound has been rarely applied owing to its low effectiveness and durability. This study reports metal ion finishing in combination with surface photografting modification (M/P technology) as a novel approach to incorporate an inorganic–organic hybrid structure containing an Fe³⁺ ion onto the surface of the polyamide (PA) 66 fabric. Specifically, the PA fabric was first surface-modified in the presence of acrylic acid (AA) and N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide (MBAAn) during photografting pretreatment under UV irradiation (step I), then further reacted with the Fe³⁺ ion in the metal ion finishing (step II). After treatment with M/P technology, the fabric exhibits the required excellent flame retardancy and dripping resistance. Here, flame retardant tests show that the treated PA fabric has the highest limiting oxygen index (LOI) value of 33.4 and no melt dripping during combustion. An interesting inorganic/organic composite thermal barrier consisting of an inorganic iron oxide nanoparticle (NP) outer layer and an organic micro-intumescent inner layer can be observed on the surface of the burnt fabric. This structure could be responsible for the significant enhancement in the fire performance of the treated fabric. Importantly, the treated fabric is also highly stable during the laundering procedure, which could retain a high Fe/C ratio and an acceptable LOI value of 27.8 after washing 45 times. This confirms the achievement of durable flame retardancy after treatment with M/P technology, and its possible interaction mechanism has been discussed here.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3acombustion 3adurability 3afabrics 3aflame retardants 3airon oxides 3aoxygen 3apolyamides 3aultraviolet radiation 0ametal ion finishing in combination with surface photografting modification (M/P technology) 0apolyamide 66 fabric 0aflame retardancy 0asurface modification 0ainorganic−organic hybrid structure 0ainorganic/organic composite thermal barrier1 aShi, Rui1 aZhang, Zejiang1 aGe, Xinguo1 aLi, Pingli1 aChen, Xiaosui0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Feb. 16, v. 13, no. 7 p.9122-9133dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c177783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245005900176300001600235520139000251592002801641650002401669650001701693650001401710650002501724650001501749650002201764650001301786650002401799651001901823653002301842653002301865653002201888653002001910653001401930653002501944653002401969653002001993773011302013856008502126852000902211655001202220IND60537050720221120042507.0160807e20160807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053705072DNAL7 a10.1080/1523908X.2015.11163772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoucquey, Noëlle C.10aActors and Audiences: Negotiating Fisheries Management  ap. 426-446.  aA bstract This paper combines narrative and policy performance analyses to explore why resource management is contentious even when resources are increasing in abundance. Employing a case study of red drum in North Carolina, the study aimed to find out how different narratives of fishery science interact with policy performances to create outcomes that exacerbate conflicts. Examining six years of fisheries governance, the study explores how policy performances shape managers’ interpretations of fisheries science and modes of interacting with each other. The study finds that despite being a so-called success story, red drum management remains controversial because while user groups are concerned about access and allocation questions, managers focus on debating the meaning and implications of scientific data. Though compromises between user groups are made, conflict continues because the process through which they are reached creates frustration rather than understanding. That resource access dilemmas remain so prominent confirms that continually increasing scientific information has done little to solve resource conflicts, a key point in the dawning era of ‘big data'. The findings underscore the need for more scrutiny of how policy-making is performed, to provide insight into where interventions might promote better collaboration and acceptance of compromises.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSciaenops ocellatus 3acase studies 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3amanagers 3aresource management 3aNorth Carolina 0aPolicy performance 0anarrative analysis 0apolitical ecology 0ascience studies 0afisheries 0aenvironmental policy 0aresource management 0apolicy analysis0 tJournal of environmental policy & planning.g2016 Aug. 7, v. 18, no. 4 p.426-446dRoutledgex1522-72007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1523908X.2015.11163773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011200158300002000270520149400290592002801784650001301812650001301825650001101838650001301849650001601862650001401878700001501892700001801907700001901925700001601944700001801960773012401978856007402102852000902176655001202185IND60641985920221119155901.0190506e20170616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064198592DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04586g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mingguang10aEffect of organic cathode interfacial layers on efficiency and stability improvement of polymer solar cells  ap. 31158-31163.  aThe cathode interfacial layer (CIL) plays a vital role in enhancing the efficiency and lifetime performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs). Here, we compared the use of various organic semiconducting molecules, tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato) aluminum (Alq₃), bathocuproine (BCP) and 1,3,5-tri(m-pyrid-3-yl-phenyl)benzene (TmPyPB), as CILs in PSCs and analyzed their influence on device performance. Compared to the inorganic LiF CIL-based PSCs, significantly higher photovoltaic performance was observed by using these organic CILs in both PTB7:PC₇₁BM and P3HT:PC₆₁BM PSCs. Specifically, TmPyPB CIL-based devices exhibit superior device stability and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 7.96%. A systematic study on the effects of Frontier orbital energy levels, surface morphology, and electron mobility of CILs suggests that a relatively coarse interface morphology would be helpful in the formation of high-density interfacial defect states for efficient electron extraction and a high mobility is of central importance in facilitating electron collection for high PCEs. Moreover, a synergistic effect between the inorganic LiF and organic molecules in the dual-CIL could contribute to the further enhancement of PSC efficiency (8.01%) and ambient stability. This work reveals fundamental principles in regulating the functions of CILs and would hopefully promote the investigation and development of ideal organic CILs for high-performance PSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acathodes 3aenergy 3apolymers 3asolar cells 3asynergism1 aZhang, Wen1 aWang, Honglei1 aChen, Lingfeng1 aZheng, Chao1 aChen, Runfeng0 tRSC advances.g2017 June 16, v. 7, no. 50 p.31158-31163dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra04586g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013200167520182400299592002802123650001202151650001102163650001602174650001002190650001502200650003102215650001902246650001102265650005002276650001502326650001902341650004002360650002902400650001902429650001502448650002302463650001802486650001602504650001502520653000902535653001202544653000802556653001002564653001002574653000902584653000902593653000902602653000902611700002102620700005402641700001902695700006602714700001802780700001602798773011102814856008102925852000903006655001203015IND60683448120221119062827.0200210e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068344812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1116862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhaoying14aThe potential of satellite FPAR product for GPP estimation: An indirect evaluation using solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence  aSatellite remotely sensed fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) products are widely used in land-surface monitoring and modeling, especially for estimating global terrestrial photosynthetic activity through light use efficiency (LUE) models. PAR absorbed by active chlorophyll (APARcₕₗ) is directly linked to vegetation photosynthesis and can be used to estimate ecosystem gross primary production (GPP). Previous studies have demonstrated that solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence has very tight relationship with APARcₕₗ at various ecosystems. Therefore, the solar angle normalized SIF (nSIF) is directly related to the fraction of PAR absorbed by chlorophyll (FPARcₕₗ). This paper intercompared six space FPAR products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). Their potential relationships with FPARcₕₗ were indirectly evaluated with both spaceborne (Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, OCO-2 and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument, TROPOMI) and airborne (Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer, CFIS) nSIF data as well as in situ GPP measurements. Our results show that these FPAR products are different in terms of amplitudes and seasonal variations across biomes. Among six FPAR products, OLCI FPAR shows the best relationships with TROPOMI nSIF740, OCO-2 nSIF757, and CFIS nSIF755. The coefficient of determination (R²) for the relationship between OLCI FPAR and TROPOMI nSIF740 is 0.79 ± 0.17 on a global average. APAR calculated from OLCI also exhibits the best relationship (R² = 0.79) with in situ GPP over 25 flux towers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3acarbon 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3aecosystems 3agross primary productivity 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3aphotosynthesis 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aradiation use efficiency 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3aspectrometers 3atroposphere 3avegetation 0aFPAR 0aFPARchl 0aSIF 0aMODIS 0aVIIRS 0aCGLS 0aEPIC 0aMISR 0aOLCI1 aZhang, Yongguang1 aZhang, Yao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7468-24091 aGobron, Nadine1 aFrankenberg, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0546-58571 aWang, Songhan1 aLi, Zhaohui0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Apr., v. 240 p.111686-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1116863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245012400210300001600334500001900350520169800369592002802067596007002095596006902165596007102234650001702305650002102322650001602343650002102359650002202380650002602402650001802428650001502446650001302461650002202474650002202496650001802518650002002536650001402556650001102570650002002581650001202601650002102613650001102634650002402645650002202669650001702691650001502708700006302723700006402786773011302850856008202963852000903045655001203054IND60708470520221121121332.0200826e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070847052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10453-020-09638-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatz, Daniel S.

Mechanistic models could be well suited for this task, but their development will require data on pollen production across cities, including estimates of pollen production by individual trees. In this study, we developed predictive models for pollen production as a function of trunk size, canopy area, and height, which are commonly recorded in tree surveys or readily extracted from remote sensing data. Pollen production was estimated by measuring the number of flowers per tree, the number of anthers per flower, and the number of pollen grains per anther. Variability at each morphological scale was assessed using bootstrapping. Pollen production was estimated for the following species: Acer negundo, Acer platanoides, Acer rubrum, Acer saccharinum, Betula papyrifera, Gleditsia triacanthos, Juglans nigra, Morus alba, Platanus × acerifolia, Populus deltoides, Quercus palustris, Quercus rubra, and Ulmus americana. Basal area predicted pollen production with a mean R² of 0.72 (range 0.41–0.99), whereas canopy area predicted pollen production with a mean R² of 0.76 (range 0.50–0.99). These equations are applied to two tree datasets to estimate total municipal pollen production and the spatial distribution of street tree pollen production for the focal species. We present some of the first individual-tree based estimates of pollen production at the municipal scale; the observed spatial heterogeneity in pollen production is substantial and can feasibly be included in mechanistic models of airborne pollen at fine spatial scales.  aPublisher supplied data  aF32 ES026477cNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  aP30ES017885cNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  aUL1 TR002240cNational Center for Advancing Translational Sciences 3aAcer negundo 3aAcer platanoides 3aAcer rubrum 3aAcer saccharinum 3aBetula papyrifera 3aGleditsia triacanthos 3aJuglans nigra 3aMorus alba 3aPlatanus 3aPopulus deltoides 3aQuercus palustris 3aQuercus rubra 3aUlmus americana 3aallometry 3acanopy 3adata collection 3aflowers 3ahypersensitivity 3apollen 3apollen productivity 3aspatial variation 3astreet trees 3atree trunk1 aMorris, Jonathan R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0878-72531 aBatterman, Stuart A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9894-53250 tAerobiologia.g2020 Sept., v. 36, no. 3 p.401-415dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870027x0393-59657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10453-020-09638-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245015200165300001600317500002000333520157600353592002801929596002401957650001301981650001701994650002602011650000902037650001402046650001102060650001202071650002902083650002302112650001502135650001902150650002902169650001702198650001402215700001702229700001802246700001702264700005902281700006102340773013102401856007902532852000902611655001202620IND60750580220221123030442.0210915e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075058022DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.129742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadchity, Linda10aAcrAB, the major RND‐type efflux pump of Photorhabdus laumondii, confers intrinsic multidrug‐resistance and contributes to virulence in insects  ap. 637-648.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe resistance‐nodulation‐division (RND)‐type efflux pumps AcrAB and MdtABC contribute to multidrug‐resistance (MDR) in Gram‐negative bacteria. Photorhabdus is a symbiotic bacterium of soil nematodes that also produces virulence factors killing insects by septicaemia. We previously showed that mdtA deletion in Photorhabdus laumondii TT01 resulted in no detrimental phenotypes. Here, we investigated the roles of the last two putative RND transporters in TT01 genome, AcrAB and AcrAB‐like (Plu0759‐Plu0758). Only ΔacrA and ΔmdtAΔacrA mutants were multidrug sensitive, even to triphenyltetrazolium chloride and bromothymol blue used for Photorhabdus isolation from nematodes on the nutrient bromothymol blue‐triphenyltetrazolium chloride agar (NBTA) medium. Both mutants also displayed slightly attenuated virulence after injection into Spodoptera littoralis. Transcriptional analysis revealed intermediate levels of acrAB expression in vitro, in vivo and post‐mortem, whereas its putative transcriptional repressor acrR was weakly expressed. Yet, plasmid‐mediated acrR overexpression did not decrease acrAB transcript levels neither MDR in TT01 WT. While no pertinent mutations were detected in acrR of the same P. laumondii strain grown either on NBTA or nutrient agar, we suggest that AcrR‐mediated repression of acrAB is not physiologically required under conditions tested. Finally, we propose that AcrAB is the primary RND‐efflux pump, which is essential for MDR in Photorhabdus and may confer adaptive advantages during insect infection.  aPublisher supplied data  cLebanese University 3aNematoda 3aPhotorhabdus 3aSpodoptera littoralis 3aagar 3achlorides 3agenome 3ainsects 3amultiple drug resistance 3arepressor proteins 3asepticemia 3asoil nematodes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransporters 3avirulence1 aLanois, Anne1 aKiwan, Paloma1 aNassar, Fida1 aGivaudan, Alain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3901-51331 aKhattar, Ziad Abi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4386-74670 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2021 Oct., v. 13, no. 5 p.637-648dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.129743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01958naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245016800166300001800334520068800352592002801040650001201068650001201080650002401092650001501116650001501131650001401146650002101160650001401181650002001195650001801215650001401233700001901247700002701266700002501293700002401318773013101342856007801473852000901551655001201560IND60541878420221116150322.0170502e20160518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054187842DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b021322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCummings, Steven
P.10aTetrahydroxydiboron-Mediated Palladium-Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation and Deuteriation of Alkenes and Alkynes Using Water as the Stoichiometric H or D Atom Donor  ap. 6107-6110.  aThere are few examples of catalytic transfer hydrogenations of simple alkenes and alkynes that use water as a stoichiometric H or D atom donor. We have found that diboron reagents efficiently mediate the transfer of H or D atoms from water directly onto unsaturated C–C bonds using a palladium catalyst. This reaction is conducted on a broad variety of alkenes and alkynes at ambient temperature, and boric acid is the sole byproduct. Mechanistic experiments suggest that this reaction is made possible by a hydrogen atom transfer from water that generates a Pd–hydride intermediate. Importantly, complete deuterium incorporation from stoichiometric D₂O has also been achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3aalkynes 3aambient temperature 3aboric acid 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3adeuterium 3adeuterium oxide 3ahydrogenation 3apalladium1 aLe, Thanh-Ngoc1 aFernandez, Gilberto E.1 aQuiambao, Lorenzo G.1 aStokes, Benjamin J.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 May 18, v. 138, no. 19 p.6107-6110dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b021323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245011200164300001400276520193100290592002802221650001502249650001502264650001102279650002002290650002102310650001702331650001602348650001002364650001002374651002302384653001002407653001602417653002302433653001702456653001602473653001602489773010802505856007702613852000902690655001202699IND60519986820221120124342.0160512e20131012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051998682DNAL7 a10.2478/ffp-2013-00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBallian, Dalibor10aGenetic overload of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) from five populations from central Bosnia and Herzegovina  ap. 49-57.  aThe research was conducted with a view to establishing physiological parameters of the silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) with regard to germination energy, absolute germination and genetic overload produced by silver fir populations. The intention was to identify significant variability within populations and subpopulations, or rather within the two combined, and to give recommendations on the usage and usability of seeds from specific populations. The results form a basis for establishing silver fir genetic overload within five fir populations of central Bosnia and Herzegovina. The results of research on the characteristics such as absolute seed weight, germination energy and absolute germination are within a scope of previous studies. The studied physiological characteristics of silver fir seeds in the central Bosnia area showed distinct individual and inter-population variability when compared to variability of the subpopulations analyzed. The inclusion of non-physiological data (height, DBH, age and the presence of mistletoe) concerning sampled trees proved to be effective new quality of research. No correlation was found between DBH and seed physiological characteristics but increased tree height had a positive effect on seed quality in terms of absolute germination and growth, proportional to tree height. This in turn shows that seeds should be collected only from trees of above average height, because they are less genetically overloaded. The characteristics of healthy but ungerminated seeds from less tall trees displayed lower parameter values, also indicating that seeds should be collected from taller than average trees only. The presence of mistletoe had a very interesting effect of increasing rotten seeds percentage, and therefore reducing seed quality. Accordingly, seed collection should be limited to trees not affected by mistletoe, however further research on this aspect is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aSantalales 3aenergy 3aseed collecting 3aseed germination 3aseed quality 3aseed weight 3aseeds 3atrees 3aBosnia-Herzegovina 0aseeds 0agermination 0aungerminated seeds 0arotten seeds 0aempty seeds 0apopulations0 tFolia forestalia Polonica.g2013 Oct. 12, v. 55, no. 2 p.49-57dVersitawJournal:14917x2199-59077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ffp-2013-00063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245014200165300001800307500001900325520178400344592002802128650002302156650001702179650001302196653002902209653002302238653002102261653004002282653003202322653003402354700002102388700005502409700006202464700002402526700007102550773013902621856007902760852000902839655001202848IND60728773820221118024146.0210423e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072877382DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c179292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRastogi, Rishabh10aAnalyte Co-localization at Electromagnetic Gap Hot-Spots for Highly Sensitive (Bio)molecular Detection by Plasmon Enhanced Spectroscopies  ap. 9113-9121.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aElectromagnetic hot-spots at ultranarrow plasmonic nanogaps carry immense potential to drive detection limits down to few molecules in sensors based on surface-enhanced Raman or fluorescence spectroscopies. However, leveraging the EM hot-spots requires access to the gaps, which in turn depends on the size of the analyte in relation to gap distances. Herein, we leverage a well-calibrated process based on self-assembly of block copolymer colloids on a full-wafer level to produce high-density plasmonic nanopillar arrays exhibiting a large number (>10¹⁰ cm–²) of uniform interpillar EM hot-spots. The approach allows convenient handles to systematically vary the interpillar gap distances down to a sub-10 nm regime. The results show compelling trends of the impact of analyte dimensions in relation to the gap distances toward their leverage over interpillar hot-spots and the resulting sensitivity in SERS-based molecular assays. Comparing the detection of labeled proteins in surface-enhanced Raman and metal-enhanced fluorescence configurations further reveal the relative advantage of fluorescence over Raman detection while encountering the spatial limitations imposed by the gaps. Quantitative assays with limits of detection down to picomolar concentrations are realized for both small organic molecules and proteins. The well-defined geometries delivered by a nanofabrication approach are critical to arriving at realistic geometric models to establish meaningful correlation between the structure, optical properties, and sensitivity of nanopillar arrays in plasmonic assays. The findings emphasize the need for the rational design of EM hot-spots that takes into account the analyte dimensions to drive ultrahigh sensitivity in plasmon-enhanced spectroscopies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3afluorescence 3ageometry 0aelectromagnetic hot-spot 0aplasmonic bioassay 0ananopillar array 0asurface-enhanced raman spectroscopy 0ametal-enhanced fluorescence 0asurface-enhanced spectroscopy1 aArianfard, Hamed1 aMoss, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5195-17441 aJuodkazis, Saulius1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3542-38741 aAdam, Pierre-Michel1 aKrishnamoorthy, Sivashankar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0410-16960 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 13, no. 7 p.9113-9121dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c179293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245005500183300001600238520156600254592002801820650002601848650001401874650002201888650001601910650001001926650004201936650001901978650001101997650000902008650002202017650001902039650001802058650000902076650002902085650003102114650005602145650003602201650003702237650002402274650002502298650003202323650002002355650003802375650001102413700001602424700001602440773009402456856004802550852000902598655001202607IND50072315820221122065518.0140126e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007231582DNAL7 a243711892pmid7 a10.1007/s12041-013-0288-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTANG, ZI-HUI10aHuman genetics of diabetic vascular complications   ap. 677-694.  aDiabetic vascular complications (DVC) affecting several important organ systems of human body such as the cardiovascular system constitute a major public health problem. There is evidence demonstrating that genetic factors contribute to the risk of DVC genetic variants, structural variants, and epigenetic changes play important roles in the development of DVC. Genetic linkage studies have uncovered a number of genetic loci that may shape the risk of DVC. Genetic association studies have identified many common genetic variants for susceptibility to DVC. Structural variants such as copy number variation and interactions of gene × environment have also been detected by association analysis. Apart from the nuclear genome, mitochondrial DNA plays a critical role in regulation of development of DVC. Epigenetic studies have indicated epigenetic changes in chromatin affecting gene transcription in response to environmental stimuli, which provided a large body of evidence of regulating development of diabetes mellitus. Recently, a new window has opened on identifying rare and common genetic loci through next generation sequencing technologies. This review focusses on the current knowledge of the genetic and epigenetic basis of DVC. Ultimately, identification of genes or genetic loci, structural variants and epigenetic changes contributing to risk of or protection from DVC will help uncover the complex mechanism(s) underlying DVC, with crucial implications for the development of personalized medicine for diabetes mellitus and its complications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiovascular system 3achromatin 3adiabetes mellitus 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahuman genetics 3ahumans 3aloci 3amitochondrial DNA 3anuclear genome 3apublic health 3arisk 3atranscription (genetics) 2aDNA Copy Number Variations 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xcomplicationsxgenetics. 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxgenetics 2aDiabetic Nephropathiesxgenetics 2aEpigenesis, Genetic 2aGenes, Mitochondrial 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHumans1 aFang, Zhou,1 aZHOU, LINUO0 tJournal of genetics.g2013 Dec., v. 92, no. 3 p.677-694dSpringer-Verlagx0022-13337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-013-0288-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245008000208520166100288592002801949650002001977650001101997650001002008650001902018650001102037650001202048650001202060651001202072653003002084653001702114653002102131653001902152700002002171700006102191700002002252700005702272773011102329856008102440852000902521655001202530IND60683448320221119062928.0200210e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068344832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1116882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChernyshov, Pavel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7513-149X10aRapid wavelet-based bathymetry inversion method for nearshore X-band radars  aA wavelet based method for bathymetry retrieval from X-band radar images is proposed. The method combines traditional Fast Fourier Transform techniques for retrieving peak frequency maps by evaluating the spectral peaks in the time domain, and a localized 2D Continuous Wavelet Transform for retrieving the corresponding peak wavenumbers. The main improvements of the new method compared to conventional FFT-based methods are as follows: a) the wavelet-based approach is localized - naturally fitting the inhomogeneous conditions typically found in the nearshore environment; b) it is continuous and uses wave phase information providing smooth bathymetry maps with good accuracy (RMSE in the range 2.6–6.6% of the maximum water depth); c) it requires relatively small number of successive images without the limitation of requiring a uniform time step.In order to verify the proposed method, 2D simulations of wave shoaling and refraction were performed for different sea conditions and over several bottom topographies. A radar image model including tilt and shadowing modulations together with speckle noise was applied to the simulated surface elevations to provide synthetic radar images. The method's ability to reconstruct the original bathymetry is shown to be robust in intermediate to shallow water depths (kₚh < 1) for all cases. The method was also applied to real data acquired in Sylt island (Germany). A comparison between a bathymetric survey held prior to a storm and a radar reconstructed one during the storm shows very good agreement. These results reassure the high capability of this new method to be used in operational settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3amodels 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3astorms 3asurveys 3awavelet 3aGermany 0aBathymetry reconstruction 0aX-band radar 0aWavelet analysis 0aShoaling waves1 aVrecica, Teodor1 aStreßer, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6214-81611 aCarrasco, Ruben1 aToledo, Yaron1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0025-95090 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Apr., v. 240 p.111688-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1116883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005200151245010400203520131900307592002801626650001501654650001301669650002201682650001101704650001301715650002201728650001201750650002001762650002201782650001101804650001601815650001901831650001301850653002401863653002201887653001801909653002301927700006001950700002602010700001302036773011402049856008602163852000902249655001202258IND60783485820221116164957.0220816e20220920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078348582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1331122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Yi,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0590-099410aDecomposition of PVDF to delaminate cathode materials from end-of-life lithium-ion battery cathodes  aThe growing demand of electric vehicles and rapid consumption of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) require recycling of spent cathode active materials (CAMs) to reduce hazardous wastes and supply raw materials to LIB production. To separate CAMs from the cathode, direct calcination of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder is widely applied, which leads to high energy consumption and release of toxic hydrogen fluoride. It is desirable to have an environmentally friendly and effective alternative to traditional direct calcination. In this study, five lithium salts, LiOAc (lithium acetate), LiNO₃, LiCl, Li₂CO₃, and Li₂SO₄, were deployed and compared for their performance in recycling CAMs. A peel-off efficiency of up to 98.5% was achieved at a LiOAc to LiNO₃ molar ratio of 3:2, salt to cathode mass ratio of 10:1, and temperature of 300 °C at a holding time of 30 min. This system avoids corrosive chemicals and minimizes particle agglomeration of recycled products. Compared with sodium salt systems (NaOAc-NaNO₃) or direct calcination, the LiOAc-LiNO₃ system prevented high reaction temperature or further lithium loss, and minimized crystal structure and morphological changes. A decomposition mechanism of PVDF through adsorption of HF and fluorine substitution was proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acathodes 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3afluorine 3ahydrofluoric acid 3alithium 3alithium acetate 3alithium batteries 3asodium 3atemperature 3athermoplastics 3atoxicity 0aLithium-ion battery 0aCathode materials 0aLithium salts 0aPVDF decomposition1 aJafvert, Chad T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3475-70661 aZyaykina, Nadezhda N.1 aZhao, Fu0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 20, v. 367 p.133112-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1331123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03348naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245012900208520195100337592002802288650001502316650001502331650001802346650002002364650002102384650002602405650004302431650001102474650001802485650001302503650001502516650001902531650003002550651001902580653002302599653003402622700006502656773012602721856008202847852000902929655001202938IND60683448420221119063012.0200221e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068344842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1116892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, Timothy S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4731-276810aIncorporating environmental data in abundance-based algorithms for deriving phytoplankton size classes in the Atlantic Ocean  aEnvironmental conditions are important drivers in regulating the distribution pattern of phytoplankton composition in the world's oceans. We constructed models that predict pico-, nano- and micro-phytoplankton size classes and assessed the impact of separately including sea surface temperature (SST) and estimates of light level in the surface mixed-layer on model skill. The empirical models were trained using size classes estimated by chemotaxonomic analysis of in situ high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigments and environmental data originating from the Atlantic Ocean. As the accuracy of transforming pigment data into quantitative size classes is crucial when constructing phytoplankton size composition (PSC) models, we also quantified the resulting differences of our and several existing PSC models when using class sizes derived from HPLC pigments by two common chemotaxonomic methods, CHEMTAX and Diagnostic Pigments (DP). Addition of the environmental variables to abundance-based models using our approach improved the skill of correctly predicting PSC, reducing the root mean square difference (RMSD) by 10 to 20% in the best cases. Addition of SST yielded the highest percentage decreases, on average, for all three size classes, with greatest improvement in microplankton and nanoplankton fractions. These models performed equal to or better than several existing abundance-based models. The improvements in model predictions, however, could be obscured by the choice of pigment method used to generate the initial PSC data set. Insufficient data is available to assess whether CHEMTAX or DP is the more appropriate chemotaxonomic method to employ when estimating PSC. Further collection and analysis of additional water samples for phytoplankton taxa and size by microscopic methods - including traditional microscopic cell counts and automated methods - and HPLC pigment data are required to answer this question.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aautomation 3achemotaxonomy 3adata collection 3aempirical models 3aenvironmental factors 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aoceans 3aphytoplankton 3apigments 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asurface water temperature 3aAtlantic Ocean 0aPhytoplankton size 0aPhytoplankton functional type1 aBrown, Christopher W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9905-63910 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Apr., v. 240 p.111689-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1116893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010500169300001600274520149900290592002801789650002701817650001901844650002201863650001101885650001401896650002101910650003301931650001901964650002901983650001202012651001002024653002602034653002102060653002702081653002502108653002402133700001802157773011202175856008602287852000902373655001202382IND60592476420221118040513.0201209e20180520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059247642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.2542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zhen-Yu10aCritical factors affecting the development of renewable energy power generation: Evidence from China  ap. 466-480.  aAs the largest energy consumption country, China is facing a number of energy related challenges including energy sustainability, global warming and environmental pollution, which have forced China to promote renewable energy (RE) utilization proactively. Stimulated by various incentive policies, renewable energy power generation (REPG) in China has achieved tremendous growth in terms of new installed capacity. However, RE power provides only about 26% of national electricity generation in China so far, with great potential in the future. This study presents a systematical investigation on critical factors (CFs) affecting REPG development in China. Through multi-facet content analysis, a total of 43 influence factors for REPG development have been identified. Then, 33 CFs affecting REPG development within the context of China have been extracted and prioritized using questionnaire survey and relative importance index (RII) model. Furthermore, the CFs are condensed to 12 principal components (PCs) by applying principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, a novel driving force model is established to demonstrate the interaction mechanisms for REPG development formed by the PCs and CFs. In addition, policy implications based on the research results are proposed to effectively promote REPG. The findings not only help to understand the significant forces on REPG development in China, but also offer useful references for other countries that intend to promote RE in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity generation 3aglobal warming 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apollution 3apower generation 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquestionnaires 3arenewable energy sources 3asurveys 3aChina 0aRenewable energy (RE) 0aPower generation 0aCritical factors (CFs) 0aQuestionnaire survey 0aDriving force model1 aChen, Yu-Long0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 May 20, v. 184 p.466-480dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.2543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245014600162300001400308520101100322592002801333650001801361650002001379650001001399650001301409650001701422650000901439650001401448650001201462650001401474650001901488650001601507650001401523650002001537650002201557650001001579651001601589651001101605653001701616653002601633653002201659653002901681700002401710773010801734856007701842852000901919655001201928IND60519987120221120133857.0160512e20131012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051998712DNAL7 a10.2478/ffp-2013-00092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazur, Andrzej10aPhenology of development and population characteristics of the small spruce bark beetle Ips amitinus (Eichh.) in the Karkonoski National Park  ap. 89-96.  aIn the years 2005- 2006, in the Karkonoski National Park there were conducted observations on infestation of spruce trees by bark beetles (Col., Curculionidae, Scolytinae). Data on bark beetle species composition and frequency of occurrence of individual species were collected. The data on development phenology of the small spruce bark beetle Ips amitinus in the upper subalpine spruce forest sites (1000- 1250 m a.s.l.) indicated higher frequency of occurrence of this species (26.3%) when compared to the European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. The study included analyses of population size, density, fecundity and mortality of I. amitinus. The rate of development in I. amitinus in the Karkonosze Mts. is similar to that observed in the Alps. The number of laid eggs observed was low and the reproduction success was very high at minimal mortality. Establishment of feeding galleries and egg laying lasted several weeks and 1/3 of feeding galleries were found in the second series of trap trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurculionidae 3aIps typographus 3aPicea 3aaltitude 3abark beetles 3aeggs 3afecundity 3aforests 3amortality 3anational parks 3aoviposition 3aphenology 3apopulation size 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aAlps region 3aPoland 0aIps amitinus 0adevelopment phenology 0apopulation traits 0aKarkonoski National Park1 aKuźmiński, Robert0 tFolia forestalia Polonica.g2013 Oct. 12, v. 55, no. 2 p.89-96dVersitawJournal:14917x2199-59077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ffp-2013-00093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245012100160300001800281500001900299520103400318592002801352650000801380650002001388650001101408650001901419650001101438650001301449650001601462650002201478650001901500653002601519653001601545653002701561653002601588653003301614700001201647700001701659700001901676700001701695700005201712700005401764700005701818700001401875700001601889700005701905773013901962856007802101852000902179655001202188IND60728774220221118024315.0210224e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072877422DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c180092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Dongxu10aConstruction of an Iodine Diffusion Barrier Using Network Structure Silicone Resin for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells  ap. 8138-8146.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLong-term stability of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is inhibited by ion diffusion. Herein, we introduce a thermally stable and hydrophobic silicone resin layer with a network structure as an interfacial layer between the perovskite and the hole-transporting layer (HTL). Experimental and theoretical investigations confirm that the small Si–O–Si unit in the network forms both Si–I and Pb–O bonds with the perovskite surface, which physically and chemically inhibit the diffusion and self-release of iodine. Besides, the silicone resin layer suppresses the thermal crystallization of spiro-OMeTAD and optimizes the interfacial energy level alignment for hole extraction. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a perovskite solar cell with a silicone resin layer is improved to 21.11%. The device maintains more than 90.1% of its original PCE after 1200 h under 85 °C thermal stress, 99.6% after 2000 h under RH ∼55 ± 5%, and 83% of its original PCE after light soaking in air for 1037 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acrystallization 3aenergy 3ahydrophobicity 3aiodine 3asilicone 3asolar cells 3athermal stability 3athermal stress 0aperovskite solar cell 0apassivation 0aiodine diffuse barrier 0astability improvement 0aspiro-OMeTAD crystallization1 aXu, Xin1 aWang, Jiming1 aZhang, Tiankai1 aXie, Fangyan1 aGong, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1259-74011 aChen, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5725-43681 aShi, Tingting1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5686-67061 aShi, Jifu1 aLiu, Pengyi1 aXie, Weiguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3706-63590 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 13, no. 7 p.8138-8146dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c180093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015000159300002000309500001900329520119900348592002801547650001701575650002301592650001401615650001401629650001701643650001601660700001701676700001601693700001501709700001601724700001601740700001501756700001501771773012501786856007401911852000901985655001201994IND60715855120221118212437.0201104e20201102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071585512DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra06877b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shuangming10aFacile sub-/supercritical water synthesis of nanoflake MoVTeNbOₓ-mixed metal oxides without post-heat treatment and their catalytic performance  ap. 39922-39930.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA fast and simple sub-/supercritical water synthesis method is presented in this work in which MoVTeNbOₓ-mixed metal oxides with various phase compositions and morphologies could be synthesized without post-heat treatment. It was demonstrated that the system temperature for synthesis had a significant influence on the physico-chemical properties of MoVTeNbOₓ. Higher temperatures were beneficial for the formation of a mixed crystalline phase containing TeVO₄, Te₃Mo₂V₂O₁₇, Mo₄O₁₁ and TeO₂, which are very different from the crystalline phases of conventional Mo–V–Te–Nb-mixed metal oxides. While at lower temperatures, Mo₄O₁₁ was replaced by Te. At high temperature, the as-prepared samples presented distinct nanoflake morphologies with an average size of 10–60 nm in width and exhibited excellent catalytic performances in the selective oxidation of propylene to acrylic acid. It is illustrated that the large specific surface area, presence of Mo₄O₁₁ and superficial Mo⁶⁺ and Te⁴⁺ ions are responsible for the high propylene conversion, while suitable acidic sites and superficial Nb⁵⁺ ions improved the selectivity to acrylic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3acatalytic activity 3aoxidation 3apropylene 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aLiu, Yongwei1 aFan, Yaoxin1 aLu, Zixuan1 aYan, Yunong1 aDeng, Luyao1 aZhang, Zhe1 aYu, Sansan0 tRSC advances.g2020 Nov. 02, v. 10, no. 65 p.39922-39930dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra06877b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010100160300002000261520108500281592002801366650002701394650002401421650001901445650001601464650000801480650002801488650001701516650002201533650001501555650001001570650001701580650002001597650001801617650001901635650001501654650000901669650002201678700002101700700002101721700002101742700002901763700002301792700002101815773012401836856007401960852000902034655001202043IND60641986520221119155646.0190506e20170621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064198652DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04608a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozłowska, Ewa10aBiotransformation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) by environmental strains of filamentous fungi  ap. 31493-31501.  aMicrobial transformations of steroids are an important method of obtaining new steroid derivatives of potential pharmaceutical activity, which follows the principles of green chemistry. We studied the ability of selected filamentous fungus species to transform dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and interesting DHEA derivatives were obtained. Twenty-five strains of filamentous fungi were isolated from soil and air in Wroclaw and they were used as biocatalysts. Strains of the genus Penicillium transformed the substrate into the products of Baeyer–Villiger lactonization in the D ring. Biotransformation of DHEA by Fusarium acuminatum KCh S1 strain led to a stereoselective hydroxylation at 7α (the product was obtained with 97% conversion). Androst-5-ene-3β,7α,17α-triol, compound with high anticancer activity towards glioblastoma and lymphoma cell lines was obtained with 65% yield in the culture of Mucor hiemalis KCh W2 strain. In the culture of Aspergillus versicolor KCh TJ1 strain, DHEA was transformed into androst-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (ADD) with high isolated yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus versicolor 3aFusarium acuminatum 3aMucor hiemalis 3aPenicillium 3aair 3aantineoplastic activity 3abiocatalysts 3abiotransformation 3acell lines 3afungi 3aglioblastoma 3agreen chemistry 3ahydroxylation 3aneoplasm cells 3aprasterone 3asoil 3astereoselectivity1 aUrbaniak, Monika1 aKancelista, Anna1 aDymarska, Monika1 aKostrzewa-Susłow, Edyta1 aStępień, Łukasz1 aJaneczko, Tomasz0 tRSC advances.g2017 June 21, v. 7, no. 50 p.31493-31501dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra04608a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245018700160300001800347500001900365520100900384592002801393596006701421650001501488650002101503650002301524650003301547650002101580650001801601650002201619650002201641650001101663650000701674700001501681700005301696773012201749856008201871852000901953655001201962IND60708471120221121121328.0200826e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070847112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-020-02932-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, J.10aBioconversion of arachidonic acid into human 14,15-hepoxilin B3 and 13,14,15-trioxilin B3 by recombinant cells expressing microbial 15-lipoxygenase without and with epoxide hydrolase  ap. 2001-2009.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOBJECTIVE: To produce high concentrations of 13-hydroxy-14,15-epoxy-eicosatrienoic acid (14,15-hepoxilin B₃, 14,15-HXB₃) and 13,14,15-trihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (13,14,15-trioxilin B₃, 13,14,15-TrXB₃) from arachidonic acid (ARA) using microbial 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) without and with epoxide hydrolase (EH), respectively.

The crude extract and its partial purified fractions obtained from both isolates showed complete inhibition of the mycelial growth of V. dahliae. However, the same fractions obtained from B. bassiana EABb 09/16-Su were less effective against the mycelial growth of P. megasperma. Our results showed that M. brunneum EAMb 09/01-Su had the highest fungicidal activity, inhibiting the mycelial growth of both pathogens. Both fractions IV and VI from M. brunneum EAMb 09/01-Su were evaluated by the progress of the Verticillium wilt of the plant and showed clear antagonism against V. dahliae, reducing the severity of the symptoms between 38.9 and 58.9%. The active metabolite obtained from M. brunneum not only reduced the germination of V. dahliae microsclerotia but also inhibited hyphal formation, decreased the number of reproductive structures, and changed the conformation of the microsclerotial colony, preventing the formation of new microsclerotia. The evaluation of temperature, UV light and pH on the antifungal activity of the dialyzed fraction from M. brunneum showed that the antifungal activity was stable at 60 °C (2 h) and 120 °C (20 min) and to UV light radiation. However, the exposition to the dialyzed fraction at pH 7.5 and 8.5 affected the antifungal activity. The results of this study clearly showed that the entomopathogenic fungus M. brunneum EAMb 09/01-Su produces antifungal compounds that reduce the number of the pathogen propagules in the soil and the severity of Verticillium wilt. Therefore, this resource should be further studied as an alternative for the integrated management of Verticillium wilt and Phytophthora root rot, which is the most severe disease in all traditional olive-growing regions worldwide, and as a reliable and sustainable strategy for a reduced reliance on pesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aMetarhizium brunneum 3aPhytophthora megasperma 3aVerticillium dahliae 3aVerticillium wilt 3aantagonism 3aantifungal agents 3aantifungal properties 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3agermination 3ahyphae 3amycelium 3aolives 3apH 3apesticides 3aroot rot 3asclerotia 3asecondary metabolites 3asoil 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 0aFungal extracts 0aVerticillium wilt 0aAntagonistic microorganism 0aPhytophthora root rot 0aAntifungal activities1 aGarrido-Jurado, I.1 aQuesada-Moraga, E.1 aRaya-Ortega, M.C.1 aTrapero-Casas, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3089-83010 tCrop protection.g2017 Oct., v. 100 p.186-195dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2017.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01952naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012100158300001800279520083800297592002801135650003701163650002401200650001501224650001301239650001401252650001701266650001301283650001201296650002201308700002501330700002301355773014101378856007401519852000901593655001201602IND60670904120221121013815.0191002e20150127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067090412DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta05767h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerea, Alexis10aCharacterization of LiNi₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄ spinel electrode in the presence of 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene as additive  ap. 2776-2783.  aThe effect of adding 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (THB) to the electrolyte [1.0 M LiPF₆ in ethylene carbonate (EC), diethyl carbonate (DEC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1 : 1 : 1)] on the performance and nature of the surface species on a LiNi₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄ cathode in a lithium battery was investigated.

The improved cyclability of the LiNi₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄ cathode is attributed to better stability of the electrode/electrolyte interface, presumably due to the presence of a THB-derived film.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3acarbonates 3acathodes 3achemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aethylene 3alithium 3alithium batteries1 aZaghib, K.q(Karim),1 aBélanger, Daniel,0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Jan. 27, v. 3, no. 6 p.2776-2783dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta05767h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02059naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245011300180300001600293500001500309520075800324592002801082650001601110650003601126650001501162650001401177650002801191650002001219650002801239650001701267650001701284650001401301650002301315653001701338700002101355700002601376700001901402700002301421773009901444856008501543852000901628655001201637IND60537051420221120042544.0160807e20160817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053705142DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2016.11872802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazavi-Azarkhiavi, Kamal14aThe Protective Role of Phenolic Compounds Against Doxorubicin-induced Cardiotoxicity: A Comprehensive Review  ap. 892-917.  a2019-12-06  aAlthough doxorubicin (DOX) is among the most widely used anticancer agents, its clinical application is hampered owing to its cardiotoxicity. Adjuvant therapy with an antioxidant has been suggested as a promising strategy to reduce DOX-induced adverse effects. In this context, many phenolic compounds have been reported to protect against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The cardioprotective effects of phenolic compounds are exerted via multiple mechanisms including inhibition of reactive oxygen species generation, apoptosis, NF-κB, p53, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage. In this review, we present a summary of the in vitro, in vivo, and clinical findings on the protective mechanisms of phenolic compounds against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3adoxorubicin 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3aDNA damage 3aadjuvants 3areactive oxygen species 3aadverse effects 3acardioprotective effect 3atherapeutics 3amitochondria 3aapoptosis 3aphenolic compounds 0aantioxidants1 aIranshahy, Milad1 aSahebkar, Amirhossein1 aShirani, Kobra1 aKarimi, Gholamreza0 tNutrition and cancer.g2016 Aug. 17, v. 68, no. 6 p.892-917dTaylor & Francisx1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2016.11872803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03466naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245009500186300001400281520136100295650003201656650003201688650002401720650000801744650001001752650001001762650002901772650002201801650002501823650002401848650001401872650001301886650002101899650001301920650001701933650002401950650004501974650002602019650003002045650003302075650005502108650003002163650002602193650002802219650002402247650001402271650003202285650002402317650005402341650002302395650003402418700001602452700002002468700001902488700003102507773012102538852000902659856009202668930003302760946001102793655001202804IND4401242720221118035048.0080210e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440124272DNAL7 a182484222pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.01048.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yong14aThe mitochondrial genome of the Basidiomycete fungus Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom)  ap. 34-41.  aIn this study, the full mitochondrial genome of a basidiomycete fungus, Pleurotus ostreatus, was sequenced and analyzed. It is a circular DNA molecule of 73 242 bp and contains 44 known genes encoding 18 proteins and 26 RNA genes. The protein-coding genes include 14 common mitochondrial genes, one ribosomal small subunit protein 3 gene, one RNA polymerase gene and two DNA polymerase genes. In addition, one RNA and one DNA polymerase genes were identified in a mitochondrial plasmid. These two genes show relatively low similarities to their homologs in the mitochondrial genome but they are nearly identical to the known mitochondrial plasmid genes from another Pleurotus ostreatus strain. This suggests that the plasmid may mediate the horizontal gene transfer of the DNA and RNA polymerase genes into mitochondrial genome, and such a transfer may be an ancient event. Phylogenetic analysis based on the cox1 ORFs verified the traditional classification of Pleurotus ostreatus among fungi. However, the discordances were observed in the phylogenetic trees based on the six cox1 intronic ORFs of Pleurotus ostreatus and their homologs in other species, suggesting that these intronic ORFs are foreign DNA sequences obtained through HGT. In summary, this analysis provides valuable information towards the understanding of the evolution of fungal mtDNA. 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aRNA 3afungi 3agenes 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial genome 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3aplasmids 3aprotein subunits 3aproteins 3atransfer DNA 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBasidiomycotaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA, Intergenicxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aDNA-Directed RNA Polymerasesxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGene Transfer, Horizontal 2aGenome, Mitochondrial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPhylogeny 2aPhysical Chromosome Mapping 2aPleurotusxgenetics 2aRNA-Directed DNA Polymerasexchemistryxgenetics. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid1 aZeng, Fanya1 aHon, Chung Chau1 aZhang, Yizheng1 aLeung, Frederick Chi Ching0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2008 Mar., v. 280, no. 1 p.34-41dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.01048.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03064naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245008200189300001600271520153700287650001801824650001301842650001401855650005401869650001201923650003601935650001101971650003801982650003602020650000902056650002402065650002702089650005202116650004302168653003002211653001402241700001902255700001902274700001902293773013702312852000902449856009202458930003302550946001102583655001202594IND4401602720221118035246.0080217e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440160272DNAL7 a182058052pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-695X.2007.00373.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakino, Asako10aNicotine involved in periodontal disease through influence on cytokine levels  ap. 282-286.  aPeriodontal disease, for which smoking is a known risk factor, is infectious, and is associated with oral biofilm. Cytokines mediate and regulate immune and inflammatory responses. Lipopolysaccharide produced by periodontopathic bacteria plays a role in the progression of periodontitis. The effect of nicotine on cytokine production in mice was evaluated in this study. Nicotine (10 or 200 μg mouse⁻¹) was administered intraperitoneally to 4-week-old female BALB/c mice, once a day, for 49 days. Control mice received injections of phosphate-buffered saline. Blood was collected from all mice and serum IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IFN-γ levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on the 42nd day. IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-γ levels in the nicotine-treated mice were higher than those in the control mice. However, no differences were found in TNF-α levels between nicotine-treated and control mice. Lipopolysaccharide (20 μg mouse⁻¹) purified from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (formerly Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) Y4 was administered intraperitoneally on the 49th day. A rapid increase in TNF-α was observed in the control mice at 2 h after administration of lipopolysaccharide. In contrast, no increase was noted in the nicotine-treated groups. Significantly higher levels of IFN-γ were seen in the 200 μg nicotine-treated mice at 2 h after administration of lipopolysaccharide (P<0.05). The results showed that cytokine levels were influenced by nicotine in mice. 3aanimal models 3anicotine 3acytokines 2aAggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitansximmunology 2aAnimals 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesisxblood. 2aFemale 2aImmunologic Factorsxpharmacology 2aLipopolysaccharidesximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aNicotinexpharmacology 2aPeriodontal Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPolysaccharides, Bacterialximmunology 0aperiodontopathic bacteria 0aendotoxin1 aYamada, Satoru1 aOkuda, Katsuji1 aKatō, Tetsuo.0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2008 Mar., v. 52, no. 2 p.282-286dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0928-82447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-695X.2007.00373.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080218b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02589naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001900193245025500212300001600467520134800483653000901831653001901840653001001859653001101869653001701880700002101897700001501918700001901933700002201952773010801974852000902082856009202091939003302183946001102216655001202227IND4405698720221118035115.0080516e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440569872DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02755.x2doi7 aPMC25666242pmcid7 a182179582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishioka, Chie10aDHMEQ, a novel nuclear factor-κB inhibitor, induces selective depletion of alloreactive or phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, decreases production of T helper type 1 cytokines, and blocks maturation of dendritic cells  ap. 198-205.  aDehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), a novel nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) inhibitor, has been shown to be active against variety types of solid tumours as well as haematological malignant cells. This study explored the anti-inflammatory effects of DHMEQ in vitro. DHMEQ inhibited the proliferation of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated or alloreactive peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in mixed lymphocyte cultures as measured using a 3-(4,5-dimethylithiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. In contrast, DHMEQ did not affect the viability of resting PBMC. In addition, real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that DHMEQ decreased PHA-stimulated expression of T helper type 1 (Th1) cytokines, including interleukin-2, interferon-γ, and tumour necrosis factor α, in PBMC as well as Jurkat T-lymphoblastic leukaemia cells, and also decreased levels of p65 isoforms of NF-κB in the nucleus. Furthermore, we found that DHMEQ inhibited the endocytic capacity of dendritic cells (DCs) and down-regulated the expression of cell surface antigen CD40, suggesting that DHMEQ blocked the maturation as well as the function of DCs. Taken together, the results suggest that DHMEQ may be useful for treatment of inflammatory diseases, including graft-versus-host disease after allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 0aCD40 0adendritic cell 0aDHMEQ 0aNF-κB 0aTh1 cytokine1 aIkezoe, Takayuki1 aJing, Yang1 aUmezawa, Kazuo1 aYokoyama, Akihito0 tImmunology.g2008 June, v. 124, no. 2 p.198-205dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02755.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111107  aNon-US 7aarticle02316naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010300164300001500267520099600282650001601278650002101294650002501315650001001340650000701350650001501357650002301372650001901395650001601414651002101430651001001451653002901461653001601490653001301506700001801519700002001537700001401557700002501571773013601596852000901732856008501741930003301826946001101859655001201870IND4401002220221118035221.0080203e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440100222DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-007-9444-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, Anita 10aPhosphate solubilization by Penicillium spp. isolated from soil samples of Indian Himalayan region  ap. 97-102.  aA total of 246 fungal isolates representing 36 genera and 72 species were isolated from the soil samples collected from Indian Himalayan region. Twenty-one species belonged to the genus Penicillium alone. All the Penicillium species were screened for phosphate solubilizing activity on Pikovskaya agar at 21 °C. Eight species of Penicillium, exhibiting formation of halos (zone of solubilization) around the fungal colonies in qualitative plate assays, were selected for quantitative estimations. In quantitative estimations that were conducted upto day 30 (at 3 days interval), seven species of Penicillium brought maximum solubilization after day 15, while P. oxalicum showed maximum solubilization after day 21 of incubation. The increase in solubilization coincided with decrease in pH of the broth. Acid phosphatase activity was 1.5-2.0 times higher in comparison to alkaline phosphatase. Many of these species showed wide range of tolerance for temperature, pH and salt concentration. 3aPenicillium 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3afungi 3apH 3aphosphates 3asalt concentration 3asolubilization 3atemperature 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 0aPhosphate-solubilization 0aPhosphatase 0aHimalaya1 aDas, Namrata 1 aKumar, Bhavesh 1 aRinu, K. 1 aTrivedī, Paṅkaja.0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2008 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.97-102dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-007-9444-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02690naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245012100161300001600282520173700298653002102035653002902056653002902085700001602114700001602130773011602146852000902262856008502271930003302356946001102389655001202400IND4407802920221118035214.0080712e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440780292DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-007-0994-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSonmez, H. 10aEngineering characteristics of Ankara Greywacke under the foundation of the Beytepe open air theatre, Ankara, Turkey  ap. 485-497.  aThe construction of a large open air theatre having with an audience capacity of 7,000 is planned at the Beytepe Campus of Hacettepe University located near Ankara, Turkey, in the heart of Anatolia. The foundation of the open air theatre is composed of weak and heavily jointed Ankara Greywacke. An estimation of the strength and deformation of the Ankara Greywacke was required for assessments of short- and long-term stability. Accordingly, rock mass characterization of the Ankara Greywacke was investigated in detail by scan-line surveys and back-analyses of in situ tests performed on the excavated surface of the rock mass. The final version of the Hoek and Brown Criterion (Hoek et al., In: Proceedings of the north American rock mechanics society meeting, Toronto, Canada, pp 1-6, 2002) together with and improvements proposed by Sonmez and Gokceoglu (Int J Rock Mech Min Sci, 43:671-676, 2006) were considered together for the back analyses of small slope benches subjected to plate loading test loaded to failure. In addition, the plate loading test data were used with some well-known empirical equations for predicting of deformation modulus of rock masses to calculate ranges of values of the Geological Strength Index (GSI) The static and pseudostatic slope stabilities of the audience seating structures to be supported by benches excavated into the rock were also analyzed. The stability assessments revealed the unlikelihood of large rock mass failures for the short-term construction stages or for the long-term, as-constructed conditions under static or pseudo-static conditions. Additionally, the analyses showed that there was no need for anchors between the concrete seating structures and greywacke rock mass. 0aAnkara Greywacke 0aBeytepe open air theatre 0aHoek and Brown criterion1 aGurkan, B. 1 aSonmez, B. 0 tEnvironmental geology.g2008 Aug., v. 55, no. 3 p.485-497dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-0994-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080712b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03986naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245017400187300001600361520235100377650002502728650001102753650002002764650001102784650002102795650002002816650001702836650001702853650003102870650002602901650004302927650002402970650004802994650003103042653002803073653002303101653001303124653001703137653001903154700001903173700002603192773012903218852000903347856009203356930003303448946001103481655001203492IND4407696820221118035046.0080712e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440769682DNAL7 a183972612pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03796.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMederos, L.10aNew variants of polar glycopeptidolipids detected in Mycobacterium simiae, including 'habana' strains, as evidenced by electrospray ionization-ion trap-mass spectrometry  ap. 602-614.  aTo determine the composition of polar glycopeptidolipids (pGPLs) of Mycobacterium simiae and, particularly, those of 'habana' strains, in a search for specific markers given the immunogenic potential of 'habana' TMC 5135 in experimental tuberculosis. pGPLs were determined in free lipid extracts using electrospray ionization-ion trap-mass spectrometry (ESI-IT-MS), working in both negative- and positive-ion mode. In the case of TMC 5135, the presence of the previously characterized GPL-II (containing 2,4-di-O-CH₃ glucuronic acid as distal sugar in the oligosaccharide antigenic moiety) and GPL-III (containing 4-O-CH₃ glucuronic acid as distal sugar) was confirmed using MS/MS and MS/MS/MS approaches. Interestingly, some 'habana' strains presented variants of GPL-II, designated GPL-II'-A and GPL-II'-B. A di-O-CH₃-deoxy-hexose (tentatively, 2,3-di-O-CH₃-fucose) was identified as the penultimate sugar in the oligosaccharide moiety of GPL-II'-A, whereas in GPL-II'-B the penultimate sugar was fucose (tentative identification). On the contrary, the distal sugar of the oligosaccharide chain of pGPLs of Myco. simiae ATCC 25275T was identified as tri-O-CH₃-glucuronic acid (designated GPL-simT-I, with two variants: GPL-simT-I-A and GPL-simT-I-B), O-CH₃-glucuronic acid (designated GPL-simT-II) and di-O-CH₃-glucuronic acid (GPL-II'-A and GPL-II'-B). The penultimate sugar of the oligosaccharide chain of GPL-simT-I-A and GPL-simT-II was identified as di-O-CH₃-deoxy-hexose (tentatively, 2,3-di-O-CH₃ fucose), and that of GPL-simT-I-B as deoxy-hexose (tentatively, fucose). In all strains studied, each [M-H]⁻ and [M+Na]⁺ ion was revealed as a mixture of homologous compounds varying in the number of -O-CH₃ groups present in the oligosaccharide moiety and in the length of the fatty acyl linked to the peptide. The present work indicates that, within a similar general pattern of pGPLs, different strains of Myco. simiae present some variations, so that new compounds (GPL-II'-A, GPL-II'-B, GPL-simT-I-A, GPL-simT-I-B and GPL-simT-II) were defined. Noteworthy was the fact that the 'habana' strains clearly differed from the type strain of Myco. simiae. The data obtained can be used in the delineation of the 'habana' group of Myco. simiae, including the quality control of the immunogenic strain 'habana' TMC 5135. 3aMycobacterium simiae 3afucose 3aglucuronic acid 3alipids 3aoligosaccharides 3aquality control 3aspectroscopy 3atuberculosis 2aBacteriological Techniques 2aGlycolipidsxanalysis 2aNontuberculous Mycobacteriaxchemistry 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aTuberculosisxmicrobiology 0aelectrospray ionization 0aglycopeptidolipids 0aion-trap 0aMyco. simiae 0a'Myco. habana'1 aValdivia, J.A.1 aValero-Guillén, P.L.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2008 Aug., v. 105, no. 2 p.602-614dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03796.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080712b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03219naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245009800179300001400277520105100291650002601342650001801368650001901386650001101405650001501416650001001431650001001441650002201451650001601473650001101489650003301500650001601533650001801549650001001567650001401577650001001591650008001601650003801681650004101719650004801760650003301808650002801841650001401869650003401883650005301917650003901970650003502009650005102044650002702095650003602122653004002158653002202198653002902220653004802249700001902297773010302316852000902419856008502428930003302513946001102546655001202557IND4401551420221118035045.0080217e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440155142DNAL7 a181886122pmid7 a10.1007/s00572-007-0159-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Liqin 10aInteraction between an isolate of dark-septate fungi and its host plant Saussurea involucrata  ap. 79-85.  aA dark-septate endophytic (DSE) fungus EF-M was isolated from the roots of an alpine plant Saussurea involucrata Kar. et Kir. ex Maxim. The fungus was identified by sequencing the PCR-amplified rDNA 5.8S gene and ITS regions. The sequence was compared with similar sequences in the GenBank, and results showed that EF-M was congeneric to Leptodontidium. Resynthesis study was conducted to clarify the relationship between the root endophyte EF-M and the host plant S. involucrata using the material grown in sterile culture bottle. In roots recovered 6 weeks after inoculation, epidermal cells were colonized by intercellular and intracellular hyphae and “microsclerotia” formed within individual cells in the epidermis layers. However, hyphae did not invade the cortex and the stele. There were no profound effects of endophyte EF-M on plant root development, but significant differences were detected in plant height and shoot dry weight between the treatments. The present study is the first report hitherto on DSE fungi in S. involucrata. 3aSaussurea involucrata 3aalpine plants 3aaxenic culture 3acortex 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agenes 3agenetic databases 3ahost plants 3ahyphae 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amycorrhizae 3aribosomal DNA 3aroots 3asclerotia 3astele 2aAscomycotaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxchemistryxgenetics. 2aHyphaexgrowth & development 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Epidermisxmicrobiology 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Shootsxgrowth & development 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 5.8Sxgenetics 2aSaussureaxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0aDark-septate endophytic (DSE) fungi 0aITS and 5.8S rDNA 0aMolecular identification 0aSaussurea involucrata Kar. et Kir. ex Maxim1 aGuo, Shunxing 0 tMycorrhiza.g2008 Feb., v. 18, no. 2 p.79-85dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0940-63607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-007-0159-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20080218b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02654naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002100193245011000214300001800324520148300342653002101825653001101846653002401857653000901881653001001890700001901900700002101919700001601940700002101956700002101977700002001998773010502018852000902123856009202132930003302224946001102257655001202268IND4406990520221118035118.0080620e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440699052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00747.x2doi7 aPMC37616882pmcid7 a184104862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNathan, James A.14aThe Ubiquitin E3 Ligase MARCH7 is Differentially Regulated by the Deubiquitylating Enzymes USP7 and USP9X  ap. 1130-1145.  aProtein modification by one or more ubiquitin chains serves a critical signalling function across a wide range of cellular processes. Specificity within this system is conferred by ubiquitin E3 ligases, which target the substrates. Their activity is balanced by deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs), which remove ubiquitin from both substrates and ligases. The RING-CH ligases were initially identified as viral immunoevasins involved in the downregulation of immunoreceptors. Their cellular orthologues, the Membrane-Associated RING-CH (MARCH) family represent a subgroup of the classical RING genes. Unlike their viral counterparts, the cellular RING-CH proteins appear highly regulated, and one of these in particular, MARCH7, was of interest because of a potential role in neuronal development and lymphocyte proliferation. Difficulties in detection and expression of this orphan ligase lead us to search for cellular cofactors involved in MARCH7 stability. In this study, we show that MARCH7 readily undergoes autoubiquitylation and associates with two deubiquitylating enzymes - ubiquitin-specific protease (USP)9X in the cytosol and USP7 in the nucleus. Exogenous expression and short interfering RNA depletion experiments demonstrate that MARCH7 can be stabilized by both USP9X and USP7, which deubiquitylate MARCH7 in the cytosol and nucleus, respectively. We therefore demonstrate compartment-specific regulation of this E3 ligase through recruitment of site-specific DUBs. 0adeubiquitylation 0aMARCH7 0aubiquitin E3 ligase 0aUSP7 0aUSP9X1 aSengupta, Soma1 aWood, Stephen A.1 aAdmon, Arie1 aMarkson, Gabriel1 aSanderson, Chris1 aLehner, Paul J.0 tTraffic.g2008 July, v. 9, no. 7 p.1130-1145dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1398-92197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00747.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080620b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01912naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011600169300001600285520069300301650001400994650002001008650001601028650001701044650002101061650001701082650001801099650001901117650001401136650001401150650001001164700002201174700002201196700002401218773013401242852000901376856008501385930003301470946001101503655001201514IND4405794220221118035208.0080516e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440579422DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437080301382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinasbekyan, L.

In our recently published X-ray crystal structure of the Sclerotium rolfsii lectin (SRL) at 1.1 Å resolution, amino acid sequence was initially deduced from the electron density map and residues Asp/Asn and Glu/Gln were assigned by considering their hydrogen bonding potential within their structural neighborhood. Attempts to verify the sequence by Edman sequencing were not successful as the N terminus of the protein was blocked. Mass spectrometry was applied to verify and resolve the ambiguities in the SRL X-ray crystal structure deduced sequence. From the Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF-MS) and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides of SRL, we could confirm and correct the sequence at five locations with respect to Asp/Asn and Glu/Gln. Analysis data also confirmed the positions of Leu/Ile, Gln/Lys residues and the sequence covering 118 of the total 141 residues accounting to 83.68% of the earlier deduced sequence of SRL. 3aAthelia rolfsii 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aamino acid sequences 3adata analysis 3adesorption 3ahydrogen bonding 3aionization 3alectins 3apeptides 3atandem mass spectrometry 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBasidiomycotaxchemistry 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aCrystallography, X-Ray 2aHydrogen Bonding 2aLectinsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aMass Spectrometryxmethods 2aTime Factors 0aProtein crystal structure 0aSclerotium rolfsii lectin1 aSubrahmanya Prakash, Y.

A field decomposition experiment was performed in a mature forest stand of tropical montane cloud forest in Mexico. The areas under the canopies of Quercus laurina Humbl. & Bompl., Oreopanax xalapensis (Kunth) Decne. & Planchon and Beilschmedia ovalis (Blake) C. K. Allen trees were used as experimental units. The natural soil and litter macroinvertebrate communities were monitored and compared to the community that invaded decomposition boxes with reciprocally transplanted leaf litter. The abundances of four macroinvertebrate taxa in natural litter differed among tree species independently of season. No differences were found in the soil community. The response to experimental litter by macroinvertebrate taxa suggests that the production of a specific quality of litter is an important mechanism by which a tree influences the litter macroinvertebrate community that develops under its canopy. However, not all differences in community composition naturally found between tree species can be explained by differences in litter quality during the first year of decomposition. Differences in nutrient release that occur after the first year, and physical properties of litter also probably play an important role. Independently of the canopy tree, the initial chemical quality (N, P, Ca, Mg and lignin) of experimental litter largely determined the decomposition rate and nutrient dynamics of decomposing leaves. However, it was found that under O. xalapensis trees the breakdown of lignin from the litter produced by the same species of tree was particularly effective. This suggests that a feedback has developed between this tree species and the decomposer community prevailing under its canopy. 3aOreopanax xalapensis 3aQuercus 3acalcium 3acanopy 3acommunity structure 3aforest stands 3aleaves 3alignin 3amacroinvertebrates 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphysical properties 3aplant litter 3asoil ecology 3atrees 3atropical montane cloud forests 3aMexico 0aAbove-belowground relationship 0aLitter quality 0aMacrofauna 0aSingle-tree influence circles 0aTropical mountain cloud forest1 aFragoso, Carlos 1 aNewton, Adrian C. 1 aRussell, Graham 1 aHeal, O.

To better understand essential fatty acid homeostasis in this region of the brain, we investigated the contributions of n-3 fatty acid precursors in supplying hippocampal neurons with DHA. Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons incorporated radiolabeled 18-, 20-, 22-, and 24-carbon n-3 fatty acid and converted some of the uptake to DHA, but the amounts produced from either [1-¹⁴C]α-linolenic or [1-¹⁴C]eicosapentaenoic acid were considerably less than the amounts incorporated when the cultures were incubated with [1-¹⁴C]22:6n-3. Most of the [1-¹⁴C]22:6n-3 uptake was incorporated into phospholipids, primarily ethanolamine phosphoglycerides. Additional studies demonstrated that the neurons converted [1-¹⁴C]linoleic acid to arachidonic acid, the main n-6 fatty acid in the brain. These findings differ from previous results indicating that cerebral and cerebellar neurons cannot convert polyunsaturated fatty acid precursors to DHA or arachidonic acid. Fatty acid compositional analysis demonstrated that the hippocampal neurons contained only 1.1-2.5 mol% DHA under the usual low-DHA culture conditions. The relatively low-DHA content suggests that some responses obtained with these cultures may not be representative of neuronal function in the brain. 3aarachidonic acid 3abrain 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3alinoleic acid 3aphospholipids 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xanalysisxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aHippocampusxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aNeuronsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 0aα-linolenic acid1 aChen, Yucui1 aHell, Johannes W.1 aSpector, Arthur A.0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2008 May, v. 105, no. 4 p.1525-1535dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05274.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02273naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245010000202300002000302506007600322520086500398506003701263650002101300650000901321650004401330650001801374650002201392700001601414700001601430700001501446700002601461700001601487700001601503700001801519773017601537852000901713856008301722930003301805946001301838655001201851IND4409897320221207101829.0080905e20080902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440989732DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08050321052doi7 aPMC25260992pmcid7 a187536332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMallamace, F.10aNMR evidence of a sharp change in a measure of local order in deeply supercooled confined water  ap. 12725-12729.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUsing NMR, we measure the proton chemical shift δ, of supercooled nanoconfined water in the temperature range 195 K < T < 350 K. Because δ is directly connected to the magnetic shielding tensor, we discuss the data in terms of the local hydrogen bond geometry and order. We argue that the derivative -([partial differential] ln δ/[partial differential]T)P should behave roughly as the constant pressure specific heat CP(T), and we confirm this argument by detailed comparisons with literature values of CP(T) in the range 290-370 K. We find that -([partial differential] ln δ/[partial differential]T)P displays a pronounced maximum upon crossing the locus of maximum correlation length at [almost equal to]240 K, consistent with the liquid-liquid critical point hypothesis for water, which predicts that CP(T) displays a maximum on crossing the Widom line.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahydrogen bonding 3aloci 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aspecific heat 3awater temperature1 aCorsaro, C.1 aBroccio, M.1 aBranca, C.1 aGonzález-Segredo, N.1 aSpooren, J.1 aChen, S.

We describe a system that yields such photo-control over actin assembly. We fused the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 in its GDP-bound form to the photosensory domain of phytochrome B (PhyB) and fused the Cdc42 effector, the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP), to the light-dependent PhyB-binding domain of phytochrome interacting factor 3 (Pif3). Upon red light illumination, the fusion proteins bind each other, activating WASP, and consequently stimulating actin assembly by the WASP target, the Arp2/3 complex. Binding and WASP activation are reversed by far-red illumination. Our approach, in which the biochemical specificity of the nucleotide switch in Cdc42 is overridden by the light-dependent PhyB-Pif3 interaction, should be generally applicable to other GTPase-effector pairs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactin 3abiomedical research 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3alighting 3aphytochrome 3ared light1 aOtomo, Chinatsu1 aChory, Joanne1 aRosen, Michael K.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Sept. 2, v. 105, no. 35 p.12797-12802dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08012321053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080905b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02237naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245009100204300002000295500001500315506007600330520079700406506003701203650001901240650001901259650000901278650001501287650001301302650001401315653001701329700001901346700002201365700002301387700002001410700002401430700002301454773017601477852000901653856008301662930003301745946001301778655001201791IND4409897420221207101844.0080905e20080902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440989742DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08064941052doi7 aPMC25290842pmcid7 a187256332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoven, Corey V.10aElectron injection into organic semiconductor devices from high work function cathodes  ap. 12730-12735.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe show that polymer light-emitting diodes with high work-function cathodes and conjugated polyelectrolyte injection/transport layers exhibit excellent efficiencies despite large electron-injection barriers. Correlation of device response times with structure provides evidence that the electron-injection mechanism involves redistribution of the ions within the polyelectrolyte electron-transport layer and hole accumulation at the interface between the emissive and electron-transport layers. Both processes lead to screening of the internal electric field and a lowering of the electron-injection barrier. The hole and electron currents are therefore diffusion currents rather than drift currents. The response time and the device performance are influenced by the type of counterion used.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelectric field 3asemiconductors 3aions 3aelectrodes 3apolymers 3ascreening 0aelectrolytes1 aYang, Renqiang1 aGarcía, Andrés.1 aCrockett, Victoria1 aHeeger, Alan J.1 aBazan, Guillermo C.1 aNguyen, Thuc-Quyen0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Sept. 2, v. 105, no. 35 p.12730-12735dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08064941053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080905b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02674naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100003000184245014400214300002000358506007600378520126300454506003701717650002201754650001701776650001201793650002201805650001601827650002501843700002401868700002201892700002401914700002401938773017601962852000902138856008302147930003302230946001302263655001202276IND4409898820221207101834.0080905e20080902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440989882DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08063051052doi7 aPMC25290622pmcid7 a187236882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalderone, Christopher T.12aA ketoreductase domain in the PksJ protein of the bacillaene assembly line carries out both α- and β-ketone reduction during chain growth  ap. 12809-12814.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe polyketide signaling metabolites bacillaene and dihydrobacillaene are biosynthesized in Bacillus subtilis on an enzymatic assembly line with both nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) modules acting along with catalytic domains servicing the assembly line in trans. These signaling metabolites possess the unusual starter unit α-hydroxyisocaproate (α-HIC). We show here that it arises from initial activation of α-ketoisocaproate (α-KIC) by the first adenylation domain of PksJ (a hybrid PKS/NRPS) and installation on the pantetheinyl arm of the adjacent thiolation (T) domain. The α-KIC unit is elongated to α-KIC-Gly by the second NRPS module in PksJ as demonstrated by mass spectrometric analysis. The third module of PksJ uses PKS logic and contains an embedded ketoreductase (KR) domain along with two adjacent T domains. We show that this KR domain reduces canonical 3-ketobutyryl chains but also the α-keto group of α-KIC-containing intermediates on the PksJ T-domain doublet. This KR activity accounts for the α-HIC moiety found in the dihydrobacillaene/bacillaene pair and represents an example of an assembly-line dual-function α- and β-KR acting on disparate positions of a growing chain intermediate.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3aactive sites 3ahybrids 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3apolyketide synthases1 aBumpus, Stefanie B.1 aKelleher, Neil L.1 aWalsh, Christopher.1 aMagarvey, Nathan A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Sept. 2, v. 105, no. 35 p.12809-12814dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08063051053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080905b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03372naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184100002200201245007600223300002000299506007600319520172500395506003702120650002902157650002402186650002202210650002202232650002502254650002202279650001702301650001802318653002402336653001302360700002102373700001902394700003002413700002202443700001702465700002302482700002202505773017602527852000902703856008302712930003302795945002502828946001302853655001202866IND4409898720221207101847.0080905e20080902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440989872DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08058271052doi7 aPMC25290652pmcid7 a187256342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We present the crystal structure of the 2.6-MDa Saccharomyces cerevisiae fatty acid synthase (FAS) multienzyme in complex with the antibiotic cerulenin, representing, to our knowledge, the first structure of an inhibited fatty acid megasynthase. Cerulenin attacks the FAS ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain, forming a covalent bond to the active site cysteine C1305. The inhibitor binding causes two significant conformational changes of the enzyme. First, phenylalanine F1646, shielding the active site, flips and allows access to the nucleophilic cysteine. Second, methionine M1251, placed in the center of the acyl-binding tunnel, rotates and unlocks the inner part of the fatty acid binding cavity. The importance of the rotational movement of the gatekeeping M1251 side chain is reflected by the cerulenin resistance and the changed product spectrum reported for S. cerevisiae strains mutated in the adjacent glycine G1250. Platensimycin and thiolactomycin are two other potent inhibitors of KSs. However, in contrast to cerulenin, they show selectivity toward the prokaryotic FAS system. Because the flipped F1646 characterizes the catalytic state accessible for platensimycin and thiolactomycin binding, we superimposed structures of inhibited bacterial enzymes onto the S. cerevisiae FAS model. Although almost all side chains involved in inhibitor binding are conserved in the FAS multienzyme, a different conformation of the loop K1413-K1423 of the KS domain might explain the observed low antifungal properties of platensimycin and thiolactomycin.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3afatty-acid synthase 3aenzyme inhibition 3acrystal structure 3aprotein conformation 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aactive sites 3abinding sites 0amultienzyme complex 0acerulein1 aWiltschi, Birgit1 aKumari, Preeti1 aFriant-Kessler, Brigitte.1 aVonrhein, Clemens1 aVonck, Janet1 aOesterhelt, Dieter1 aGrininger, Martin0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Sept. 2, v. 105, no. 35 p.12803-12808dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08058271053Available from publisher's Web site  a20081002b20081101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/10/02  aOther US 7aarticle02742naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245012100209300002000330506007600350520150900426506003701935650001001972650001401982650001101996650003102007700002302038700001702061773017602078852000902254856008302263930003302346946001302379655001202392IND4409622820221207101829.0080829e20080826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440962282DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08000051052doi7 aPMC25279522pmcid7 a187236762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSridharan, Devarajan12aA critical role for the right fronto-insular cortex in switching between central-executive and default-mode networks  ap. 12569-12574.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCognitively demanding tasks that evoke activation in the brain's central-executive network (CEN) have been consistently shown to evoke decreased activation (deactivation) in the default-mode network (DMN). The neural mechanisms underlying this switch between activation and deactivation of large-scale brain networks remain completely unknown. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the mechanisms underlying switching of brain networks in three different experiments. We first examined this switching process in an auditory event segmentation task. We observed significant activation of the CEN and deactivation of the DMN, along with activation of a third network comprising the right fronto-insular cortex (rFIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), when participants perceived salient auditory event boundaries. Using chronometric techniques and Granger causality analysis, we show that the rFIC-ACC network, and the rFIC, in particular, plays a critical and causal role in switching between the CEN and the DMN. We replicated this causal connectivity pattern in two additional experiments: (i) a visual attention "oddball" task and (ii) a task-free resting state. These results indicate that the rFIC is likely to play a major role in switching between distinct brain networks across task paradigms and stimulus modalities. Our findings have important implications for a unified view of network mechanisms underlying both exogenous and endogenous cognitive control.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3acognition 3acortex 3amagnetic resonance imaging1 aLevitin, Daniel J.1 aMenon, Vinod0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 26, v. 105, no. 34 p.12569-12574dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08000051053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080830b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02831naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245010500202300002000307506007600327520147500403506003701878650002801915650002701943650002101970650001101991650002002002650001302022700001802035700002802053700002102081700001702102773017602119852000902295856008302304930003302387946001302420655001202433IND4409899120221207101837.0080905e20080902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440989912DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08005261052doi7 aPMC25290862pmcid7 a187281812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yong-Ick14aThe day/night switch in KaiC, a central oscillator component of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria  ap. 12825-12830.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe circadian oscillator of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus is composed of only three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, which, together with ATP, can generate a self-sustained [almost equal to]24 h oscillation of KaiC phosphorylation for several days. KaiA induces KaiC to autophosphorylate, whereas KaiB blocks the stimulation of KaiC by KaiA, which allows KaiC to autodephosphorylate. We propose and support a model in which the C-terminal loops of KaiC, the "A-loops", are the master switch that determines overall KaiC activity. When the A-loops are in their buried state, KaiC is an autophosphatase. When the A-loops are exposed, however, KaiC is an autokinase. A dynamic equilibrium likely exists between the buried and exposed states, which determines the steady-state level of phosphorylation of KaiC. The data suggest that KaiA stabilizes the exposed state of the A-loops through direct binding. We also show evidence that if KaiA cannot stabilize the exposed state, KaiC remains hypophosphorylated. We propose that KaiB inactivates KaiA by preventing it from stabilizing the exposed state of the A-loops. Thus, KaiA and KaiB likely act by shifting the dynamic equilibrium of the A-loops between exposed and buried states, which shifts the balance of autokinase and autophosphatase activities of KaiC. A-loop exposure likely moves the ATP closer to the sites of phosphorylation, and we show evidence in support of how this movement may be accomplished.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSynechococcus elongatus 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acircadian rhythm 3amodels 3aphosphorylation 3aproteins1 aDong, Guogang1 aCarruthers, Carl W.

PORA is considered a globular protein consisting of nine α-helices and seven β-strands. The model predicts the presence of two functionally distinctive Pchlide binding sites where the pigment is coordinated by cystein residues. The pigment bound to the first, high-affinity Pchlide binding site is used for the formation of the photoactive state of the enzyme. The pigment bound to the second, low-affinity Pchlide binding site is involved in the PORA:PORB interaction, allowing for resonance energy transfer between the neighboring PORs in the complex. In the in vitro reconstituted light-harvesting POR:Pchlide complex (LHPP), light absorbed by PORA-bound Pchlide b is transferred to PORB-bound Pchlide a. That induces the conversion of Pchlide a to chlorophyllide (Chlide) a. This energy transfer eliminates the possibility of Pchlide b photoreduction and prevents that excited triplet states of either Pchlides a or b accumulate and provoke singlet oxygen production. Together, our results provide a photoprotective role of PORA during greening.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3aoxidoreductases 3aphotostability 3apigments 3abinding capacity 3aenergy transfer 3aprotein conformation 0aNADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase A 0aprotochlorophyllide1 aEl Bakkouri, Majida1 aValdez, Oscar1 aPollmann, Stephan1 aLebedev, Nikolai1 aReinbothe, Steffen1 aReinbothe, Christiane0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 26, v. 105, no. 34 p.12629-12634dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08039501053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080911b20081011c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/09/11  aOther US 7aarticle03168naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245011000203300002000313506007600333520151400409506003701923650001601960650001201976650002601988650002002014650001102034650001802045650001202063650001802075650003702093650002002130650002102150650001602171650003602187700001502223700001802238700002202256700002602278700002102304700002302325773017602348852000902524856008302533930003302616946001302649655001202662IND4409623420221207101846.0080829e20080826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440962342DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08066321052doi7 aPMC25180972pmcid7 a187138532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Jian-Ping10aDifferences in the length of the carboxyl terminus mediate functional properties of neurokinin-1 receptor  ap. 12605-12610.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) has two naturally occurring forms that differ in the length of the carboxyl terminus: a full-length receptor consisting of 407 aa and a truncated receptor consisting of 311 aa. We examined whether there are differential signaling properties attributable to the carboxyl terminus of this receptor by using stably transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell lines that express either full-length or truncated NK1R. Substance P (SP) specifically triggered intracellular calcium increase in HEK293 cells expressing full-length NK1R but had no effect in the cells expressing the truncated NK1R. In addition, in cells expressing full-length NK1R, SP activated NF-κB and IL-8 mRNA expression, but in cells expressing the truncated NK1R, SP did not activate NF-κB, and it decreased IL-8 mRNA expression. In cells expressing full-length NK1R, SP stimulated phosphorylation of PKCδ but inhibited phosphorylation of PKCδ in cells expressing truncated NK1R. There are also differences in the timing of SP-induced ERK activation in cells expressing the two different forms of the receptor. Full-length NK1R activation of ERK was rapid (peak within 1-2 min), whereas truncated NK1R-mediated activation was slower (peak at 20-30 min). Thus, the carboxyl terminus of NK1R is the structural basis for differences in the functional properties of the full-length and truncated NK1R. These differences may provide important information toward the design of new NK1R receptor antagonists.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantagonists 3acalcium 3afunctional properties 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-8 3akidneys 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein kinase C 3asubstance P 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aLai, Saien1 aTuluc, Florin1 aTansky, Morris F.1 aKilpatrick, Laurie E.1 aLeeman, Susan E.1 aDouglas, Steven D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 26, v. 105, no. 34 p.12605-12610dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08066321053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080830b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01406naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245005700204300002000261506007600281520025400357506003700611650002600648650002300674650001000697650002400707650002300731773017600754852000900930856008300939930003301022946001301055655001201068IND4409896020221207101847.0080905e20080902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440989602DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08000881052doi7 aPMC25290722pmcid7 a186260152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClary, David C.10aTheoretical studies on bimolecular reaction dynamics  ap. 12649-12653.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis perspective discusses progress in the theory of bimolecular reaction dynamics in the gas phase.

The DNA binding activities of the E-proteins are regulated by a distinct class of antagonistic HLH proteins, named Id1-4. Here we demonstrate that Id2 deficient mice in a C57BL/6 genetic background exhibit increased cellularity in the granulocyte/myeloid progenitor compartment and show significantly higher numbers of maturing neutrophils. Within 6 months of age, Id2 deficient mice succumbed from overwhelming granulocytosis. The disease closely mimicked the distinctive features of human chronic myeloid leukemia: leukocytosis with maturing neutrophils, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and myeloid infiltration into peripheral tissues, including spleen, liver, and lungs. Strikingly, forced Id2 expression in murine bone marrow cells substantially delayed the onset of myeloproliferative disease (MPD). Collectively, these studies show that suppression of E-protein activity interferes with the development of BCR-ABL-mediated MPD.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3abone marrow cells 3agenetic background 3ahumans 3aliver 3alungs 3amice 3amyeloid leukemia 3aneutrophils 3aproteins 3aspleen 3asplenomegaly 3atissues1 aPatel, Nihal1 aIkawa, Tomokatsu1 aKawamoto, Hiroshi1 aFrank, Oliver1 aRivera, Richard R.1 aVan Etten, Richard A.1 aMurre, Cornelis0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Sept. 2, v. 105, no. 35 p.12967-12972dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08050731053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080905b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02487naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245013000203300002000333506007600353520104200429506003701471650002101508650002101529650002701550650002801577650004901605650001501654650001201669700001701681700002301698700002101721700002101742773017601763852000901939856008301948930003302031946001302064655001202077IND4409899320221207114955.0080905e20080902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440989932DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08037991052doi7 aPMC25290242pmcid7 a187256382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrelle, Cedric10aBoth maltose-binding protein and ATP are required for nucleotide-binding domain closure in the intact maltose ABC transporter  ap. 12837-12842.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe maltose transporter MalFGK₂ of Escherichia coli is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily. A periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP) delivers maltose to MalFGK₂ and stimulates its ATPase activity. Site-directed spin labeling EPR spectroscopy was used to study the opening and closing of the nucleotide-binding interface of MalFGK₂ during the catalytic cycle. In the intact transporter, closure of the interface coincides not just with the binding of ATP, as seen with isolated nucleotide-binding domains, but requires both MBP and ATP, implying that MBP stimulates ATPase activity by promoting the closure of the nucleotide-binding interface. After ATP hydrolysis, with MgADP and MBP bound, the nucleotide-binding interface resides in a semi-open configuration distinct from the fully open configuration seen in the absence of any ligand. We propose that Pi release coincides with the reorientation of transmembrane helices to an inward-facing conformation and the final step of maltose translocation into the cell.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aABC transporters 3aEscherichia coli 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ahydrolysis 3amaltose1 aAyvaz, Tulin1 aEverly, R.

The LPD monomer consists of a 25-residue peptide with fatty acyl chains linked to side chains located at positions 2 and 24 of the peptide. LPDs are designed to form α-helices that self-assemble into cylindrical micelles, providing a more natural interior acyl chain packing environment relative to traditional detergents. We have determined the crystal structure of LPD-12, an LPD coupled to two dodecanoic acids, to a resolution of 1.20 Å. The LPD-12 monomers adopt the target conformation and associate into cylindrical octamers as expected. Pairs of helices are strongly associated as Alacoil-type antiparallel dimers, and four of these dimers interact through much looser contacts into assemblies with approximate D₂ symmetry. The aligned helices form a cylindrical shell with a hydrophilic exterior that protects an interior hydrophobic cavity containing the 16 LPD acyl chains. Over 90% of the methylene/methyl groups from the acylated side chains are visible in the micelle interiors, and [almost equal to]90% of these adopt trans dihedral angle conformations. Dodecylmaltoside (DDM) was required for the crystallization of LPD-12, and we find 10-24 ordered DDM molecules associated with each LPD assembly, resulting in an overall micelle molecular weight of [almost equal to]30 kDa. The structures confirm the major design objectives of the LPD framework, and reveal unexpected features that will be helpful in the engineering additional versions of lipopeptide amphiphiles.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adetergents 3aengineering 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alipopeptides 3amembrane proteins 3amicelles 3amolecular weight1 aPomroy, Neil C.1 aCuesta-Seijo, José A.1 aPrivé, Gilbert G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Sept. 2, v. 105, no. 35 p.12861-12866dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08019411053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080905b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02340naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245007500205300002000280506007600300520092300376506003701299650001801336650001801354650001201372650001101384650001501395650000901410650001201419700002201431700002201453700002401475700001901499700002301518700002101541700001801562773017601580852000901756856008301765930003301848946001301881655001201894IND4409622220221207115007.0080829e20080826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440962222DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07069991052doi7 aPMC25279462pmcid7 a187191142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowers, M.

A novel G protein modulator (Gpsm1/AGS3) was up-regulated in the rat nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) but not in other limbic nuclei during abstinence from operant EtOH self-administration. Furthermore, NAcore AGS3 knockdown reduced EtOH seeking to pre-abstinence levels in a novel rat model of compulsive, human EtOH seeking. AGS3 can both inhibit G protein Giα-mediated signaling and stimulate Gβγ-mediated signaling. Accordingly, sequestration of Gβγ, but not Giα knockdown, significantly reduced EtOH seeking to pre-abstinence levels. Thus, AGS3 and Gβγ are hypothesized to gate the uncontrolled motivation to seek EtOH during abstinence. AGS3 up-regulation during abstinence may be a key determinant of the transition from social consumption to compulsion-like seeking during relapse.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalcohol abuse 3aanimal models 3aethanol 3ahumans 3amotivation 3arats 3arelapse1 aHopf, F.

Until now, a formal confirmation of these actions using genetic models has been elusive since the systemic adm knockout results in embryo lethality. We have built a conditional knockout mouse model using the Cre/loxP approach. When crossed with transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the tubulin Tα-1 promoter, we obtained animals with no AM expression in the CNS but normal levels in other organs. These animals lead normal lives and do not present any gross morphological defect. Specific areas of the brain of animals lacking CNS AM contain hyperpolymerized tubulin, a consequence of AM downregulation. Behavioral analysis shows that mice with no AM in their brain have impaired motor coordination and are hyperactive and overanxious when compared to their wild-type littermates. Treatment with methylphenidate, haloperidol, and diazepam did not show differences between genotypes. Circulating levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone were similar in knockout and wild-type mice. Animals with no brain AM were less resistant to hypobaric hypoxia than wild-type mice, demonstrating the neuroprotective function of AM in the CNS. In conclusion, AM exerts a beneficial action in the brain by maintaining homeostasis both under normal and stress conditions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3aanxiety 3abehavior change 3abrain 3acorticosterone 3acorticotropin 3adiazepam 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahaloperidol 3ahomeostasis 3ahypoxia 3aknockout mutants 3amice 3atransgenic animals 3atubulin1 aSerrano, Julia1 aTessarollo, Lino1 aCuttitta, Frank1 aMartinez, Alfredo.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Aug. 26, v. 105, no. 34 p.12581-12586dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08031741053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080830b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03902naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002400193245013300217300001600350520181000366650001402176650001802190650001002208650004102218650004402259650001102303650002802314650001102342650003802353650006402391650000902455650001602464650003202480650004802512650005002560650003702610650003802647650002102685650003702706650003002743650003102773653002302804653004302827653002302870700001602893700001502909700001502924700001402939700001502953700001502968700001502983773013302998852000903131856009203140930003303232946001103265655001203276IND4404223320221118035153.0080412e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440422332DNAL7 a183553522pmid7 aPMC23841082pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03637.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, J.q(Jin-Yong)10aUp-regulated macrophage migration inhibitory factor protects apoptosis of dermal fibroblasts in patients with systemic sclerosis  ap. 328-335.  aMacrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflammatory cytokine that has been demonstrated to regulate the apoptosis of several cell types. Dysregulated apoptosis of fibroblasts has been implicated in a variety of fibrotic diseases, including systemic sclerosis (SSc). In this study, we investigated the role of MIF in the apoptosis of dermal fibroblasts. The concentrations of MIF were measured in sera and in culture supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and dermal fibroblasts by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The degree of apoptosis was determined by colorimetric assay, and signalling pathways were examined by Western blot. The results showed that serum levels of MIF were significantly higher in patients with SSc (n = 47) than in healthy controls (n = 56). Stimulation of PBMCs by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 increased the production of MIF by fourfold over the constitutive levels. SSc dermal fibroblasts produced higher amounts of MIF than normal dermal fibroblasts. When treated with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), SSc dermal fibroblasts showed a lower degree of apoptosis compared with normal dermal fibroblasts. Exogenous MIF (1-100 ng/ml) inhibited SNP-induced apoptosis of dermal fibroblasts dose-dependently. Both extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (PD98059) and protein kinase B (Akt) inhibitor (LY294002) almost completely blocked the inhibitory effect of MIF on apoptosis. Furthermore, MIF increased the expression of Bcl-2, phospho-ERK and phospho-Akt activity in dermal fibroblasts. Taken together, our data suggest that MIF released by activated T cells and dermal fibroblasts decreases the apoptosis of dermal fibroblasts through activation of ERK, Akt and Bcl-2 signalling pathways, which might be associated with excessive fibrosis in SSc. 3aapoptosis 3aT-lymphocytes 2aAdult 2aApoptosisxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Immunologic 2aFemale 2aFibroblastsximmunology 2aHumans 2aLymphocyte Activationximmunology 2aMacrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factorsxbloodxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNitroprussidexpharmacology 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-aktxbiosynthesis 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2xbiosynthesis 2aRecombinant Proteinsximmunology 2aScleroderma, Systemicximmunology 2aSkinximmunology 2aT-Lymphocyte Subsetsximmunology 2aUp-Regulationximmunology 2aeIF-2 Kinasexbiosynthesis 0adermal fibroblasts 0amacrophage migration inhibitory factor 0asystemic sclerosis1 aKwok, S.-K.1 aHur, K.-H.1 aKim, H.-J.1 aKim, N.S.1 aYoo, S.-A.1 aKim, W.-U.1 aCho, C.-S.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2008 May, v. 152, no. 2 p.328-335dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03637.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080412b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03656naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003500164245018300199300001600382520152700398650001501925650001501940650001701955650001701972650002001989650001802009650001802027650001602045650002302061650002502084650001502109650002302124650002202147650001202169650002402181650001502205650002602220650001502246650001502261650001502276650001702291650001202308650005002320650001502370650005302385650004502438650003202483650002002515650003802535650001702573653001502590653001302605653003302618653001002651700002202661700002702683773013402710852000902844856008502853930003302938946001102971655001202982IND4401579820221118034943.0080217e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440157982DNAL7 a163622912pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-005-0209-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsteve-Turrillas, Francesc A. 10aComparison of different mass spectrometric detection techniques in the gas chromatographic analysis of pyrethroid insecticide residues in soil after microwave-assisted extraction  ap. 801-809.  aA comparative study was carried out for the simultaneous determination of 11 pyrethroid insecticides in soil by gas chromatography (GC) - ion trap (IT)- mass spectrometry (MS), by means of two different ionization modes; electron impact and negative chemical ionization and three data acquisition procedures; full scan, selected ion monitoring and MS/MS. Pyrethroids investigated were tetramethrin, bifenthrin, phenothrin, λ-cyhalothrin, permethrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, flucythrinate, esfenvalerate, fluvalinate and deltamethrin. Soil samples were treated with toluene/water by microwave-assisted extraction for 9 min at 700 W and a cleaning up with florisil was performed. Clean soil samples were spiked with pyrethroids at a spiking level of 10, 25 and 50 ng/g. The method employed provides a concentration factor of 10. The ionization gas employed in the negative chemical ionization mode was methane. The use of MS/MS acquisition, in electron impact ionization, provided the best results, due to its high selectivity and sensitivity, giving very low limits of detection from 0.08 to 0.54 ng/g. In negative chemical ionization full scan and selected ion monitoring methods detection limits from 0.12 to 1.40 ng/g were found. The proposed methods were applied to several levels from 10 to 50 ng/g of spiked soils, being electron impact MS/MS method which minimizes matrix spectrum interferences and provided recovery average values from 84% to 120% with relative standard deviations which varied from 3.2 to 7.2%. 3abifenthrin 3acyfluthrin 3acypermethrin 3adeltamethrin 3adetection limit 3aesfenvalerate 3aflucythrinate 3afluvalinate 3agas chromatography 3ainsecticide residues 3aionization 3alambda-cyhalothrin 3amass spectrometry 3amethane 3amicrowave treatment 3amonitoring 3amultiresidue analysis 3apermethrin 3aphenothrin 3apyrethrins 3atetramethrin 3atoluene 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aMicrowaves 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysisxradiation effects. 2aPyrethrinsxanalysisxradiation effects. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aTime Factors 0aPyrethroid 0aResidues 0aNegative Chemical Ionization 0aMS/MS1 aPastor, Agustín 1 aGuardia, Miguel de la.0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2006 Feb., v. 384, no. 3 p.801-809dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-005-0209-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20080218b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02804naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001300171245009100184300001400275520082000289650001901109650001101128650001701139650001001156650002301166650001501189650001101204650002601215650001801241650000901259650001301268650001101281650001201292650002601304650001701330650002401347650001201371650001801383650003201401650002201433650002301455650001101478650006001489650004601549650002601595650000901621650002801630650001401658650004201672650004701714650002301761653001001784653001901794653002701813700001301840700001301853773011901866852000901985856009201994930003302086946001102119655001202130IND4400953520221118035053.0080203e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440095352DNAL7 a182372842pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2583.2008.00775.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiya, T.10aExpression analysis of the FoxP homologue in the brain of the honeybee, Apis mellifera  ap. 53-60.  aThe transcription factor FoxP2 is related to acoustic communication in vertebrates and, although widely expressed in various tissues, its mutations cause a speech disorder in humans and disrupt vocalization in mice. In honeybee colonies, workers transmit information about a food location using 'dance communication', which is a form of acoustic communication. We identified a honeybee FoxP2-homologue, AmFoxP, and investigated its expression in the honeybee brain to elucidate its possible role in dance communication. The relative abundance of AmFoxP mRNA in the worker brain increased during the first 4 days of adult life. In situ hybridization revealed AmFoxP expression around the optic lobes, central complex, dorsal lobes, and protocerebral lobes, which was not dependent on the caste or division of labour. 3aApis mellifera 3aadults 3abioacoustics 3abrain 3ahoney bee colonies 3ahoney bees 3ahumans 3ain situ hybridization 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amutation 3aspeech 3atissues 3atranscription factors 3avocalization 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBeesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBrainxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFemale 2aForkhead Transcription Factorsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique 2aSequence Alignment 0aFoxP2 0adance language 0aacoustic communication1 aItoh, Y.1 aKubo, T.0 tInsect molecular biology.g2008 Feb., v. 17, no. 1 p.53-60dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2583.2008.00775.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080203b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03136naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003400145245009000179300001600269500001500285520139500300650004401695650002301739650002401762650001001786650002601796650001601822650001801838650002601856650001801882650002401900650001701924650002301941650001501964650002101979650002202000650001302022650002202035650002602057650001502083650001302098653001902111653002402130653003702154700002302191700002002214700002102234700002102255700002002276773012402296852000902420856008502429930003302514946001102547655001202558IND4405516020221118035114.0080509e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440551602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-008-0285-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNdour, Ndèye Yacine Badiane 10aImpact of irrigation water quality on soil nitrifying and total bacterial communities  ap. 797-803.  a2019-12-04  aDisturbance induced by two contrasting irrigation regimes (groundwater versus urban wastewater) was evaluated on a sandy agricultural soil through chemical and microbial analyses. Contrary to wastewater, groundwater displayed very high nitrate contents but small amounts of ammonium and organic matter. Despite these strong compositional shifts, soil organic carbon and nitrogen, nitrate and ammonium contents were not significantly different in both types of irrigated plot. Moreover, neither microbial biomass nor its activity, determined as fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis activity, was influenced by irrigation regimes. Bacterial community structure, assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S ribosomal DNA fragments, was also weakly impacted as molecular fingerprints shared an overall similarity of 85%. Ammonia-oxidizing bacterial community (AOB) was monitored by DGGE of the functional molecular marker amoA gene (alpha subunit of the ammonia monooxygenase). Surprisingly, no amoA signals were obtained from plots irrigated with groundwater, whereas signal intensities were high in all plots under wastewater. Among the last, compositional shifts of the AOB community were weak. Overall, impact of irrigation water quality on soil chemistry could not be evidenced, whereas effects were low on the total bacterial compartment but marked on the AOB community. 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aagricultural soils 3asoil organic carbon 3agenes 3aammonia monooxygenase 3agroundwater 3aribosomal DNA 3abacterial communities 3awater quality 3acommunity structure 3asoil quality 3aammonium compounds 3ahydrolysis 3airrigation water 3aDNA fragmentation 3anitrogen 3amicrobial biomass 3airrigation management 3awastewater 3anitrates 0aorganic matter 0aTropical sandy soil 0aAmmonia-oxydizing bacteria (AOB)1 aBaudoin, Ezékiel 1 aGuissé, Aliou.1 aSeck, Mountakha 1 aKhouma, Mamadou 1 aBrauman, Alain 0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2008 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.797-803dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-008-0285-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02503naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245007700168300001400245500011300259520125900372650001301631650002601644650001401670650001301684650001301697650003001710650001001740650002301750650001601773650001301789650001701802650001601819651001001835700001201845700001501857700001501872773014301887856005402030852000902084655001202093IND60569900020221118035128.0170623e20170420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056990002DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1156.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, J.

Of about 25 recognized Fragaria species in the world, 13 have distribution in China. Since 1980, 317 wild strawberry accessions have been collected from throughout the world and conserved in Shenyang Agricultural University, of which 252 were collected from China. The objective of this study was to evaluate these plants to determine the main taxonomical characteristics and ploidy. The 13 Chinese species include eight diploids: F. chinensis Lozinsk., F. daltoniana J. Gay, F. mandschurica Staudt, F. nilgerrensis Schlect., F. nubicola Lindl., F. pentaphylla Lozinsk., F. vesca L. and F. viridis Duch., and five tetraploids: F. corymbosa Lozinsk, F. gracilis A. Los., F. moupinensis (French.) Card., F. orientalis Lozinsk and F. tibetica Staudt & Dickoré. There was some variation within several Fragaria species. In recent years, several wild pentaploid strawberry genotypes were collected from northeast China. A dichotomous key of Fragaria species growing in China was prepared, considering runner branching, leaflets, sex, fruit characteristics, as well as presence of hairs on petioles, runners and peduncles.

Bioreactor micropropagation in liquid media has promoted automation of strawberry micropropagation as a possible way to reduce labour and propagation cost. Production of plants genetically identical to the mother plant is a major concern in commercial strawberry production. DNA-based markers that allow direct comparison of different genetic material independent of environmental influences can efficiently monitor genetic stability of micropropagated strawberries. This review deals with progress of strawberry culture in vitro, genetic and epigenetic variations in micropropagated plants and the use of molecular markers for the assessment of these variations. 3aautomation 3abioreactors 3aepigenetics 3agenetic markers 3agenetic stability 3agrowers 3alabor 3amicropropagation 3amonitoring 3astrawberries0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Apr. 20, , no. 1156 p.83-88dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1156.11  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245013200168300001400300500011300314520130700427650000801734650002201742650002201764650001101786650001501797650001101812650002201823650003501845650001701880651001201897700001801909700001901927700002001946700001601966700001901982700001402001700001602015700001602031700001702047700001202064700001402076700002002090773014302110856005502253852000902308655001202317IND60569900520170801000000.0170623e20170420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056990052DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1156.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, S.10aDevelopment and evaluation of the Axiom® IStraw35 384HT array for the allo-octoploid cultivated strawberry Fragaria ×ananassa  ap. 75-82.  aPaper presented at the VIII International Strawberry Symposium held August 13-17, 2016, Quebec  City, Canada  aThe Axiom® IStraw90 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) array was developed to enable high-throughput genotyping in allo-octoploid cultivated strawberry (Fragaria ×ananassa). However, high cost ($80-105 sample-1) limits throughput for certain applications. On average the IStraw90 has yielded 50 to 60% usable data points, defined as PHR (Poly High Resolution) and NMH (No Minor Homozygote) marker classes. Thus, an array is needed with a higher percentage of usable data points at a lower cost. We initiated an effort to identify IStraw90 SNP markers that were genetically mapped in one or more strawberry populations from research programs around the world. Seven programs participated in this endeavor. A total of 41,183 SNP probes were submitted to Affymetrix for quality check, 38,506 of which were accommodated on the Axiom® IStraw35 384HT design. In order to assess the performance of the Axiom® IStraw35 384HT array, 384 DNA samples from the University of Florida strawberry breeding program were assayed at a cost of $ 50 per sample, all inclusive. The performance of the array met expectations. More than 87% of markers belonged to the PHR and NMH categories. This array is expected to provide high-quality genome scanning at a more affordable price for strawberry researchers worldwide. 3aDNA 3aFragaria ananassa 3abreeding programs 3agenome 3agenotyping 3aprices 3aresearch programs 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astrawberries 3aFlorida1 aBassil, N.

DNA markers for important traits in octoploid strawberry have increased dramatically in recent years, and are now widely applied for marker-assisted selection (MAS) to assist strawberry breeding. To date, laborious and expensive DNA extraction procedures have been used to achieve sufficient DNA quality in this recalcitrant species. When combined with gel-based marker systems, current genotyping methods are becoming a bottleneck for MAS in large breeding populations. Here we present a high-throughput genotyping system for octoploid strawberry as a model for other Rosaceae fruit crop breeding programs. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis was combined with rapid DNA extraction for selection at the FaFAD1, FaRPc1 and FaRXf1 loci conferring fruity-aroma (γ-decalactone), resistance to Phytophthora crown root rot (Phytophthora cactorum) and bacterial angular leaf spot (Xanthamonas fragariae), respectively. This system was successfully employed to screen approximately 8,000 seedlings in the University of Florida strawberry breeding program in 2015. The system is rapid, cost-effective and highly accurate and should be readily applicable to other Rosaceae fruit crops with minor modifications. Updates and insights from seedling screening in spring, 2016 will also be discussed. 3aDNA 3aPhytophthora cactorum 3aRosaceae 3abreeding programs 3acost effectiveness 3afruit crops 3agamma-decalactone 3agenetic markers 3agenotyping 3aleaf spot 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3amelting 3amodels 3aoctaploidy 3aplant breeding 3arecalcitrant species 3aroot rot 3ascreening 3aseedlings 3aspring 3astrawberries 3aFlorida1 aNoh, Y.

Based on flow cytometric measurement of the DNA content, branching of stolons, sex expression, other morphological traits, the geographic distribution, and EST-SSR, SSR markers data, the species of the genus Fragaria in Yunnan and their phylogeny are discussed. Among 39 accessions, there are diploids and tetraploids, which show sympodial and monopodial branching. In tetraploid species, there are female and male plants. Based on EST-SSR and SSR data, a dendrogram was constructed using UPGMA method, the 39 accessions were classified into 2 groups based on the similarity coefficient at 0.7. The results show that genetic polymorphism of Fragaria germplasm in Yunnan is relatively abundant, and the relationships among the 39 accessions are defined. 3aDNA 3aFragaria 3abranching 3adiploidy 3afemales 3aflow cytometry 3agenetic polymorphism 3ageographical distribution 3agermplasm 3amale plants 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeny 3astolons 3astrawberries 3atetraploidy 3aChina1 aYu, H.

Japanese cultivars taste good but disease resistance is poor. European and American cultivars have good disease resistance but acid flavor. Therefore, the selection of high quality and disease resistant cultivars is very necessary. A new strawberry cultivar 'Zijin Jiuhong' was released by Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences in 2015, which derived from the cross 'Jiu59-SS-1' × 'Benihoppe', made in 2009. It is a short day cultivar with excellent fruit quality, especially the attributes of flavor, aroma and color. 'Zijin Jiuhong' has high yield. Fruit is short conical, red, shiny, beautiful in appearance with few deformities. Flavor is sweet and the average of soluble solids content is 11.3%. The average fruit firmness is 2.04 kg cm-2 when grown in the area around Nanjing city. The fruit is big and uniform, with an average weight of secondary fruit on the first inflorescence of 20.2 g, with a maximum of 45.9 g. The yield plant-1 is 312 g. It has a vigorous plant and produces a good number of runners in the nursery. 'Zijin Jiuhong' has a medium level of resistance to powdery mildew and anthracnose. It has a high level of resistance to grey mold. This cultivar is suitable for strawberry protected cultivation in most areas of China. 3aanthracnose 3acolor 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3aflavor 3afruit quality 3agray mold 3aodors 3apowdery mildew 3aprotected cultivation 3astrawberries 3ataste 3atotal soluble solids 3aChina1 aWang, Z.

The optimal use of the substrate is also connected to physical factors that can affect its capacity for water retention and suitability for root growth. Renewable substrate derived from by-product of coconut transformation were evaluated in strawberry cultivation and used with different types of containers to individuate the best container to enhance plant behavior, evaluating the effect of substrate volume, pot size and shape. Plants of the cultivar 'Elsanta' were grown in three different experiments on: (exp. 1) three substrates using two different containers of the same volume (peat in pot, peat + agriperlite 10% in plastic bag, and coconut coir in pot); (exp. 2) two substrates using three different containers at different volumes (peat in short plastic bag, coconut coir in pot, and coconut coir in long plastic bag); (exp. 3) peat using different pot volume, shape (height) and colour (black, white). Yield parameters and plant growth were registered. The total plant production was similar using different substrates and container types, while the plants grown in higher volume pots provided higher amount of fruits compared to smaller pots. The volume of the pot had also effects on the time of harvest peak. Plants grown on coir produced more roots compared to peat; plastic bags filled with peat base substrate induced higher vegetative growth compared to pots; plastic bags filled with coir induced more roots compared to pots. The performance of the substrates was connected with the container features, as probable consequence of different distribution of available water and of the root system. 3abyproducts 3acoconuts 3acoir 3acolor 3acultivars 3afruits 3aharvest date 3apeat 3aplastic bags 3aroot growth 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asoilless culture 3astrawberries 3avegetative growth1 aSavini, G.1 aNeri, D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Apr. 20, , no. 1156 p.295-300dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1156.45  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245012200172300001600294500011300310520116200423650001201585650001401597650001901611650001301630650001701643651001201660700001801672700001601690700001301706773014501719856005501864852000901919655001201928IND60569904620221118035041.0170626e20170420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056990462DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1156.502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, B.

Runner removal is a costly but recommended procedure in day-neutral strawberry production that is said to maximize fruit production. Trials were established in two distinct environments in Ontario in 2014 using the cultivars 'Albion' and 'eascape'. Runners were removed weekly, three times, once or not at all during the growing seasons in 2014 and 2015. Runner removal increased the total and marketable yields of 'Albion' in the planting year at both sites. There were few effects of runner removal in the second year at either site. In the cooler climate, both 'Albion' and 'Seascape' produced greater yields in the planting year with weekly runner removal but not with the less frequent treatments. In the warmer climate, the total yield of 'Albion' was reduced 30% when runners were not removed. Weekly runner removal took significantly longer than the other runner removal treatments at both sites although runner numbers were lower in the cooler climate. Runner removal also affected the number of runners formed, plant dry weight and crown numbers depending on the site and cultivar. 3aclimate 3acultivars 3agrowing season 3aplanting 3astrawberries 3aOntario1 aZandrstra, J.1 aTaghavi, T.1 aDale, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Apr. 20, , no. 1156 p.327-332dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1156.50  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245010200169300001600271500011300287520099000400650002101390650001601411650001101427650001301438650001501451650001401466650002601480650002201506650002401528650002101552650001701573700001601590700001301606700001301619700001401632700001301646773014501659856005501804852000901859655001201868IND60569904720221118035043.0170626e20170420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056990472DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1156.512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, W.

According to the results, the quadratic regression model had better simulation effect. Main effect analysis of fertilizer showed that N, P and K had different influences on fruit yield, N and K had more dramatic influences than P. Two-factor interaction analysis showed that there was significant interaction between two fertilizer factors that could increase the fruit yield, among which, N and K had more intensive interaction than P and K. By computer simulating, the optimum fertilization combination for 'Ningfeng'strawberry was ammonium nitrate 2.14-2.93 g plant-1, sodium dihydrogen phosphate 0.43-0.73 g plant-1 and potassium sulfate 2.41-3.69 g plant-1, with the average first inflorescence yield of 'Ningfeng' strawberry was 84.8±0.5 g plant-1. 3aammonium nitrate 3afruit yield 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3apotassium fertilizers 3apotassium sulfate 3aregression analysis 3asodium phosphate 3astrawberries1 aZhao, M.

Furthermore, the joint improvement of the nutritional value and the sensory key parameters of strawberry might increase the consumption rate of this fruit, which in turn will have a positive effect on consumer's health and a positive economic impact on the producing areas. New cultivars and strawberry selections bred in Huelva (southwestern Spain) have been characterized in relation to their organoleptic and nutritional properties. Key metabolites associated to the strawberry flavor (sucrose, fructose, glucose, malic and citric acid and 20 main volatile compounds) as well as specific phytochemicals (nine phenolic compounds plus vitamin C) with relevant antioxidant capacities have been analyzed by high resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HRGC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Data were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and Pearson correlations to discriminate those strawberry selections that, besides good agronomic performances, produce fruits with high contents of key flavor components and health-promoting phytochemicals. PCA clearly distinguish selections A10-48-3 and A7-32-10 as having significantly different metabolic profiles and displaying the highest contents of sugars, organic acids, ethyl esters, mesifurane, terpineol, quercetin and vitamin C. 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abreeding 3abreeding programs 3acitric acid 3acultivars 3aeconomic impact 3aesters 3aflavor 3aflavor compounds 3afructose 3afruits 3agas chromatography 3aglucose 3ahealth promotion 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3anew variety 3anutritive value 3aphenolic compounds 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquercetin 3astrawberries 3asucrose 3aterpineol 3avolatile compounds 3aSpain1 aGarcia-Rodriguez, R.1 aSanz, C.1 aRefoyo, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Apr. 20, , no. 1156 p.363-370dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1156.55  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245006900171300001600240500011300256520101800369650000801387650001201395650002201407650001401429650002001443650002601463650002301489650001301512650002701525650001701552700001501569773014501584856005501729852000901784655001201793IND60569902020221118035011.0170623e20170420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056990202DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1156.252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunaydin, S.10aCharacterization of strawberry cultivars by SSR and CAPS markers  ap. 171-178.  aPaper presented at the VIII International Strawberry Symposium held August 13-17, 2016, Quebec  City, Canada  aThis study was performed to reveal the value of genetic relationship among 34 Turkish and foreign strawberry cultivars and genotypes using CAPS and SSR DNA molecular markers. Seventeen primer-enzyme combinations in CAPS and 12 SSR primer pairs in SSR analysis were used. In CAPS analysis, 60 bands were produced and 52 of them were polymorphic. In SSR analysis, 150 alleles were generated and 145 of them were polymorphic. In the analysis of combined CAPS and SSR data, genetic similarity ranged between 0.59 and 0.91. 'Call Giant-2' and 'Call Giant-3' (0.91) were the closest cultivars, while Genotype 8 and Call Giant-4 were the most distant genotypes. As a result, SSR was better than CAPS from the point of view of polymorphism rates and polymorphism information contents, whereas CAPS was better than SSR from the point of view of resolving power values, in the characterization of strawberry cultivars and genotypes. The result of this study may allow us to design a cultivar breeding program in strawberry. 3aDNA 3aalleles 3abreeding programs 3acultivars 3agenetic markers 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic similarity 3agenotype 3amicrosatellite repeats 3astrawberries1 aKafkas, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Apr. 20, , no. 1156 p.171-178dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1156.25  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001600169245012500185300001800310500002400328500001500352520112300367650004401490650001401534650002801548650002401576650001401600650001801614650001701632650001801649650001401667650001301681650001801694650001501712650001701727650004601744650003001790650002301820650002001843650004301863650003701906650001401943650003401957650003901991650002602030653001302056700001302069700001602082700001702098773009902115852000902214856005302223655001202276IND4423588520221118035205.0090724e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442358852DNAL7 a195596042pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.05.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Guodong10aAnalysis of bacteria communities in an up-flow fixed-bed (UFB) bioreactor for treating sulfide in hydrocarbon wastewater  ap. 5056-5062.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn up-flow fixed-bed (UFB) bioreactor with patented functional polyurethane foam (FPUF) carriers was used to treat sulfide in hydrocarbon wastewater. Community compositions of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). DGGE results showed that a relatively stable bacterial community composed of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria formed in the bioreactor by the end of experiment, which ensured 92-100% sulfide removal efficiencies. Furthermore, autotrophic genera of Thiobacillus and Thiomonas, as well as those of the heterotrophic genus of Acinetobacter survived and exhibited high sulfide oxidation activity under all three operational conditions. Different special genera were also observed under each operational condition, such as the halophilic genus of Nesterenkonia. In addition, a new genus of sulfide oxidation bacteria was found in the bioreactor, which had the ability to synthesize cytoplasm from organic compounds. These genera have wide applications for the treatment of sulfide in hydrocarbon wastewater. 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3anew genus 3aphotosynthetic bacteria 3acommunity structure 3aThiomonas 3apolyurethanes 3ahydrocarbons 3aNesterenkonia 3aoxidation 3asulfides 3aAcinetobacter 3awastewater 3aThiobacillus 2aBacteriaxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aCells, Immobilized 2aElectrophoresis 2aHydrocarbonsxisolation & purification 2aOxygenxisolation & purification 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSulfidesxisolation & purification 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 0abacteria1 aLiao, Bo1 aTao, Huchun1 aLei, Zhihong0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Nov., v. 100, no. 21 p.5056-5062dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.05.052 7aarticle01069naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100003100154245006700185300001400252500002400266520027400290650001300564650002300577650001900600773013000619852000900749856005700758655001200815IND4461398120221118035132.0110812e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446139812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.1992.tb00236.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aANDRZEJEWSKA-GOLEC, EMILIA12aA taxonomic study of Plantago subgenus Psyllium (Miller) Harms  ap. 49-53.  aIncludes references  aANDRZEJEWSKA-GOLEC, E., 1992.

Some authors postulated a sister-group relationship between Copelatus Erichson and the remaining Dytiscidae, relying mainly on the absence of a mandibular channel in Copelatus. Other authors suggested a more derived position of the genus. Larval characters have been underutilized in phylogenetic studies, mainly because the larvae of many taxa within the family and, in particular, within Copelatinae are unknown. A comprehensive approach aimed to study the phylogenetic placement of a member of this subfamily based on larval characters has not been produced so far. In this study, the phylogenetic relationships of Copelatus are explored based on a cladistic analysis of 24 taxa and 120 chaetotaxic and morphological characters from larvae. For this purpose, larvae of Copelatus longicornis Sharp are described and illustrated in detail for the first time, with particular emphasis on morphometry and chaetotaxy, with the latter being unexplored until now. The results support a derived position of Copelatus within Dytiscidae, with a sister-group relationship between this genus and a clade formed by the subfamilies Lancetinae, Coptotominae, Laccophilinae, Colymbetinae, Matinae, and Dytiscinae, and part of Agabinae. No evidence was found for a sister-group relationship between Copelatus and the remaining Dytiscidae so that the absence of a mandibular channel in this genus is likely a reduction. Copelatus is supported by three apomorphies within Dytiscidae: mandibular channel absent, internal margin of the stipes with three robust spinulae, and seta MX8 inserted subapically on the galea. 3aDytiscidae 3alarvae 3aphylogeny1 aTorres, Patricia L.

Phenotypic properties indicated that 11 strains showed a high degree of similarity and <5% of isolates showed different properties such as utilization of dulcitol and inositol. A majority of isolates produced rep-PCR profiles similar (>80%) to a B. nigrifluens reference strain. This study showed that the majority of strains had 0-3 plasmids with estimated sizes ranging 9-32 Kb. Strains were clustered into two and three groups by whole-cell protein analysis and rep-PCR, respectively. 3aBrenneria nigrifluens 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aDNA primers 3abark 3agalactitol 3agenes 3amyo-inositol 3aplasmids 3aproteins 3aribosomal RNA 3awalnuts 3aIran1 aHarighi, B.0 tForest pathology.g2009 Oct., v. 39, no. 5 p.335-342dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1437-47817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0329.2009.00594.x 7aarticle02830naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003400145245015400179300001400333500002400347520172400371650001202095650001702107650002502124650002302149650001502172650001002187650001202197650001502209650000802224650001402232650001002246651001102256700002502267773010702292852000902399856004802408655001202456IND4429952620221118035143.0091211e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442995262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-009-9700-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrepaldi, Maria Otávia Silva10aUse and knowledge of plants by “Quilombolas” as subsidies for conservation efforts in an area of Atlantic Forest in Espírito Santo State, Brazil  ap. 37-60.  aIncludes references  aThe present work was undertaken in the Cachoeira do Retiro “Quilombola” community, located in the municipality of Santa Leopoldina (20°06′04″S × 40°31′47″W), in Espírito Santo State, Brazil. We expected to encounter high levels of ethnobotanical knowledge in the community due to its distance from the principal local urban center and its localization in a region of high biodiversity. Field work was undertaken between August 2005 and August 2006, employing semi-structured interviews, participant observation, artifact-interviews, as well as the “walk-in-the-forest” technique in the company of a local specialist. Ten additional informants participated in the research (seven women and three men with ages between 42 and 84) who were identified using the “snow-ball” method. A total of 192 ethnospecies belonging to 188 distinct plant taxa were cited (with 59% being native to the Atlantic Forest biome) and were classified into the following use-categories: medicinal (52%), food (34%), construction (18%), technology (10%), ritualistic (5%), ornamental (5%), and fuelwoods (2%). The plants with the greatest Use-Values were Attalea humilis (1.3) and Polyandrococos caudescens (1.1). The Diversity Index of the community's ethnobotanical knowledge (5.12 nats) was found to be higher than seen in other ethnobotanical studies undertaken in the Atlantic Forest. Using a methodology for determining conservation priorities it was found that 17 of the 49 species analyzed should be examined more closely in studies that could help guarantee the continuity of their populations in the local forest fragment in light of their low density and intense utilization by the Retiro Quilombola community. 3aAttalea 3abiodiversity 3abusiness enterprises 3aconservation areas 3aecosystems 3afoods 3aforests 3ainterviews 3amen 3asubsidies 3awomen 3aBrazil1 aPeixoto, Ariane Luna0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2010 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.37-60dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-009-9700-9 7aarticle03767naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245011500177300001800292500002400310500001500334520183100349650002702180650000902207650001602216650001902232650002202251650001102273650002802284650002302312650001302335650001102348650002202359650001402381650001002395650002302405650002302428650002402451650001602475650001502491650002502506650002302531650002802554650002002582650002702602650002102629650002602650650002202676650002202698653001102720700001702731700001902748700002002767700001802787700002202805700002102827700002602848700002402874700001602898773011002914852000903024856004803033655001203081IND4427797720221118035043.0091023e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442779772DNAL7 a196691232pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-009-1120-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamu, P.10aExploiting rice-sorghum synteny for targeted development of EST-SSRs to enrich the sorghum genetic linkage map  ap. 1193-1204.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe sequencing and detailed comparative functional analysis of genomes of a number of select botanical models open new doors into comparative genomics among the angiosperms, with potential benefits for improvement of many orphan crops that feed large populations. In this study, a set of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was developed by mining the expressed sequence tag (EST) database of sorghum. Among the SSR-containing sequences, only those sharing considerable homology with rice genomic sequences across the lengths of the 12 rice chromosomes were selected. Thus, 600 SSR-containing sorghum EST sequences (50 homologous sequences on each of the 12 rice chromosomes) were selected, with the intention of providing coverage for corresponding homologous regions of the sorghum genome. Primer pairs were designed and polymorphism detection ability was assessed using parental pairs of two existing sorghum mapping populations. About 28% of these new markers detected polymorphism in this 4-entry panel. A subset of 55 polymorphic EST-derived SSR markers were mapped onto the existing skeleton map of a recombinant inbred population derived from cross N13 × E 36-1, which is segregating for Striga resistance and the stay-green component of terminal drought tolerance. These new EST-derived SSR markers mapped across all 10 sorghum linkage groups, mostly to regions expected based on prior knowledge of rice-sorghum synteny. The ESTs from which these markers were derived were then mapped in silico onto the aligned sorghum genome sequence, and 88% of the best hits corresponded to linkage-based positions. This study demonstrates the utility of comparative genomic information in targeted development of markers to fill gaps in linkage maps of related crop species for which sufficient genomic tools are not available. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arice 3achromosomes 3alinkage groups 3adrought tolerance 3amodels 3aexpressed sequence tags 3achromosome mapping 3agenomics 3aStriga 3asequence homology 3adatabases 3acrops 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plant 2aComputer Simulation 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Plant 2aData Miningxmethods 2aDatabases, Genetic 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGenetic Markers 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aSorghumxgenetics 2aSyntenyxgenetics 0agenome1 aKassahun, B.1 aSenthilvel, S.1 aAshok Kumar, C.1 aJayashree, B.1 aFolkertsma, R.

LRR-extensin1 (LRX1) of Arabidopsis thaliana is a potential regulator of cell wall development, consisting of an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain and a C-terminal extensin-like domain typical for structural cell wall proteins. LRX1 is expressed in root hairs, and lrx1 mutant plants develop distorted root hairs that often swell, branch, or collapse. The aberrant cell wall structures found in lrx1 mutants point toward a function of LRX1 during the establishment of the extracellular matrix. To identify genes that are involved in an LRX1-dependent developmental pathway, a suppressor screen was performed on the lrx1 mutant, and two independent rol1 (for repressor of lrx1) alleles were isolated. ROL1 is allelic to Rhamnose Biosynthesis1, which codes for a protein involved in the biosynthesis of rhamnose, a major monosaccharide component of pectin. The rol1 mutations modify the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan I and, for one allele, rhamnogalacturonan II. Furthermore, the rol1 mutations cause a change in the expression of a number of cell wall-related genes. Thus, the lrx1 mutant phenotype is likely to be suppressed by changes in pectic polysaccharides or other cell wall components.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aproteins 3aprotein synthesis 3aalleles 3aphenotype 3acell growth 3apectins 3acell walls 3amutation 3arhamnose 3aroot hairs 3amutants 3acell wall components 3aextracellular matrix 2aAlleles 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Wallxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aExtracellular Matrixxchemistry 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGlucosyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMonosaccharidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Rootsxcytology 2aRhamnosexbiosynthesis 2aUridine Diphosphate Sugarsxmetabolism 0aplants1 aLink, Bruce1 aSeifert, Georg J.1 aSchellenberg, Barbara1 aWagner, Ulrich1 aPauly, Markus1 aReiter, Wolf-Dieter1 aRingli, Christoph0 tplant cell.g2006 July, v. 18, no. 7 p.1630-1641dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.105.0386533Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/ 7aarticle01176naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002100154245010200175300001600277500002400293520024200317650001800559650003100577650001800608650001200626650001500638700001900653773014800672852000900820856005700829655001200886IND4456201820221118035414.0110408e198606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445620182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1986.tb00526.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMisch, Donald W.12aA technique and apparatus for placement of test substances into the intestines of mosquito larvae  ap. 179-183.  aIncludes references  aA method for injection of substances into the intestinal lumen via the anal pore is described for fourth instar larvae of Aedes aegypti.

However, distributed models typically require values of many parameters to be specified or calibrated, which exacerbates model prediction uncertainty. This study uses the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) technique to analyse the parameter sensitivities of a distributed hydrological model, LISFLOOD-WB. Discharge time series and event volume data of the Luo River at upstream and downstream sites, Lingkou and Lushi, are used to analyse parameter uncertainty. Eight key parameters in the model are selected for conditioning and sampled using the Monte Carlo method under assumed prior distributions. The results show that maximum efficiency of model performance is lower and the number of behavioural parameter sets giving acceptable performance is fewer in the Lingkou sub-basin than in the Lushi sub-basin with the same criteria of acceptability. For both sub-basins the distribution shape parameter B in the fast runoff generation scheme is the most sensitive in predicting both discharge time series and event volume at the outlet. It is also shown that the value of parameter B at which the highest efficiency is derived is shifted from a high value for Lushi to a low value for Lingkou, consistent with past experience of model calibration that the larger the basin, the larger the B value is. The channel Manning coefficient N c shows some sensitivity in the prediction of discharge time series, but less in the prediction of event volumes. The other key parameters show little sensitivity and good simulations are found across the full range of parameter values sampled. The uncertainty bounds of predicted discharges at the Lushi sub-basin are broad in the peak and narrow in the recession. The normalized difference between the upper and lower uncertainty bounds for both discharge and evapotranspiration are broad in summer and narrow in winter and that of recharge is the opposite. 3aMonte Carlo method 3abasins 3aevapotranspiration 3aglobal change 3ahydrologic models 3amodel validation 3aparameter uncertainty 3aprediction 3arivers 3arunoff 3asummer 3atime series analysis 3awinter1 aMO, XINGGUO1 aPappenberger, Florian,1 aBeven, K.

Over the years, many infiltration models have been developed which are either physically based, conceptual or empirical. The literature shows that a model's applicability will always be limited to its context (such as location, availability of data, etc.). Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been recently used with success for a variety of nonlinear hydrological processes. In this study, the ANN multilayer perceptron was employed to model infiltration using data derived from plot-scale rainfall simulator experiments conducted in Cebu, the Philippines. Training parameters such as the stopping criteria and the type of transfer function affected the efficiency and the generalization capability of the ANN. The ANN resulted in a satisfactory network with an average R 2 of 0.9110. The network performance was also found to be related to the input as the accuracy of the ANN model was higher for soil types with higher proportions in the training data. The time distribution of infiltration showed that the model was unable to estimate the first few minutes of the process, but improved significantly in the later time intervals. Sensitivity analysis showed that soil moisture and hydraulic conductivity are the influencing factors in modelling infiltration using ANN. When compared with the traditional Philip and Green-Ampt models, ANNs provided the highest accuracy in terms of cumulative infiltration. 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aneural networks 3asoil types 3asoil water 3awatersheds 3aPhilippines0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2006, v. 51, no. 1 p.3-20dPublished for the International Association of Hydrological Sciences by Blackwell Scientific PublicationswJournal:2013x0262-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.51.1.3  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245007600177300002100253500001500274520132700289650002201616650002801638650001401666650002101680650001201701650001301713650001301726650002901739650002201768650001901790653002401809700001901833773010101852852000901953930003301962945002501995946001302020655001202033IND4387581520221118033739.0070205e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438758152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W10420 (16 p.  a2019-12-05  a1 Finite element methods for solute transport simulation typically use a discrete representation of the flow domain obtained from a finite element solution of the associated groundwater flow problem. Velocity, saturated thickness, and components of the dispersion coefficient tensor are represented as a set of nodal and/or element-averaged values. In contrast, the analytic element method (AEM) provides continuous mesh-independent solutions for these variables. In this paper, a set of techniques for using two-dimensional AEM flow solutions as the basis of finite element solute transport models is introduced. First, a general AEM-based discretization approach is presented that addresses the existence of curved boundaries, singularities, and discontinuities in vertically averaged concentration. Second, residual integration methods that handle continuous parameters with internal and boundary singularities are developed and evaluated. Third, an approach is introduced for handling internal discontinuities in concentration across certain analytic elements. This new approach uses a nonstandard mesh topology and a new formulation for internal coupled boundary conditions. The AEM-based transport simulation methods introduced in this paper are demonstrated to be robust and accurate for a variety of test problems. 3asimulation models 3afinite element analysis 3aequations 3agroundwater flow 3asolutes 3aaquifers 3avelocity 3asoil transport processes 3ahydrologic models 3asaturated flow 0amathematical models1 aRabideau, A.J.0 tWater resources research.g2006 Oct., v. 42, no. 10 p.W10420 (16 p-W10420 (16 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080318b20080404c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/03/17  aOther US 7aarticle03746naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245013200177300002100309500001500330520215400345650002202499650002502521650001202546650001602558650002802574650001002602650001702612650002402629650001802653650001002671650002202681650002002703650002202723650001902745650002202764650001302786650002202799650002102821650002602842651001102868653001702879653001502896653002102911700001702932700001902949700001902968773010102987852000903088930003303097945002503130946001303155655001203168IND4387581220221118033730.0070205e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438758122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSchoups, G.10aSustainable conjuctive water management in irrigated agriculture: model formulation and application to the Yaqui Valley, Mexico  ap. W10417 (19 p.  a2019-12-05  a1 This paper investigates strategies to alleviate the effects of droughts on the profitability and sustainability of irrigated agriculture. These strategies include conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater resources, and engineered improvements such as lining of irrigation canals and addition of regional pumping well capacity. A spatially distributed simulation-optimization model was developed for an irrigated system consisting of multiple surface water reservoirs and an alluvial aquifer. The simulation model consists of an agronomic component and simulators describing the hydrologic system. The physical models account for storage and flow through the reservoirs, routing through the irrigation canals, and regional groundwater flow. The agronomic model describes crop productivity as a function of irrigation quantity and salinity, and determines agricultural profit. A profit maximization problem was formulated and solved using large-scale constrained gradient-based optimization. The model was applied to a real-world conjunctive surface water/groundwater management problem in the Yaqui Valley, an irrigated agricultural region in Sonora, Mexico. The model reproduces recorded reductions in agricultural production during a historical drought. These reductions were caused by a decline in surface water availability and limited installed pumping capacity. Results indicate that the impact of the historical 8-year drought could have been significantly reduced without affecting profit in wet years by better managing surface water and groundwater resources. Namely, groundwater could have been more heavily relied upon and surface water allocation capped at a sustainable level as an operating rule. Lining the irrigation canals would have resulted in water savings of 30% of historical reservoir releases during wet years, which could have been used in subsequent drier years to increase agricultural production. The benefits of a greater reliance on groundwater pumping by installing additional wells are limited due to pumping restrictions near the coast to avoid seawater intrusion and due to increased pumping costs. 3airrigation canals 3aspatial distribution 3adrought 3agroundwater 3asustainable agriculture 3apumps 3asaline water 3aprofits and margins 3asurface water 3awells 3ahydrologic models 3acrop production 3asimulation models 3aalluvial soils 3aagricultural land 3aaquifers 3airrigated farming 3agroundwater flow 3airrigation management 3aMexico 0aoptimization 0areservoirs 0awater management1 aAddams, C.L.1 aMinjares, J.L.1 aGorelick, S.M.0 tWater resources research.g2006 Oct., v. 42, no. 10 p.W10417 (19 p-W10417 (19 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080315b20080404c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/03/14  aOther US 7aarticle02039naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002000144245010800164300002000272520089200292650001201184650001901196650002301215650001401238650000901252650001101261651001101272653004401283653001801327700002101345700002401366700002701390700001901417700001401436773009901450852000901549930003301558945002501591946001301616655001201629IND4387795720221118033745.0070212e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438779572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWinsemius, H.C.10aAssessment of gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) temporal signature over the upper Zambezi  ap. W12201 (8 p.  a1 The temporal signature of terrestrial storage changes inferred from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has been assessed by comparison with outputs from a calibrated hydrological model (lumped elementary watershed (LEW)) of the upper Zambezi and surroundings and an inspection of the within-month ground track coverage of GRACE together with spatial-temporal rainfall patterns. The comparison of the hydrological model with GRACE reveals temporal inconsistencies between both data sets. Because the LEW model has been calibrated and validated with independent data sources, we believe that this is a GRACE artifact. The within-month ground track coverage shows an irregular orbit behavior which may well cause aliasing in the GRACE monthly deconvolutions. This aliasing is the most probable cause of observed temporal inconsistencies between GRACE and other data sets. 3agravity 3aclimate models 3atemporal variation 3ahydrology 3arain 3arivers 3aAfrica 0aGravity Recovery and Climate Experiment 0aZambezi River1 aSavenije, H.H.G.1 aGiesen, N.C. van de1 aHurk, B.J.J.M. van den1 aZapreeva, E.A.1 aKlees, R.0 tWater resources research.g2006 Dec., v. 42, no. 12 p.W12201 (8 p-W12201 (8 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080227b20080301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/01/30  aOther US 7aarticle02986naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024004200117040001800159100001900177245005900196300001600255500011900271520107500390650002201465650001901487650001701506650001701523650001801540650001901558650002201577650001401599650002001613650002101633650001801654650001101672650002001683650001401703650002401717650001201741650003201753650001601785650002201801650001901823650002201842650002801864650002601892650001601918650001701934650001501951651001401966700001801980700001901998700001702017700001502034773014502049856005502194856011402249852000902363655001202372IND60707733120221118033845.0200821e20191125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070773312DNAL7 a10113/70773312hdl7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1265.322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasnauskas, A.10aSmall fruit breeding tendencies in Lithuania: a review  ap. 225-232.  aPaper presented at the XXX International Horticultural Congress: IHC2018 held August 12-16, 2018, Istanbul, Turkey  aSmall fruit growing in northern countries presents specific challenges NDASH cold and frost resistance, short vegetation period, low yield and berry quality. Horticultural plant breeding has been the major activity at the Institute of Horticulture LAMMC, focused on black currant (Ribes nigrum), strawberry (Fragaria annanassa; Fragaria vesca) raspberry (Rubus idaeus) and other. Research is concentrated on plant development and biotechnology applications aimed at ensuring high quality of propagation material for fruit plant production practices. The breeding program of small fruit plants involves the conventional and interspecific hybridization, in vitro techniques, usage of molecular markers for early diagnosis of important traits. The availability of genetically diverse germplasm is an important basis for successful breeding of plant cultivars. The laboratory of cryobiology was recently established to long-term preservation of horticultural and ornamental plant genetic resources. Recently new cultivars and promising hybrids of small fruits were released. 3aFragaria ananassa 3aFragaria vesca 3aRibes nigrum 3aRubus idaeus 3abiotechnology 3ablack currants 3abreeding programs 3acultivars 3aearly diagnosis 3afrost resistance 3afruit growing 3afruits 3agenetic markers 3agermplasm 3ahorticultural crops 3ahybrids 3ainterspecific hybridization 3anew variety 3aornamental plants 3aplant breeding 3aplant development 3aplant genetic resources 3apropagation materials 3araspberries 3astrawberries 3avegetation 3aLithuania1 aRugienius, R.1 aMazeikiene, I.1 aBendokas, v.1 aStanys, V.0 tActa horticulturae.g2019 Nov. 25, , no. 1265 p.225-232dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1265.3240uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/70773313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245009500173300001400268500020500282520123000487650004101717650001801758650001201776650001201788650002301800650001301823650001101836650001701847650001101864650001201875650000901887650000701896650001201903650001101915650001801926650001401944650001001958650001101968700002001979700001901999773014302018856005402161852000902215655001202224IND60707734620221118033750.0200821e20191125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070773462DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1266.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSullivan, D.

Compost pH is typically high (7 to 8) relative to the requirements of many plants. We developed a protocol to determine the acidity required to reduce compost pH to 5 for use with acid-loving plants. The same protocol may also have application to pH adjustment in soil-less media that include compost. The amount of elemental S (S°) required depends upon initial compost pH and its pH buffering capacity. Compost response to acidification was determined by equilibration of compost with dilute sulfuric acid (H(2)SO(4); 0.1 to 1.0 mol H+ kg(‑1) compost) at 22°C. After a 72-h equilibration period, the decrease in compost pH with acid addition was linear vs. acid addition rate. Compost buffering capacity, the amount of H+ required for a one unit pH decrease, ranged from 0.17 to 0.28 mol H+ kg(‑1) across all composts (n=28). The quantity of S° required to acidify compost to pH 5 averaged 7 to 8 g S° kg(‑1) for composts derived from municipal yard debris, deciduous tree leaves, or horse stall waste, and 12 g kg(‑1) for composts from dairy solids or peppermint biomass after oil extraction. 3aMentha piperita nothosubsp. piperita 3aacidification 3aacidity 3abiomass 3abuffering capacity 3acomposts 3ahorses 3ahorticulture 3aleaves 3amarkets 3aoils 3apH 3aprotons 3asulfur 3asulfuric acid 3atitration 3atrees 3awastes1 aCostello, R.

Significantly more malignant and multiple tumors were observed in pepper-treated mice than in vehicle-treated controls. Although pepper is officially recognized as "safe" by the FDA, pepper constituents include known carcinogens, procarcinogens, and cocarcinogens, such as saffrole and tannins.

The basic physics governing the operation of these sensors makes them relatively tolerant or immune to the effects of high-temperature, high-EMI, and highly-corrosive environments. This pressure microsensor represents a significant improvement in size and performance over previous generation sensors. To achieve the desired overall size and sensitivity, numerical modeling of diaphragm deflection was incorporated in the design, with the desired dimensions and calculated material properties. With an outer diameter of approximately 250 μm, a dynamic operating range of over 250 mmHg, and a sampling frequency of 960 Hz, this sensor is ideal for the minimally invasive measurement of physiologic pressures and incorporation in catheter-based instrumentation. Nine individual sensors were calibrated and characterized by comparing the output to a U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Traceable reference pressure over the range of 0-250 mmHg. The microsensor performance demonstrated accuracy of better than 2% full-scale output, and repeatability, and hysteresis of better than 1% full-scale output. Additionally, fatigue effects on five additional sensors were 0.25% full-scale output after over 10,000 pressure cycles. 3adiaphragm 3ahysteresis 3ainstrumentation 3ainterferometry1 aKarpen, Whitney R. 1 aMorrow, Duane A. 1 aKaufman, Kenton R. 0 tAnnals of biomedical engineering.g2009 Aug., v. 37, no. 8 p.1638-1645dBoston : Springer USx0090-69647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10439-009-9718-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090718b20090801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03763naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245013200167300001600299520210000315650001102415650001202426650001602438650002702454650001502481650001402496650002202510650001502532650002102547650002002568650001502588650001502603650001802618650001602636650001602652650001002668650002002678650001602698650001202714650001202726650001802738650001502756651002002771653001002791653001002801700002202811700003302833700002802866700002302894700002302917773009302940852000903033856008503042930003303127946001303160655001203173IND4423365820221118033852.0090718e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442336582DNAL7 a10.1007/s10745-009-9258-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiegler, Alan D. 10aEnvironmental Consequences of the Demise in Swidden Cultivation in Montane Mainland Southeast Asia: Hydrology and Geomorphology  ap. 361-373.  aThe hydrological and geomorphological impacts of traditional swidden cultivation in Montane Mainland Southeast Asia are virtually inconsequential, whereas the impacts associated with intensified replacement agricultural systems are often much more substantial. Negative perceptions toward swiddening in general by governments in the region beginning half a decade ago have largely been based on cases of forest conversion and land degradation associated with (a) intensified swidden systems, characterized by shortened fallow and extended cropping periods and/or (b) the widespread cultivation of opium for cash after the Second World War. Neither of these practices should be viewed as traditional, subsistence-based swiddening. Other types of intensive agriculture systems are now replacing swiddening throughout the region, including semi-permanent and permanent cash cropping, monoculture plantations, and greenhouse complexes. The negative impacts associated with these systems include changes in streamflow response, increased surface erosion, a higher probability of landslides, and the declination in stream water quality. Unlike the case for traditional swiddening, these impacts result because of several factors: (1) large portions of upland catchments are cultivated simultaneously; (2) accelerated hydraulic and tillage erosion occurs on plots that are cultivated repetitively with limited or no fallowing to allow recovery of key soil properties, including infiltration; (3) concentrated overland flow and erosion sources are often directly connected with the stream network; (4) root strength is reduced on permanently converted hillslopes; (5) surface and ground water extraction is frequently used for irrigation; and (6) and pesticides and herbicides are used. Furthermore, the commercial success of these systems relies on the existence of dense networks of roads, which are linear landscape features renowned for disrupting hydrological and geomorphological systems. A new conservation focus is needed to reduce the impacts of these intensified upland agricultural practices. 3afallow 3aforests 3agreenhouses 3agroundwater extraction 3aherbicides 3ahighlands 3aintensive farming 3airrigation 3aland degradation 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3alandslides 3aoverland flow 3aplantations 3aprobability 3aroads 3asoil properties 3astream flow 3astreams 3atillage 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aSouth East Asia 0aOpium 0aFlood1 aBruun, Thilde B. 1 aGuardiola-Claramonte, Maite 1 aGiambelluca, Thomas W. 1 aLawrence, Deborah 1 aThanh Lam, Nguyen 0 tHuman ecology.g2009 June, v. 37, no. 3 p.361-373dBoston : Springer USx0300-78397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-009-9258-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090718b20090801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02930naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121072000900139072000900148072000900157100002000166245011800186300001500304500002400319520134500343650001701688650000901705650002201714650002001736650002301756650001701779650002201796650001401818650001201832650002201844650001601866650001201882650001001894651001001904653002301914653002401937700002101961700001501982700001701997773017902014852000902193856007902202856004802281930003302329945002502362946001302387655001202400IND4377048020221118032645.0060108e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437704802DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.93.1.942doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aF8211 aChen, Liang-Yan10aEffects of insect-resistance transgenes on fecundity in rice (Oryza sativa, Poaceae): a test for underlying costs  ap. 94-101.  aIncludes references  aUnderstanding the balance between yield benefits and possible underlying yield costs that are associated with transgenic cultivars is useful for evaluating crop performance and the fitness of crop-wild hybrid progeny, but few researchers have tested for such costs under rigorous experimental conditions. We examined shifts in net costs and benefits of insect-resistance transgenes in cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) using two levels of insect pressure (low vs. moderate) and two types of competition (pure vs. mixed lines). We compared the growth and fecundity of potted rice plants from three transgenic lines, Bt, CpTI, and Bt/CpTI, relative to isogenic control plants at outdoor locations in Fuzhou, China. Net yield costs were detected, but only in Bt/CpTI plants in mixed-line competition with low insect pressure. These plants produced 16% fewer tillers, 6% smaller seeds, and 30% fewer seeds than competing control plants. Under moderate insect pressure, Bt and Bt/CpTI plants produced 36-65% more seeds than controls, but the net benefit for Bt/CpTI plants disappeared in mixed-line competition pots. To our knowledge, this is the first report of yield costs in cultivars with transgenic insect resistance. Our results suggest that these costs may be negligible in monotypic rice fields, especially when target insects are abundant. 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3atransgenic plants 3apest resistance 3agenetic resistance 3ainsect pests 3aseed productivity 3acultivars 3ahybrids 3aplant competition 3agrain yield 3atillers 3aseeds 3aChina 0aselection pressure 0acompetitive ability1 aSnow, Allison A.1 aWang, Feng1 aLu, Bao-Rong0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2006 Jan., v. 93, no. 1 p.94-101dPublished in cooperation with the Botanical Society of America by the Brooklyn Botanic Gardensx0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.93.1.943Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/3electronic resource  a20060329b20060402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/03/10  aOther US 7aarticle03719naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024004200117040001800159100002700177245012200204300001600326500021200342520205600554650001902610650001202629650002402641650001102665650001602676650001402692650001102706650001102717650004302728650002302771650001702794650002402811651001102835700002702846700002602873700002502899700002502924773014602949856005503095856011403150852000903264655001203273IND60691153420201204000000.0200428e20190930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069115342DNAL7 a10113/69115342hdl7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1251.202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzalez-Orozco, B.

Our working group previously reported that “seed” bulbs from 'Coreano' cultivar conditioned at 5°C for 5 weeks accelerated the crop cycle and increased the synthesis of phenolic compounds; however, there is little information on the variation in the levels of organosulfur compounds within low temperature conditioned garlic cloves. The aim of this work was to examine the effect of low temperature conditioning (5°C) or room temperature (20°C) on the levels of several organosulfur compounds in garlic “seed” cloves. Two sets of garlic 'Coreano' "seeds" were cultivated at Aguascalientes, Mexico during the crop cycle 2014-2015; one set was stored at room temperature (20°C), and the other was conditioned at low temperature (5°C) for 5 weeks. Pungency was determined by the pyruvic acid colorimetric assay and qualitative determination of allicin and other thiosulfinates were obtained using an HPLC-DAD system comparing the chromatograms and UV-spectral data against the literature. The results showed that garlic “seed” cloves conditioned at 5°C and at room temperature showed no significant differences in production of pyruvic acid. Four thiosulfinates were identified in the chromatograms of both conditions. The average relative content (%) suggested that allicin was significantly increased in low temperature conditioned garlic "seed" cloves compared with those conditioned at room temperature. While the levels of the other three identified thiosulfinates were increased at room temperature conditioning. Furthermore, the results propose that low temperature conditioning affected the accumulation of flavor precursors in garlic “seed” cloves though further research is needed to establish a better understanding of individual thiosulfinates influence on garlic flavor development. 3aAllium sativum 3aallicin 3aambient temperature 3acloves 3acolorimetry 3acultivars 3aflavor 3agarlic 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aphenolic compounds 3apyruvic acid 3astorage temperature 3aMexico1 aRivera-Pastrana, D.

The objective was to characterize physical and physiological changes in three cultivars of processed and whole carrots treated with ethylene and stored at two temperatures. The cultivars 'Alvorada', 'Brasília' and 'Esplanada' were harvested and the separation of whole carrots and baby carrots type cenourete®. In each of the groups, half received application of ethylene (10 ppm for 24 h) and the other half control. Afterwards, carrots were conditioned in plastic bags and stored at 8 and 25°C for 6 days. Samples were taken at every three days for analyses of the relative fresh weight loss, whitening index and total phenolic compounds. It was observed that the application of ethylene had no marked effect on all analyzes, regardless of the storage temperature. The roots stored at room temperature lost more weight, and the loss was higher in baby carrot. Regardless of the processing or not, all the carrots exceeded the maximum fresh weight loss (8%). The baby carrot has greatly increased the values of whitening index between 0 and 3 days, independent of treatment. There was an increase in total phenolic compounds during storage, in the three cultivars and for all treatments. Application of ethylene, the concentration used did not change the physical and physiological characteristics of carrots; there were differences between storage temperatures, cenourete® and carrots; and there were differences between cultivars during storage. 3aambient temperature 3acarrots 3acultivars 3adiscoloration 3aethylene 3amechanical damage 3aphenolic compounds 3aplastic bags 3aroots 3asecondary metabolites 3astorage temperature 3aweight loss1 aZanatta, F.

Among them, vegetables show high richness in valuable antioxidant compounds in their products. One example is onion (Allium cepa L.), which has been known and used worldwide for centuries. Onion is a valuable raw material largely used in food industry. Low production cost makes it an important crop in developing countries providing opportunities to meet with food demand and supply chain. A number of authors have shown that onions possess many biological activities including antibacterial, anticancer, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, antiplatelet aggregation and antioxidant. Among onions, the Egyptian Walking Onion (Allium cepa L. var. viviparum), a traditional neglected crop grown in Sicily, could be exploited for diversification of ready-to-eat products. The goal of our work was to compare the total polyphenol content of the Egyptian Walking Onion with five landraces of onion (Allium cepa var. cepa) of different bulb color. Additionally, the analyses of ascorbic acid and carotenoids content were performed. The quantitative and qualitative polyphenol contents were detected by HPLC and the antioxidant capacity analysis was ascertained by DPPH and ROO. Our results showed different qualitative and quantitative traits between the var. cepa and var. viviparum of A. cepa and they have been discussed. 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAllium cepa var. cepa 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abulbs 3acarotenoids 3acolor 3adeveloping countries 3afood industry 3ahealth promotion 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alandraces 3aonions 3apolyphenols 3aquantitative traits 3araw materials 3aready-to-eat foods 3asupply chain 3awalking 3aSicily1 aKaczynska, K.1 aNiklas, A.1 aDi Bella, M.

Field experiments were conducted at the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) Nietvoorbij site (33°54'S; 18°14'E) in Stellenbosch, South Africa during the late autumn for both years. The experimental design followed a randomized complete block design in a factorial arrangement of one control, seven treatments (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 L ha(‑1)) and two application methods (drench and foliar), replicated four times. At 60 days after planting (DAP), S. tuberosum 'BP1', leaves were sampled for nutrient analysis. The results for the 2010 and 2011 seasons showed that there was no difference in the leaf nutrient content due to the method of application. N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Mn, Cu, Zn and B increased with treatment concentrations, with minor exceptions (Cu in 2010 and Fe in 2011). 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aautumn 3aboron 3acalcium 3acopper 3aexperimental design 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3afoliar application 3agrowing season 3airon 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3aplant extracts 3aplanting 3apotassium 3apotatoes 3asodium 3asoil drenching 3azinc 3aSouth Africa1 aRaitt, L.

Three major defects discussed are: (1) A grossly unequal distribution of power, in which the interviewee greatly desires the object (job) that the interviewer controls; (2) Due to the imbalance of power in the interview, job seekers often resort to phony behavior in an attempt to match the "perfect applicant" stereotype; (3) Interviewers often ask questions without answers and base decisions on superficial personality traits. 3abehavior 3ainterviews 0aInterview techniques 0aInterview design 0aPersonnel policy 0aEmployment practices 0aJob placement 0aPsychological aspects0 pPersonnel Jg1976 Dec., v. 55, no. 12 p.598-600x0031-57457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19770401c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle04188naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175072000900193072000900202100001900211245009500230300001800325500002400343506007600367520192600443506003702369650001302406650002102419650002702440650001802467650000902485650001502494650002002509650001002529650002502539650001402564650001902578650001902597650001702616650001602633650008302649650002102732650005302753650001402806650003302820650002602853650002402879651001002903651001002913653001602923653002902939653003402968653004403002700002003046700002303066700002503089773013503114852000903249856009203258856006903350930003303419945002503452946001303477655001203490IND4376646720221207125429.0051211e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437664672DNAL7 a163327522pmid7 aPMC13173222pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.71.12.7788-7791.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF2001 aCortesi, Paolo10aGenetic Similarity of Flag Shoot and Ascospore Subpopulations of Erysiphe necator in Italy  ap. 7788-7791.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe overwintering mode of the grape powdery mildew fungus, Erysiphe necator (syn. Uncinula necator), as mycelium in dormant buds (resulting in symptoms known as flag shoots) or as ascospores in cleistothecia, affects the temporal dynamics of epidemics early in the growing season. We tested whether distinct genetic groups (I and III) identified previously in E. necator correlate to overwintering modes in two vineyards in Tuscany, Italy, to determine whether diagnostic genetic markers could be used to predict overwintering. Samples from one vineyard were collected from flag shoots; the other vineyard, 60 km away, had no flag shoots, and mildew colonies were assumed to be derived from ascospores. Genetic markers putatively diagnostic for groups I and III showed that both types were common in the flag shoot subpopulation. Both genetic types were found in the ascospore population, although group III was dominant. We did not find strong genetic differentiation between the two subpopulations based on inter-simple sequence repeat markers. Although there was significant (P < 0.001) genetic differentiation between these subpopulations in 1997 and when 1997 and 1998 subpopulations were pooled ([theta] = 0.214 and 0.150, respectively), no differentiation was evident between vineyards in 1998 ([theta] = 0.138, P = 0.872). Moreover, we did not observe distinct lineages corresponding to overwintering modes, as observed in previous studies. We could not determine if differentiation resulted from biological differences or restricted gene flow between the two vineyards. Our samples were taken from both subpopulations early in the epidemic, while previous studies confounded overwintering mode and sampling time. These results do not support a strong correlation between overwintering and genetic groups, highlighting the need to base population biology studies on sound biological and epidemiological knowledge.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aErysiphe 3aUncinula necator 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aoverwintering 3abuds 3aascospores 3agenetic markers 3agenes 3agenetic polymorphism 3avineyards 3aVitis vinifera 3apowdery mildew 3aepidemiology 3awine grapes 2aAscomycotaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDNA, Fungalxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGeography 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aVitisxmicrobiology 3aItaly 0aItaly 0aflag shoots 0amating type polymorphism 0ainter simple sequence repeats 0asequence characterized amplified region1 aMazzoleni, Anna1 aPizzatti, Cristina1 aMilgroom, Michael G.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2005 Dec., v. 71, no. 12 p.7788-7791dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.12.7788-7791.20053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060113b20060202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/01/12  aOther US 7aarticle04262naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175072000900193100002600202245010600228300001800334500002400352500001500376506007600391520178700467506003702254650001702291650002202308650002002330650002802350650001902378650002302397650002202420650001702442650002202459650001202481650002102493650001202514650002202526650002102548650002702569650002302596650002902619650002702648650002202675650002202697650006402719650003402783650001402817650002702831650002902858653001902887653002002906653002002926700002202946700002002968700001802988700002703006700002203033700003503055700002203090773013503112852000903247856009203256856008503348930003303433945002503466946001303491655001203504IND4376646620221207125412.0051211e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437664662DNAL7 a163327512pmid7 aPMC13173992pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.71.12.7781-7787.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2051 aCobo Molinos, Antonio10aEffect of Immersion Solutions Containing Enterocin AS-48 on Listeria monocytogenes in Vegetable Foods  ap. 7781-7787.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe effect of immersion solutions containing enterocin AS-48 alone or in combination with chemical preservatives on survival and proliferation of Listeria monocytogenes CECT 4032 inoculated on fresh alfalfa sprouts, soybean sprouts, and green asparagus was tested. Immersion treatments (5 min at room temperature) with AS-48 solutions (25 [micro]g/ml) reduced listeria counts of artificially contaminated alfalfa and soybean sprouts by approximately 2.0 to 2.4 log CFU/g compared to a control immersion treatment in distilled water. The same bacteriocin immersion treatment applied on green asparagus had a very limited effect. During storage of vegetable samples treated with immersion solutions of 12.5 and 25 [micro]g of AS-48/ml, viable listeria counts were reduced below detection limits at days 1 to 7 for alfalfa and soybean sprouts at 6 and 15°C, as well as green asparagus at 15°C. Only a limited inhibition of listeria proliferation was detected during storage of bacteriocin-treated alfalfa sprouts and green asparagus at 22°C. Treatment with solutions containing AS-48 plus lactic acid, sodium lactate, sodium nitrite, sodium nitrate, trisodium phosphate, trisodium trimetaphosphate, sodium thiosulphate, n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, p-hydoxybenzoic acid methyl ester, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, peracetic acid, or sodium hypochlorite reduced viable counts of listeria below detection limits (by approximately 2.6 to 2.7 log CFU/g) upon application of the immersion treatment and/or further storage for 24 h, depending of the chemical preservative concentration. Significant increases of antimicrobial activity were also detected for AS-48 plus potassium permanganate and in some combinations with acetic acid, citric acid, sodium propionate, and potassium sorbate.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abean sprouts 3aaqueous solutions 3adecontamination 3abacterial contamination 3araw vegetables 3afood contamination 3apathogen survival 3abacteriocins 3afood preservation 3asoaking 3aasparagus spears 3aalfalfa 3afood microbiology 3amicrobial growth 3aListeria monocytogenes 3afood preservatives 3aantibacterial properties 2aBacteriocinsxtoxicity 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Preservation 2aListeria monocytogenesxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aMedicago sativaxmicrobiology 2aSolutions 2aSoybeansxmicrobiology 2aVegetablesxmicrobiology 0asprouts (food) 0aenterocin AS-48 0aalfalfa sprouts1 aAbriouel, Hikmate1 aBen Omar, Nabil1 aValdivia, Eva1 aLucas López, Rosario.1 aMaqueda, Mercedes1 aCañamero, Magdalena Martínez1 aGálvez, Antonio.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2005 Dec., v. 71, no. 12 p.7781-7787dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.12.7781-7787.20053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080206b20080301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/01/12  aOther US 7aarticle02806naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001500190245008700205300001800292500002400310520123800334650001001572650001101582650002101593650002001614650001501634650002201649650001701671650002201688650002601710650001401736650002001750650002401770650002401794650001401818650002101832651001801853700001601871773014901887852000902036856009402045856007802139930003302217945002502250946001302275655001202288IND4376923720221118032505.0051230e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437692372DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03794.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP200 0aB200 0aX1001 aEleria, A.10aPredicting fecal coliform bacteria levels in the Charles River, Massachusetts, USA  ap. 1195-1209.  aIncludes references  aIn Massachusetts, the Charles River Watershed Association conducts a regular water quality monitoring and public notification program in the Charles River Basin during the recreational season to inform users of the river's health. This program has relied on laboratory analyses of river samples for fecal coliform bacteria levels, however, results are not available until at least 24 hours after sampling. To avoid the need for laboratory analyses, ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression models were developed to predict fecal coliform bacteria concentrations and the probabilities of exceeding the Massachusetts secondary contact recreation standard for bacteria based on meteorological conditions and streamflow. The OLS models resulted in adjusted R2s ranging from 50 to 60 percent. An uncertainty analysis reveals that of the total variability of fecal coliform bacteria concentrations, 45 percent is explained by the OLS regression model, 15 percent is explained by both measurement and space sampling error, and 40 percent is explained by time sampling error. Higher accuracy in future bacteria forecasting models would likely result from reductions in laboratory measurement errors and improved sampling designs. 3afeces 3arivers 3arecreation areas 3awater pollution 3aprediction 3acoliform bacteria 3ahuman health 3aindicator species 3aenvironmental factors 3ahydrology 3arisk assessment 3amathematical models 3aregression analysis 3aequations 3amodel validation 3aMassachusetts1 aVogel, R.M.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2005 Oct., v. 41, no. 5 p.1195-1209dAmerican Water Resources Associationx1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03794.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080327b20080404c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/03/16  aOther US 7aarticle04012naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174072000900183100001300192245019100205300001600396500002400412520180100436650001002237650001902247650001702266650001202283650002002295650001902315650001702334650002302351650004302374650002202417650001202439650005402451650002702505650001202532650002902544650001902573650002202592650001602614650001102630650002202641650001702663650005402680650001702734650001202751650002802763650002402791650004102815650006402856651001002920651001002930700001202940773010102952852000903053856007703062856010403139930003303243945002503276946001303301655001203314IND4376908220221118032443.0051228e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437690822DNAL7 a163021702pmid7 a10.1002/tox.201462doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aM320 0aL600 0aM0011 aChen, J.10aSeasonal dynamics of the hepatotoxic microcystins in various organs of four freshwater bivalves from the large eutrophic Lake Taihu of subtropical China and the risk to human consumption  ap. 572-584.  aIncludes references  aSo far, little is known on the distribution of hepatotoxic microcystin (MC) in various organs of bivalves, and there is no study on MC accumulation in bivalves from Chinese waters. Distribution pattern and seasonal dynamics of MC-LR, -YR and -RR in various organs (hepatopancreas, intestine, visceral mass, gill, foot, and rest) of four edible freshwater mussels (Anodonta woodiana, Hyriopsis cumingii, Cristaria plicata, and Lamprotula leai) were studied monthly during Oct. 2003-Sep. 2004 in Lake Taihu with toxic cyanobacterial blooms in the summer. Qualitative and quantitative determinations of MCs in the organs were done by LC-MS and HPLC. The major toxins were present in the hepatopancreas (45.5-55.4%), followed by visceral mass with substantial amount of gonad (27.6-35.5%), whereas gill and foot were the least (1.8-5.1%). The maximum MC contents in the hepatopancreas, intestine, visceral mass, gill, foot, and rest were 38.48, 20.65, 1.70, 0.64, 0.58, and 0.61 micrograms/g DW, respectively. There were rather good positive correlation in MC contents between intestines and hepatopancreas of the four bivalves (r = 0.75-0.97, p < 0.05). There appeared to be positive correlations between the maximum MC content in the hepatopancreas and the delta13C (r = 0.919) or delta15N (r = 0.878) of the foot, indicating that the different MC content in the hepatopancreas might be due to different food ingestion. A glutathione (GSH) conjugate of MC-LR was also detected in the foot sample of C. plicata. Among the foot samples analyzed, 54% were above the provisional WHO tolerable daily intake (TDI) level, and the mean daily intakes from the four bivalves were 8-23.5 times the TDI value when the bivalves are eaten as a whole, suggesting the high risk of consuming bivalves in Lake Taihu. 3alakes 3aeutrophication 3amicrocystins 3amussels 3abioaccumulation 3aanimal tissues 3ahuman health 3aseasonal variation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Toxinsxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aClimate 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEutrophication 2aFood Microbiology 2aFresh Water 2aHumans 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMicrocystins 2aPeptides, Cyclicxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aRisk Factors 2aSeasons 2aShellfishxmicrobiology 2aTissue Distribution 2aUnionidaexmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 3aChina 0aChina1 aXie, P.0 tEnvironmental toxicology.g2005 Dec., v. 20, no. 6 p.572-584dJohn Wiley & Sonsx1520-40817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.201463Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1522-72783Available from publisher's Web site  a20100727b20100807c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/01/05  aOther US 7aarticle04235naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165072000900183100002100192245016100213300001400374500002400388500001500412506007600427520167300503506003702176650002502213650002102238650001802259650002002277650001402297650001002311650001502321650001202336650001602348650001402364650001602378650001102394650001102405650001202416650008202428650004802510650002802558650002702586650004202613650002802655650001002683650003002693650001302723650001402736650002902750650006002779650004302839650005102882650003302933650003602966653001703002653001503019653001403034653002303048700001803071700002103089700002303110773010703133852000903240856008203249856005103331930003303382945002503415946001303440655001203453IND4376952120221207101238.0060101e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437695212DNAL7 a163613922pmid7 aPMC13234832pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.105.0377962doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aRiefler, Michael10aArabidopsis Cytokinin Receptor Mutants Reveal Functions in Shoot Growth, Leaf Senescence, Seed Size, Germination, Root Development, and Cytokinin Metabolism  ap. 40-54.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe used loss-of-function mutants to study three Arabidopsis thaliana sensor histidine kinases, AHK2, AHK3, and CRE1/AHK4, known to be cytokinin receptors. Mutant seeds had more rapid germination, reduced requirement for light, and decreased far-red light sensitivity, unraveling cytokinin functions in seed germination control. Triple mutant seeds were more than twice as large as wild-type seeds. Genetic analysis indicated a cytokinin-dependent endospermal and/or maternal control of embryo size. Unchanged red light sensitivity of mutant hypocotyl elongation suggests that previously reported modulation of red light signaling by A-type response regulators may not depend on cytokinin. Combined loss of AHK2 and AHK3 led to the most prominent changes during vegetative development. Leaves of ahk2 ahk3 mutants formed fewer cells, had reduced chlorophyll content, and lacked the cytokinin-dependent inhibition of dark-induced chlorophyll loss, indicating a prominent role of AHK2 and, particularly, AHK3 in the control of leaf development. ahk2 ahk3 double mutants developed a strongly enhanced root system through faster growth of the primary root and, more importantly, increased branching. This result supports a negative regulatory role for cytokinin in root growth regulation. Increased cytokinin content of receptor mutants indicates a homeostatic control of steady state cytokinin levels through signaling. Together, the analyses reveal partially redundant functions of the cytokinin receptors and prominent roles for the AHK2/AHK3 receptor combination in quantitative control of organ growth in plants, with opposite regulatory functions in roots and shoots.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aseed germination 3afar-red light 3aseedling growth 3aphenotype 3aseeds 3acytokinins 3amutants 3aroot growth 3areceptors 3achlorophyll 3aleaves 3ashoots 2aAlleles 2aArabidopsisxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aCytokininsxmetabolism 2aDNA, Bacterialxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGerminationxphysiology 2aLight 2aMorphogenesisxphysiology 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Leavesxphysiology 2aPlant Rootsxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aProtein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxcytologyxphysiology. 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 0aplant growth 0asenescence 0aseed size 0aphotomorphogenesis1 aNovak, Ondrej1 aStrnad, Miroslav1 aSchmulling, Thomas0 tplant cell.g2006 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.40-54dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.105.0377963Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/3electronic resource  a20060401b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/31  aOther US 7aarticle03651naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165072000900183100002200192245012700214300001600341500002400357506007600381520141200457506003701869650001701906650000901923650002501932650002101957650001801978650002501996650001202021650002202033650001902055650002302074650002102097650002002118650001202138650002502150650001802175650002002193650001102213650002802224650002102252650004302273650004202316650003302358650003902391650003102430650004202461650004802503653002602551653002902577700001902606700001802625773010902643852000902752856008202761856005102843930003302894945002502927946001302952655001202965IND4376951020221207124936.0060101e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437695102DNAL7 a163398522pmid7 aPMC13234902pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.105.0370692doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aIsshiki, Masayuki14aThe Serine/Arginine-Rich Protein Family in Rice Plays Important Roles in Constitutive and Alternative Splicing of Pre-mRNA  ap. 146-158.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSer/Arg-rich (SR) proteins play important roles in the constitutive and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. We isolated 20 rice (Oryza sativa) genes encoding SR proteins, of which six contain plant-specific characteristics. To determine whether SR proteins modulate splicing efficiency and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA in rice, we used transient assays in rice protoplasts by cotransformation of SR protein genes with the rice Waxy[superscript b] (Wx[superscript b])-{szligbeta}-glucuronidase fusion gene. The results showed that plant-specific RSp29 and RSZp23, an SR protein homologous to human 9G8, enhanced splicing and altered the alternative 5' splice sites of Wx[superscript b] intron 1. The resulting splicing pattern was unique to each SR protein; RSp29 stimulated splicing at the distal site, and RSZp23 enhanced splicing at the proximal site. Results of domain-swapping experiments between plant-specific RSp29 and SCL26, which is a homolog of human SC35, showed the importance of RNA recognition motif 1 and the Arg/Ser-rich (RS) domain for the enhancement of splicing efficiencies. Overexpression of plant-specific RSZ36 and SRp33b, a homolog of human ASF/SF2, in transgenic rice changed the alternative splicing patterns of their own pre-mRNAs and those of other SR proteins. These results show that SR proteins play important roles in constitutive and alternative splicing of rice pre-mRNA.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3aRNA-binding proteins 3abinding capacity 3amessenger RNA 3aalternative splicing 3aintrons 3atransgenic plants 3areporter genes 3abeta-glucuronidase 3apromoter regions 3astarch synthase 3aalleles 2aAlternative Splicing 2aBase Sequence 2aCells, Cultured 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aOryzaxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aProtoplastsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aRNA Precursorsxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aSer/Arg-rich proteins 0amessenger RNA precursors1 aTsumoto, Ayako1 aShimamoto, Ko0 tplant cell.g2006 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.146-158dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.105.0370693Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/3electronic resource  a20060401b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/31  aOther US 7aarticle03666naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172100002100181245007000202300001600272500014500288500021900433500002400652520192200676650001102598650001202609650001902621650002102640650001802661650001402679650001202693650001702705651001902722653002302741700001602764700001702780773014702797852000902944856009402953856007803047930003303125945002503158946001303183655001203196IND4376926320221118032547.0051230e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437692632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03777.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aK001 0aK1301 aRichardson, J.S.10aOrganic matter dynamics in small streams of the Pacific Northwest  ap. 921-934.  aIn the special issue: Small stream channels and their riparian zones in forested catchments of the Pacific Northwest / edited by R.D. Moore.  aPaper presented at the symposium and workshop on "Small stream channels and their riparian zones: their form, function and importance in a watershed context," February, 2002, University of British Columbia, Canada.  aIncludes references  aSmall streams in forested landscapes are tightly coupled to the vegetation of the surrounding forest, and one of the key drivers of the stream ecosystem is the nature of organic matter supplied to it. This paper is focussed on three questions related to organic matter dynamics in small, forested streams of the conifer dominated Pacific Northwest: (1) How do small streams differ from large streams? (2) How do small streams of the Pacific Northwest differ from those of other regions? and (3) How do forest practices alter organic matter dynamics of small streams in the Pacific Northwest? The organic matter dynamics of small streams in this region differ from temperate deciduous forests in the nature of the organic matter deposited (protective chemicals, hard epidermis, slower loss rates), the timing of inputs (distributed throughout the year), and the transport rates (smaller, hard needles are more easily transported). The large amount and persistence of wood in these streams provides an additional source of organic matter that can be consumed by particular species and contributes to biofilm and fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) production. Logging is commonly practiced in many forests of the region. This practice has been shown to alter the type, amount, and timing of organic matter delivery to small streams and reduce the amount and size of large wood. Changes in channel complexity and water temperature after logging also can contribute to reduced organic matter storage. Many of the processes controlling organic matter dynamics in small streams are well described in other regions. However, the climate, vegetation, and topography of the Pacific Northwest suggest that the rates and nature of some processes affecting stream organic matter may differ considerably from other regions. Further research on small streams of this area will be required to better understand these differences. 3arivers 3astreams 3aorganic matter 3ariparian forests 3aforest litter 3adead wood 3alogging 3aclearcutting 3aPacific States 0aliterature reviews1 aBilby, R.E.1 aBondar, C.A.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2005 Aug., v. 41, no. 4 p.921-934dAmerican Water Resources Associationx1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03777.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070815b20070902c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/03/15  aOther US 7aarticle02372naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001600190245008600206300001500292500002400307500001500331520086200346650002001208650001701228650001901245650001801264650002601282650002701308650001501335650001601350650002001366650001201386650001501398650003001413651001101443653001401454700001601468773014601484852000901630856009401639856006201733930003301795945002501828946001301853655001201866IND4376798420221118032523.0051220e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437679842DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03720.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aH000 0aJ500 0aF1101 aNielson, L.10aInfluences of residential yard care and water quality: Tualatin Watershed, Oregon  ap. 93-106.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe Tualatin is the first watershed in Oregon to implement the Total Maximum Daily Load provisions of the Clean Water Act to deal with nonpoint source pollution. Local officials cite residential yard care practices as potential contributors to nonpoint source pollution in the basin. Qualitative and quantitative methods, including observation of yard maintenance styles, suggest behaviors potentially harmful to water quality and conservation. Yard maintenance is influenced by the importance of neighborhood appearance and concern for aesthetics. These concerns stimulate residents to water, fertilize, and apply weed control at more frequent intervals than yard care experts recommend. Better understanding of the effects that relations with neighbors and yard maintenance knowledge have on residential yard care practices can help improve water quality. 3awater pollution 3aweed control 3ahome gardening 3awater quality 3apesticide application 3afertilizer application 3ainterviews 3aurban areas 3aturf management 3asurveys 3awatersheds 3anonpoint source pollution 3aOregon 0awater use1 aSmith, C.L.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2005 Feb., v. 41, no. 1 p.93-106dAmerican Water Resources Associationx1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03720.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3electronic resource  a20060313b20060402c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/03/13  aOther US 7aarticle02535naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136072000900154072000900163100001300172245005200185300001400237500002400251520124200275650001601517650001101533650001401544650001501558650001901573650001801592650002401610650002501634651001001659653002001669700001701689700001401706773014501720852000901865856009401874856006201968930003302030945002502063946001302088655001202101IND4376798320221118032643.0051220e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437679832DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03719.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aZhai, G.10aModeling flood damage: case of Tokai Flood 2000  ap. 77-92.  aIncludes references  aIn conventional flood damage reduction studies, flood damage is usually estimated with a damage function according to the depth of inundation. However, this method may not reflect the conditions of each family residing in the floodplain because it ignores not only the distribution of flood damage but also the effect of building characteristics and residents' preparedness. This paper uses data from a questionnaire based survey (N = 3,036) conducted 17 months after the Tokai Flood of 2000 that caused disastrous losses to household properties. It provides a conceptual "doughnut structure" model of flood damage to houses and house contents and a mathematical basis for models to explore the determinants of flood damage. Besides the inundation depth, house type significantly affects both the house structural and content damage probabilities, while house ownership and house structure affect house damage probability but not house content damage probability at a given depth. Inundation depth, residing period, and household income significantly affect both house and content damage values. In addition, house ownership has a significant impact on the house damage value, while house structure has an impact on content damage value. 3afloodplains 3afloods 3adisasters 3ahouseholds 3aquestionnaires 3adata analysis 3amathematical models 3astatistical analysis 3aJapan 0aproperty damage1 aFukuzono, T.1 aIkeda, S.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2005 Feb., v. 41, no. 1 p.77-92dAmerican Water Resources Associationx1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03719.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3electronic resource  a20060313b20060402c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/03/13  aOther US 7aarticle02548naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172100001500181245008400196300001400280500002400294520121500318650001001533650001101543650001201554650002801566650002101594650002201615650002201637650001501659650002401674650002401698651001101722773014501733852000901878856009401887856006201981930003302043945002502076946001302101655001202114IND4376798020221118032612.0051220e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437679802DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03716.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aX100 0aX3801 aCude, C.G.10aAccomodating change of bacterial indicators in long term water quality datasets  ap. 47-54.  aIncludes references  aIn 1996, the State of Oregon adopted a water quality standard based on Escherichia coli (E. coli), recognizing E. coli as an indicator of pathogenic potential. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) began analysis for E. coli that same year. The Oregon DEQ continued collection and analysis of fecal coliform (a prior indicator organism) for data input to bacterial loading models and the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI). The OWQI is a primary indicator of general water quality for the Oregon DEQ and the Oregon Progress Board. The objective of this study was to develop a regression relationship between fecal coliform and E. coli. This relationship would fill data gaps and extend water quality models and indicators. Water quality policy is better informed by the ability of these extended water quality models to determine whether water quality meets present or would have met past bacterial standards. Monitoring resources spent on dual bacterial analyses could be conserved. This study also showed that changes to OWQI values (as a result of changing bacterial indicators) were minimal, and corresponded to improved characterization of water quality with respect to pathogenic potential. 3afeces 3arivers 3astreams 3awater quality standards 3aEscherichia coli 3aindicator species 3acoliform bacteria 3aprediction 3amathematical models 3aregression analysis 3aOregon0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2005 Feb., v. 41, no. 1 p.47-54dAmerican Water Resources Associationx1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03716.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3electronic resource  a20060313b20060402c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/03/13  aOther US 7aarticle02387naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172100001700181245006000198300001400258500002400272500001500296520103700311650001101348650001901359650002101378650001201399650001001411650001801421650001901439650002101458650001801479651001101497653002201508700001801530773014501548852000901693856009401702856006201796930003301858945002501891946001301916655001201929IND4376797920221118032533.0051220e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437679792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03715.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP300 0aF400 0aX6001 aKelley, C.E.10aCanopy cover and shade determinations in riparian zones  ap. 37-46.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThree instruments commonly used to measure stream canopy cover were evaluated: the clinometer, a modified spherical convex densiometer Model A, and a hemispherical image system. The hemispherical image system was also used to model shade. At each of five locations throughout Oregon, canopy cover above a stream was measured from the center of the stream along a series of transects. Vegetation along the reaches sampled ranged from a densely vegetated coastal forest stand to a sparsely vegetated eastern Oregon meadow. When techniques were compared within each site, canopy cover measured with the clinometer was similar to that measured with hemispherical imagery. The densiometer measurements, however, were typically lower than, though still highly correlated with, those derived from hemispherical images and from the clinometer. Because of site-specific factors, the differences between all methods were significant in the Willamette and John Day Provinces. Canopy cover and shade were not equivalent for the streams studied. 3acanopy 3aimage analysis 3avegetation cover 3astreams 3ashade 3aplant density 3ariparian areas 3aimage processors 3adensitometers 3aOregon 0ameasuring devices1 aKrueger, W.C.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2005 Feb., v. 41, no. 1 p.37-46dAmerican Water Resources Associationx1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03715.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3electronic resource  a20060314b20060402c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/03/13  aOther US 7aarticle03436naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100002000147245013600167300001600303500002400319520208900343650002102432650002402453650001902477650001402496650001302510650004702523650001202570650001502582650003502597650001302632650001502645650003202660650002602692650002502718650002302743700001402766773011802780852000902898930003302907945002502940946001302965655001202978IND4376747820221118032630.0051218e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437674782DNAL7 a163572992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aC100 0aL5001 aWattiaux, M.

A student-assessment-of-learning-gain instrument with 46 items was administered anonymously as a survey 3-wk into the semester and as a course evaluation at the end of the semester. Scores, collected on a scale of 1 to 10, were analyzed to determine differences between survey and evaluation, the variation due to student cohort (years 2003, 2004, and 2005), and student standing (undergraduate or graduate) for 5 selected items: item 1 = My level of interest/ curiosity for nutrition is; item 17 = The reading assignments help me learn; item 18 = The in-class discussions help me learn; item 24 = I would prefer the professor lecture; item 38 = I am learning a lot in this class. Although students indicated a preference to using class time for discussion rather than lecture, the degree of consensus was low, as 10% of scores indicated a strong desire for lecture, whereas another 10% indicated strong opposition to lecture. Reading assignments and in-class discussions contributed positively to the perception of learning and both were correlated positively with level of interest in the topic. In the evaluation, the desire for lecture was correlated negatively with level of interest in the topic and the self-assessed level of learning. Students reported a greater interest in the topic at the end of the semester than at wk 3; however, the self-reported learning gains from discussion-related activities varied with student cohort. Graduate students reported a higher interest, more learning from discussion-related activities, and less desire for lecture than undergraduates. Although graduate students were more impervious to the discussion format, undergraduates perceived more learning if the discussion was student-centered (i.e., focused on their questions and answers), rather than subject-centered (i.e., focused on the paper content). 3acollege students 3aeducational methods 3aanimal feeding 3aruminants 3alearning 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCurriculum 2aEducation, Veterinaryxmethods 2aLearning 2aPerception 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRuminantsxphysiology 2aStudentsxpsychology 2aTeachingxmethods.1 aCrump, P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.343-352dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20060210b20060302c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/02/09  aOther US 7aarticle02356naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172100001600181245008200197300001600279500002400295500001500319520108000334650002201414650002001436650002501456650001501481650001301496653002401509700001601533700001401549773014701563852000901710856009401719856006201813930003301875945002501908946001301933655001201946IND4376799220221118032444.0051220e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437679922DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03729.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aP000 0aX1001 aHouse, M.R.10aVelocity distributions in streambed simulation culverts used for fish passage  ap. 209-217.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aStream crossings designed to simulate a natural streambed inside a culvert are commonly used to meet criteria where fish passage is required. Currently, there has been little research that quantitatively examines the flow patterns within these streambed simulation culverts. A model is presented that estimates the percent of a cross section that is within the swimming ability of juvenile fish developed from velocity measurements on first-generation stream simulation culverts - those culverts with a continuous gravel bed. The model, developed with regression techniques, uses physical and hydraulic parameters including discharge, total cross sectional area, Froude number, and relative roughness, and was tested directly against velocity distributions computed from field measurements and in a culvert design mode. Results were favorable, although larger percentage errors exist, particularly at small flow depths. The model appears to underestimate the percent of channel cross section at or below a limiting velocity, hence it is generally conservative in design mode. 3asimulation models 3astream channels 3aspatial distribution 3awater flow 3avelocity 0amathematical models1 aPyles, M.R.1 aWhite, D.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2005 Feb., v. 41, no. 1 p.209-217dAmerican Water Resources Associationx1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03729.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3electronic resource  a20060313b20060402c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/03/13  aOther US 7aarticle02182naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100001800156245010700174300001600281500002400297520082800321650001701149650001701166650001801183650002201201650002101223650001201244650002101256650003301277650001401310650002101324650001101345650001101356650002001367650000901387650000901396650002401405650002101429650001201450650001601462773011801478852000901596930003301605945002501638946001301663655001201676IND4376746120221118032443.0051218e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437674612DNAL7 a163572832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL300 0aN2001 aJensen, M.

Before weaning, but not during weaning, the calves on low milk allowance occupied the milk feeder more, consumed more concentrates, and had a lower daily gain. There was no interaction between milk allowance and weaning type. Weaning by reducing the number of milk portions resulted in more unrewarded visits to the milk feeder, but less time ingesting a similar amount of milk. The effect of milk allowance on milk feeder occupancy before weaning was not found when this allowance was halved during weaning. 3acalf feeding 3acalf feeders 3amilk replacer 3aautomated feeders 3afeeding behavior 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aCattlexgrowth & development 2aComputers 2aDietxveterinary 2aEating 2aFemale 2aHousing, Animal 2aMale 2aMilk 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSucking Behavior 2aWeaning 2aWeight Gain0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.201-206dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20060210b20060302c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/02/09  aOther US 7aarticle03015naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001800147245010200165300001600267500002400283520125800307650002001565650001801585650003101603650003001634650002201664650002701686650001201713650001101725650004501736650001101781650003201792650001001824650004001834650003501874650003401909650003001943650003201973650003602005650002802041650003902069700002002108700001902128700001502147700001802162700001502180700001602195700001602211773011802227852000902345930003302354945002502387946001302412655001202425IND4376745720221118032720.0051218e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437674572DNAL7 a163572792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8001 aCremonesi, P.10aTechnical Note: Improved Method for Rapid DNA Extraction of Mastitis Pathogens Directly from Milk  ap. 163-169.  aIncludes references  aEfficient control against bovine mastitis requires sensitive, rapid, and specific tests to detect and identify the main bacteria that cause heavy losses to the dairy industry. Molecular detection of pathogenic microorganisms is based on DNA amplification of the target pathogen. Therefore, efficient extraction of DNA from pathogenic bacteria is a major step. In this study, we aimed to develop a specific, sensitive, and rapid method to extract DNA directly from the main gram-positive bacteria known to cause bovine mastitis (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus uberis) found in milk samples. The DNA extraction method is based on the lysing and nuclease-inactivating properties of the chaotropic agent, guanidinium thiocyanate, together with the nucleic acid-binding properties of the silica particles. An efficient protocol consisting of 6 basic steps (3 of which were done twice) was developed and applied directly to milk samples. Absence of PCR inhibitors and DNA quality were evaluated by PCR amplification of the species-specific DNA sequences of the target bacteria. The level of sensitivity achieved in our experiments is applicable to milk sample analysis without sample enrichment. 3abovine mastitis 3arapid methods 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3apolymerase chain reaction 3adisease detection 3aGram-positive bacteria 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDNA, Bacterialxisolation & purification 2aFemale 2aGoat Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aGoats 2aMastitisxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aMastitis, Bovinexmicrobiology 2aMilkxcytologyxmicrobiology. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aStaphylococcus aureusxgenetics 2aStreptococcusxgenetics 2aStreptococcus agalactiaexgenetics1 aCastiglioni, B.1 aMalferrari, G.1 aBiunno, I.1 aVimercati, C.1 aMoroni, P.1 aMorandi, S.1 aLuzzana, M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Jan., v. 89, no. 1 p.163-169dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20060208b20060302c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/02/08  aOther US 7aarticle03365naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100002100161245009100182300001800273500002400291500001500315520185700330650002402187650002202211650002302233650001702256650002602273650002702299650001602326650002402342650001602366650002602382650001702408650001502425650001902440651002502459653002202484653002102506700001702527700002002544700001902564773010602583852000902689856009202698930003302790945002502823946001102848655001202859IND4376726320221118032618.0051216e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437672632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01039.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF3001 aWilliams, N.S.G.10aPlant traits and local extinctions in natural grasslands along an urban-rural gradient  ap. 1203-1213.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  a1. The effect that the surrounding landscape matrix has on the loss of species from fragmented patches remains largely unknown. To determine whether there were differences in the persistence of plants inhabiting remnant patches in contrasting landscape types we examined the local extinction of grassland plants along an urban-rural gradient in western Victoria, Australia. 2. Thirty small grassland remnants that had been comprehensively surveyed between 1979 and 1990 were intensively re-surveyed. A total of 289 (26%) of the 1104 plant populations present in the 1980s were not relocated and were presumed to be locally extinct. The proportion of populations lost differed along the gradient, with higher local extinction rates at patches in urban (37%) and peri-urban landscapes (27%) than those in the rural landscape (20%). 3. We calculated the probability of local extinction of species in urban, peri-urban and rural landscapes using Bayesian logistic regression models. Across all plant functional traits examined, species had a consistently higher probability of local extinction in the urban landscape. 4. Species that were geophytes or hemicryptophytes with a flat rosette and species with seeds dispersed by wind or ants had substantially increased risks of extinction in the urban landscape. Low seed mass, the lack of vegetative reproduction and the presence of a soil-stored seed bank increased the probability of local extinction in all landscapes. Regionally rare species had a higher probability of local extinction in rural and peri-urban landscapes but rarity had little influence on extinction risk in urban landscapes. 5. Urbanization has a strong influence on the species composition of urban grasslands and substantially increases the probability of local extinction of plants with particular combinations of functional traits. 3amathematical models 3aplant communities 3aplant architecture 3aurbanization 3abotanical composition 3avegetative propagation 3aurban areas 3aregression analysis 3arural areas 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aburied seeds 3agrasslands 3aseed dispersal 3aVictoria (Australia) 0aspecies diversity 0alocal extinction1 aMorgan, J.W.1 aMcDonnell, M.J.1 aMcCarthy, M.A.0 tjournal of ecology.g2005 Dec., v. 93, no. 6 p.1203-1213dCambridge University Pressx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01039.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110423b20110507c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03552naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003900133040001800172072000900190100002300199245007200222300001600294500002400310506007600334520145100410506003701861650001901898650001301917650001501930650002101945650000801966650001801974650001001992650002502002650002702027650001202054650003502066650005402101650001902155650001902174650003502193650001602228650002602244650002802270650007602298650001402374650002402388650002702412650001402439653001402453653002802467653001702495700002002512773013202532852000902664856008902673856006902762930003302831945002502864946001302889655001202902IND4377086120221207114655.0060108e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437708612DNAL7 a163911172pmid7 aPMC13522742pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.72.1.769-775.20062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ1001 aDavidson, Seana K.10aTransmission of Nephridial Bacteria of the Earthworm Eisenia fetida  ap. 769-775.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe lumbricid earthworms (annelid family Lumbricidae) harbor gram-negative bacteria in their excretory organs, the nephridia. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing of bacteria associated with the nephridia of several earthworm species has shown that each species of worm harbors a distinct bacterial species and that the bacteria from different species form a monophyletic cluster within the genus Acidovorax, suggesting that there is a specific association resulting from radiation from a common bacterial ancestor. Previous microscopy and culture studies revealed the presence of bacteria within the egg capsules and on the surface of embryos but did not demonstrate that the bacteria within the egg capsule were the same bacteria that colonized the nephridia. We present evidence, based on curing experiments, in situ hybridizations with Acidovorax-specific probes, and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, that the egg capsules contain high numbers of the bacterial symbiont and that juveniles are colonized during development within the egg capsule. Studies exposing aposymbiotic hatchlings to colonized adults and their bedding material suggested that juvenile earthworms do not readily acquire bacteria from the soil after hatching but must be colonized during development by bacteria deposited in the egg capsule. Whether this is due to the developmental stage of the host or the physiological state of the symbiont remains to be investigated.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEisenia fetida 3abacteria 3aAcidovorax 3aexcretory system 3aova 3aribosomal RNA 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3abacterial colonization 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxgrowth & development 2aComamonadaceaexgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aDNA, Ribosomal 2aDigestive Systemxmicrobiology 2aGenes, rRNA 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligochaetaxanatomy & histologyxembryologyxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16S 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSymbiosis 0anephridia 0amolecular sequence data 0aegg capsules1 aStahl, David A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Jan., v. 72, no. 1 p.769-775dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.72.1.769-775.20063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060525b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/25  aOther US 7aarticle03958naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003900133040001800172072000900190072000900199100002400208245008700232300001600319500002400335500001500359506007600374520167100450506003702121650002202158650001402180650000902194650003002203650001402233650001802247650002602265650001002291650001502301650001402316650001202330650004802342650005602390650002502446650002202471650002802493650001402521650002702535650002402562650002102586650008202607651002002689651001102709651001402720651001802734653001402752653001402766653002802780653002502808653001302833700002002846773013202866852000902998856008903007856006903096930003303165945002503198946001303223655001203236IND4377086920221207114708.0060108e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437708692DNAL7 a163911242pmid7 aPMC13522912pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.72.1.826-835.20062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL0011 aMiller, Wolfgang J.10aEvolutionary Dynamics of wAu-Like Wolbachia Variants in Neotropical Drosophila spp  ap. 826-835.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWolbachia bacteria are common intracellular symbionts of arthropods and have been extensively studied in DROSOPHILA: Most research focuses on two Old World hosts, Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, and does not take into account that some of the Wolbachia associations in these species may have evolved only after their fast global expansion and after the exposure to Wolbachia of previously isolated habitats. Here we looked at Wolbachia of Neotropical Drosophila species. Seventy-one lines of 16 Neotropical Drosophila species sampled in different regions and at different time points were analyzed. Wolbachia is absent in lines of Drosophila willistoni collected before the 1970s, but more recent samples are infected with a strain designated wWil. Wolbachia is absent in all other species of the willistoni group. Polymorphic wWil-related strains were detected in some saltans group species, with D. septentriosaltans being coinfected with at least four variants. Based on wsp and ftsZ sequence data, wWil of D. willistoni is identical to wAu, a strain isolated from D. simulans, but can be discriminated when using a polymorphic minisatellite marker. In contrast to wAu, which infects both germ line and somatic tissues of D. simulans, wWil is found exclusively in the primordial germ line cells of D. willistoni embryos. We report on a pool of closely related Wolbachia strains in Neotropical Drosophila species as a potential source for the wAu strain in D. simulans. Possible evolutionary scenarios reconstructing the infection history of wAu-like Wolbachia in Neotropical Drosophila species and the Old World species D. simulans are discussed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSouthern blotting 3aWolbachia 3aloci 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aphylogeny 3aendosymbionts 3aminisatellite repeats 3agenes 3aDrosophila 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aDrosophilaxclassificationxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Variation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTropical Climate 2aWolbachiaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 3aCentral America 3aMexico 3aCaribbean 3aSouth America 0aftsZ gene 0aevolution 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0awsp gene1 aRiegler, Markus0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Jan., v. 72, no. 1 p.826-835dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.72.1.826-835.20063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060531b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/25  aOther US 7aarticle03903naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003900133040001800172072000900190072000900199100002200208245013900230300001600369500002400385506007600409520182800485506003702313650001602350650002702366650001502393650002902408650001602437650002002453650002502473650002802498650001502526650001702541650002102558650002102579650001202600650002102612650001702633650005902650650003102709650001302740650006402753650002402817650002302841700002702864700002802891773013202919852000903051856008903060856006903149930003303218945002503251946001303276655001203289IND4377078320221207114404.0060108e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437707832DNAL7 a163910462pmid7 aPMC13522162pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.72.1.221-227.20062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ125 0aQ5051 aJussier, Delphine10aEffect of Simultaneous Inoculation with Yeast and Bacteria on Fermentation Kinetics and Key Wine Parameters of Cool-Climate Chardonnay  ap. 221-227.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInoculating grape musts with wine yeast and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) concurrently in order to induce simultaneous alcoholic fermentation (AF) and malolactic fermentation (MLF) can be an efficient alternative to overcome potential inhibition of LAB in wines because of high ethanol concentrations and reduced nutrient content. In this study, the simultaneous inoculation of yeast and LAB into must was compared with a traditional vinification protocol, where MLF was induced after completion of AF. For this, two suitable commercial yeast-bacterium combinations were tested in cool-climate Chardonnay must. The time courses of glucose and fructose, acetaldehyde, several organic acids, and nitrogenous compounds were measured along with the final values of other key wine parameters. Sensory evaluation was done after 12 months of storage. The current study could not confirm a negative impact of simultaneous AF/MLF on fermentation success and kinetics or on final wine parameters. While acetic acid concentrations were slightly increased in wines after simultaneous AF/MLF, the differences were of neither practical nor legal significance. No statistically significant differences were found with regard to the final values of pH or total acidity and the concentrations of ethanol, acetaldehyde, glycerol, citric and lactic acids, and the nitrogen compounds arginine, ammonia, urea, citrulline, and ornithine. Sensory evaluation by a semiexpert panel confirmed the similarity of the wines. However, simultaneous inoculation led to considerable reductions in overall fermentation durations. Furthermore, differences of physiological and microbiological relevance were found. Specifically, we report the vinification of "super-dry" wines devoid of glucose and fructose after simultaneous inoculation of yeast and bacteria.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3awhite wines 3aalcoholic fermentation 3agrape must 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3awine yeasts 3aOenococcus oeni 3alactic acid bacteria 3amalolactic fermentation 3awinemaking 3awine quality 3afood composition 3aflavor compounds 2aClimate 2aCold Temperature 2aFermentation 2aGram-Positive Coccixgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aVitisxmicrobiology 2aWinexmicrobiology1 aDubé Morneau, Amélie1 aMira de Orduña, Ramón0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Jan., v. 72, no. 1 p.221-227dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.72.1.221-227.20063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060519b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/19  aOther US 7aarticle01050naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115242011000133245010400243300001600347500002400363520007000387650001500457651001200472653006800484653002600552700001500578773009200593852000900685939003300694945000800727946001300735655001200748991626024580742620221118032605.0830713e198212  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aPAR830062812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJustine, J.L.10aReinvestigation of the ultrastructure of the spermatozoon of Haematoloechus (Trematoda: Haematoloechidae)10aReinvestigation de l'ultrastructure du spermatozoide d'Haematoloechus (Trematoda: Haematoloechidae)  ap. 322-332.  aSummary in English.  aHaematoloechus [sp.], spermatozoon, light and electron microscopy 3agerm cells 3aSenegal 0aHaematoloechus [sp.] (Trematoda)Dicroglossus occipitalis (Host) 0aMorphology, Trematoda1 aMattei, X.0 tJournal of ultrastructure research.g1982 Dec., v. 81, no. 3 p.322-332x0022-53207nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830713c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle03962naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003900133040001800172072000900190100002100199245020600220300001600426500002400442500001500466506007600481520158700557506003702144650002102181650002002202650001002222650001502232650002202247650001402269650001802283650002502301650002902326650001602355650001202371650006202383650001302445650002802458650002802486650005802514650004502572650002902617650001102646650003102657650004102688650001702729650006802746650002602814653001502840653001602855700002302871700002402894773013202918852000903050856008903059856006903148930003303217945002503250946001303275655001203288IND4377082720221207101454.0060108e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437708272DNAL7 a163910872pmid7 aPMC13522232pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.72.1.522-526.20062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aR2001 aThormar, Halldor10aStable Concentrated Emulsions of the 1-Monoglyceride of Capric Acid (Monocaprin) with Microbicidal Activities against the Food-Borne Bacteria Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli  ap. 522-526.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOf 11 fatty acids and monoglycerides tested against Campylobacter jejuni, the 1-monoglyceride of capric acid (monocaprin) was the most active in killing the bacterium. Various monocaprin-in-water emulsions were prepared which were stable after storage at room temperature for many months and which retained their microbicidal activity. A procedure was developed to manufacture up to 500 ml of 200 mM preconcentrated emulsions of monocaprin in tap water. The concentrates were clear and remained stable for at least 12 months. They were active against C. jejuni upon 160- to 200-fold dilution in tap water and caused a >6- to 7-log₁₀ reduction in viable bacterial count in 1 min at room temperature. The addition of 0.8% Tween 40 to the concentrates as an emulsifying agent did not change the microbicidal activity. Emulsions of monocaprin killed a variety of Campylobacter isolates from humans and poultry and also killed strains of Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter lari, indicating a broad anticampylobacter activity. Emulsions of 1.25 mM monocaprin in citrate-lactate buffer at pH 4 to 5 caused a >6- to 7-log₁₀ reduction in viable bacterial counts of Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli in 10 min. C. jejuni was also more susceptible to monocaprin emulsions at low pH. The addition of 5 and 10 mM monocaprin emulsions to Campylobacter-spiked chicken feed significantly reduced the bacterial contamination. These results are discussed in view of the possible utilization of monocaprin emulsions in controlling the spread of food-borne bacteria from poultry to humans.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3adecontamination 3afeeds 3aSalmonella 3amonoacylglycerols 3aemulsions 3adecanoic acid 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aantibacterial properties 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCampylobacter jejunixdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aChickens 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aEmulsionsxpharmacology 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aFood Contaminationxprevention & control 2aGlyceridesxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Testsxmethods 2aPolysorbates 2aSalmonellaxclassificationxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSurface-Active Agents 0amonocaprin 0afatty acids1 aHilmarsson, Hilmar1 aBergsson, Gudmundur0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Jan., v. 72, no. 1 p.522-526dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.72.1.522-526.20063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060525b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/25  aOther US 7aarticle04183naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003900133040001800172072000900190100002500199245012200224300001600346500002400362506007600386520180500462506003702267650002002304650001702324650001902341650002302360650002702383650002702410650002102437650002602458650002102484650001102505650001802516650003502534650001202569650005002581650004602631650004402677650001802721650002502739650002102764650003802785650003702823650002302860650004502883650005102928650002702979650002903006650003303035700001703068700001703085700002503102773013203127852000903259856008903268856006903357930003303426945002503459946001303484655001203497IND4377081420221207101448.0060108e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437708142DNAL7 a163910752pmid7 aPMC13522632pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.72.1.437-442.20062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aIbargutxi, María A.10aUse of Bacillus thuringiensis Toxins for Control of the Cotton Pest Earias insulana (Boisd.)

At a concentration of 100 [micro]g of toxin per milliliter of artificial diet, six Cry toxins (Cry1Ca, Cry1Ea, Cry1Fa, Cry1Ja, Cry2Aa, and Cry2Ab) were not toxic at all. Cry1Aa, Cry1Ja, and Cry2Aa did not cause mortality but caused significant inhibition of growth. The other Cry toxins (Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1Ba, Cry1Da, Cry1Ia, and Cry9Ca) were toxic to E. insulana larvae. The 50% lethal concentration values of these toxins ranged from 0.39 to 21.13 [micro]g/ml (for Cry9Ca and Cry1Ia, respectively) for an E. insulana laboratory colony originating from Egypt and from 0.20 to 4.25 [micro]g/ml (for Cry9Ca and Cry1Da, respectively) for a laboratory colony originating from Spain. The relative potencies of the toxins in the population from Egypt were highest for Cry9Ca and Cry1Ab, and they were both significantly more toxic than Cry1Ac and Cry1Ba, followed by Cry1Da and finally Cry1Ia. In the population from Spain, Cry9Ca was the most toxic, followed in decreasing order by Cry1Ac and Cry1Ba, and the least toxic was Cry1Da. Binding experiments were performed to test whether the toxic Cry proteins shared binding sites in this insect. ¹²⁵I-labeled Cry1Ac and Cry1Ab and biotinylated Cry1Ba, Cry1Ia, and Cry9Ca showed specific binding to the brush border membrane vesicles from E. insulana. Competition binding experiments among these toxins showed that only Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac competed for the same binding sites, indicating a high possibility that this insect may develop cross-resistance to Cry1Ab upon exposure to Cry1Ac transgenic cotton but not to the other toxins tested.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEarias insulana 3ainsect pests 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3abacterial insecticides 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3abacterial toxins 3ainsecticidal proteins 3acrystal proteins 3alarvae 3abinding sites 3abrush border membrane vesicles 2aAnimals 2aBacillus thuringiensisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Toxinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBinding Sites 2aBinding, Competitive 2aBiological Assay 2aEndotoxinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGossypiumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHemolysin Proteins 2aLarvaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aLepidopteraxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aMicrovillixmetabolism 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPlants, Genetically Modified1 aEstela, Anna1 aFerré, Juan1 aCaballero, Primitivo0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Jan., v. 72, no. 1 p.437-442dAmerican Society for Microbiology.x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.72.1.437-442.20063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060519b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/19  aOther US 7aarticle03164naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003900133040001800172072000900190100001900199245015700218300001600375500002400391500001500415506007600430520075500506506003701261650001701298650001801315650002201333650001601355650003001371650001201401650001401413650001001427650002501437650007301462650003301535650001601568650005601584650002901640650002601669650002801695650001401723650003901737650003401776650002701810650003101837650002401868653004001892653001001932653002401942653002801966653002201994653001402016653001102030700002302041700002002064773013202084852000902216856008902225856006902314930003302383945002502416946001302441655001202454IND4377080120221207101442.0060108e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437708012DNAL7 a163910632pmid7 aPMC13522052pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.72.1.346-352.20062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ1001 aSalazar, Oscar10aReal-Time PCR for the Detection and Quantification of Geodermatophilaceae from Stone Samples and Identification of New Members of the Genus Blastococcus  ap. 346-352.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReal-time PCR (RT-PCR) technology was used for the specific detection and quantification of members of the family Geodermatophilaceae in stone samples.

Phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptors integrate light quantity and quality to modulate the pace and phase of the clock. PHYTOCHROME B (phyB) controls period length in red light as well as the phase of the clock in white light. phyB interacts with ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR4 (ARR4) in a light-dependent manner. Accordingly, we tested ARR4 and other members of the type-A ARR family for roles in clock function and show that ARR4 and its closest relative, ARR3, act redundantly in the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian system. Loss of ARR3 and ARR4 lengthens the period of the clock even in the absence of light, demonstrating that they do so independently of active phyB. In addition, in white light, arr3,4 mutants show a leading phase similar to phyB mutants, suggesting that circadian light input is modulated by the interaction of phyB with ARR4. Although type-A ARRs are involved in cytokinin signaling, the circadian defects appear to be independent of cytokinin, as exogenous cytokinin affects the phase but not the period of the clock. Therefore, ARR3 and ARR4 are critical for proper circadian period and define an additional level of regulation of the circadian clock in ARABIDOPSIS:0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aphenotype 3acotyledons 3abinding proteins 3agene expression 3agenes 3amutants 3aphytochrome 3acircadian rhythm 3aprotein-protein interactions 3alight 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiological Clocksxphysiology 2aCircadian Rhythmxphysiology 2aCotyledonxmetabolism 2aCytokininsxmetabolism 2aLight 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPhotoperiod 2aPhytochrome Bxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aTemperature 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0acotyledon movement 0acircadian period 0aclock genes 0aARR9 gene 0aARR4 gene 0aplant proteins1 aTo, Jennifer P.C.1 aKieber, Joseph J.1 aMcClung, C.

Carotenoids could be a part of a protective strategy to minimize oxidative damage in vulnerable populations, such as the elderly. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine the protective effect of carotenoids against DNA damage. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study was conducted. Thirty-seven healthy, nonsmoking postmenopausal women aged 50-70 y were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 groups and were instructed to consume a daily dose of mixed carotenoids ({szligbeta}-carotene, lutein, and lycopene; 4 mg each), 12 mg of a single carotenoid ({szligbeta}-carotene, lutein, or lycopene), or placebo for 56 d. Plasma carotenoid concentrations were analyzed by using HPLC, and lymphocyte DNA damage was measured by using a single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. RESULTS: At day 57, all carotenoid-supplemented groups showed significantly lower endogenous DNA damage than at baseline (P < 0.01), whereas the placebo group did not show any significant change. Significantly less (P < 0.05) endogenous DNA damage was found as early as day 15 in the mixed carotenoid (P < 0.01) and {szligbeta}-carotene (P < 0.05) groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that carotenoid supplementation decreases DNA damage and that a combination of carotenoids (4 mg each of lutein, {szligbeta}-carotene, and lycopene), an intake that can be achieved by diet, or a larger dose (12 mg) of individual carotenoids exerts protection against DNA damage. 3aelderly 3aDNA damage 3adose response 3awomen 3anutritional intervention 3afree radicals 3alymphocytes 3amenopause 3amiddle-aged adults 3alycopene 3aelderly nutrition 3abeta-carotene 3alutein 3aDNA repair 3arandomized clinical trials 3adietary supplements 3aantioxidant activity 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 2aAged 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aCarotenoidsxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aComet Assay 2aDNA Damagexdrug effects 2aDietary Supplements 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLymphocytesxchemistry 2aMiddle Aged 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPostmenopause 0amixed carotenoids 0asenescence1 aAldini, Giancarlo1 aJohnson, Elizabeth J.1 aRasmussen, Helen1 aKraemer, Klaus1 aWoolf, Herb1 aMusaeus, Nina1 aKrinsky, Norman I.1 aRussell, Robert M.1 aYeum, Kyung-Jin0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2006 Jan., v. 83, no. 1 p.163-169dJournal of Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060218b20060302c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/02/17  aOther US 7aarticle03689naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100003300138245008000171300001600251500002400267500001500291520168800306650001501994650001602009650003202025650002502057650001202082650002502094650001602119650002102135650001602156650001102172650003102183650001502214650001002229650003302239650002002272650001902292650002802311650002302339650001102362650001102373650001802384650002502402650000902427650004902436650003202485650001702517650002302534650002002557650001602577653001802593700002202611700001902633700001802652700002302670700002102693773012702714852000902841856007002850930003302920945002502953946001302978655001202991IND4377048820221118032650.0060108e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437704882DNAL7 a164000612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aLauzon-Guillain, Blandine de10aIs restrained eating a risk factor for weight gain in a general population?  ap. 132-138.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: In modern societies characterized by abundant and accessible foods, restrained eating may become an adaptive behavior to limit weight gain. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the relations between eating behavior (EB) and adiposity in a general population over a 2-y period. DESIGN: We recruited 466 adults and 271 adolescents in 1999 on a geographical basis to participate in a longitudinal study. At the initial examination and 2 y later, they answered an EB questionnaire, the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R18, which measured cognitive restraint (CR), uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating. On the same occasions, several measures of adiposity were also obtained: body mass index (BMI; in kg/m²), waist circumference, the sum of 4 skinfold thicknesses, and percentage body fat. Relations between EB and adiposity were tested separately in adults and adolescents by using mixed linear regressions after adjustment for age, sex, and (in adolescents) Tanner pubertal stage. RESULTS: At baseline, CR was positively associated with BMI in normal-weight subjects (x BMI: 21.4 in the lowest to 23.3 in the highest CR quintile; P < 0.001) but not in overweight adults (P = 0.25). Initial CR did not predict change in adiposity variables (BMI change: P = 0.79 in adults, P = 0.57 in adolescents and young adults). Conversely, a high initial BMI was associated with a larger increase in CR ({szligbeta} = 20.1, P < 0.0001 in adults; {szligbeta} = 21.7, P = 0.003 in adolescents and young adults). CONCLUSIONS: Restrained eating is strongly associated with adiposity in normal-weight subjects but not in overweight subjects. However, restrained eating does not promote weight gain. 3aadipocytes 3aweight gain 3aanthropometric measurements 3alongitudinal studies 3afasting 3aadolescent nutrition 3alipogenesis 3afood deprivation 3aadolescents 3aadults 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aBody Mass Index 2aCohort Studies 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEatingxpsychology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aObesityxepidemiologyxetiologyxpsychology. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aSkinfold Thickness 2aWaist-Hip Ratio 2aWeight Gain 0aeating habits1 aBasdevant, Arnaud1 aRomon, Monique1 aKarlsson, Jan1 aBorys, Jean-Michel1 aCharles, M Aline0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2006 Jan., v. 83, no. 1 p.132-138dJournal of Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060218b20060302c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/02/17  aOther US 7aarticle03917naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100002100156245013700177300001600314500002400330520179300354650001402147650001802161650002002179650001902199650002602218650002602244650003102270650002102301650001302322650001902335650001502354650002502369650000902394650000902403650003602412650002502448650001402473650002402487650006302511650005902574650001802633650001102651650000902662650001602671650003302687650002402720650006302744650003102807653002102838700002602859700002202885700002402907700002302931773012702954852000903081856007003090930003303160945002503193946001303218655001203231IND4377048620221118032649.0060108e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437704862DNAL7 a164000592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aX3801 aRutten, Erica PA10aMetabolic effects of glutamine and glutamate ingestion in healthy subjects and in persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  ap. 115-123.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Because low plasma glutamate and glutamine concentrations are often seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), glutamine or glutamate supplementation may be a good option for preventing further metabolic disturbances in COPD patients. However, the metabolic effects of glutamate supplementation have never been compared with those of glutamine supplementation. OBJECTIVE: We compared the metabolic effects of repeated ingestion of glutamine and glutamate in COPD patients and in age-matched healthy control subjects. DESIGN: On 3 d separated by intervals of [>/=]2 d, a protocol of primed constant and continuous infusion of [²H₅]phenylalanine and [²H₂]tyrosine was performed for 3 h in 8 stable male COPD patients and 8 healthy control subjects. After a 90-min tracer infusion, all subjects ingested a glutamine or glutamate drink or the same amount of water every 20 min for 80 min. Blood samples were taken at the end of the postabsorptive and ingestion periods to test for effects on plasma amino acid and substrate concentrations and whole-body protein turnover. RESULTS: Glutamate but not glutamine ingestion resulted in higher plasma ornithine concentrations than did water ingestion (P < 0.01). The change in plasma arginine, citrulline, and urea concentrations was significantly (P < 0.01) higher after glutamine ingestion than after water or glutamate ingestion. Whole-body protein turnover decreased overall, independent of the drink consumed. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated ingestion of glutamine and glutamate resulted in different effects on the plasma amino acid concentration. In both groups, ingestion of glutamine but not of glutamate increased the plasma concentrations of citrulline and arginine, substrates produced in the intestine and the liver. 3aglutamine 3aglutamic acid 3adietary protein 3aprotein intake 3aamino acid metabolism 3anutrient availability 3arespiratory tract diseases 3achronic diseases 3apatients 3ablood proteins 3acitrulline 3amonosodium glutamate 3aurea 2aAged 2aAmino Acidsxbloodxmetabolism. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aDeuterium 2aDietary Supplements 2aGlutamic Acidxadministration & dosagexbloodxmetabolism. 2aGlutaminexadministration & dosagexbloodxmetabolism. 2aHealth Status 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMuscle, Skeletalxmetabolism 2aPostprandial Period 2aPulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructivexbloodxmetabolism. 2aRespiratory Function Tests 0aprotein turnover1 aEngelen, Marielle PKJ1 aWouters, Emiel FM1 aSchols, Annemie MWJ1 aDeutz, Nicolaas EP0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2006 Jan., v. 83, no. 1 p.115-123dJournal of Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20060218b20060302c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/02/17  aOther US 7aarticle03134naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245015100190300001600341500002400357520184200381650001002223650001602233650001502249650001502264650002502279650001202304650001202316650001102328650002202339650000902361650003302370650002602403650001602429700001802445700001502463700001802478700002402496773011602520852000902636856005502645655001202700IND4459855320221118032638.0110708e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445985532DNAL7 a211219702pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2010.01730.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgadillo, JA14aThe Ovulatory Response of Anoestrous Goats Exposed to the Male Effect in the Subtropics is Unrelated to their Follicular Diameter at Male Exposure  ap. 687-691.  aIncludes references  aThis study was designed to determine whether the follicular diameter at the introduction of the bucks influences the ovarian response in does exposed to males during the anoestrous season in the subtropics. Bucks (n = 4) were subjected to 2.5 months of long days from November 1st to stimulate their sexual activity. On 29th March, one of the four treated males was joined with the females (n = 13), being exchanged with other males every 12 h, during 10 days. Oestrous behaviour was recorded twice daily. Ultrasound examinations of the ovaries were performed once daily from Day -7 to -1 and twice daily from Day 0 to 6. Follicles that ovulate were categorized according to the diameter at the moment when females were joined with males, as Small (<3.9 mm), Medium (4.0-5.9 mm) or Large (>6.0 mm). All females ovulated (13/13) and 12 came into oestrus during the first 5 days after exposure to males. The growth rate of the follicles increased after the introduction of the bucks from 1.1 ± 0.1 mm per day to 1.5 ± 0.1 mm per day (p < 0.05). The percentage of follicles from each category that ovulated did not differ (p > 0.05; Small 47.8%; Medium 34.8% and Large 17.4%). From follicles that ovulated, the growth rate of those that were Small at the moment of the introduction of the bucks was greater (2.1 ± 0.1 mm per day; p < 0.05) than that observed in those that were Medium (1.3 ± 0.1 mm per day) and Large follicles (1.1 ± 0.1 mm per day). In 12 does, the largest follicle present in the ovaries was growing when bucks were introduced. From these follicles, five finally ovulated and seven finally regressed. In conclusion, the follicular diameter at the introduction of the bucks is not related to the oestrous behaviour and ovulatory responding patterns in female goats exposed to sexually active bucks in the subtropics. 3abucks 3amale effect 3anannygoats 3asubtropics 2aAnestrusxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aClimate 2aFemale 2aGoatsxphysiology 2aMale 2aOvarian Folliclexphysiology 2aOvulationxphysiology 2aPhotoperiod1 aUngerfeld, R.1 aFlores, JA1 aHernandez, H.1 aFitz-Rodríguez, G.0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2011 Aug., v. 46, no. 4 p.687-691dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2010.01730.x 7aarticle02389naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002000157245013500177300001800312500002400330500001500354520090800369650002601277650001601303650002201319650001801341650002401359650002201383650002001405650001901425650001201444650002001456650002401476650002301500650005301523650003801576650002801614650005301642653001301695700002001708773011601728852000901844856007801853655001201931IND4398681220221118032429.0071209e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439868122DNAL7 a180570482pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erm2382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYazawa, Katsumi10aIdentification and characterization of carrot HAP factors that form a complex with the embryo-specific transcription factor C-LEC1  ap. 3819-3828.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aC-LEC1, an orthologue of Arabidopsis LEC1, is thought to be an essential transcriptional activator required for normal development during the early and late phases of embryogenesis.

Two carrot HAP5 homologues and two carrot HAP2 homologues were identified; these factors have significant sequence similarity to the conserved regions of HAP5 and HAP2, respectively. Some of these proteins form heterotrimeric complexes that bind specifically to DNA fragments containing a CCAAT sequence in vitro. The results suggest that C-LEC1 is a component of the CCAAT-box-binding factor and forms a complex with C-HAP2B and C-HAP5A or C-HAP5B that regulates gene expression during carrot embryo development. 3atranscription factors 3aArabidopsis 3acomplementary DNA 3aembryogenesis 3aconserved sequences 3aearly development 3agene expression 3acDNA libraries 3acarrots 3asomatic embryos 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDaucus carotaxembryologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aproteins1 aKamada, Hiroshi0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2007 Oct., v. 58, no. 13 p.3819-3828dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erm2383Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04066naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001100145245011000156300001600266500002400282500001500306520278200321650001503103650001803118650001003136650001403146650001703160650001203177650001003189650001903199650000903218650001503227650001803242650001103260650002003271650001603291650001903307650001303326651001003339653001803349700002003367700001703387700001803404773010503422852000903527856004803536655001203584IND4433366920221118032420.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443336692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-009-0089-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Li12aA laboratory investigation of microbe-inducing CdCO₃ precipitate treatment in Cd²⁺ contaminated soil  ap. 248-254.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBackground, aim and scope This paper discusses a method investigating the reduction of free heavy metal cation contents in soil through the use of microbe-inducing precipitate (MIP). Materials and methods Bacteria Pasteurella is adopted to induce urea hydrolysis and produce CO ₃ ²⁻ . Free Cd²⁺ is then precipitated as CdCO₃ in soil. Bacteria Pasteurella reproduces and the produced urease activity is then determined to evaluate the Cd²⁺ effect. Wheat seeds are planted in Cd²⁺ contaminated soil after treatment with microbial inducing CdCO₃ precipitate. Wheat-growing status is photographed and wheat stem length data are recorded to evaluate the microbial treatment. Results Bacteria Pasteurella is discovered to consistently reproduce in 10 mg L⁻¹ Cd²⁺ solution for over 120 h. The optimal result is a free Cd²⁺ concentration reduction by 92% after a 28-day microbial treatment on Cd²⁺ contaminated soil (initial Cd²⁺ content 10 µg g⁻¹ (soil)). Discussion Free Cd²⁺ in soil is immobilized by the microbe-inducing CdCO₃ precipitate. The mechanism goes through the stages of hydrolyzing CO(NH₂)₂ into CO ₃ ²⁻ by Pasteurella bacteria's enzymolysis and reducing free Cd²⁺ content in soil by immobilizing free Cd²⁺ in the CdCO₃ precipitate. Based on the Michaelis-Menten equation of enzyme dynamics, urease constant K m is 1,230 mol L⁻¹ and maximum urease catalytic rate V max is 4.55 g L⁻¹ h⁻¹. Urease catalytic rate V is no less than 0.94 g L⁻¹ h⁻¹ in 10 µg g⁻¹ Cd²⁺ contaminated soil in 72 h under repetitious urea supplement (40 mg L⁻¹ per 24 h). Before the wheat tassel stage, the average wheat stem length cultivated in soil samples T2, T3, and T4 varies from 16 to 22 cm. Part of the stem length of T3 and T4 is well over 22 cm. The specific Cd²⁺ treatment method used in T4 is the best for rehabilitating Cd²⁺ contaminated soil in the investigation. Conclusions The treatment is based on the mechanism of hydrolyzing CO(NH₂)₂ into CO ₃ ²⁻ by Pasteurella bacteria's enzymolysis and reducing free Cd²⁺ content in soil by immobilizing free Cd²⁺ in CdCO₃ precipitate. Based on the Michaelis-Menten equation of enzyme dynamics, Cd²⁺ is observed to hold back Pasteurella-producing urease activity in solution and in soil. But Pasteurella bacteria are also endurable to Cd²⁺ with an appropriate concentration. Cd²⁺ treatments significantly reduced the residual contents of free Cd²⁺ in soil. Recommendations and perspectives The microbe-inducing carbonate precipitate method used in this investigation is patented by China Patent Bureau in 2007. It is recommended in application for its low-cost, repeatable and environmentally friendly specialties in China. 3acarbonates 3asoil solution 3astems 3aequations 3aheavy metals 3acations 3awheat 3asoil treatment 3aurea 3ahydrolysis 3asoil sampling 3aurease 3aSpermatophytina 3aPasteurella 3apolluted soils 3abacteria 3aChina 0aSpermatophyta1 aQian, Chunxiang1 aCheng, Liang1 aWang, Ruixing0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2010 Mar., v. 10, no. 2 p.248-254dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-009-0089-6 7aarticle03378naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245010200169300001600271500002400287520215800311650001702469650001202486650002002498650001502518650001202533650001002545650001502555650001602570650000902586650002302595650001702618650001702635650001502652650001802667650001202685650001002697650001702707651001102724700001802735700002302753773008702776852000902863856004802872655001202920IND4457216320221118032503.0110423e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445721632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-010-0153-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillward, Andrew A.10aNaturalization as a strategy for improving soil physical characteristics in a forested urban park  ap. 261-278.  aIncludes references  aEnsuring good soil quality is essential to promoting plant growth in urban parks and building ecological resilience into a cityscape. Periodically used to restore a degraded urban ecosystem, parkland naturalization is a management approach designed to facilitate the return of an area to a natural state by largely discontinuing maintenance activities and restricting public access. This study investigates the potential for parkland naturalization to improve soil quality in a forested portion of Kew Gardens Park, Toronto, Canada by comparing soil physical properties in three six-year-old naturalization enclosures with those found in adjacent managed parkland. Soil texture, compaction, bulk density, and surface water infiltration rate were measured at 104 sample sites, while ordinary kriging was used to interpolate two-dimensional prediction surfaces representative of soil properties. Sand and loamy sand were the dominant soil texture classes found across the study site. Highly compacted soil (>2,000 kPa) and soil with a bulk density >1.8 Mg/m³ (values sufficiently elevated to restrict tree root growth and respiration and impair soil water infiltration) were spatially correlated with high pedestrian traffic areas and corridors used by festival and park maintenance vehicles. In contrast, compaction and bulk density measurements in the naturalized areas were at or below thresholds known to impair root function ( [graphic removed] at 10 and 30 cm depth: 849 and 1,311 kPa, 1.15 and 1.51 Mg/m³, respectively). Similarly, water infiltration rates were rapid [graphic removed] within the naturalization enclosures but retarded to the point of surface pooling in parkland subjected to regular public use. In the absence of quantitative baseline data, our use of spatial analysis demonstrates that parkland naturalization is a good management practice for restoration of soil physical characteristics. While our results show improvements to soil properties in a relatively short period of time, variability in the soil response rate to parkland naturalization will be dependent upon disturbance history as well as on soil and climate type. 3abulk density 3aclimate 3acompacted soils 3aecosystems 3akriging 3aparks 3aprediction 3aroot growth 3asand 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil quality 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3asurface water 3atraffic 3atrees 3aurbanization 3aCanada1 aPaudel, Kamal1 aBriggs, Suzanne E.0 tUrban ecosystems.g2011 June, v. 14, no. 2 p.261-278dSpringer USx1083-81557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-010-0153-4 7aarticle02758naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245016800198300001800366500002400384506007600408520125900484506003701743650004801780650002901828650003101857650002601888650001701914650002701931650001801958650001801976650000901994650002102003650001502024650001102039700003102050700001702081773013702098852000902235856008002244655001202324IND4421800820221207120521.0090612e20090615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442180082DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02898-082doi7 aPMC26983372pmcid7 a193955642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Mengjin10aIn Silico Prediction of Horizontal Gene Transfer Events in Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus Reveals Protocooperation in Yogurt Manufacturing  ap. 4120-4129.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, used in yogurt starter cultures, are well known for their stability and protocooperation during their coexistence in milk. In this study, we show that a close interaction between the two species also takes place at the genetic level. We performed an in silico analysis, combining gene composition and gene transfer mechanism-associated features, and predicted horizontally transferred genes in both L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus. Putative horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events that have occurred between the two bacterial species include the transfer of exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthesis genes, transferred from S. thermophilus to L. bulgaricus, and the gene cluster cbs-cblB(cglB)-cysE for the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, transferred from L. bulgaricus or Lactobacillus helveticus to S. thermophilus. The HGT event for the cbs-cblB(cglB)-cysE gene cluster was analyzed in detail, with respect to both evolutionary and functional aspects. It can be concluded that during the coexistence of both yogurt starter species in a milk environment, agonistic coevolution at the genetic level has probably been involved in the optimization of their combined growth and interactions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 3aLactobacillus helveticus 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3aamino acid metabolism 3abiosynthesis 3acultured milk starters 3agene transfer 3amanufacturing 3amilk 3amultigene family 3aprediction 3ayogurt1 aSiezen, R.

Twelve samples of raw animal by‐products and their corresponding meals were analysed for chemical composition, amino acids (AA) content, FDNB‐reactive lysine content, pepsin digestibility, protein dispersibility index (PDI) and fatty acids (FA) content. There was a high variation in MBM composition between and within plants, mainly in the ash and fat content. Rendering caused a decrease in the total (p < 0.05) and the essential (p < 0.01) AA content (in crude protein basis) in both plants, because of a decrease in lysine (p < 0.001), methionine (p < 0.05), threonine (p < 0.01), leucine (p < 0.01), valine (p < 0.01) and phenylalanine (p < 0.01). Besides, there was a reduction in the cystine (p < 0.001), serine (p < 0.01) and aspartic acid (p < 0.01) content. The FDNB‐reactive lysine to total lysine ratio and pepsin digestibility only decreased (p < 0.001) in the plant with more severe treatment conditions, whereas the PDI increased (p < 0.05) by the process in both plants. The saturated to unsaturated FA ratio increase on average from 0.73 to 0.88 after rendering, because of the decrease in both linoleic and linolenic acids content and the increase in palmitic and stearic acids content. The results indicate that rendering has negative effects on protein and fat quality of MBM. Variability between and within plants is attributed to differences in raw material, processing conditions and fat removing efficiency. Therefore, a continuous monitoring is recommended to assure the quality of each batch before use. 3aanimals 3aaspartic acid 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3aleucine 3alinolenic acid 3alipid content 3alysine 3ameat and bone meal 3ameat quality 3amethionine 3apepsin 3araw materials 3arendering 3aserine 3athreonine 3avaline 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBiological Productsxanalysis 2aCattle 2aFatsxchemistry 2aFood Handling 2aHorses 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMeat Productsxanalysis 2aMineralsxanalysis 2aPoultry 2aProteinsxchemistry 2aSwine1 aCastrillo, C.1 aBaucells, M.D.1 aGuada, J.A.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2010 Oct., v. 94, no. 5 p.e154-e163dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2010.00998.x 7aarticle
