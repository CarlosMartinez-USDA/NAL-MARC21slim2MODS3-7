The complexity of fruit softening through involvement of several cell wall modifying genes has been well documented. More than one class of enzymes and proteins are involved in the process of softening and these may either act sequentially or synergistically. In this paper we provide further evidence of the complexity of fruit softening by demonstrating the simultaneous expression of multiple genes of the same family during softening. We report the identification of four α-expansin genes, MaEXPA2, MaEXPA3, MaEXPA4 and MaEXPA5 from banana fruit which express differentially during fruit development and ripening. The ORFs range from 750 to 774 bp in size. All four genes also possess two introns with variable sizes ranging from 75 to 343 nucleotides that are conserved in position. All the four genes were expressed during the course of ripening. Of these, MaEXPA2 was fruit specific and showed a strong ripening related and ethylene dependent expression in banana fruit. MaEXPA4 expressed both during fruit growth as well as ripening and might be related to expansion. MaEXPA3 and MaEXPA5 were also expressed in tissues other than fruit. It is concluded that expression of multiple expansin genes might be required for softening not only in dicot fruit such as pear, apple and strawberry but also in monocot fruit such as banana. 3ashelf life 3aMusa 3agene expression 3aexpansins 3aripening 3aintrons 3abananas 3afruiting 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences1 aSane, V.A.1 aSane, A.P.1 aNath, P.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2007 Aug., v. 45, no. 2 p.184-192dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2007.03.0033Available from publisher's Web site.  a20071015b20071102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03983naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147072000900156100002200165245010800187300001400295500018200309500002400491500001500515520183900530650001702369650002002386650001402406650001302420650001902433650001402452650001902466650001702485650003002502650002502532650002002557650001502577650001202592650001602604650003702620650002102657650003102678650003702709650002002746650001102766650001502777650003202792650003602824650001702860653002102877653002202898700001702920700001502937700001802952773013802970852000903108856012303117930003303240945002503273946001103298655001203309IND4392128520221122213404.0070605e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439212852DNAL7 a173437742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT200 0aT300 0aQ505 0aU6001 aRungapamestry, V.10aEffect of cooking brassica vegetables on the subsequent hydrolysis and metabolic fate of glucosinolates  ap. 69-81.  aPaper presented at the Postgraduate Symposium at the summer meeting of the Nutrition Society, held at the Exhibition Conference Center, 3-6 July, 2006, Aberdeen, United Kingdom.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe protective effects of brassica vegetables against cancer may be partly related to their glucosinolate content. Glucosinolates are hydrolysed by plant myrosinase following damage of plant tissue. Isothiocyanates are one of the main groups of metabolites of glucosinolates and are implicated in the preventive effect against cancer. During cooking of brassica the glucosinolate-myrosinase system may be modified as a result of inactivation of plant myrosinase, loss of enzymic cofactors such as epithiospecifier protein, thermal breakdown and/or leaching of glucosinolates and their metabolites or volatilization of metabolites. Cooking brassica affects the site of release of breakdown products of glucosinolates, which is the upper gastrointestinal tract following consumption of raw brassica containing active plant myrosinase. After consumption of cooked brassica devoid of plant myrosinase glucosinolates are hydrolysed in the colon under the action of the resident microflora. Feeding trials with human subjects have shown that hydrolysis of glucosinolates and absorption of isothiocyanates are greater following ingestion of raw brassica with active plant myrosinase than after consumption of the cooked plant with denatured myrosinase. The digestive fate of glucosinolates may be further influenced by the extent of cell rupture during ingestion, gastrointestinal transit time, meal composition, individual genotype and differences in colonic microflora. These sources of variation may partly explain the weak epidemiological evidence relating consumption of brassica to prevention against cancer. An understanding of the biochemical changes occurring during cooking and ingestion of brassica may help in the design of more robust epidemiological studies to better evaluate the protective effects of brassica against cancer. 3acooked foods 3aisothiocyanates 3aneoplasms 3aBrassica 3avolatilization 3araw foods 3aglucosinolates 3afood storage 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3athioglucosidase 3avegetables 3acooking 3ametabolites 2aBrassicaxchemistryxenzymology. 2aCookingxmethods 2aGlucosinolatesxmetabolism 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aHydrolysis 2aIsothiocyanatesxmetabolism 2aNeoplasmsxprevention & control 2aTime Factors 0afood preparation 0aprotective effect1 aDuncan, A.J.1 aFuller, Z.1 aRatcliffe, B.0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2007 Feb., v. 66, no. 1 p.69-81dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/cabi/pns;jsessionid=2egth11oi6kuo.victoria3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aINDd1CTe2007/09/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03593naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245018800189300001600377520143200393650001301825650002501838650001201863650002101875650003401896650003701930650002701967650004201994650002702036650003902063650004502102650005002147650002702197650000902224650001802233650003502251650002402286650004202310650000902352650002502361650002902386650007602415650001702491653002002508653001702528653005002545653002102595700002102616700002502637700002502662700002202687773012302709852000902832856009202841930003302933946001302966655001202979IND4403904820221122213419.0080404e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440390482DNAL7 a181942172pmid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05172.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPekcec, Anton10aTargeting epileptogenesis-associated induction of neurogenesis by enzymatic depolysialylation of NCAM counteracts spatial learning dysfunction but fails to impact epilepsy development  ap. 389-400.  aPolysialylation is a post-translational modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), which in the adult brain promotes structural changes in regions of neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. Because a variety of plastic changes including neurogenesis have been suggested to be functionally involved in the pathophysiology of epilepsies, it is of specific interest to define the impact of the polysialic acid (PSA)-NCAM system on development of this disease and associated comorbidities. Therefore, we studied the impact of transient enzymatic depolysialylation of NCAM on the pathophysiology in an electrically induced rat post-status epilepticus (SE) model. Loss of PSA counteracted the SE-induced increase in neurogenesis in a significant manner. This effect of endoneuraminidase (endoN) treatment on hippocampal neurogenesis did not impact the subsequent development of spontaneous seizures. In contrast, transient lack of PSA during SE and in the early phase of epileptogenesis exhibited a cognition sparing effect as revealed in the Morris water maze paradigm. In conclusion, our data do not support a central role of neurogenesis in the development of a hyperexcitable epileptic network. However, in view of the cognition-sparing effect, the transient modulation of the PSA-NCAM system seems to allow beneficial long-term disease modification, which might be mediated by the partial normalization of neurogenesis. 3aepilepsy 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aBromodeoxyuridinexmetabolism 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aElectric Stimulationxadverse effects 2aElectroencephalography 2aExploratory Behaviorxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxadministration & dosage 2aHippocampusxpathology 2aMale 2aMaze Learning 2aNeural Cell Adhesion Molecules 2aNeuronsxphysiology 2aPhosphopyruvate Hydratasexmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSialic Acidsxmetabolism 2aStatus Epilepticusxdrug therapyxetiologyxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aTime Factors 0aepileptogenesis 0aneurogenesis 0apolysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule 0aspatial learning1 aFuest, Christina1 aMühlenhoff, Martina1 aGerardy-Schahn, Rita1 aPotschka, Heidrun0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2008 Apr., v. 105, no. 2 p.389-400dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05172.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080404b20080502c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02540naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009900165300001600264520126300280650002401543650001501567650001201582650001801594650001001612650001401622650001201636650001001648650001001658650001501668650001501683650001301698650001101711650001301722653001701735653003001752700002201782700002201804773013001826852000901956856008501965930003302050946001102083655001202094IND4404358720221122213400.0080412e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440435872DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-007-0712-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaulsen, Peter 10aBiogenic amines and polyamines in liver, kidney and spleen of roe deer and European brown hare  ap. 209-213.  aCadaverine (CAD), histamine (HIS), tyramine (TYR) and the polyamines putrescine (PUT), spermidine (SPD) and spermine (SPM) were determined in liver, kidney and spleen of hunted roe deer (n = 39) and European brown hare (n = 20) 3 and 6 h post mortem, respectively. Median concentrations (mg/kg fresh weight) of CAD and TYR were <5 mg/kg for organs of both species, whereas median HIS concentrations were higher in spleen (14.6 and 11.6 mg/kg for hare and roe deer, respectively) and lowest in liver. Maximum PUT concentration was 72.9 mg/kg, but median values were <=7.8 mg/kg. Mean SPD concentrations were 8.5, 10.7 and 42.9 mg/kg for liver, kidney and spleen of roe deer, and 37.2, 24.4 and 52.0 mg/kg for hare. Mean SPM concentrations were higher (94.6, 79.9, 102.2 and 111.2, 82.8, 91.1 mg/kg, respectively). SPM concentrations in the organs of the male roe deer were significantly higher than in those of females. SPM:SPD ratios (weight base) were in the order of 2:1 for spleen, and higher for liver and kidney. SPM and SPD were correlated significantly (r = 0.42-0.47). Although variations of polyamine concentrations are partially associated with species, organ, age and gender, the relative contribution of individual factors deserves further study. 3aCapreolus capreolus 3acadaverine 3afemales 3afood research 3ahares 3ahistamine 3akidneys 3aliver 3amales 3aputrescine 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3aspleen 3atyramine 0aInner organs 0aSpermine-spermidine ratio1 aDicakova, Zuzana 1 aBauer, Friedrich 0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2008 May, v. 227, no. 1 p.209-213dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-007-0712-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080412b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02591naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160100001400169245005600183300001800239500002400257520114200281650001401423650002101437650003401458650002901492650002301521650002201544650002001566650001701586650003001603650001901633650001101652651001001663653002601673653002201699700001401721700001601735700001301751700001601764700001801780700001501798773009101813852000901904856009101913930003302004945002502037946001102062655001202073IND4409193820221122213411.0080819e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440919382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2008.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aLiu, J.Q.10aCytotoxic sesquiterpenes from Ligularia platyglossa  ap. 2231-2236.  aIncludes references  aFour sesquiterpene lactones including an eremophilenolide dimer, named as biligulaplenolide, 1, 8β-hydroxy-1-oxo-(14α,15α eremophil-7(11),9(10)-dien-12,8α-olide, 2, 1-hydroxy-2-oxo-(14α,15α eremophil-1(10),7(11),8(9)-trien-12,8-olide, 3, 4α,8β,9α-trihydroxy- 5αΗ-7(11)-eudesmen-12,8α-olide, 4, along with two known ones, 10α-hydroxy-1-oxo-eremophil-7(11),8(9)-dien-12,8-olide, 5, and furanoeremophil-1(10)-ene-2,9-dione, 6, were isolated from the underground organs of Ligularia platyglossa (Franch.)

The spent residue also contained 7.7% starch and 5% bound fat. Particle size analysis showed a direct effect on the hydration properties of the fiber. The spent residue exhibited 3.3 g/g water holding capacity, 4.0 g/g water retention capacity and 4.47 ml/g swelling capacity. Scanning electron microscopy revealed spherical starch granules embedded within cell wall material, which upon differential sedimentation gave differently sized starch granules (5.8 μm). Upon defatting the spent residue showed typically a 'honey comb' structure, almost devoid of starch granules. Thus, the spent residue from cumin, not having much commercial value at present, can be a rich source of useful dietary fiber and can find food applications. It can be an effective way of utilizing industrial waste from the point of view of environmental pollution from the residues of spice processing industries. 3aprocessing residues 3acumin 3adietary fiber 3aparticle size 3aproximate composition 3afood analysis 3awaste utilization 3afood composition 3awater holding capacity 3astarch granules 3afiber content1 aSuma, P.F.1 aMahadevamma, S.1 aTharanathan, R.N.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 104, no. 3 p.1220-1225dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.01.0663Available from publisher's Web site.  a20080214b20080301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/01/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03169naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001500168245015200183300001800335500002400353500001500377520127000392650002501662650001501687650001901702650004301721650001301764650002201777650002501799650003601824650002301860650002501883650001401908650001101922651001301933653002501946653002501971653003001996653002202026653005102048653002502099653002202124653002602146700001302172700001502185700001502200700001502215700001402230700001602244700001602260773009802276852000902374856009102383930003302474945002502507946001102532655001202543IND4392125820221122192015.0070605s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439212582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.01.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aRuslay, S.10aCharacterization of the components present in the active fractions of health gingers (Curcuma xanthorrhiza and Zingiber zerumbet) by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS  ap. 1183-1191.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCurcuma xanthorrhiza and Zingiber zerumbet are two of the most commonly used ingredients in Indo-Malaysian traditional medicines, health supplements and tonics. Recently, a number of products derived from the aqueous extracts of these species have appeared in the market in the form of spray-dried powder packed in sachet or bottle. On-line high performance liquid chromatography, coupled with diode array detection and electrospray ion trap tandem mass spectroscopy (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MSn), was used to analyze the components in the antioxidant-active fractions from the rhizomes of these species. Three components were identified from C. xanthorrhiza, including bisdemethoxycurcumin (1), demethoxycurcumin (2) and curcumin (3). The active fraction from Z. zerumbet consisted of five components, including kaempferol 3-O-rhamnoside (4), compound 5 [kaempferol 3-O-(2"-O-acetyl)rhamnoside (5a) or kaempferol 3-O-(3"-O-acetyl)rhamnoside (5b)], kaempferol 3-O-(4"-O-acetyl)rhamnoside (6), kaempferol 3-O-(3",4"-O-diacetyl)rhamnoside (7) and kaempferol 3-O-(2",4"-O-diacetyl)rhamnoside (8). To confirm their identities, the components from Z. zerumbet were isolated conventionally and were analyzed by spectroscopic techniques as well as by comparison with literature data. 3atraditional medicine 3akaempferol 3aplant extracts 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aZingiber 3amass spectrometry 3aCurcuma zanthorrhiza 3achemical constituents of plants 3aactive ingredients 3aantioxidant activity 3adetection 3aginger 3aMalaysia 0achemical composition 0aCurcuma xanthorrhiza 0akaempferol 3-O-rhamnoside 0aZingiber zerumbet 0aelectrospray ion trap tandem mass spectroscopy 0abisdemethoxycurcumin 0ademethoxycurcumin 0adiode array detection1 aAbas, F.1 aShaari, K.1 aZainal, Z.1 aMaulidiani1 aSirat, H.1 aIsraf, D.A.1 aLajis, N.H.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 104, no. 3 p.1183-1191dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.01.0673Available from publisher's Web site.  a20080214b20080301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/01/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02359naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001500168245011200183300001900295500002400314520094600338650001001284650002201294650001201316650001601328650002601344650001201370650001901382650002301401650001101424650002001435650001601455650001001471650001201481653002501493653003601518700001501554700001501569700001301584773009901597852000901696856009101705930003301796945002501829946001101854655001201865IND4392124520221122191924.0070605s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439212452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ204 0aQ5041 aGokmen, V.10aEffects of dough formula and baking conditions on acrylamide and hydroxymethylfurfural formation in cookies  ap.  1136-1142.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of dough formula and baking conditions on the formations of acrylamide and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) were studied in a cookie model system. Increasing the sugar concentration in the dough formula increased acrylamide formation during baking at 205 °C for 11 min. The effect of sugar on acrylamide formation was more pronounced for glucose than for sucrose, expectedly. Addition of citric acid into dough formula comprising sucrose increased the susceptibility of acrylamide formation, while it decreased acrylamide formation in the dough formula comprising glucose. Decreasing the pH of dough formula increased the tendency to surface browning and the formation of hydroxymethylfurfural in cookies during baking. The results suggest that a cookie with acceptable texture and colour, but having less than 150 ng/g of acrylamide, can be manufactured by lowering the baking temperature and avoiding reducing sugars in the recipe. 3adough 3adough development 3arecipes 3aacrylamides 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3acookies 3abaking quality 3amodel food systems 3abaking 3areducing sugars 3afood safety 3acolor 3atexture 0aacrylamide formation 0ahydroxymethylfurfural formation1 aAcar, O.C.1 aKoksel, H.1 aAcar, J.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 104, no. 3 p. 1136-1142dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.01.0083Available from publisher's Web site.  a20080214b20080301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/01/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02522naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168072000900177100001500186245012500201300001800326500002400344520097800368650003101346650002401377650001601401650002401417650001201441650001801453650002301471650001701494650001601511650002101527650002501548650002701573650002101600650001801621650002101639700001601660700001601676700001501692700001801707773009801725852000901823856009101832930003301923945002501956946001101981655001201992IND4392124720221122192037.0070605s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439212472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aM001 0aQ116 0aQ5061 aChen, Y.C.10aPhysicochemical changes in ω - 3-enhanced farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) muscle during refrigerated storage  ap. 1143-1152.  aIncludes references  aPhysicochemical changes of ω - 3-enhanced farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fillets developed by dietary modification with flaxseed oil and α-tocopheryl acetate (α-TA) were determined during storage at 2 °C. Trout were fed experimental diets for 120 days followed by processing to obtain boneless skinless fillets. The dietary modification increased concentration of total ω - 3 fatty acids in the fillets, which enhanced chances for lipid oxidation during storage. The fillets were vacuum or non-vacuum packed and stored at 2 °C for 10 or 12 days. Dietary α-TA resulted in higher (P < 0.05) concentration of α-tocopherol in fillets during storage; however, it did not retard (P > 0.05) lipid oxidation. Vacuum packaging resulted in much lower (P < 0.05) TBARS and higher (P < 0.05) retention of α-tocopherol during storage than non-vacuum packaging.

Between 95% and 108% of the added naringinase was actively entrapped in PVA cryogel, depending on the conditions of immobilization used. The optimal conditions were: 8% (w/v) PVA at pH 7 and 1.6-3.7 U ml-1 of enzyme load. The pH/activity profiles revealed no change in terms of shape or optimum pH (4.5) upon immobilization of naringinase. However, the optimum temperature was shifted from 60 °C to 70 °C and the activation energy of reaction, Ea, was decreased from 8.09 kJ mol-1 to 6.36 kJ mol-1 by immobilization. The entrapped naringinase could be reused through six cycles (runs of 24 h at 20 °C), retaining 36% efficacy for the hydrolysis of naringin in simulated juice. 3anaringin 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aAspergillus niger 3agels 3abitterness 3acitrus fruits 3afruit juices 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme activity 3apH 3atemperature 3astorage quality 3amodel food systems 3afood processing 3anaringinase 0aAspergillus niger CECT 2088 0apoly(vinyl alcohol) cryogels1 aMeza, V.1 aOrtega, N.1 aPerez-Mateos, M.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 104, no. 3 p.1177-1182dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.01.0333Available from publisher's Web site.  a20080214b20080301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/01/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03066naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245013100167300001400298520157900312650002001891650001401911650001501925650002401940650001101964650001701975650001601992650001602008650000902024650001002033650001202043650001502055650001202070650001202082650001002094650001302104650001502117650001102132650001102143650001702154653002102171653002802192700001602220700001902236700001702255773011902272852000902391856009202400930003302492946001102525655001202536IND4401591920221122192036.0080217e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440159192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2494.2007.00616.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHessle, A.10aEffect of breed of cattle and season on diet selection and defoliation of competitive plant species in semi-natural grasslands  ap. 86-93.  aTo maintain biodiversity in semi-natural grasslands, the choice of breed of livestock and season of grazing can be important. The objective was to determine the effects of breed and season on the composition of plant fragments in the faeces of cattle grazing a heterogeneous semi-natural grassland. Twelve heifers of the traditional Swedish Väneko breed (live weight 309 kg) and twelve heifers of the Charolais breed (live weight 431 kg) were allocated to three pastures per breed. Faeces samples were collected in spring, summer and autumn for micro-histological examination of plant fragments. On the same occasion, defoliation of four competitive plant species was recorded. Faecal plant fragments mainly consisted of grasses but also herbs, whereas Cyperaceae, despite their abundance on the pastures, only composed a small proportion of fragments. Season affected the composition of plant fragments in the faeces, with a higher proportion of Cyperaceae and herbs in spring than later in the grazing period (P < 0·001), and the heifers ingesting more grasses and woody plants in autumn. In spite of a clear difference in live weight between the two breeds, no effects of breed on the composition of plant fragments in faeces were observed, although Väneko heifers defoliated more Filipendula ulmaria in spring than the Charolais heifers (P < 0·01). In addition, defoliation of Alnus glutinosa increased later in the grazing period (P < 0·05), especially for the Väneko heifers, indicating control of pernicious brushwood by grazing may be more effective in autumn. 3aAlnus glutinosa 3aCharolais 3aCyperaceae 3aFilipendula ulmaria 3aautumn 3abiodiversity 3abody weight 3adefoliation 3adiet 3afeces 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3aheifers 3aherbs 3apastures 3ashrublands 3aspring 3asummer 3awoody plants 0adiet composition 0asemi-natural grasslands1 aWissman, J.1 aBertilsson, J.1 aBurstedt, E.0 tGrass and forage science.g2008 Mar., v. 63, no. 1 p.86-93dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0142-52427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2494.2007.00616.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080218b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01756naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001800159245007500177300001800252500002400270520050000294650002300794650001400817650001900831650003600850650000700886650003600893650002200929650001800951650001500969650002300984653001801007653002701025700001501052773009801067852000901165856009101174930003301265945002501298946001101323655001201334IND4392124120221122192008.0070605s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439212412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aQuijano, C.E.10aVolatile compounds of copoazú (Theobroma grandiflorum Schumann) fruit  ap. 1123-1126.  aIncludes references  aVolatile compounds were isolated from copoazú (Theobroma grandiflorum Schumann) fruit by liquid-liquid extraction at two different pH values of 3.3 (natural) and 7.

The coding sequences of the first 0 (Luc0), 6 (Luc6), 7 (Luc7), 8 (Luc8), 9 (Luc9), 10 (Luc10) and 20 (Luc20) amino acids of the N-terminus were deleted and inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pBV220. The results showed that the enzymes were completely inactivated when the first eight or more N-terminal amino acids were removed. The recombinant Luc0 and mutants Luc6 and Luc7 were purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation and liquid chromatography for determination of their activity and conformational changes. The activity assay showed that removal of the first six amino acids resulted in 29% loss of enzymatic activity while removal of the first seven amino acids resulted in nearly complete inactivation (with remaining activity <0.5% of the original activity). Circular dichroism spectra showed no significant secondary structure changes. But the fluorescence emission maximum red-shift indicated some conformational changes. Luc6 and Luc7 were more sensitive to guanidine unfolding than Luc0. The present result indicated the significant role of Ile7 to the luciferase stability. 3aamino acids 3aammonium sulfate 3acell biology 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3aguanidines 3aliquid chromatography 3aluciferase 3amutants 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxenzymology. 2aLeucinexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLuciferasesxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMutagenesis 2aProtein Conformation 2aProtein Folding 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship1 aYang, J.1 aHuang, W.1 aHe, L.1 aYu, J.T.1 aLin, Q.S.1 aLi, W.1 aZhou, H.M.0 tInternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2002 Aug., v. 34, no. 8 p.983-991x1357-27257nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle03093naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100003400171245009300205300001800298520154100316650001501857650001201872650002001884650006401904650003701968650002902005650004902034650005202083650008002135650000902215653006602224653001002290653001602300653001602316700002902332700002602361773012502387852000902512856009202521930003302613946001302646655001202659IND4407900520221122154423.0080718e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440790052DNAL7 a184663192pmid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05458.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanta-Catalina, Marta Olivera10aLovastatin effect in rat neuroblasts of the CNS: inhibition of cap-dependent translation  ap. 1078-1091.  aMevalonate biosynthesis pathway is important in cell growth and survival and its blockade by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, arrest brain neuroblasts growth and induce apoptosis. Translation is among the main biochemical mechanisms that controls gene expression and therefore cell growth or apoptosis. In the CNS, translation regulates synaptic plasticity. Thus, our aim was to investigate the effect of lovastatin in protein translation in rat neuroblasts of the CNS and the biochemical pathways involved. Lovastatin treatment in rat brain neuroblasts causes a significant time- and concentration-inhibition of protein synthesis, which is partially mediated by phosphatydilinositol 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway inhibition. Lovastatin treatment decreases the phosphorylation state of mTOR substrates, p70S6K and eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding protein 1 and simultaneously increases eIF4E-binding protein 1 in a time-dependent manner. Concomitantly, lovastatin causes a decrease in eIF4G cellular amount, which is partially mediated by caspase(s) activity excluding caspase 3. These biochemical pathways affected by lovastatin might explain the protein translation inhibition observed in neuroblasts. Cycloheximide treatment, which blocked protein synthesis, does not induce neuroblasts apoptosis. Therefore, we suggest that lovastatin-induced protein synthesis inhibition might not contribute to the concomitant neuroblasts apoptosis previously observed. 3alovastatin 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aCentral Nervous Systemxcytologyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aLovastatinxpharmacology 2aNeuronsxcytologyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aProtein Biosynthesisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aRNA Cap-Binding Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aRats 0aeukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 0aeIF4G 0aneuroblasts 0atranslation1 aGarcia-Marin, Luis Jesus1 aBragado, María Julia0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2008 Aug., v. 106, no. 3 p.1078-1091dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05458.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080718b20080801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03310naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245010900178300001600287520132600303650000801629650002201637650001701659650001701676650001001693650002401703650002001727650001201747650001801759650000901777650002701786650001501813650002201828650001401850650001501864650001801879650002301897650002501920650001801945650002701963650002701990650002802017650002102045650002602066650004602092650002702138650001202165653002502177653004102202653003302243653001202276700001302288700001402301700001702315700002002332700001502352700001802367773010102385852000902486856008502495930003302580946001102613655001202624IND4409355420221122154440.0080822e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440935542DNAL7 a179788802pmid7 a10.1007/s10709-007-9222-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Gang 10aSimple sequence repeat analyses of interspecific hybrids and MAALs of Oryza officinalis and Oryza sativa  ap. 169-180.  aWild rice is a valuable resource for the genetic improvement of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L., AA genome). Molecular markers are important tools for monitoring gene introgression from wild rice into cultivated rice. In this study, Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to analyze interspecific hybrids of O. sativa-O. officinalis (CC genome), the backcrossing progenies and the parent plants. Results showed that most of the SSR primers (335 out of 396, 84.6%) developed in cultivated rice successfully amplified products from DNA samples of wild rice O. officinalis. The polymorphism ratio of SSR bands between O. sativa and O. officinalis was as high as 93.9%, indicating differences between the two species with respect to SSRs. When the SSR markers were applied in the interspecific hybrids, only a portion of SSR primers amplified O. officinalis-specific bands in the F₁ hybrid (52.5%), BC₁ (52.5%), and MAALs (37.0%); a number of the bands disappeared. Of the 124 SSR loci that detected officinalis-specific bands in MAAL plants, 96 (77.4%) showed synteny between the A and C-genomes, and 20 (16.1%) showed duplication in the C-genome. Sequencing analysis revealed that indels, substitution and duplication contribute to the diversity of SSR loci between the genomes of O. sativa and O. officinalis. 3aDNA 3aOryza officinalis 3aOryza sativa 3abackcrossing 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic markers 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amonitoring 3asequence analysis 3awild rice 2aAneuploidy 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosomes, Plant 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGenome, Plant 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSynteny 0aInterspecific hybrid 0aMonosomic alien addition line (MAAL) 0aSimple sequence repeat (SSR) 0aSynteny1 aHu, Wei 1 aQin, Rui 1 aJin, Huajun 1 aTan, Guangxuan 1 aZhu, Lili 1 aHe, Guangcun 0 tGenetica.g2008 Oct., v. 134, no. 2 p.169-180dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0016-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-007-9222-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01955naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245004500148300001800193520058500211650001800796650002400814650001300838650001100851650001100862650001200873650002000885650001500905650001200920650002400932650002800956650003300984650001301017650001601030650001101046650001101057650004001068650002501108650002801133650003601161650002201197650003601219700001501255773011301270852000901383930003301392945001301425946001101438655001201449IND2123581220221122122622.0980623e199711  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212358122DNAL7 a94518232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConsidine, R.V.10aLeptin and the regulation of body weight  ap. 1255-1272.  aLeptin has received considerable attention as a newly recognized metabolic hormone and for its potential for therapeutic use in the treatment of human obesity.

In view of the importance of the enzyme activity, the interaction and binding affinities to substrates and metal ions have been studied. We determined the effect of Zinc ion (Zn(2+)) on the (Na(+),K(+))ATPase activity present in both conducting (non-innervated) and post-synaptic (innervated) membranes of electrocyte from Electrophorus electricus (L.). Zn(2+) is involved in many biological functions and is present in pre-synaptic nerve terminals. This metal, which has affinity for thiol groups, acted as a potent competitive inhibitor of (Na(+),K(+))ATPase of both membrane fractions, which were obtained by differential centrifugation of the E. electricus main electric organ homogenate. We tried to recover the enzyme activity using dithiothreitol, a reducing agent. Kinetic analysis showed that dithiothreitol acted as a non-essential non-competitive activator of (Na(+),K(+))ATPase from both membrane fractions and was able to revert the Zn(2+) inhibition at mM concentrations. In the presence of dithiothreitol, this metal behaved as a competitive inhibitor of (Na(+),K(+))ATPase in the non-innervated membrane fractions and presented a non-competitive inhibition of (Na(+),K(+))ATPase in innervated membrane fractions. This difference may be attributed to formation of a Zn-dithiothreitol complex, as well as the involvement of other binding sites for both agents. The consequences of the enzyme inhibition by Zn(2+) may be considered in regard to its neurotoxic effects. 3aElectrophorus electricus 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abinding capacity 3abinding sites 3acell biology 3acentrifugation 3adithiothreitol 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3amagnesium 3ametal ions 3anerve tissue 3aneurotoxicity 3areducing agents 3athiols 3azinc 2aAnimals 2aCell Fractionation 2aChelating Agentsxpharmacology 2aDithiothreitolxpharmacology 2aEdetic Acidxpharmacology 2aElectric Organxcytologyxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aElectrophorusxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aSodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aZincxpharmacology1 aPedrenho, A.R.1 aHasson-Voloch, A.0 tInternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2002 May, v. 34, no. 5 p.516-524x1357-27257nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02981naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100001600174245011200190300001800302500002400320500001500344520114400359650001701503650001701520650003001537650001801567650002301585650002001608650002001628650001501648650002701663650001101690650001901701650001401720650002101734650001601755650002301771650002701794650002601821650004701847650004201894650003101936650002601967653001201993700001602005700002102021700001702042773016302059852000902222856007702231930003302308945002502341946001302366655001202379IND4409197420221122055832.0080819e20080813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440919742DNAL7 a185980372pmid7 a10.1021/jf80041782doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aF6001 aCimmino, A.10aProduction of Phytotoxins by Phoma exigua var. exigua, a Potential Mycoherbicide against Perennial Thistles  ap. 6304-6309.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe potential of the different Phoma exigua var. exigua strains for the biocontrol of the perennial weeds Sonchus arvensis and Cirsium arvense, occurring throughout temperate regions of the world, has been evaluated in previous studies. The majority of the above strains produced ascosonchine, a newly discovered enol tautomer of 4- pyridylpyruvic acid, whereas strains C-177 and S-9, though virulent to weeds, did not produce the above metabolite. In this study, it was demonstrated that the above two strains, grown in liquid and solid cultures, produced p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, cytochalasins B, F, Z2 and Z3, and deoxaphomin. When assayed on the leaves of both C. arvense and S. arvensis, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde was inactive, whereas deoxaphomin demonstrated the highest level of toxicity on leaves of S. arvensis. Cytochalasin Z2 appeared to be the less toxic cytochalasan on both plants according to the lack of the secondary hydroxyl group on C-7. Production of cytochalasins by P. exigua var. exigua strains isolated from C. arvense and S. arvensis is discussed in relation to chemotaxonomy and the biocontrol potential of the fungus. 3aPhoma exigua 3aweed control 3abiological control agents 3achemotaxonomy 3astrain differences 3abroadleaf weeds 3aCirsium arvense 3amycotoxins 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aleaves 3amycoherbicides 3avirulence 3aSonchus arvensis 3ametabolites 3abiological control 2aAscomycotaxmetabolism 2aCirsiumxdrug effects 2aCytochalasinsxbiosynthesisxpharmacology. 2aHerbicidesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effects 2aSonchusxdrug effects 0astrains1 aAndolfi, A.1 aBerestetskiy, A.1 aEvidente, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 Aug. 13, v. 56, no. 15 p.6304-6309dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf80041783Available from publisher's Web site  a20090520b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/29  aOther US 7aarticle03177naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002000167245007800187300001600265500002400281500001500305520176800320650002202088650002502110650002102135650002902156650001302185650001602198650001002214650002202224651001802246653001802264653001502282653002402297653002402321653001702345653002402362700001802386700001802404773009302422852000902515856009002524930003302614945002502647946001102672655001202683IND4392009920221122032903.0070531e20070515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439200992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aOstendorf, D.W.10aUnconfined aquifer response to infiltration basins and shallow pump tests  ap. 132-144.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe measure and model the unsteady, axisymmetric response of an unconfined aquifer to delayed, arbitrary recharge.

A proteinaceous inhibitor of cowpea weevil digestive enzymes, PpAI, was purified from white sucupira seeds (Pterodon pubescens) and biochemically characterized in this study. Proteins were extracted from seeds and precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 100% saturation. This fraction was applied onto a Red-sepharose CL-6B column, and the retained peak showed 70% inhibitory activity toward larval C. maculatus digestive -amylases. The retained peak was then purified using an analytical reversed-phase HPLC column. Purified PpAI showed 65% inhibitory activity against larval C. maculatus enzymes. Enzymatic assays also showed that the purified P. pubescens inhibitor was unable to reduce the activity of mammalian α-amylases, suggesting specificity toward insect enzymes. Moreover, artificial seeds containing PpAI were able to reduce larval weight by 36% and cause 55% mortality. Mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE analyses indicated that PpAI showed a molecular mass of approximately 5.0 kDa. This α-amylase inhibitor, coming from a native Cerrado plant, could be used to construct a genetically engineered cowpea with enhanced resistance against weevil pests. 3ain vivo studies 3ainsect pests 3aVigna 3aseeds 3ainsect biochemistry 3acowpeas 3alarvae 3aplant proteins 3aplant-incorporated protectants 3aPterodon 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3ain vitro studies 3achemical constituents of plants 3ainsect control 3aenzyme inhibition 3aalpha-amylase 3amortality 3abiological control 3aBrazil 0aPterodon pubescens 0aVigna ungiculata 0asucupira 0ainhibitors 0adigestive enzymes1 aCasado-Filho, E.L.1 aCorrea, A.S.R.1 aFarias, L.R.1 aBloch, C.

These solutions give the aquifer stage and flow rate, the flow exchange rate at the stream-aquifer interface and the exchanged water volumes (bank storage/release). The solutions are analytical, when the flow-inducing stream stage variations are common functions; otherwise, the convolution integral is evaluated numerically. Responses are compared for aquifers on positive, negative and zero base slopes to a wave-like change in the stage of the stream. Analytical and numerical convolution-derived solutions are used to model the interaction of Cedar River and its adjacent unconfined aquifer near Cedar Rapids, Iowa. In the model, the aquifer base is taken to be horizontal or inclined and the streambed clogged by a low-conductivity sediment layer; the model is verified against data not used in the calibration and is found to perform very well. 3asimulation models 3aequations 3astreams 3aaquifers 3awatershed hydrology 3ahydrologic models 3aIowa 0amathematical models 0astream-aquifer interface 0abank storage 0aBoussinesq equation 0ahydrology 0asloping aquifers1 aAkylas, E.1 aMazi, K.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2007 May 15, v. 338, no. 1-2 p.73-84dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.02.0303Available from publisher's Web site.  a20090129b20090206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/01/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02985naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124072000900142100001700151245011600168300001600284500002400300500001500324520157600339650000801915650002301923650001001946650001501956650001701971650001601988650002802004650001102032653001602043653002802059700001702087700002002104700001502124700001602139700001602155773011502171852000902286856008202295856006902377930003302446945002502479946001102504655001202515IND4392032320221122032914.0070601e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439203232DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ijo.08033952doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aFinley, C.E.10aRetention rates and weight loss in a commercial weight loss program [Erratum: 2007 Feb., v. 31, no. 2, p. 394.]  ap. 292-298.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective: To evaluate and describe retention rates and weight loss in clients participating in a commercial weight loss program. Subjects: A total of 60 164 men and women ages 18-79 years who enrolled in the Jenny Craig Platinum program between May 2001 and May 2002. Methods: Retention rates, mean weight loss and percent weight loss were calculated on a weekly basis for the 52-week period following initial enrollment in the weight loss program. Clients were categorized based on final week of participation in the program (weeks 1-4, weeks 5-13, weeks 14-26, weeks 27-39 and weeks 40-52) and weight loss was calculated at final week. A subgroup of clients was identified based on attendance through 13, 26 and 52 weeks. Mean and percent weight loss was calculated for these subgroups of clients. Results: Of the 60 164 men and women who enrolled in the weight loss program, 73% were retained in the program after 4 weeks, 42% at 13 weeks, 22% at 26 weeks and 6.6% at 52 weeks. Clients who dropped out of the program during the first 4 weeks lost 1.1+/-1.6% (mean+/-s.d.) of their initial body weight, whereas clients who dropped out between 40 and 52 weeks lost 12.0+/-7.2%. Clients in the 13-week, 26-week and 52-week cohorts lost 8.3+/-3.3, 12.6+/-5.1 and 15.6+/-7.5% of their initial body weight, respectively. Conclusion: Weight loss was greater among clients who were retained in the program longer. The findings from this study suggest that a commercial weight loss program can be an effective weight loss tool for individuals who remain active in the program. 3amen 3apatient compliance 3awomen 3aoverweight 3adiet therapy 3aweight loss 3aweight control programs 3aadults 0abody weight 0aprogram retention rates1 aBarlow, C.E.1 aGreenway,  F.L.1 aRock, C.L.1 aRolls, B.J.1 aBlair, S.N.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2007 Feb., v. 31, no. 2 p.292-298dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.08033953Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20080201b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02623naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001700167245004000184300001400224500002400238500001500262520126700277650002201544650001601566650002901582650001501611650000901626650002401635650001101659650002201670651001801692651001101710653002401721653003101745653002101776653002101797653001901818700001501837700001801852773009101870852000901961856009001970930003302060945002502093946001102118655001202129IND4392009220221122032824.0070531e20070515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439200922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aCrobeddu, E.10aImproved rational hydrograph method  ap. 63-72.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis paper presents an improved rational hydrograph method to compute the runoff at the outlet of a small urban catchment. The new formulation, based on the linear system theory, explicitly considers the contributions of pervious and impervious areas, the time variability of rainfall, the initial abstraction on impervious areas and the infiltration on pervious areas. Moreover, the rational method formula appears to be a special case of the proposed rational hydrograph method. A sensitivity analysis conducted on the improved rational hydrograph method has emphasized the most influent parameters. A sequential procedure is proposed to calibrate parameters of the improved rational hydrograph method on the basis of appropriate storm events. The improved rational hydrograph method was applied to 41 rainfall events gauged in 7 different North American and European urban catchments. Runoff computed with the improved rational hydrograph method was compared to measured runoff, as well as to the runoff derived from the nonlinear reservoir model. A good agreement was achieved between simulated and observed runoff hydrographs. Moreover, runoff hydrographs derived with the proposed method are equivalent to those computed with the nonlinear reservoir model. 3asimulation models 3aurban areas 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3awatersheds 3arain 3awatershed hydrology 3arunoff 3ahydrologic models 3aNorth America 3aEurope 0amathematical models 0arational hydrograph method 0aurban watersheds 0aimpervious areas 0apervious areas1 aBennis, S.1 aRhouzlane, S.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2007 May 15, v. 338, no. 1-2 p.63-72dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.02.0203Available from publisher's Web site.  a20090129b20090206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/01/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03492naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001400155245014200169300001800311500002400329500001500353520158000368650003101948650001701979650002401996650001702020650002602037650001702063650001602080650002302096650002402119650002102143650001702164650002502181650001902206650002102225650003602246650002902282650001502311650001602326653001502342653002702357700001402384700001502398700002002413700001402433700001602447700001402463700002502477700001602502700001602518773016202534852000902696856007802705930003302783945002502816946001302841655001202854IND4392010220221122032837.0070531e20070530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439201022DNAL7 a10.1021/jf06331852doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aTerra, X.10aGrape-Seed Procyanidins Act as Antiinflammatory Agents in Endotoxin-Stimulated RAW 264.7 Macrophages by Inhibiting NFkB Signaling Pathway  ap. 4357-4365.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aProcyanindin extract (PE) is a mixture of polyphenols, mainly procyanidins, obtained from grape seed with putative antiinflammatory activity. We evaluated the PE effect on RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide plus interferon-γ that show a rapid enhanced production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO). Our results demonstrated that PE significantly inhibited the overproduction of NO, dose and time dependently. PE caused a marked inhibition of PGE2 synthesis when administered during activation. Moreover, PE pretreatment diminished iNOS mRNA and protein amount dose dependently (10-65 microgram/mL). PE (65 microgram/mL) pretreatment inhibited NF(kappa)B (p65) translocation to nucleus by nearly 40%. Trimeric and longer oligomeric-rich procyanidin fractions from PE (5-30 microgram/mL) inhibited iNOS expression but not the monomeric forms catechin and epicatechin. Thus, we show that the degree of polymerization is important in determining procyanidin effects. PE was considerably a more effective inhibitor of NO biosynthesis (IC50 = 50 microgram/mL) in comparison to other antiinflammatories, such as aspirin (3 mM), indomethacin (20 micromolar), and dexamethasone (9 nM). In conclusion, PE modulates inflammatory response in activated macrophages by the inhibition of NO and PGE2 production, suppression of iNOS expression, and NFkB translocation. These results demonstrate an immunomodulatory role of grape seed procyanidins and thus a potential health-benefit in inflammatory conditions that exert an overproduction of NO and PGE2. 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abiosynthesis 3alipopolysaccharides 3aprocyanidins 3amacrophage activation 3anitric oxide 3amacrophages 3agrape seed extract 3asignal transduction 3aimmunomodulators 3ainflammation 3abiochemical pathways 3aprostaglandins 3ain vitro studies 3achemical constituents of plants 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3aendotoxins 3ainterferons 0ainhibitors 0aNfkB signaling pathway1 aValls, J.1 aVitrac, X.1 aMerrillon, J.M.1 aArola, L.1 aArdevol, A.1 aBlade, C.1 aFernandez-Larrea, J.1 aPujadas, G.1 aSalvado, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 May 30, v. 55, no. 11 p.4357-4365dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf06331853Available from publisher's Web site.  a20090211b20090301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/01/10  aOther US 7aarticle04046naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161072000900170100002100179245013600200300001600336500002400352500001500376520186700391650002202258650000802280650002002288650001602308650001002324650002202334650001802356650001802374650003202392650002302424650001202447650002002459650002202479650001102501650002302512650001002535650001802545650003002563650002002593650002802613650001102641650002702652650001102679650002302690650002602713650000902739650001902748653001702767653001502784653001902799653001302818700001702831700001802848700001702866700001602883700003002899700001502929773011502944852000903059856008203068856006903150930003303219945002503252946001103277655001203288IND4392031220221122032844.0070601e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439203122DNAL7 a167703292pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ijo.08034212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX380 0aT3001 aStraczkowski, M.10aIncreased serum interleukin-18 concentration is associated with hypoadiponectinemia in obesity, independently of insulin resistance  ap. 221-225.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective: Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a cytokine with proinflammatory and proatherogenic properties, which might be associated with the development of insulin resistance. In contrast, adiponectin, a protein secreted by adipose tissue, might exert insulin-sensitizing and antiatherogenic effects. The aim of the present study was to analyze the association between serum IL-18 and adiponectin in lean and obese subjects, in relation to insulin resistance. Design: Cross-sectional study. Subjects: One hundred and thirty individuals, 62 lean (body mass index (BMI)<25 kg/m2, 30 men and 32 women) and 68 with overweight or obesity (BMI>25 kg/m2, 24 men and 44 women), with normal glucose tolerance and without concomitant diseases. Measurements: Oral glucose tolerance test, euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, serum concentrations of IL-18, IL-6, soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors and adiponectin. Results: Obese subjects had lower insulin sensitivity (M value, P=0.00029) and serum adiponectin (P=0.01) and higher levels of serum IL-18 (P=0.00055). Circulating IL-18 was negatively related to adiponectin (r=-0.31, P=0.00027) and insulin sensitivity (r=-0.33, P=0.00012). Subgroup analysis revealed that these associations were present in the obese (adiponectin, r=-0.38, P=0.0014; M, r=-0.29, P=0.016), but not in lean individuals (r=-0.17, P=0.18 and r=-0.20, P=0.12, respectively). Association of IL-18 with adiponectin remained significant after adjustment for other estimated parameters, including insulin sensitivity. Also, relationship between IL-18 and insulin sensitivity was independent of other estimated parameters. Conclusion: Serum IL-18 is inversely related to serum adiponectin, independently of insulin resistance. The relationships of IL-18 with adiponectin and insulin sensitivity are influenced by the presence of overweight/obesity. 3ahormone secretion 3amen 3ablood chemistry 3aadiponectin 3awomen 3ahormone receptors 3ainterleukin-6 3aatherogenesis 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3ainsulin resistance 3aobesity 3abody mass index 3aglucose tolerance 3aadults 2aAdiponectinxblood 2aAdult 2aAnthropometry 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHumans 2aInsulin Resistance 2aInterleukin-18xblood 2aMale 2aObesityxblood 0ainterleukins 0aoverweight 0ainterleukin-18 0ahormones1 aKowalska, I.1 aNikolajuk, A.1 aOtziomek, E.1 aAdamska, A.1 aKarolczuk-Zarachowicz, M.1 aGorska, M.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2007 Feb., v. 31, no. 2 p.221-225dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.08034213Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20080201b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/12  aNon-US 7aarticle04248naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161100002500170245017100195300001600366500002400382500001500406520190700421650002102328650001202349650001702361650000802378650001002386650000802396650002302404650002402427650001102451650001802462650002402480650001402504650001302518650001002531650001602541650000902557650002202566650002002588650001902608650001102627650001102638650006202649650000902711650001602720650002302736650003102759650001602790650007002806650004002876650002002916651001802936653003902954653001602993653001603009653001103025700001603036700001403052700001903066700002003085700001703105773011503122852000903237856008203246856006903328930003303397945002503430946001103455655001203466IND4392029520221122032851.0070601e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439202952DNAL7 a169532562pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ijo.08034542doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aMaurovich-Horvat, P.10aComparison of anthropometric, area- and volume-based assessment of abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue volumes using multi-detector computed tomography  ap. 500-506.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPurpose: Cross-sectional imaging may enable accurate localization and quantification of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue. The reproducibility of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT)-based volumetric quantification of abdominal adipose tissue and the ability to depict age- and gender-related characteristics of adipose tissue deposition have not been reported. Methods: We evaluated a random subset of 100 Caucasian subjects (age range: 37-83 years; 49% women) of the Framingham Heart Study offspring cohort who underwent MDCT scanning. Two readers measured subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue volumes (SAV and VAV; cm3) and areas (SAA and VAA; cm2) as well as abdominal sagital diameter (SD) and waist circumference (WC). Results: Inter-reader reproducibility was excellent (relative difference: -0.34+/-0.52% for SAV and 0.59+/-0.93% for VAV, intra-class correlation (ICC)=0.99 each). The mean SAA/VAA ratio was significantly different from the mean SAV/VAV ratio (2.0+/-1.2 vs 1.7+/-0.9; P<0.001). The ratio of SAV/VAV was only weakly inversely associated with SD (ICC=-0.32, P=0.01) and not significantly associated with WC (ICC=-0.14, P=0.14) or body mass index (ICC=-0.17, P=0.09). The mean SAV/VAV ratio was significantly different between participants <60 vs >60 years (1.9+/-1.0 vs 1.5+/-0.7; P<0.001) and between men and women (1.2+/-0.5 vs 2.2+/-0.9; P<0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that MDCT-based volumetric quantification of abdominal adipose tissue is highly reproducible. In addition, our results suggest that volumetric measurements can depict age- and gender-related differences of visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue deposition. Further research is warranted to assess whether volumetric measurements may substantially improve the predictive value of obesity measures for insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus and other diseases. 3asubcutaneous fat 3aelderly 3avisceral fat 3amen 3awomen 3aage 3agender differences 3awaist circumference 3aWhites 3aabdominal fat 3acomputed tomography 3aprecision 3aaccuracy 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aBody Mass Index 2aCohort Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIntra-Abdominal Fatxanatomy & histologyxultrastructure. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObserver Variation 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSex Factors 2aSubcutaneous Fat, Abdominalxanatomy & histologyxultrastructure. 2aTomography, X-Ray Computedxmethods 2aWaist-Hip Ratio 3aMassachusetts 0amulti-detector computed tomography 0amethodology 0anew methods 0aadults1 aMassaro, J.1 aFox, C.S.1 aMoselewski, F.1 aO'Donnell, C.J.1 aHoffmann, U.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2007 Mar., v. 31, no. 3 p.500-506dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.08034543Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20080201b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03910naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245011800131300001600249500002400265520267000289650002202959650001602981650001702997650001303014650001303027650001403040650001403054650001203068650001603080650001303096650001403109650001803123650001103141650002003152650002103172650001903193650000903212650001303221650001103234650001303245700001903258773017803277852000903455655001203464IND4461499620221122005738.0110817s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446149962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyoung Seok10aEffect of Selenium Fertilization and Methyl Jasmonate Treatment on Glucosinolate Accumulation in Broccoli Florets  ap. 239-246.  aIncludes references  aBroccoli (Brassica oleracea ssp. italica) is a rich source of glucosinolates (GSs), phytochemicals that are hydrolyzed into isothiocyanates with known human anticarcinogenic bioactivity. Increasing dietary intake of the element selenium (Se) can also reduce the risk of cancer. Previous research reported that Se fertilization at high concentrations reduces the concentration of GSs in brassicaceous plants. This research was conducted to determine the effect of Se fertilization on accumulation of different types of GSs in broccoli floret tissues in five genotypes. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA), an elicitor known to stimulate biosynthesis of indolyl GSs, was used to analyze changes in biosynthetic capability of indolyl GSs in broccoli floret tissue under Se-enriched conditions. Five broccoli genotypes were subjected to root fertilization with low and high levels of Na2SeO4 solutions (0.17 and 5.2 mM), MeJA sprays to aerial portions of the plants (250 micromolar), and the combined treatment of 5.2 mM Se with 250 micromolar MeJA, respectively. The effect of Se fertilization on GS accumulation varied among genotypes and the level of Se fertilization. Variation in the level of Se fertilization resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in glucoraphanin concentrations with no significant effect on indolyl GS accumulation in broccoli florets across the five genotypes. MeJA treatment increased indolyl and aromatic GS accumulation in floret tissues. MeJA-mediated increases in these GSs were inhibited in the high Se fertilization treatment, but the increase in neoglucobrassicin concentrations was less affected than other GSs in florets across the five genotypes. An experiment conducted with 6-week-old broccoli plants under the high Se treatment demonstrated greater accumulation of Se with depressed accumulation of sulfur and complete inhibition of MeJA-mediated indolyl GS accumulation compared with those changes in florets of mature broccoli plants. These results suggest that GS accumulation under Se fertilization may be influenced by not only the level of Se fertilization, but also the differences in sizes of available pools of resources (sulfur and sulfur-containing amino acids) required for GS biosynthesis and accumulation in broccoli plants. Partitioning of the variance indicated that the existence of substantial variability in GS concentrations was primarily attributed to differences in genotype response across different treatments. Results suggest that cultivar selection and breeding of broccoli can be used to develop broccoli germplasm with enhanced capacity for Se uptake and stability of GS biosynthesis with varying Se fertilization. 3aBrassica oleracea 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3abreeding 3abroccoli 3acultivars 3aelicitors 3aflorets 3afood intake 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3aglucoraphanin 3ahumans 3aisothiocyanates 3amethyl jasmonate 3aphytochemicals 3arisk 3aselenium 3asulfur 3avariance1 aJuvik, John A.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2011 July, v. 136, no. 4 p.239-246dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03647naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161072000900170100001800179245012000197300001600317500002400333500001500357520160500372650001301977650001001990650001102000650001502011650002302026650001202049650001602061650001002077650000902087650002002096650002802116650003002144650001102174650001202185650001102197650001802208650002502226650001602251650004602267650002802313650002202341650002802363651001502391653001602406653002202422653001802444700001902462700002402481700001702505700001902522700001702541700001702558700001802575773011502593852000902708856008202717856006902799930003302868945002502901946001102926655001202937IND4392028920221122005728.0070601e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439202892DNAL7 a169091302pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ijo.08034382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aLittman, A.J.10aSleep, ghrelin, leptin and changes in body weight during a 1-year moderate-intensity physical activity intervention  ap. 466-475.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective: To investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships among exercise, sleep, ghrelin and leptin. Methods: We randomly assigned 173 post-menopausal sedentary overweight (body mass index greater than or equal to 24.0 kg/m2 and > 33% body fat) women aged 50-75 years living in western Washington State to either a facility- and home-based moderate-intensity physical activity intervention or a stretching control group. Fasting plasma ghrelin, leptin, measured height, weight and self-reported sleep were assessed at baseline and 12 months. Results: There were no consistent cross-sectional patterns between self-reported sleep measures and ghrelin or leptin at baseline. The weight loss differences between exercisers and stretchers were greater for those who slept less at follow-up than at baseline compared to those whose sleep duration did not change (-3.2 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.8, -0.5). Improvements in sleep quality were associated with significantly greater differences between exercisers and stretchers for ghrelin increases (improved vs same sleep quality: +115 pg/ml, 95% CI +25, +206) and leptin decreases (improved vs worsened sleep quality: -5.7 ng/ml, 95% CI -9.5, -1.5). Conclusion: There was only limited evidence that changes in sleep duration or quality modified exercise-induced changes in weight, ghrelin or leptin. Moreover, the observed differences were not in the directions hypothesized. Future longitudinal studies including population-based samples using objective measures of sleep and long follow-up may help to clarify these relationships. 3aexercise 3awomen 3aleptin 3aoverweight 3amiddle-aged adults 3aghrelin 3aweight loss 3asleep 2aAged 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aExercise Therapyxmethods 2aFemale 2aGhrelin 2aHumans 2aLeptinxblood 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxbloodxphysiopathologyxtherapy. 2aPeptide Hormonesxblood 2aSleepxphysiology 2aWeight Lossxphysiology 0aWashington 0abody weight 0aphysical activity 0asleep quality1 aVitiello, M.V.1 aFoster-Schubert, K.1 aUlrich, C.M.1 aTworoger, S.S.1 aPotter, J.D.1 aWeigle, D.S.1 aMcTiernan, A.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2007 Mar., v. 31, no. 3 p.466-475dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.08034383Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20080201b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02150naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245004300171300001600214520121200230650000901442653002201451653002901473700002101502700002101523700002201544700001801566773011401584852000901698856008501707930003301792946001101825655001201836IND4445224820221122005717.0101113e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444522482DNAL7 a10.1007/s00580-010-1074-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNassiri, Seyed Mahdi 10aPolycythemia vera-related MDS in a dog  ap. 627-630.  aA young male Doberman dog was presented with a short period history of anorexia and weakness. The main clinical signs were red mucous membranes, conjunctival hyperemia, dilated retinal vessels, seizures, and head extension. Laboratory findings revealed a moderate thrombocytopenia and a significant erythrocytosis, together with reticulocytosis and the presence of erythroid precursors in the blood film. Serum erythropoietin concentration was low-normal. The erythroid elements occupied the bone marrow and consisted of highly dysplastic forms. Rubriblasts constituted 8% of all nucleated cells of the bone marrow. Though megakaryocytic hypoplasia was remarkable, the megakaryocytic lineage was the other affected cellular line, with dysplastic features such as micromegakaryocytes. The granulocytic elements showed minimal dysplasia. A final diagnosis of polycythemia vera-related myelodysplastic syndrome was made. It is a highly aggressive condition, leading to death shortly after admission. Future studies on chromosome changes and specific mutations associated with the development of acute leukemias or myelodysplastic syndromes following chronic myeloproliferative diseases in animals are critical. 3adogs 0aPolycythemia vera 0aMyelodysplastic syndrome1 aChegeni, Solmaz 1 aRezaei, Mahdieh 1 aMohammadi, Elham 1 aIzadi, Sadra 0 tComparative clinical pathology.g2010 Dec., v. 19, no. 6 p.627-630dLondon : Springer-Verlagx1618-56417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00580-010-1074-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20101113b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02372naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100002000166245012200186300001600308500002400324500001500348520075600363650002801119650002601147650001701173650001301190650002601203650001901229650001701248650002301265650002201288650001601310650001601326650002901342650002401371650002701395650002301422650001701445650002501462650001001487651001201497653001601509700001601525700001301541773009701554852000901651856008901660930003301749945002501782946001101807655001201818IND4392016720221121235403.0070531e20070621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439201672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aGuardabassi, L.10aRetrospective detection of methicillin resistant and susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ST398 in Danish slaughter pigs  ap. 384-386.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis retrospective study documents the first detection in Danish pigs of methicillin resistant and susceptible variants of the Staphylococcus aureus lineage ST398, which was previously described among pigs, pig farmers and veterinary staff in The Netherlands as well as in human patients and infected animals in Europe.

The detection of ST398 in Danish pigs suggests that this new emerging zoonotic bacterium is rapidly spreading in the pig population in Europe. 3aepidemiological studies 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3atetracycline 3azoonoses 3aantibiotic resistance 3aswine diseases 3anasal cavity 3adisease prevalence 3aemerging diseases 3aclindamycin 3amethicillin 3amultiple drug resistance 3amicrobial detection 3amolecular epidemiology 3adisease resistance 3aerythromycin 3abacterial infections 3aswine 3aDenmark 0apenicillins1 aStegger, M.1 aSkov, R.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2007 June 21, v. 122, no. 3-4 p.384-386dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.03.0213Available from publisher's Web site.  a20071025b20071102c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/10/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03043naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100002900165245008300194300001800277500002400295500001500319520121200334650002501546650001601571650002601587650001401613650001801627650001701645650002001662650002201682650001501704650002101719650002301740650002701763650001901790650002101809650003801830650004201868650002701910650002401937650002601961651001001987653001501997653003702012700001302049700002202062700002202084700001502106773016302121852000902284856007702293930003302370945002502403946001302428655001202441IND4409204620140724000000.0080819e20080813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440920462DNAL7 a186429252pmid7 a10.1021/jf801131b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aPérez-Camino, M. del C.10aAlkyl Esters of Fatty Acids a Useful Tool to Detect Soft Deodorized Olive Oils  ap. 6740-6744.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFatty acid alkyl esters (FAAEs) are a family of natural neutral lipids present in olive oils and formed by esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) with low molecular alcohols. Inappropriate practices during the olive oil extraction process and bad quality of the olive fruits promote their formation. Quantification can be done by isolation with a silica gel solid phase extraction cartridge followed by analysis on a gas chromatograph equipped with a programmed temperature vaporizer injector using a polar capillary column. The application of the method to more than 100 Spanish olive oils from different categories, varieties, and geographical origin allowed for establishing the average content of FAAEs and distinguishing the Spanish protected denomination of origin (PDO) and extra virgin olive oils from other categories of olive oils. Those other categories of oils can be subjected to a mild refining process, which leads to blending with extra virgin olive oils. Studies on low quality oils subjected to mild refining showed that FAAEs remain after that process. Thereby, blends of extra virgin olive and mildly refined low quality olive oils can be detected by their alkyl ester concentrations. 3aproduct authenticity 3afatty acids 3aquantitative analysis 3aolive oil 3adeodorization 3afood quality 3afood processing 3afatty acid esters 3aprovenance 3afood composition 3agas chromatography 3asolid phase extraction 2aEsterification 2aEstersxanalysis 2aFatty Acidsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxchemistry 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 3aSpain 0aextraction 0aprotected denomination of origin1 aCert, A.1 aRomero-Segura, A.1 aCert-Trujillo, R.1 aMoreda, W.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 Aug. 13, v. 56, no. 15 p.6740-6744dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf801131b3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090520b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/30  aOther US 7aarticle03136naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100004300163245012500206300001600331500002400347520142000371650002801791650001201819650001301831650001001844650002201854650001301876650001701889650001901906650001001925650001201935650002101947650001401968650005801982650002602040650001302066650001302079650003302092650004202125650003002167650002402197700003302221700002802254700003302282700002802315700004302343773012702386852000902513856008402522655001202606IND4461475520221121235431.0110815s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446147552DNAL7 a214259292pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-12-10-03272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranco, Claudinéia Conationi da Silva10aVegetative Compatibility Groups and Parasexual Segregation in Colletotrichum acutatum Isolates Infecting Different Hosts  ap. 923-928.  aIncludes references  aHeterokaryosis is an important mechanism which provides genetic variability increase in filamentous fungi. In order to assess the diversity of vegetative compatibility reactions existing among Colletotrichum acutatum isolates derived from different hosts, complementary nit mutants of each isolate were obtained and paired in all possible combinations. Vegetative compatibility groups (VCG) were identified among the isolates according to their ability to form viable heterokaryons. Seven VCGs were identified among the isolates, one of which contained isolates from different hosts. VCGs 2 and 6 contained two and three members, respectively; VCG-3 contained four members, and four VCGs (1, 4, 5, and 7) contained a single one. This study shows, for the first time, the isolation and the parasexual segregation of a heterozygous diploid sector derived from the heterokaryon formed with nit mutants from VCG-6. Diploid, named DE-3, showed nit+ phenotype and growth rate similar to the parental wild isolate. When inoculated in the presence of the haploidizing agent benomyl, the diploid strain produced parasexual haploid segregants exhibiting the nit phenotypes of the crossed mutants. Since viable heterokaryons and diploid may be formed among vegetative compatible isolates of C. acutatum, this study suggests that the parasexual cycle may be an alternative source of genetic variability in C. acutatum isolates. 3aColletotrichum acutatum 3abenomyl 3adiploidy 3afungi 3agenetic variation 3ahaploidy 3aheterokaryon 3aheterozygosity 3ahosts 3amutants 3aparasexual cycle 3aphenotype 2aColletotrichumxclassificationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDiploidy 2aMutation 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlantsxclassificationxmicrobiology. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSpecies Specificity1 aSant' Anna, Juliane Rocha de1 aRosada, Lucia Jacovozzi1 aKaneshima, Edilson Nobuyoshi1 aStangarlin, Jose Renato1 aCastro-Prado, Marialba Avezum Alves De0 tPhytopathology.g2011 Aug., v. 101, no. 8 p.923-928dAmerican Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-12-10-03273Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02891naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010900165300001800274520109800292650001901390650001601409650002101425650001501446650001701461650002401478650001001502650001301512650001101525650001501536650001901551650003601570650003101606650003301637653002601670653005201696653001401748653001401762653002301776653001401799653002301813700002201836700002201858700001901880700001901899700001901918700001701937700001901954700002001973700001701993700002102010700001902031773013402050852000902184856008502193946001102278655001202289IND4442952220221121235446.0100924e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444295222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-010-0388-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Han-Cheon 10aHDAC3 selectively represses CREB3-mediated transcription and migration of metastatic breast cancer cells  ap. 3499-3510.  aWe identified CREB3 as a novel HDAC3-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen for HDAC3-interacting proteins. Among all class I HDACs, CREB3 specifically interacts with HDAC3, in vitro and in vivo. HDAC3 efficiently inhibited CREB3-enhanced NF-κB activation, whereas the other class I HDACs did not alter NF-κB-dependent promoter activities or the expression of NF-κB target genes. Importantly, both knock-down of CREB3 and overexpression of HDAC3 suppressed the transcriptional activation of the novel CREB3-regulated gene, CXCR4. Furthermore, CREB3 was shown to bind to the CRE element in the CXCR4 promoter and to activate the transcription of the CXCR4 gene by causing dissociation of HDAC3 and subsequently increasing histone acetylation. Importantly, both the depletion of HDAC3 and the overexpression of CREB3 substantially increased the migration of MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that HDAC3 selectively represses CREB3-mediated transcriptional activation and chemotactic signalling in human metastatic breast cancer cells. 3aCXCR4 receptor 3aacetylation 3abreast neoplasms 3achemotaxis 3adissociation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahistones 3ahumans 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atranscriptional activation 3atwo hybrid system techniques 0aHistone deacetylase 3 0acAMP response element-binding protein 3 (CREB3) 0aChemokine 0aCXC motif 0aReceptor 4 (CXCR4) 0aMigration 0aBreast cancer cell1 aChoi, Kyung-Chul 1 aChoi, Hyo-Kyoung 1 aKang, Hee-Bum 1 aKim, Mi-jŏng.1 aLee, Yoo-Hyun 1 aLee, Ok-Hee 1 aYi, Chong-min.1 aKim, Yŏng-jun.1 aJun, Woojin 1 aJeong, Jae-Wook 1 aYoon, Ho-Geun 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2010 Oct., v. 67, no. 20 p.3499-3510dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-010-0388-53Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle04192naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004400133040001800177100002400195245017100219300001600390500002400406500001500430506007600445520179900521506003702320650001102357650002502368650002402393650001102417650001902428650002402447650001902471650002102490650001902511650001002530650001602540650001802556650002402574650001802598650002702616650002202643650000902665650002502674650001102699650001302710650002202723650001702745650002202762650001202784650004102796650002602837650006202863650005202925650003102977650001103008650004803019650002603067650003603093650005403129650002403183653001503207700002203222700002303244773008803267852000903355856009403364655001203458IND4461474320221207134248.0110815s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446147432DNAL7 a217561342pmid7 aPMC34069322pmcid7 a10.1146/annurev.nutr.012809.1046352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBazán, Nicolás G.10aDocosahexaenoic Acid Signalolipidomics in Nutrition: Significance in Aging, Neuroinflammation, Macular Degeneration, Alzheimer's, and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases  ap. 321-351.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEssential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are critical nutritional lipids that must be obtained from the diet to sustain homeostasis. Omega-3 and -6 PUFAs are key components of biomembranes and play important roles in cell integrity, development, maintenance, and function. The essential omega-3 fatty acid family member docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is avidly retained and uniquely concentrated in the nervous system, particularly in photoreceptors and synaptic membranes. DHA plays a key role in vision, neuroprotection, successful aging, memory, and other functions. In addition, DHA displays anti-inflammatory and inflammatory resolving properties in contrast to the proinflammatory actions of several members of the omega-6 PUFAs family. This review discusses DHA signalolipidomics, comprising the cellular/tissue organization of DHA uptake, its distribution among cellular compartments, the organization and function of membrane domains rich in DHA-containing phospholipids, and the cellular and molecular events revealed by the uncovering of signaling pathways regulated by DHA and docosanoids, the DHA-derived bioactive lipids, which include neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), a novel DHA-derived stereoselective mediator. NPD1 synthesis agonists include neurotrophins and oxidative stress; NPD1 elicits potent anti-inflammatory actions and prohomeostatic bioactivity, is anti-angiogenic, promotes corneal nerve regeneration, and induces cell survival.

On the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, forest management objectives typically include wood fiber production but may also include the maintenance of environmental quality and, sometimes, species diversity. Silvicultural prescriptions alter stand structure and development trajectories by influencing the competitive interactions among plant species for site resources. Early site intervention may include nutrient additions and/or vegetation control; in coastal loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands, herbaceous and arborescent species can dominate the site leaf area index (LAI) for many years after a harvest (followed by planting). LAI is an important structural and functional component of a forest stand. Many eco-hydrologic and water quality models do not accurately account for LAI as the process driver to evapotranspiration (ET), and thus they ignore the ecophysiological effects of LAI on site water balance and nutrient loading. We measured LAI of emergent vegetation following a harvest, mechanical site preparation, and then pine planting for a drained loblolly pine plantation in coastal North Carolina. For six years monthly, growing season estimates of LAI were obtained using a LI-COR LAI 2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (PCA) for control (D1), thinned (D3), and harvested (D2) watersheds. In this article, we present results from the D2 treatment. In D2, we "harvested" all emergent vegetation in 18 randomly placed 1 m2 clip plots for three growing seasons where we estimated LAI using species-pooled estimates of specific leaf area and total leaf dry mass (i.e., LAICLIP); PCA measurements were recorded prior to clipping (LAIPCA). We also simulated loblolly pine seedling growth and development using the biogeochemical process model SECRETS-3PG to examine site differentiation in LAI. Four years post-harvest maximum LAICLIP exceeded 8 m2 m-2 (projected area basis). LAIPCA underestimated LAICLIP; LAICLIP = 1.436 x LAIPCA (r2 = 0.53; p < 0.0001; n = 195). Corrected LAIPCA estimates exceeded simulated pine LAI (LAISIM) for approximately 4.5 years post-planting. Emergent vegetation dominated the site for nearly five years and likely exerted a strong influence over site water balance and nutrient use during early stand development. 3aseedling growth 3aleaf area index 3awatersheds 3aPinus taeda 3asociety 3astand structure 3aforests 3arefuge habitats 3aanimals 3asilviculture 3aforest stands 3anutrient balance 3aenvironmental quality 3aplanting 3ahydrologic models 3aleaves 3amanagers 3agrowth and development 3aecosystem services 3aplants (botany) 3aspecies diversity 3asite preparation 3acoastal plains 3acanopy 3aevapotranspiration 3aecophysiology 3aforest management 3agrowing season 3awood fibers 3aNorth Carolina 0awater balance1 aAmatya, D.M.1 aBlanton Lawson, C.D.1 aSkaggs, R.W.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2011 , v. 54, no. 6 p.2057-2066wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b00000000c20120403  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03069naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100001700164245018800181300001800369500002400387500001500411520132600426650002001752650002101772650001301793650001101806650001701817650001101834650001901845650002101864650002701885650002201912650000901934650002601943650002101969650002201990653001602012653002702028653002502055700001602080700001402096700001802110700001402128700001402142700001502156773016202171852000902333856007802342930003302420945002502453946001302478655001202491IND4392013920221121223928.0070531e20070530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439201392DNAL7 a10.1021/jf070569k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ505 0aT300 0aT2001 aSugiyama, H.10aOligomeric Procyanidins in Apple Polyphenol Are Main Active Components for Inhibition of Pancreatic Lipase and Triglyceride Absorption [Erratum: 2007 July 11, v. 55, no. 14, p. 5906.]  ap. 4604-4609.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aInhibitory effects of apple polyphenol extract (AP) and procyanidin contained in AP on in vitro pancreatic lipase activity and in vivo triglyceride absorption in mice and humans were examined. AP and procyanidin considerably inhibited in vitro pancreatic lipase activity. However, polyphenols, except for procyanidin, in AP (i.e., catechins, chalcones, and phenol carboxylic acids) showed weak inhibitory activities on pancreatic lipase. Procyanidins separated by normal-phase chromatography according to the degree of polymerization were also examined. Inhibitory effects of procyanidins increased according to the degree of polymerization from dimer to pentamer. On the other hand, pentamer or greater procyanidins showed maximal inhibitory effects on pancreatic lipase. These results suggested that with respect to in vitro pancreatic lipase inhibition, the degree of polymerization was an important factor and oligomeric procyanidin mainly contributed. Next, we performed a triglyceride tolerance test in mice and humans. Simultaneous ingestion of AP and triglyceride significantly inhibited an increase of plasma triglyceride levels in both models. These results suggested that the oligomeric procyanidins contained in AP inhibited triglyceride absorption by inhibiting pancreatic lipase activity in mice and humans. 3ain vivo studies 3afunctional foods 3apancreas 3aapples 3aprocyanidins 3ahumans 3apolymerization 3atriacylglycerols 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3aenzyme inhibitors 3amice 3aintestinal absorption 3ain vitro studies 3aprotective effect 0apolyphenols 0aoligomeric procyanidin 0abioactive properties1 aAkazome, Y.1 aShoji, T.1 aYamaguchi, A.1 aYasue, M.1 aKanda, T.1 aOhtake, Y.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 May 30, v. 55, no. 11 p.4604-4609dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf070569k3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20090211b20090301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/01/13  aOther US 7aarticle02693naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245011900164300001400283520134400297650001501641650001501656650002801671650001101699650002301710650001901733650001301752650001001765650001101775650002001786650001501806650001001821650001201831650001701843650002001860650001601880651002901896653002801925700001501953700001701968773010001985852000902085856008502094930003302179946001102212655001202223IND4447286720221121224002.0110107e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444728672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-010-9314-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, G.

Through assessment of its thermal biology and low temperature tolerance, this study ascertains the establishment potential of L. testaceipes in cool temperate climates typical of northern Europe. The developmental threshold of L. testaceipes was 5.8°C. Rearing of parasitoids at shorter day lengths and lower temperatures indicated no ability to enter a diapause state. The supercooling points (SCP) of non-acclimated and acclimated parasitoid life stages were between −24.6°C and −17.7°C, with LTemp₅₀ temperatures approaching these values, indicating a high level of cold tolerance in short exposures. At 5°C the LTime₅₀ of acclimated larvae within parasitized aphids was 42.8 days. Acclimated pupae continued to develop with 54% adult emergence from mummies within 60 days. Acclimated parasitoid larvae and pupae, within living and mummified aphids, continued to develop during 70 days of winter field exposure and emerging adult parasitoids were reproductively viable under field conditions. These data indicate that where suitable host species are available throughout the year, L. testaceipes would be able to establish in northern Europe. 3aAphidoidea 3aBraconidae 3aLysiphlebus testaceipes 3aadults 3abiological control 3acold tolerance 3adiapause 3ahosts 3alarvae 3aparasitic wasps 3aparasitism 3apupae 3arearing 3asupercooling 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3aNorthern European region 0aEstablishment potential1 aSterk, G. 1 aBale, J.

In contrast to soil, the upward movement of water through the plant residue layer is predominantly in the vapor phase rather than the liquid phase. Because of this difference in the mechanism of water movement, physically based numerical models that simulate liquid-dominated water movement in the soil profile have not been tested for water movement through residue. In this article, a new methodology is presented in which the crop residue layer is replaced with a hydraulically equivalent soil layer (ESL), thereby allowing the use of a numerical model, Hydrus-1D, to simulate the changes in soil moisture in a residue-covered production system. Parameter optimization software, PEST, was used to characterize the unsaturated hydraulic function of the ESL. The data for calibrating and validating the model were collected from two different studies in 2010 at the University of California West Side Research and Extension Center in Five Points, California. The simulated soil water content in the profile under the ESL matched the measured soil water content under crop residue cover with RMSE values of 0.004 to 0.013 cm 3 cm-3 for calibration and 0.001 to 0.019 cm 3 cm-3 for validation. Parameter optimization of the ESL provides a new tool to allow the use of a physically based model such as Hydrus-1D to simulate the many complex interactions between the soil, crop residue, and atmosphere. The methodology may need further validation in different soil, mulch, and climatic conditions. In future research, the effect of crop residue on evaporation for a crop system will be quantified for different growth periods, and efficient irrigation management protocols will be designed to reduce the evaporation component of crop evapotranspiration. 3aclimatic factors 3acomputer software 3acrop residues 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation management 3amathematical models 3amethodology 3amulches 3aprediction 3asoil profiles 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asoil water movement 3avapors 3aCalifornia1 aMitchell, J.P.1 aWallender, W.W.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2011 , v. 54, no. 6 p.2029-2035wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://elibrary.asabe.org/toc_journals.asp?volume=54&issue=6&conf=t&orgconf=t20113Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120406  aOther US 7aarticle03164naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001600155245010900171300001800280500002400298500001500322520152800337650002301865650001901888650002101907650001501928650001401943650002301957650001601980650001701996650002302013650002002036650002602056650001002082650000902092650001402101650001702115650001402132650001302146653001302159653001502172653001202187700001702199700002102216700001202237700001702249773016202266852000902428856007802437930003302515945002502548946001302573655001202586IND4392012920221121223813.0070531e20070530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439201292DNAL7 a10.1021/jf070065m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ506 0aQ1161 aChaijan, M.14aThe Effect of Freezing and Aldehydes on the Interaction between Fish Myoglobin and Myofibrillar Proteins  ap. 4562-4568.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe interaction between fish myoglobin (Mb) and natural actomyosin (NAM) extracted from fresh and frozen fish was studied. The quantity of soluble Mb in Mb-NAM extracted was less in frozen than in fresh fish (P < 0.05). However, no differences were observed in Mb that remained in solution following preparation of Mb-NAM from frozen whole fish vs frozen fillets (P > 0.05). MetMb formation in Mb-NAM was generally greater than that observed in control Mb (P < 0.05); the greatest MetMb content occurred in Mb-NAM extracted from frozen whole fish (P < 0.05). The effect of different aldehyde oxidation products on the interaction between fish Mb and NAM was also studied in vitro. The loss of soluble Mb from NAM:Mb preparations was greater in the presence of hexenal and hexanal (P < 0.05) relative to controls, and the degree of solubility loss varied with aldehyde type. Hexenal caused greater OxyMb oxidation than hexanal (P < 0.05). Whiteness of washed NAM and NAM-Mb mixtures decreased following aldehyde addition (P < 0.05). In the absence of Mb, the Ca2+-ATPase activity of NAM was lower with added hexenal than with hexanal (P < 0.05). However, no differences in Ca2+-ATPase activity between hexanal and hexenal-treated samples were observed when Mb was present (P > 0.05). Reducing and nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses suggested that both disulfide and nondisulfide covalent linkages contributed to aldehyde-induced cross-linking between Mb and myofibrillar proteins. 3apostmortem changes 3afrozen storage 3ain vitro studies 3amyofibrils 3amyoglobin 3alipid peroxidation 3afrozen fish 3afood quality 3achemical structure 3astorage quality 3achemical interactions 3acolor 3afish 3aoxidation 3afish fillets 3aaldehydes 3araw fish 0aseafoods 0aactomyosin 0ahexanal1 aBenjakul, S.1 aVisessanguan, W.1 aLee, S.1 aFaustman, C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 May 30, v. 55, no. 11 p.4562-4568dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf070065m3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20090211b20090301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/01/13  aOther US 7aarticle03092naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245009200170300001600262520169000278650002301968650001701991650001802008650001302026650001402039650001402053650001802067650001802085650001002103650002202113650001102135650001302146650000902159650002202168650002502190653002302215653001402238700002302252700002202275700002102297700001802318773013602336852000902472856008502481930003302566946001102599655001202610IND4442100020221121224039.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444210002DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437100500312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZakharenkova, T. S. 10aRelease of elicitors from rice blast spores under the action of reactive oxygen species  ap. 615-619.  aEffects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the release of putative elicitors from spores of rice blast causal fungus Magnaporthe grisea (Hebert) Barr were studied. While studying the influence of exogenous ROS, the spores were germinated for 5 h in the presence of 50 μM H₂O₂ and then treated with catalase to decompose hydrogen peroxide. The spore germination fluid was then boiled to inactivate catalase. When the resulting diffusate was applied onto rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaves, it caused necroses and stimulated superoxide (O ₂ ⁻ ) production. Both effects were observed with the resistant rice cultivar but not with the cultivar susceptible to the fungal strain. The susceptible cultivar did not acquire resistance to challenge with fungal spores, which were applied one day after the treatment. The fractionation of the spore diffusate showed that both low- and high-molecular compounds (mol wt < 3 kD and >3 kD, respectively) should be present in combination to induce O ₂ ⁻ production by leaves. The diffusates from spores germinated in water also caused necroses and stimulated O ₂ ⁻ generation, though to a weaker extent than diffusates from spores germinated in H₂O₂. The effect of diffusates from spores germinated in water was abolished by catalase or superoxide dismutase added initially to the spore suspension. The results suggest that germinating spores of M. grisea are able to release elicitors and this ability depends on ROS formation by spores. Presumably, the yield of elicitors is increased additionally if fungus M. grisea is stressed or subjected to exogenous ROS. The described phenomena may be involved in incompatibility mechanisms. 3aMagnaporthe grisea 3aOryza sativa 3ablast disease 3acatalase 3acultivars 3aelicitors 3afractionation 3afungal spores 3afungi 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3anecrosis 3arice 3aspore germination 3asuperoxide dismutase 0asuperoxide radical 0aelicitors1 aAver'yanov, A.

This article adopts a transaction costs economics perspective in order to explore the question whether, in the light of a particular problem, the scale at which a certain competence is attributed can be reconsidered. Specifically, it tests whether a presumption of least-cost operation concerning an agency at a given scale can hold. By doing so, it investigates whether the rescaling of certain tasks, aiming at solving a scale-related problem, is likely to produce an increase in costs for day-to-day agency operations as compared to the status quo. The article explores such a perspective for the case of Venice Lagoon. The negative aspects of the present arrangement concerning fishery management and morphological remediation are directly linked to the scale of the agencies involved. The analysis suggests that scales have been chosen correctly, at least from the point of view of the costs incurred to the agencies involved. Consequently, a rescaling of those agencies does not represent a viable option.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aeconomics 3aenvironmental governance 3afisheries management 3aremediation 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxeconomicsxlegislation & jurisprudence. 2aCost-Benefit Analysis 2aEnvironmental Policy 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediationxeconomics 2aFisheriesxeconomicsxlegislation & jurisprudence. 2aGovernment Agenciesxeconomics 2aGovernment Regulation 2aPolicy Making 2aWater Pollutionxprevention & control 2aWeights and Measures 0aItaly 0aScale 0aMulti-level governance 0aGovernance costs 0aFishery policy 0aAgency design1 aFritsch, Oliver 0 tEnvironmental management.g2010 July, v. 46, no. 1 p.17-28dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-010-9449-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100730b20100807c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03146naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100001800164245009800182300001800280500002400298500001500322520149300337650001601830650001501846650002501861650001601886650001901902650001601921650001401937650001401951650001101965650001101976650001401987650001102001650001302012650002502025650003002050650001702080650002302097650001502120653002302135653001102158653001702169653002002186700001502206700001502221773016202236852000902398856007802407930003302485945002502518946001302543655001202556IND4392011220221121204935.0070531e20070530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439201122DNAL7 a10.1021/jf070119s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ500 0aQ110 0aQ4001 aHidalgo, F.J.10aEffect of Tocopherols in the Antioxidative Activity of Oxidized Lipid-Amine Reaction Products  ap. 4436-4442.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPhosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysine (Lys), and mixtures of them were tested for antioxidative activity in a tocopherol-stripped olive oil (TSO) and the same oil after addition of 250 microgram of α-tocopherol g of oil/(tocopherol-added olive oil, TAO) to evaluate the role of tocopherol in the antioxidant activity of oxidized lipid-amine products. Neither PE nor PC nor Lys protected TSO when tested alone, but both PE and Lys increased the induction period (IP) of TAO. On the contrary, PE/Lys and PC/Lys mixtures, but not PC/PE mixtures, protected both TSO and TAO. These results were a consequence of both the formation of oxidized lipid-amine products, which were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after their conversion into volatile derivatives, and a synergism between α-tocopherol and the produced compounds. These results were confirmed by analyzing the antioxidative activity of two of the produced carbonyl-amine products: 6-amino-2-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)hexanoic acid (1) and 2,3-dipalmitoylpropyl 2-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)ethyl phosphate (2). The hydrophilic compound 1 was more antioxidant than the analogous lipophilic compound 2, and this antioxidative activity was observed in TAO and not in TSO. All these results suggested that antioxidative activity of carbonyl-amine products may be greatly increased with the addition of tocopherols, and those products derived from Lys are more antioxidant in bulk oils than those derived from PE. 3atocopherols 3ashelf life 3aphosphatidylcholines 3afood matrix 3afood additives 3aingredients 3aoxidation 3asynergism 3aamines 3alysine 3aolive oil 3amodels 3amixtures 3aantioxidant activity 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aantioxidants 3acarbonyl compounds 3asynergists 0achemical reactions 0alipids 0afood quality 0astorage quality1 aLeon, M.M.1 aZamora, R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 May 30, v. 55, no. 11 p.4436-4442dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf070119s3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20090211b20090301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/01/11  aOther US 7aarticle02598naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005500125300001800180520143900198650001601637650002101653650001501674650001501689650001201704650001501716650001101731650001101742650001401753650001001767650001301777650002301790650001601813650003101829700001401860700001801874700001201892773009501904852000901999856012202008939003302130946001302163655001202176IND4462319920221121204937.0111117e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446231992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLove, C.D.10aAdsorption of Ammonia on Ozonated Activated Carbon  ap. 1931-1940.  aIn this theoretical research, we investigated ozonated granular activated carbon (OGAC) as an ammonia adsorbent in aqueous systems. Research objectives were to determine the (1) effectiveness of ozone loading on adsorption capacity of activated carbon in aqueous ammonia solutions, (2) kinetics and adsorption isotherms of ammonia adsorption, and (3) effect of volatile organic compounds on adsorption of ammonia from the aqueous phase. Batch experiments indicated that ozonation for 30 min enhanced the adsorption capacity of granular activated carbon from 0.47 ± 0.065 mg g-1 to 1.02 ± 0.099 mg g-1 due to increased surface oxygen species on activated carbon. These results suggested that activated carbon could be chemically modified to enhance the adsorption of ammonia from aqueous systems. Analysis of the rate data suggested that the adsorption of ammonia on OGAC followed an Elovich model with initial adsorption rate (α) and desorption constants (β) between 0.146 and 1.06 mg g-1 min-1 and 5.5 and 7.75 g mg-1 , respectively (25°C to 45°C). The effect of temperature (25°C to 45°C) on adsorption was not found to be significant, suggesting that adsorption on OGAC was non-activated. However, presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as p-cresol and acetic acid inhibited adsorption of ammonia on OGAC. Future research is needed to synthesize activated carbon that can absorb ammonia and VOCs simultaneously. 3aacetic acid 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3adesorption 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aozonation 3aozone 3ap-cresol 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3avolatile organic compounds1 aKolar, P.1 aClassen, J.J.1 aDas, L.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2011 , v. 54, no. 5 p.1931-1940wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=54&issue=5&conf=t&orgconf=t20113Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111117  aOther US 7aarticle02584naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245009000186300001600276520101900292650001501311650001401326650001001340650003001350650001201380650002601392650009301418650002501511650001901536650001401555650001301569650003501582650001901617650001401636650002401650651001001674653001901684653000901703653001601712700002501728700001501753700001801768700001601786773012601802852000901928856008501937930003302022946001102055655001202066IND4442380320221121205008.0100910e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444238032DNAL7 a206231532pmid7 a10.1007/s00792-010-0322-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzúa-Bustos, A. 12aA novel subaerial Dunaliella species growing on cave spiderwebs in the Atacama Desert  ap. 443-452.  aStrategies for life adaptation to extreme environments often lead to novel solutions. As an example of this assertion, here we describe the first species of the well-known genus of green unicellular alga Dunaliella able to thrive in a subaerial habitat. All previously reported members of this microalga are found in extremely saline aquatic environments. Strikingly, the new species was found on the walls of a cave located in the Atacama Desert (Chile). Moreover, on further inspection we noticed that it grows upon spiderwebs attached to the walls of the entrance-twilight transition zone of the cave. This peculiar growth habitat suggests that this Dunaliella species uses air moisture condensing on the spiderweb silk threads as a source of water for doing photosynthesis in the driest desert of the world. This process of adaptation recapitulates the transition that allowed land colonization by primitive plants and shows an unexpected way of expansion of the life habitability range by a microbial species. 3aDunaliella 3aevolution 3awater 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aBiopolymersxanalysis 2aChlorophytaxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aDNA, Plantxanalysis 2aDesert Climate 2aEcosystem 2aHumidity 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPhylogeny 2aSpidersxphysiology 0aChile 0aAtacama Desert 0aCave 0aAdaptations1 aGonzález-Silva, C. 1 aSalas, L. 1 aPalma, R.

A review of the literature indicates it is a widespread plant-animal interaction involving a diverse array of herbivores. At least three mechanisms can produce this positive feedback cycle. First, phytophagous insect and mammalian herbivore damage can stimulate dormant buds to produce vigorous juvenile growth, which is preferred for further attack. Juvenilization cycles may have repeatedly evolved because herbivores are able to take advantage of a generalized plant compensatory response to any type of damage. Second, herbivores can manipulate plant source-sink relationships to attain more resources, and this alteration of plant growth may benefit subsequent herbivore generations. Third, herbivory can alter plant nutrition or defensive chemistry in a way that makes a plant susceptible to more herbivory. Resource regulation probably occurs because damage to resources preferred by the herbivores induces a generalized plant response that produces more preferred resources. Alternatively, manipulation of plant resources to induce resource regulation may have evolved in herbivores with a high degree of philopatry due to selection to alter plant resources to benefit their offspring. Resource regulation can stabilize insect population dynamics by maintaining a supply of high-quality plant resources. It can also increase the heterogeneity of host-plant resources for herbivores by altering the physiological age structure and the distribution of resources within plants. Resource regulation may have strong plant-mediated effects on other organisms that use that host plant, but these effects have not yet been explored. 3aage structure 3abuds 3achemistry 3ahost plants 3ajuveniles 3amammals 3aphilopatry 3aphytophagous insects 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3aplant response 3apopulation dynamics 3aprogeny 3asource-sink relationships 0aDormant bud 0aIndirect interactions 0aPhilopatry0 tPopulation ecology.g2010 Oct., v. 52, no. 4 p.461-473dJapan : Springer Japanx1438-38967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10144-010-0210-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100910b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03426naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245009500191300001800286520159600304650002001900650001201920650001501932650002201947650000901969650001301978650001901991650001202010650003502022650001202057650001702069650003902086650002102125650001102146650003702157650005602194650001302250650002002263650005702283650002602340650002402366650002502390650004302415650001202458650000902470650003102479653001902510653003202529700001602561773011402577852000902691856009202700930003302792946001102825655001202836IND4441998320221121173616.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444199832DNAL7 a207188652pmid7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07787.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelland, Andrew10aConformation-dependent hydride transfer in neuronal nitric oxide synthase reductase domain  ap. 3833-3834.  aCalmodulin (CaM) activates the constitutive isoforms of mammalian nitric oxide synthase by triggering electron transfer from the reductase domain FMN to the heme. This enables the enzymes to be regulated by Ca²⁺ concentration. CaM exerts most of its effects on the reductase domain; these include activation of electron transfer to electron acceptors, and an increase in the apparent rate of flavin reduction by the substrate NADPH. It has been shown that the former is caused by a transition from a conformationally locked form of the enzyme to an open form as a result of CaM binding, improving FMN accessibility, but the latter effect has not been explained satisfactorily. Here, we report the effect of ionic strength and isotopic substitution on flavin reduction. We found a remarkable correlation between the rate of steady-state turnover of the reductase domain and the rate of flavin reduction over a range of different ionic strengths. The reduction of the enzyme by NADPH was biphasic, and the amplitudes of the phases determined through global analysis of stopped-flow data correlated with the proportions of enzyme known to exist in the open and closed conformations. The different conformations of the enzyme molecule appeared to have different rates of reaction with NADPH. Thus, proximity of FMN inhibits hydride transfer to the FAD. In the CaM-free enzyme, slow conformational motion (opening and closing) limits turnover. It is now clear that this motion also controls hydride transfer during steady-state turnover, by limiting the rate at which NADPH can access the FAD. 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3acalcium 3acalmodulin 3aelectron transfer 3aheme 3ahydrides 3aionic strength 3amammals 3aneuronal nitric oxide synthase 2aAnimals 2aBiocatalysis 2aCalmodulinxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCatalytic Domain 2aCattle 2aFlavin Mononucleotidexchemistry 2aFlavin-Adenine Dinucleotidexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aNADPxchemistry 2aNitric Oxide Synthase Type Ixchemistryxmetabolism. 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aProtein Conformation 2aProtein Interaction Domains and Motifs 2aProtons 2aRats 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 0aisotope effect 0anitric oxide synthase (NOS)1 aDaff, Simon0 tFEBS journal.g2010 Sept., v. 277, no. 18 p.3833-3834dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07787.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03411naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002800171245010100199300001600300520149900316650001601815650001901831650001501850650002101865650001701886650001301903650001301916650001201929650002401941650001601965650000901981650002601990650001402016650001102030650001402041650001202055650002502067650002502092650003702117650002402154650001402178650002402192650004602216653002302262653001602285653002102301653002802322653003102350700001802381700002202399700001302421700002002434700002002454700002002474773012202494852000902616856009202625930003302717946001102750655001202761IND4442199320221121173620.0100910e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444219932DNAL7 a207078152pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6941.2010.00933.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aN'Guessan, Adeola Lucie10aPostbiostimulation microbial community structure changes that control the reoxidation of uranium  ap. 184-195.  aThis study evaluated the influence of changes in the microbial community structure on reoxidation of reduced uranium during a postbiostimulation period. Effluent groundwater from acetate-stimulated sediment flow-through columns was analyzed over 60 days after acetate amendment was discontinued. Only a small reoxidation of iron or uranium (17%) occurred in the presence of 1-2 mg L⁻¹ O₂ influent groundwater for the 2-month period. Most uranium reoxidation occurred during the first 2 weeks after biostimulation with acetate was discontinued. Groundwater and sediment microbial community compositions suggested that two processes played important roles immediately after the cessation of acetate addition. The first process was characterized by a predominance of both sediment-bound and planktonic microorganisms most closely related to Hydrogenophaga sp., Thiobacillus sp., and Gallionella sp., which could oxidize a variety of reduced compounds. The second process was characterized by organisms closely related to Lysobacter sp. and Sterolibacterium sp., with the potential to feed on complex organic compounds from biomass turnover. The presence of these bacteria and the lack of uranium oxidation implied that after acetate addition was stopped, reduced inorganic compounds and dead biomass became electron donors for a microbial community capable of using low ambient oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, contributing to the preservation, at least temporarily, of biogenic U(IV). 3aGallionella 3aHydrogenophaga 3aLysobacter 3aSterolibacterium 3aThiobacillus 3aacetates 3abacteria 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3agroundwater 3airon 3amicrobial communities 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asediments 3auranium 2aAcetatesxmetabolism 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aGeologic Sedimentsxmicrobiology 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhylogeny 2aUraniumxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Radioactivexmetabolism 0apostbiostimulation 0areoxidation 0abiomass turnover 0airon-oxidizing bacteria 0asulfide-oxidizing bacteria1 aMoon, Hee Sun1 aPeacock, Aaron D.1 aTan, Hui1 aSinha, Malavika1 aLong, Philip E.1 aJaffe, Peter R.0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2010 Oct., v. 74, no. 1 p.184-195dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0168-64967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2010.00933.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100910b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02152naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245007800167300001600245520123100261650001601492650003301508650001801541653001701559700002201576773012601598852000901724856008501733930003301818946001101851655001201862IND4446010920221121173612.0101203e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444601092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10517-010-1091-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPogorelov, A.

In parallel experiments, glutaraldehyde-fixed samples were dehydrated in ascending ethanol solutions, absolute ethanol, and 100% hexamethyldisilazane and then dried at room temperature. Scanning electron microscopy microphotographs of collagen fibers and cells were characterized by high resolution and the absence of collapsed or deformed structures even at high magnification (×50,000) for both chemical drying and high-vacuum freeze drying. However, high-vacuum freeze drying is superior to chemical drying for the investigation of the internal space of 3D scaffolds, because sample fracture can be prepared directly in liquid nitrogen. These techniques are a part of the sample preparation process for scanning electron microscopy and can also be used for studies of cell adhesion, morphology, and arrangement in wet specimens (3D gels and flexible tissue engineering scaffolds). 3afibroblasts 3ascanning electron microscopy 3afreeze drying 0acollagen gel1 aSelezneva, I.

We examined genetic and plastic variation in gill and brain size among swamp (low oxygen; hypoxic) and river (normal oxygen; normoxic) populations of an African cichlid fish, Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor victoriae. Larger gills and smaller brains should be advantageous when oxygen is low, and we hypothesized that the relative contribution of local genetic adaptation vs. phenotypic plasticity should be related to potential for dispersal between environments (because of gene flow's constraint on local genetic adaptation). We conducted a laboratory-rearing experiment, with broods from multiple populations raised under high-oxygen and low-oxygen conditions. We found that most of the variation in gill size was because of plasticity. However, both plastic and genetic effects on brain mass were detected, as were genetic effects on brain mass plasticity. F₁ offspring from populations with the highest potential for dispersal between environments had characteristically smaller and more plastic brains. This phenotypic pattern might be adaptive in the face of gene flow, if smaller brains and increased plasticity confer higher average fitness across environment types. 3aPseudocrenilabrus 3abrain 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironmental factors 3agene flow 3ageographical variation 3agills 3alaboratory rearing 3aoxygen 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aprogeny 3arivers 3aswamps 2aAdaptation, Biological 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aBrainxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aCichlidsxanatomy & histologyxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGene Flow 2aGenetic Variation 2aGillsxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aMale 2aOrgan Size 2aOxygenxphysiology 2aPhenotype 2aSelection, Genetic 2aWetlands 0aUganda 0aadaptive divergence 0aadaptive plasticity 0adispersal 0alocal adaptation 0areaction norms1 aCHAPMAN, L.J.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2010 Oct., v. 23, no. 10 p.2091-2103dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02069.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02210naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245007400157300001400231500002400245520095900269650001501228650001401243650001401257650001901271650001301290650001701303650002501320650000901345650002001354650001701374650001301391650003101404650002001435651001501455700002301470700001501493700002301508700001601531700002001547700002101567773007401588852000901662856008101671655001201752IND4461479420221121173622.0110815s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446147942DNAL7 a10.3733/ca.v065n01p412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Suduan10aMethods evaluated to minimize emissions from preplant soil fumigation  ap. 41-46.  aIncludes references  aMany commodities depend on preplant soil fumigation for pest control to achieve healthy crops and profitable yields. Under California regulations, minimizing emissions is essential to maintain the practical use of soil fumigants, and more stringent regulations are likely in the future. The phase-out of methyl bromide as a broad-spectrum soil fumigant has created formidable challenges. Most alternatives registered today are regulated as volatile organic compounds because of their toxicity and mobile nature. We review research on methods for minimizing emissions from soil fumigation, including the effectiveness of their emission reductions, impacts on pest control and cost. Low-permeability plastic mulches are highly effective but are generally affordable only in high-value cash crops such as strawberry.

The model produces high-resolution grids of peak flow forecast frequencies during rainfall events. Forecasters can compare these grids to locally derived threshold frequency (TF) grids to aid in warning decisions. TF grids may be derived from several sources of information such as known flood frequencies at selected river locations and local hydraulic engineering design standards. The proposed model characterizes flood severity at ungauged locations, and provides an inherent bias correction to reduce systematic errors in model predicted peaks. The distributed model basis for the approach offers advantages over current lumped model-based national weather service (NWS) flash flood guidance (FFG) procedures because it makes hydrologic calculations at spatial and temporal scales that are more commensurate with flash flooding. In this study, simulation results for 10 basins (eight nested) in Oklahoma and Arkansas, USA, were analyzed to (1) improve our understanding of distributed hydrologic model accuracy in small, interior basins, when forced by operational quality radar-based precipitation data, (2) validate that a distributed model can improve upon the lumped model-based NWS FFG, and (3) validate that the DHM-TF method can provide an inherent bias correction using available operational data archives to develop statistical parameters. We analyzed eight years of continuous hourly stream flow simulations and peak flows from 247 individual events. Both uncalibrated and calibrated distributed model results improved upon lumped model-based FFG at interior points. The DHM-TF method provided an average inherent bias correction for both uncalibrated and calibrated models in most basins examined. These positive results suggest that further development and testing of this technique should proceed. 3afloods 3awatershed hydrology 3aprediction 3ahydrologic models 3amathematical models 3arain 3astream flow 3arivers 3awatersheds 3aOklahoma 3aArkansas 0apeak flow 0aflood forecasting 0aungauged basins 0adistributed hydrologic models1 aSchaake, J.1 aZhang, Z.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2007 Apr. 30, v. 337, no. 3-4 p.402-420dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.02.0153Available from publisher's Web site.  a20080827b20080905c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/08/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02767naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001900176245013300195300001600328500002400344500001500368520136100383650002601744650001201770650002001782650001301802650001701815650002001832650001301852650001301865650001501878650001501893650001901908650002001927651001401947653001801961653001801979700001401997773009402011852000902105856009002114930003302204945002502237946001102262655001202273IND4392006320140724000000.0070531e20070430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439200632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aJ200 0aK0011 aRollenbeck, R.10aCharacteristics of the water and energy balance in an Amazonian lowland rainforest in Venezuela and the impact of the ENSO-cycle  ap. 377-390.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFrom 1996 to 2000 microclimatic conditions (profiles of wind-speed, temperature, humidity and radiation) have been investigated to determine the energy balance within a primary Amazonian rainforest in southern Venezuela (Surumoni crane project), located on the banks of the upper Rio Orinoco. Since 1997 main components of the water balance were examined additionally: gross and net precipitation, stemflow, sapflow and soilwater were measured. The main goal was to determine the water and energy balance for the study site as a contribution to an interdisciplinary ecological research project and to assess consequences of possible land use change. In this study the most important link between energy balance and hydrological cycle, the evapotranspiration, was determined independently by two different approaches. The results indicate a high interannual variability, which probably was influenced by the strong La Niña-epsiode in 1996 and the very strong El-Niño-event in 97/98. The impact of the ENSO-cycle is well documented for coastal and marine environments in South America; detailed observations in the Amazon basin however, are very scarce. Beyond the scope of supplying detailed information for a typical pristine tropical lowland forest, this study may also help to improve the understanding of ecosystem impact of ENSO in the Amazon region. 3atropical rain forests 3aEl Nino 3asolar radiation 3astemflow 3amicroclimate 3aair temperature 3asap flow 3ahumidity 3awind speed 3asoil water 3aenergy balance 3alowland forests 3aVenezuela 0aprecipitation 0awater balance1 aAnhuf, D.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2007 Apr. 30, v. 337, no. 3-4 p.377-390dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.02.0043Available from publisher's Web site.  a20080827b20080905c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/08/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02540naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002400143245011500167300001600282500002400298520123600322650003401558650001601592650001801608650001401626650002001640650002201660650001401682650001001696650002301706650002401729650001201753650001401765650001001779650001201789651001701801700002901818700002101847700002101868773012501889852000902014856008302023655001202106IND4461483720221121173623.0110816s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446148372DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-06-10-04292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoswami, Rubella S.10aColletotrichum lindemuthianum Races Prevalent on Dry Beans in North Dakota and Potential Sources of Resistance  ap. 408-412.  aIncludes references  aAnthracnose caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum is one of the most important diseases of dry edible beans in the major production areas worldwide. This pathogen is highly variable, with numerous races. Disease management relies heavily on genetic resistance and use of clean seed. Genetic resistance is controlled by major resistance genes conferring protection against specific races of the pathogen. Therefore, knowledge of the pathogen population in a region is essential for effective screening of germplasm. Surveys were conducted for more than 6 years in North Dakota, the largest dry-bean-growing state in the United States, and seed samples submitted for certification were assessed to identify the C. lindemuthianum races prevalent in the region. A collection of commercial cultivars from different market classes of dry bean was also screened for resistance to these races. Disease incidence was found to be low in most years. However, in addition to the previously reported races of anthracnose 7, 73, and 89, two new races, 1153 and 1161, previously never reported in the United States, were identified and the commercial cvs. Montcalm, Avalanche, Vista, and Sedona where found to possess resistance to these races. 3aColletotrichum lindemuthianum 3aanthracnose 3acertification 3acultivars 3adisease control 3adisease incidence 3adry beans 3agenes 3agenetic resistance 3agermplasm screening 3amarkets 3apathogens 3araces 3asurveys 3aNorth Dakota1 aDel Rio-Mendoza, Luis E.1 aLamppa, Robin S.1 aPrischmann, Jeff0 tPlant disease.g2011 Apr., v. 95, no. 4 p.408-412dAmerican Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-06-10-04293Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03038naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001300158245007100171300001600242500002400258500001500282520163800297650002001935650002301955650001601978650001101994650002102005650002402026650001802050650002402068650001302092650001602105650001102121650001502132650002202147650001702169651001902186653001502205700001402220700001902234700001702253773009402270852000902364856009002373930003302463945002502496946001102521655001202532IND4392005520221121173637.0070531e20070430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439200552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP2001 aLi, K.Y.10aModeling the hydrological impact of land-use change in West Africa  ap. 258-268.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNumerical simulations of idealized deforestation and overgrazing are performed for the Niger and Lake Chad basins of West Africa with a terrestrial ecosystem model IBIS (integrated biosphere simulator) and an aquatic transport model THMB (terrestrial hydrology model with biogeochemistry). The study reveals how land use changes affect hydrological regimes at the watershed scale. The results show that tropical forests, due to being situated in the regions of highest rainfall and exerting strong influence on evapotranspiration, have a disproportionately large impact on the water balance of the entire basin. Total deforestation (clearcutting) increases the simulated runoff ratio from 0.15 to 0.44, and the annual streamflow by 35-65%, depending on location in the basin, although forests occupy only a small portion (<5%) of the total basin area. Complete removal of grassland and savanna, which occupy much greater areas of the basins, result in an increase in simulated annual streamflow by 33-91%. The numerical simulations indicate that the hydrological response to progressive land cover change is non-linear and exhibits a threshold effect. There is no significant impact on the water yield and river discharge when the deforestation (thinning) percentage is below 50% or the overgrazing percentage below 70% for savanna and 80% for grassland areas; however, the water yield is increased dramatically when land cover change exceeds these thresholds. This threshold effect is a combined result of the non-linearity of the separate response of transpiration and soil and canopy evaporation to the imposed land cover changes. 3aland use change 3aevapotranspiration 3astream flow 3arivers 3atropical forests 3aforested watersheds 3adeforestation 3awatershed hydrology 3asavannas 3aovergrazing 3arunoff 3agrasslands 3ahydrologic models 3aclearcutting 3aWestern Africa 0awatersheds1 aCoe, M.T.1 aRamankutty, N.1 aJong, R. de.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2007 Apr. 30, v. 337, no. 3-4 p.258-268dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.01.0383Available from publisher's Web site.  a20080827b20080905c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/08/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02603naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001700175245013200192300001300324500002400337520141200361650002101773650002001794650002501814650002301839651001401862653001901876653002501895700002501920773010501945852000902050856008902059930003302148945002502181946001102206655001202217IND4392004220221121140310.0070531e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439200422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2006.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF100 0aX200 0aX1001 aUrcola, H.A.12aA stochastic dominance method for incorporating yield monitor data into the hybrid and variety decisions of Argentinean farmers  ap. 4-12.  aIncludes references  aThis paper presents a computer-based method that uses stochastic dominance techniques to combine yield monitor data and information from traditional hybrid and variety trials in guiding farm level seed choices. This choice is important since it affects farm profits and risks. The proposed method uses a non-parametric approach that takes into account information that is not easily summarized by statistical parameters, and would work with any type of distribution. The proposed method selects cultivars that have smaller probabilities of low yields, thus are more risk efficient than the ones selected by traditional methods. Therefore, the proposed method can potentially improve the choice of hybrids and varieties. An example of how this method can be applied is developed using data from the South-East region of the Buenos Aires province, Argentina. This country has more combine yield monitors than any other Latin American country and yield trials are conducted every year by farmers, farmer associations and research institutions. Therefore, the technology and data required to implement the proposed method are widely available. Advantages of the proposed method are discussed and presented graphically, and limitations are identified. The proposed method can be easily incorporated in computer software that automates the statistical procedures allowing its use by a broad sector of agriculture. 3ayield monitoring 3arisk management 3astochastic processes 3aselection criteria 3aArgentina 0aseed selection 0astochastic dominance1 aLowenberg-DeBoer, J.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2007 Aug., v. 58, no. 1 p.4-12dElsevierx0168-16997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2006.12.0093Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070607b20070702c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/06/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03309naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156100001700165245011000182300001700292500002400309520195700333650001902290650001902309650002102328650001502349650002502364650002002389650002802409650002202437650001102459650003202470650002302502650002702525650002302552700001502575773010702590852000902697856008802706930003302794945002502827946001102852655001202863IND4392004320221121140239.0070531e20070223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439200432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2005.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF8311 aMorkunas, I.14aThe possible involvement of peroxidase in defense of yellow lupine embryo axes against Fusarium oxysporum  ap.  185-194.  aIncludes references  aPeroxidase activity (EC 1.11.1.7) towards phenolic substrates, i.e. pyrogallol, syringaldazine and guaiacol, and ascorbate peroxidase activity (EC 1.11.1.11) were analyzed in embryo axes of Lupinus luteus L. cv. Polo cultured on Heller medium for 96 h after inoculation with the necrotrophic fungus Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. Schlecht lupini. Four variants were compared: inoculated embryo axes cultured with 60 mM sucrose (+Si) or without it (-Si), and non-inoculated embryo axes cultured with 60 mM sucrose (+Sn) or without it (-Sn). Between 0 and 96 h of culture, peroxidase activity towards the phenolic substrates increased in all variants except -Si, where a decrease was noted in peroxidase activity towards syringaldazine and guaiacol, but not towards pyrogallol. In +Si tissues, a considerable increase in enzyme activity towards these substrates was recorded starting from 72 h of culture. Lignin content of +Si tissues increased already at the first stage of infection, i.e. 24 h after inoculation. Additionally, in +Sn tissues, high ascorbate peroxidase activity was observed during the culture. Its activity increased in +Si tissues, beginning at 72 h after inoculation. However, this was lower than in +Sn tissues. At 72 h after inoculation, a considerably stronger development of the infection was observed in -Si than in +Si tissues during our earlier research [Morkunas, I. et al., 2005. Sucrose-stimulated accumulation of isoflavonoids as a defense response of lupine to Fusarium oxysporum. Plant Physiol Biochem 2005; 43: 363-73]. Both peroxidases assayed towards phenolic substrates and ascorbate peroxidase was less active in -Si tissues than in -Sn tissues. Hydrogen peroxide concentration was much higher in -Si than in +Si tissues. These results indicate that peroxidases may be some of the elements of the defense system that are stimulated by sucrose in yellow lupine embryo axes in response to infection caused by F. oxysporum. 3aLupinus luteus 3aembryo (plant) 3aseed germination 3aperoxidase 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aenzyme activity 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alignin 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aplant biochemistry1 aGmerek, J.0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2007 Feb. 23, v. 164, no. 2 p. 185-194dUrban & Fischerx0176-16177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2005.11.0053Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070625b20070702c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/06/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02522naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168072000900177100001800186245012700204300001600331500002400347500001500371520091100386650002301297650002101320650001901341650001301360650002201373650001701395650002601412650001201438650001601450650001201466650001501478650001801493650002001511650002301531650002201554650001301576650001201589650001901601653001901620700001801639700001901657773011101676852000901787856009101796930003301887945002501920946001101945655001201956IND4392002820221121103631.0070531e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439200282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2007.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ400 0aQ100 0aQ500 0aX1001 aPeralta, J.M.10aPrediction of heat capacity, density and freezing point of liquid refrigerant solutions using an excess Gibbs energy model  ap. 548-558.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aImmersion chilling and freezing (ICF) of foods use aqueous solutions at low temperature that are considered secondary refrigerants.

PPV isolates are grouped into seven distinct strains. The minor PPV-W strain was established recently for the divergent W3174 isolate found in Canada. Here, the partial or complete genomic sequences of four PPV-W isolates from Latvia have been determined. The completely sequenced isolates LV-141pl and LV-145bt share 93.1 and 92.1% nucleotide identity, respectively, with isolate W3174, with two regions of higher (>20%) divergence in the P1/HC-Pro and NIa (VPg) regions. Further analyses demonstrated that these two regions correspond to two independent recombination events in the W3174 genome, one involving PPV-M (approximate genome positions 692 to 1424) and the other PPV-D (nucleotides 5672 to 5789). The LV-141pl and LV-145bt isolates appear to be representatives of the “ancestral” PPV-W strain, not affected by recombination. The PPV-W intrastrain variability is substantially higher than that of all other PPV strains, with potential implications for the serological detection of PPV-W isolates. A PPV-W-specific primer pair has been developed, allowing the specific reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction detection of all five presently available W isolates. The characterization of these new PPV-W isolates sheds light on PPV-W evolutionary history, further supports the hypothesis of its East-European origin, and opens the way for the biological and epidemiological characterization of this poorly known PPV strain. 3aPlum pox virus 3agenome 3anucleotide sequences 3anucleotides 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atrees 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBiological Evolution 2aGene Expression Regulation, Viral 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenome, Viral 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlum Pox Virusxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aReassortant Viruses 2aRecombinant Proteins 2aViral Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 3aCanada 3aLatvia1 aMalinowski, Tadeusz1 aPredajna, Lukas1 aPupola, Neda1 aDekena, Dzintra1 aMichalczuk, Lech1 aCandresse, Thierry0 tPhytopathology.g2011 Aug., v. 101, no. 8 p.980-985dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-12-10-03343Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03732naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245011400193300001600307520133000323650002801653650002001681650001201701650003001713650004301743650003301786650003501819650002901854650002801883650003201911650005701943650005002000650006402050650004002114650004402154650000902198650002302207650004402230650002902274650004602303650004602349653003102395653003802426653002902464700002002493700001902513700002202532700002202554700002002576700001902596700001902615700002402634700001902658700002402677700002102701700002302722700001902745773013702764852000902901856009202910930003303002946001103035655001203046IND4443438520221121103618.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444343852DNAL7 a208463602pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-695X.2010.00731.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNobutani, Kentaro10aHelicobacter heilmannii can induce gastric lymphoid follicles in mice via a Peyer's patch-independent pathway  ap. 156-164.  aHelicobacter heilmannii induces gastric lymphoid follicles in mice. However, the pathogenic mechanisms behind the induction of gastric lymphoid follicles by H. heilmannii infection have not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of Peyer's patches (PP) in H. heilmannii-induced immune responses and the development of gastric lymphoid follicles. C57BL/6J and PP deficient mice were infected with H. heilmannii, and in addition to histological and immunohistological examinations, the expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in gastric mucosa were investigated. Gastric lymphoid follicle formation and the infiltration of dendritic cells, B cells, and helper T cells were milder in the PP-deficient mice 1 month after infection, but they were similar in both types of mice after 3 months. The mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor α and CC chemokine ligand 2 were significantly high in the H. heilmannii-infected groups, and CXC chemokine ligand 13 expression was significantly increased in the infected C57BL/6J wild-type mice 1 month after infection. These results suggest that PP are not essential for the formation and development of gastric lymphoid follicles induced by H. heilmannii infection, although they are involved in the speed of gastric lymphoid follicle formation. 3aHelicobacter heilmannii 3aPeyer's patches 2aAnimals 2aB-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aCD4-Positive T-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aChemokine CCL2xbiosynthesis 2aChemokine CXCL13xbiosynthesis 2aChemokinesxbiosynthesis 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesis 2aDendritic Cellsximmunology 2aGastric Mucosaximmunologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aGastritisximmunologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aHelicobacter Infectionsximmunologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aHelicobacter heilmanniiximmunology 2aLymphoid Tissueximmunologyxpathology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aPeyer's Patchesximmunologyxpathology. 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aT-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducerximmunology 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxbiosynthesis 0agastric lymphoid follicles 0amucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 0atertiary lymphoid tissue1 aYoshida, Masaru1 aNishiumi, Shin1 aNishitani, Yosuke1 aTakagawa, Tetsuya1 aTanaka, Hiroshi1 aYamamoto, Koji1 aMimura, Takuya1 aBensuleiman, Yahaya1 aOta, Hiroyoshi1 aTakahashi, Shinichi1 aMatsui, Hidenori1 aNakamura, Masahiko1 aAzuma, Takeshi0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2010 Nov., v. 60, no. 2 p.156-164dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0928-82447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-695X.2010.00731.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03189naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001800163245008700181300001600268500002400284520135200308650002501660650002501685650002601710650001101736650001201747650001901759650002201778650001401800650000901814650001401823650004301837650000801880650001401888650001001902650001601912650003201928650005201960650002702012650003302039650003902072650003302111650003102144650001702175651001202192651001202204700001702216700001802233700001702251700001702268700001802285700001902303700001902322700002002341773010902361852000902470856008402479655001202563IND4461476320221121103612.0110815s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446147632DNAL7 a213234682pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-07-10-01882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, L.K.10aFusarium Head Blight of Cereals in Denmark: Species Complex and Related Mycotoxins  ap. 960-969.  aIncludes references  aQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction differentiating 10 Fusarium spp. and Microdochium nivale or M. majus was applied to a total of 396 grain samples of wheat, barley, triticale, oat, and rye sampled across Denmark from 2003 to 2007, along with selected samples of wheat and barley from 1957 to 2000, to determine incidence and abundance of individual Fusarium spp. The mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol, zearalenone, T-2, and HT-2 were quantified using liquid chromatography–double mass spectrometry. Major differences in the Fusarium species complex among the five cereals as well as great yearly variation were seen. Fusarium graminearum, F. culmorum, and F. avenaceum were dominant in wheat, with DON as the dominant mycotoxin. F. langsethiae, F. culmorum, and F. avenaceum were dominant in barley and oat, leading to relatively high levels of the mycotoxins T-2 and HT-2. F. graminearum, F. culmorum, and F. avenaceum dominated in triticale and rye. The nontoxigenic M. nivale/majus were present in significant amounts in all cereal species. Wheat and barley samples from 1957 to 1996 exhibited no or very low amounts of F. graminearum, indicating a recent increase of this pathogen.

Cell constants at atmospheric pressure were determined with KCl standards and calculated against standard data, while cell constants under pressure were estimated assuming isotropic compression. Measured conductivities of NaCl solutions under pressure were within 5.7% of previously reported data at pressures up to 800 MPa and temperatures to 61 °C. Electrical conductivity of NaCl and KCl solutions, orange juice, apple juice, tomato juice, and soybean oil were measured in triplicate in 100 MPa increments from 0.1 to 800 MPa. 0.01 m salt solutions were measured at 25 and 50 °C; 0.1 m salt solutions, juice and oil samples were measured at 25 °C. Results show conductivity of salt solutions and juice samples increased as a function of pressure, peaking between 200 and 500 MPa and decreasing above 500 MPa. Except for soybean oil, pressure had a significant effect (p < 0.01) on electrical conductivity for all samples. Temperature had a significant effect (p < 0.01) on electrical conductivity of 0.01 m salt solutions at all pressures.

Because the disease occurs throughout rainy spring seasons, the effect of temperature and wetness duration on disease development was evaluated in controlled studies. The lowest inoculum concentration where disease developed on leaves was 104 conidia/ml. Longer wetness durations were needed for leaves than for blossoms and disease increased linearly with increasing wetness durations. Inoculation temperature mainly affected final disease levels. Temperature during incubation affected the rate of disease development, while final disease levels were very similar at 10, 15, or 20°C. An analysis of covariance was performed to compare regressions of the effects of wetness and temperature on disease development for several almond cultivars. For blossom inoculations at 15°C in growth-chamber studies, a common slope model was statistically sufficient to describe all four cultivars. Cultivar Nonpareil (NP) had a significantly (P < 0.05) lower adjusted means at the midpoint than cultivars Carmel (CA), NePlus Ultra (NU), and Wood Colony (WC). For blossom inoculations at 20°C and for leaf inoculations at all temperatures evaluated, an unequal slope model was statistically justified for comparing regression lines. For blossoms, the slopes were significantly different (P < 0.05) for pair-wise comparisons of CA-NU, NU-WC, and NP-WC. For leaves, most of the cultivars responded differently to infection at different temperatures. Two of the pair-wise comparisons demonstrated unequal slopes at all three temperatures evaluated (i.e., NU-NP and NU-WC). Overall, for blossoms and leaves, NP was the least susceptible, NU was the most susceptible, and WC and CA showed an intermediate susceptibility. In field blossom and fruit studies, a common slope model was statistically sufficient to describe all four cultivars. NP had a significantly lower midpoint (i.e., was less susceptible) than CA or WC, whereas no significant difference (P > 0.1) occurred in comparisons between CA and WC. 3aColletotrichum acutatum 3aalmonds 3aanthracnose 3aconidia 3acovariance 3acultivars 3ainoculum 3aleaves 3amodels 3aspring 3atemperature 2aColletotrichumxphysiology 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiology 2aPrunusxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aTemperature 2aWater1 aForster, H.1 aAdaskaveg, J.E.0 tPhytopathology.g2011 Aug., v. 101, no. 8 p.1013-1020dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-07-10-01933Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02120naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245014900163300001800312520062500330650002700955650002800982650003201010650001301042650002001055650003501075650001201110650001401122650005201136650001501188650001601203650001101219653003901230653002301269700002201292700002501314700002201339700002601361700002401387773011301411852000901524856008501533930003301618946001101651655001201662IND4444698920221121103613.0101105e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444469892DNAL7 a10.1007/s11248-010-9372-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Guowen 10aExpression of Caenorhabditis elegans RNA-directed RNA polymerase in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster does not affect morphological development  ap. 1121-1128.  aDrosophila melanogaster, along with all insects and the vertebrates, lacks an RdRp gene.

Activation of the gene was performed by crossing these lines to flies carrying the GAL4 transgene under the control of various Drosophila enhancers. RT-PCR confirmed the successful expression of each RdRp gene. The resulting phenotypes indicated that introduction of the RdRp genes had no effect on D. melanogaster morphological development. 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3acrossing 3agene activation 3agenetically modified organisms 3ainsects 3aphenotype 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atransgenes 3avertebrates 3ayeasts 0aRNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) 0aMicroRNAs (miRNAs)1 aSaint, Robert B. 1 aHelliwell, Chris A. 1 aBehm, Carolyn A. 1 aWaterhouse, Peter M. 1 aGordon, Karl H.

A few of sensors were switched-off by multivariate analysis of variance and loading analysis. The responses signals of sensor W5C, W1S, W1W, W2S, W2W and W3S were chose for the pattern recognition. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the signal of optimized sensor array, the five different stored duration of wheat were discriminated well and each group has strong convergence. The results obtained by network I (for optimized sensor array) presented the higher percent of correct classifications in comparison to network II (for original sensor array). The optimization of sensor array can improve the recognition performance of the electronic nose. The results obtained indicated that the electronic nose could discriminate successfully wheat of different age. 3apostharvest treatment 3ashelf life 3afood storage 3awheat 3aprincipal component analysis 3adynamic programming 3afood grains 3aelectronic nose 3amultivariate analysis 0aanalysis of variance 0astorage quality1 aWang, J.1 aTian, X.1 aYu, H.1 aYu, Y.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2007 Oct., v. 82, no. 4 p.403-408dElsevier Science Pub.

Desiree) under uniaxial compression  ap. 427-435.  aIncludes references  aUniaxial compression tests were performed on potato flesh. Cylindrical samples of heights (5, 10, 15 and 20 mm) and diameters (19.05 and 25.4 mm) were tested under non-lubricated, lubricated and increased friction conditions. Sample flatness (λ = 4height/diameter of sample) of specimens ranged between 0.79 and 4.20. Displacement rate effect was also examined by performing tests at 50, 100, 200 and 400 mm min-1. Measured fracture parameters were Cauchy strain (εC), engineering stress (F/A0), true stress (F/Af), work of fracture (Wf), and the apparent elastic modulus (E). Fracture parameters showed a dependence upon sample flatness when no lubricant was used, which decreased with lubrication and increased with increasing friction conditions. A lower flatness ratio led to an increase in stress at a given strain level, i.e. the material appeared to be stiffer than it truly is. Shorter samples and increased friction resulted in an observed dependence upon displacement rate; a higher displacement rate resulted in a lower fracture stresses for a given strain level. Lubrication increases significantly the Cauchy strain, and reduces the true stress, values. Cauchy strain was found to increase with displacement rate and decreased when the flatness ratio increased. Engineering stress, true stress, and work of fracture decreased as displacement rate and sample flatness are increased. Lubrication was found to reduce the effect of displacement rate on the Cauchy strain. Sample flatness influenced engineering stress, work of fracture and apparent elastic modulus, whereas displacement rate influenced true stress and apparent elastic modulus. Increased friction resulted in a higher sample flatness influence on all fracture parameters. Results show that for any compression test with potatoes, it is possible to determine optimum conditions that will minimize the effects of the test on fracture parameters. 3apotatoes 3aSolanum tuberosum subsp. tuberosum 3adiameter 3adeformation 3acompressibility 3afriction 3amodulus of elasticity 3ashear stress 3asurface area 3adimensions 3aequations 3amathematical models1 aAlvarez, M.D.1 aGil, M.J.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2007 Oct., v. 82, no. 4 p.427-435dElsevier Science Pub.

In 1982, 16.9% of the county was marshland and only 0.7% was dedicated to paddy fields. By 2005, 12.9% was marshland and 7.7% was paddy field. During this period, the agricultural population in the county rose from 28.5×10(3) to 79.4×10(3), and the numbers of households from 3.7×10(3) to 26.1×10(3). At the same time, the price of paddy and the productivity of paddies also increased. All these pressures combined to drive substantial changes to the marsh and paddy field. This paper considers the loss of the marsh ecosystem in terms of its total value and value per unit area, and assesses the overall benefits to people from the changes in paddy production. The authors also identify the total lost value of carbon formerly sequestered in the marsh compared with the net agricultural gains. Carbon sequestration lost a value of 55.50×10(6) Chinese Yuan (CNY; 100 CNY was equivalent to roughly US$12 in 2005), which was considerably less than the value of products (272.42×10(6)CNY) returned from the paddy fields. In terms of the benefits to society, the marsh created between 210.8×10(6) and 266.3×10(6) CNY, though the commercial/private benefits of the paddy field outweighed the benefits to society due to the fact that they are real while the societal benefits (although also real) have a monetary compensation that is hypothetical. Value per unit area of paddy field was much higher than that of the marsh except in 1982, before the people began to pursue more profitable private activities. Understanding the societal trade-offs between the contributions of a wetland ecosystem and agricultural expansion is a key ingredient in successful ecosystem management. 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aecosystem management 3aecosystems 3ahouseholds 3aingredients 3amarshes 3apaddies 3apeople 3aprices 3asociety 3aChina1 aLü, Xian'guo.1 aJiang, Ming1 aWang, Xi-gang0 tOutlook on agriculture.g2011 June, v. 40, no. 2 p.165-170x0030-72707nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02306naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245011900135300001400254500002400268520110900292650004101401650001301442650002901455650003301484650002501517650001201542650001401554650004101568650001001609650001201619650001301631650000901644650001901653650002301672650001601695651001001711700001801721700002601739773012201765852000901887655001201896IND4458339720221121071710.0110522s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445833972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadalia, Rajendra C.10aVariability in Volatile Terpenoid Compositions of Peppermint Cultivars and Some Wild Accession from Northern India  ap. 29-33.  aIncludes references  aThe terpenoid composition of different cultivars of peppermint (Mentha piperita L.) grown in Uttarakhand (India) and accessions collected from wild were analyzed by capillary GC and GC/MS.

Although the major characteristic constituents were the same in all oils, there were considerable variations in their quantitative makeup. The contents of menthol and menthofuran were found relatively higher in all cultivars grown in foothills compared to mid-hills. Interestingly, menthofuran, a characteristic compound of the peppermint oil, was detected either at trace level or as a minor component in all the three wild accessions collected from mid-hills.

The objective of this study is to develop a cause and effect model in uncertainty using the fuzzy set theory and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. A framework for evaluating EKMC is proposed. An approach of fuzzy linguistic is proposed to evaluate the firm EKMC. The evaluation results of EKMC obtained through the proposed approach are objective and unbiased due to two reasons. Firstly, the results are generated by a group of experts in the presence of motile attributes. Secondly, the fuzzy linguistic approach has more advantage to reduce distortion and losing of information. Through evaluating the result of EKMC, managers could judge the necessity to improve the EKMC and determine which criteria are the needed directions to improve. The managerial implication and conclusions are discussed. 3adecision making 3aexperts 3amanagers 3amodel uncertainty 3amodels 3aquantitative analysis 2aDecision Making 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFuzzy Logic 2aModels, Theoretical 0aKnowledge management capability 0aDEMATEL 0aFuzzy set theory0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 Feb., v. 161, no. 1-4 p.549-564dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0767-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100108b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04069naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100001600204245008700220300001600307500002400323500001500347520239100362650002202753650001202775650001902787650001002806650001802816650002102834650002002855650002002875650001402895650002302909650001702932650002002949650002402969650001602993650001203009650001803021650001403039650001703053650001703070650002203087650001403109653001903123700001503142700001403157700001603171773008803187852000903275856009003284930003303374945002503407946001103432655001203443IND4390684420221120234356.0070427e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439068442DNAL7 a220609802pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL500 0aL600 0aQ5021 aKarim, S.A.10aCarcass traits of Kheri lambs maintained on different system of feeding management  ap. 395-401.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe study was conducted on 6-month-old finisher lambs of the Kheri breed raised under extensive range management (G1), grazing with ad libitum concentrate supplementation (G2) or intensive feeding (G3) to assess dressing yield, cutability of standard cuts, composition of the carcass and the efficiency of mutton production from the three defined systems. The weaning weight of the lambs in the three groups was similar while the finishing weight, total body weight gain in the experiment, average daily gain and the percent feed conversion efficiency were higher (P < 0.01) in G2 and G3 than G1. The pre slaughter weight (PSW), empty live weight (ELW), hot carcass weight and hot carcass weight with edible offal was higher (P < 0.01) in G2 and G3 fed on a high plane of nutrition than G1 raised under extensive range management. The dressing percent in terms of live weight (LW) and empty live weight (ELW) was also higher in G2 and G3 than G1. The loin eye area as an index of muscle growth was also higher in G2 and G3 than G1. Although the weights of standard cuts were generally higher in G2 and G3 due to higher PSW, as proportions of half carcass they were similar in the three groups, except the rack cut, which was higher in G2 and G3. The cut proportions pooled for the three groups averaged 33.2%, 12.3%, 13.3%, 24.9% and 16.3% of half carcass for leg, loin, rack, neck and shoulder and breast and fore shank, respectively. The depot fat (Caul and kidney fat) accretion was higher in G2 and G3 than G1. The composition of the half carcass indicated that lean percent was higher (P < 0.01) in G1 and G2 than G3 while sub cutaneous and intra muscular fat content were generally higher (P < 0.01) in G2 and G3 and KOH bone percent was higher (P < 0.05) in G1 and G2 than G3. The results indicated that the growth performance was better, feed conversion efficiency, carcass yield and dressing percentage higher in lambs maintained under grazing with supplementation and intensive feeding than extensive range management. The carcass separable fat content was 8% under extensive range management while it was 12% and 16% in semi intensive and intensive system of feeding management indicating that the carcass was of acceptable quality. The loin eye area reflected the trends of pre slaughter weight and was higher in intensive and semi intensive than extensive range management. 3aextensive farming 3agrazing 3acarcass weight 3alambs 3acarcass yield 3aslaughter weight 3aliveweight gain 3aovine carcasses 3afinishing 3aad libitum feeding 3asheep breeds 3afeed conversion 3adressing percentage 3afeed intake 3abackfat 3alipid content 3alamb meat 3ameat quality 3alamb feeding 3afeed concentrates 3alean meat 0alamb carcasses1 aPorwal, K.1 aKumar, S.1 aSingh, V.K.0 tMeat science.g2007 July, v. 76, no. 3 p.395-401dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.06.0083Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070626b20070702c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/06/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02279naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162100001800171245007600189300001600265500002400281500001500305520080000320650001801120650001001138650005001148650001201198650001601210650001201226650001101238650001601249650003101265650001801296650002201314650001601336650001301352650001501365650002101380650001801401650002301419653001401442700001301456773012001469852000901589856009401598930003301692945002501725946001101750655001201761IND4390691820221120202159.0070427e20070501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439069182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2006.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ400 0aQ2001 aPinches, S.E.10aProduction in food of 1,3-pentadiene and styrene by Trichoderma species  ap. 182-185.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe ability of two strains of Trichoderma, isolated from food, to produce the Volatile Organic Compounds 1,3-pentadiene and styrene was investigated.

The taints were produced only in the presence of sorbic acid and cinnamic acid and were not synthesised de novo under the test conditions. Neither the conversion of cinnamic acid to styrene, nor the conversion of sorbic acid to 1,3-pentadiene by Trichoderma strains in foods has been previously reported.

One month after sensitization by subcutaneous inoculation with 100 mg of killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in oil, an intrapalpebral tuberculosis test was administered in the right eyelid. All animals had reactions that ranged from grade II grade V. The animals were then randomly allotted to three groups. Ten animals were inoculated with a rubeola-containing veterinary vaccine (VET), 10 were inoculated with a human measles vaccine routinely used in macaque quarantine procedures (HUM), and 3 were used as unvaccinated controls. Intradermal tuberculosis tests were administered in the left eyelid and the skin of the abdomen at vaccination (day 0), and subsequent abdominal skin tests were performed on days 5, 14, and 28. In addition, intrapalpebral tests were conducted on day 28. A higher response in the rubeola antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) optical density (OD) results was observed in the VET-inoculated group at 14 days after inoculation. More significantly, two members of the HUM-vaccinated group had negative ELISA results after a single dose of vaccine. Three other members of the HUM-inoculated group had ELISA results that were near the OD cutoff value (0.15) and were retested by the measles indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test. Results for two of these animals were equivocal, where that for the third was positive. Two of the VET-inoculated group also had results near the OD cutoff value and retested positive by IFA. After administration of a 0.5 ml vaccine booster, the four HUM-inoculated animals testing negative or equivocal had ELISA OD values comparable to those in the VET-inoculated group after administration of a single dose of vaccine. All vaccinated animals had positive results of intradermal tuberculin tests at day 0 (48 h reading), although 10 of 10 VET-inoculated animals and 6 of 10 HUM-inoculated animals had below-baseline responses. At day 5 of 10 HUM-inoculated animals tested at their baseline values, whereas 1 of 10 VET-inoculated animals test positive at the baseline value. (The reactive HUM-inoculated animals would later have equivocal or negative values for measles tests and the VET-inoculated animal would have a low-positive result.) The control group had positive responses at both intervals. At day 14, 8 of 10 HUM-inoculated animals tested positive at baseline values, whereas values in 6 of 10 VET-inoculated animals had returned to baseline. At day 28, values in animals in both groups had returned to baseline. Small group sizes prevented statistical analysis of the immune response other than to confirm that the VET vaccine provided at least as adequate protection as did the HUM vaccine (at a lower cost). However, a strong negative correlation was seen between the response to vaccination and the response to subsequent tuberculin skin testing. 3aMacaca mulatta 3avaccination 3atuberculosis 3aquarantine 3atuberculin 3adelayed hypersensitivity 3aantibody formation 3adose response 3avaccines 0ameasles1 aSouthers, J.L.1 aThoen, C.O.1 aEasley, S.P.0 tComparative medicine.g1995 Apr., v. 45, no. 2 p.125-130x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02493naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245003900143300001600182520074800198650002400946650002100970650001800991650001501009650001501024650001701039650001801056650001201074650001801086650002001104650002701124650002001151650003801171650003401209650005701243650006301300650008201363650002201445650003101467650003301498650003901531653001301570653001201583700001801595700001401613700001501627700001401642700001501656700001501671700001501686700001901701700001301720773007801733852000901811930003301820945001301853946001301866655001201879IND2080070320221120181206.0980508e199606  tnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND208007032DNAL7 a87999392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobune, F.10aNonhuman primate models of measles  ap. 315-320.  aWild measles virus isolated in a marmoset lymphoblastoid B95a cell line induced rashes and Koplik's spots when inoculated parenterally in cynomolgus and squirrel monkeys.

Virus growth, as well as histologic lesions of necrosis and giant cell formation, was observed in the lymphoid tissues. Thus clinical signs of acute measles were successfully induced in monkeys by inoculation with cell-culture-grown measles virus. These nonhuman primate models of measles will be useful for study of the pathogenesis of acute measles virus infection in terms of generalized clinical signs of disease, leukopenia, and changes in the lymphocyte subsets. 3aMacaca fascicularis 3aSaimiri sciureus 3aanimal models 3acell lines 3aleukopenia 3apathogenesis 3aT-lymphocytes 2aAnimals 2aCD4-CD8 Ratio 2aCells, Cultured 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aLeukocyte Count 2aLymph Nodesxpathologyxvirology. 2aMacaca fascicularisxvirology 2aMeaslesxbloodxpathologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aMonkey Diseasesxbloodxpathologyxtransmissionxvirology. 2aMorbillivirusxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aSaimirixvirology 2aSkinxpathologyxvirology. 2aSpleenxpathologyxvirology. 2aThymus Glandxpathologyxvirology. 0asymptoms 0ameasles1 aTakahashi, H.1 aTerao, K.1 aOhkawa, T.1 aʻAmi, Y.1 aSuzaki, Y.1 aNagata, N.1 aSakata, H.1 aYamanouchi, K.1 aC., Kai.0 tComparative medicine.g1996 June, v. 46, no. 3 p.315-320x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02439naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001100129245010800140300001600248500001500264520105200279650001601331650003001347650001601377650002201393650000901415650001601424650002201440650002401462650001201486650002601498650002301524650002701547650002801574650003601602650001901638650003501657650000901692653001601701700001501717700002101732700001801753700001601771773007801787852000901865930003301874945001301907946001301920655001201933IND2196274920221120181200.0990105e199806  tnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219627492DNAL7 a100900242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, L.10aEffect of feeding of a cholesterol-reducing bacterium, Eubacterium coprostanoligenes, to germ-free mice  ap. 253-255.  a2019-12-05  aTwelve germ-free mice were used to evaluate the effect of orally administered Eubacterium coprostanoligenes (ATCC 51222) on serum cholesterol concentration. After 1 week of bacterial administration, serum cholesterol concentration of the experimental group (204.9 +/- 5.3 mg/dl, mean +/- SEM) tended to be lower than that of controls (213.7 +/- 5.9 mg/dl, mean +/- SEM). The hypocholesterolemic effect, however, was transient. Greater coprostanol-to-cholesterol ratios in feces of bacteria-fed mice also indicated a transient cholesterol-reducing action of E. coprostanoligenes in the intestine. Eubacterium coprostanoligenes did not colonize the intestine of E. coprostanoligenes-fed mice. Results indicate that the transient occurrence of E. coprostanoligenes in the digestive tract of E. coprostanoligenes-fed mice may decrease plasma cholesterol concentration, but colonization of the tract depends on monoassociation with another bacterium. Results also indicate that feeding of E. coprostanoligenes decreases blood cholesterol concentration. 3acoprostanol 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ablood serum 3agerm-free animals 3amice 3acholesterol 3afeces composition 3aoral administration 2aAnimals 2aCholestanolxanalysis 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEubacteriumxphysiology 2aFecesxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aGerm-Free Life 2aIntestine, Smallxmicrobiology 2aMice 0aEubacterium1 aBatt, S.M.1 aWannemuehler, M.1 aDispirito, A.1 aBeitz, D.C.0 tComparative medicine.g1998 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.253-255x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02252naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245004100148300001600189500001500205520083100220650002801051650001301079650003501092650001401127650001001141650002801151650001001179650001201189650001101201650002601212650002001238650002001258650001801278650003301296650005101329650003801380653001501418653002401433653002001457653001101477653002301488653002201511653002301533653002001556773007801576852000901654930003301663945001301696946001301709655001201722IND2196274020221120170459.0990105e199806  tnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219627402DNAL7 a100900202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichaels, M.G.10aXenotransplant-associated infections  ap. 228-233.  a2019-12-05  aXenotransplantation is considered increasingly as a solution to the current shortage of human organs for allotransplantation. In addition, it is being investigated as a treatment for a number of other diseases such as Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, and acquired immunodeficiency disease. The potential risk of novel zoonotic infections is a concern associated with these procedures. Accordingly, the role of animal microbial agents must be critically examined. This review examines the concerns and proposed mechanisms for xenogeneic infections and details what is known and what still needs to be learned as the field of xenotransplantation progresses. Emphasis is placed on microbial agents of baboons and swine because they are currently the most common species considered as donor sources for xenotransplantation. 3aSuid alphaherpesvirus 1 3azoonoses 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 3ascreening 3aPapio 3aHuman betaherpesvirus 5 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aHumans 2aOrgan Transplantation 2aPapioxvirology 2aSwinexvirology 2aTissue Donors 2aTissue and Organ Procurement 2aTransplantation, Heterologousxadverse effects 2aZoonosesxmicrobiologyxvirology. 0arecipients 0aHuman herpesvirus 5 0atransplantation 0adonors 0aliterature reviews 0agerm-free animals 0aSuid herpesvirus 1 0aanimal diseases0 tComparative medicine.g1998 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.228-233x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03364naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024002200119024001900141040001800160100002100178245010600199300001800305500002400323506007600347520182100423506003702244650001602281650001102297650001302308650001202321650001202333650002202345650001502367650002602382650003602408650004302444650000902487700002002496700001602516700001902532700002102551700002102572700002202593700001702615700001802632700001802650773010402668852000902772856007702781655001202858IND4458434020221207135233.0110527s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445843402DNAL7 a10.2337/dc10-19842doi7 aPMC31143432pmcid7 a215158422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowicka, Paulina10aUtility of Hemoglobin A₁c for Diagnosing Prediabetes and Diabetes in Obese Children and Adolescents  ap. 1306-1311.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: Hemoglobin A₁c (A1C) has emerged as a recommended diagnostic tool for identifying diabetes and subjects at risk for the disease. This recommendation is based on data in adults showing the relationship between A1C with future development of diabetes and microvascular complications. However, studies in the pediatric population are lacking. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied a multiethnic cohort of 1,156 obese children and adolescents without a diagnosis of diabetes (male, 40%/female, 60%). All subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and A1C measurement. These tests were repeated after a follow-up time of ~2 years in 218 subjects. RESULTS: At baseline, subjects were stratified according to A1C categories: 77% with normal glucose tolerance (A1C <5.7%), 21% at risk for diabetes (A1C 5.7-6.4%), and 1% with diabetes (A1C >6.5%). In the at risk for diabetes category, 47% were classified with prediabetes or diabetes, and in the diabetes category, 62% were classified with type 2 diabetes by the OGTT. The area under the curve receiver operating characteristic for A1C was 0.81 (95% CI 0.70-0.92). The threshold for identifying type 2 diabetes was 5.8%, with 78% specificity and 68% sensitivity. In the subgroup with repeated measures, a multivariate analysis showed that the strongest predictors of 2-h glucose at follow-up were baseline A1C and 2-h glucose, independently of age, ethnicity, sex, fasting glucose, and follow-up time. CONCLUSIONS: The American Diabetes Association suggested that an A1C of 6.5% underestimates the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes in obese children and adolescents. Given the low sensitivity and specificity, the use of A1C by itself represents a poor diagnostic tool for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in obese children and adolescents.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3aadults 3achildren 3afasting 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ahemoglobin 3amultivariate analysis 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3arisk1 aSantoro, Nicola1 aLiu, Haibei1 aLartaud, Derek1 aShaw, Melissa M.1 aGoldberg, Rachel1 aGuandalini, Cindy1 aSavoye, Mary1 aRose, Paulina1 aCaprio, Sonia0 tDiabetes care.g2011 June, v. 34, no. 6 p.1306-1311dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc10-19843Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02345naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245005200147300001600199520109400215650002401309650001701333650001401350650001701364650001801381650002301399650002601422650001201448650001601460650003701476650001101513650002901524650003601553650000901589650005901598650002101657650002401678700001901702700002001721773007801741852000901819930003301828945001301861946001301874655001201887IND2047150620221120144847.0950807e199410  tnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204715062DNAL7 a78449552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDethloff, L.A.10aGastric acid secretion in the cynomolgus monkey  ap. 468-471.  aGastric acid secretion was measured in male and female cynomolgus monkeys under basal conditions and in response to intravenous administration of pentagastrin (PG). There were no statistically significant differences between males and females in either basal or PG-stimulated gastric acid output. Neither were differences between males and females statistically significant when adjusted according to body weight. For both sexes combined, basal acid output was 17 +/- 20 microequivalents per hour. Intravenous infusion of PG stimulated gastric acid secretion at dose rates of 1 microgram/kg/h and greater. Maximal stimulation occurred at dose rates of 10 and 100 micrograms/kg/h, indicating gastric acid secretion plateaus above PG doses of 10 micrograms/kg. Acid secretion values in response to 100 micrograms of PG/kg/h for both sexes combined were 571 +/- 132 and 400 +/- 135 microequivalents/kg/h for peak acid output and maximum acid output, respectively. These data suggest that the cynomolgus monkey may be a useful model for gastric physiology studies of relevance to human beings. 3aMacaca fascicularis 3agastric acid 3asecretion 3apentagastrin 3aanimal models 3agender differences 3aintravenous injection 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aGastric Acidxsecretion. 2aMacaca fascicularisxphysiology 2aMale 2aPentagastrinxadministration & dosagexdiagnostic use. 2aReference Values 2aSex Characteristics1 aAltrogge, D.M.1 aGillhouse, K.A.0 tComparative medicine.g1994 Oct., v. 44, no. 5 p.468-471x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01921naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245003500166300001600201520084700217650001001064650001201074650002101086650001401107650001101121650003701132700002201169700002201191700002801213700002201241700002701263773013101290852000901421856008501430930003301515946001101548655001201559IND4431015220221120124842.0100108e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443101522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-009-0169-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiardina, Paola 10aLaccases: a never-ending story  ap. 369-385.  aLaccases (benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductases, EC 1.10.3.2) are blue multicopper oxidases that catalyze the oxidation of an array of aromatic substrates concomitantly with the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. In fungi, laccases carry out a variety of physiological roles during their life cycle. These enzymes are being increasingly evaluated for a variety of biotechnological applications due to their broad substrate range. In this review, the most recent studies on laccase structural features and catalytic mechanisms along with analyses of their expression are reported and examined with the aim of contributing to the discussion on their structure-function relationships. Attention has also been paid to the properties of enzymes endowed with unique characteristics and to fungal laccase multigene families and their organization. 3afungi 3alaccase 3amultigene family 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3astructure-activity relationships1 aFaraco, Vincenza 1 aPezzella, Cinzia 1 aPiscitelli, Alessandra 1 aVanhulle, Sophie 1 aSannia, G.q(Giovanni)0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2010 Feb., v. 67, no. 3 p.369-385dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-009-0169-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100108b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01982naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245006200136300001600198500015600214500001800370500001500388520075800403650002001161650002801181650001801209650002801227650002801255650002301283650002301306653000901329653003501338653001901373700002201392700003501414773007401449852000901523930003301532945000801565946001101573655001201584991608647420742620221120124918.0841011s1982    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840056812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvenell, Alison.10aDietary fibre in human nutrition: A bibliography for 1979  ap. 199-232.  aNumerous citations are in Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Roumanian, Russian, Spanish and Swedish languages.  aBibliography.  a2019-12-04  aA bibliography of the 1979 literature on dietary fiber in nutrition includes 528 citations divided into 6 categories: gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, metabolic, fiber in foods, dietary fiber hypothesis, and miscellaneous topics.

We hypothesized that low-dose aspirin would be beneficial in patients receiving insulin therapy, as a high-risk group. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study is a subanalysis of the Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis With Aspirin for Diabetes (JPAD) trial--a randomized, controlled, open-label trial. We randomly assigned 2,539 patients with type 2 diabetes and no previous cardiovascular disease to the low-dose aspirin group (81 or 100 mg daily) or to the no-aspirin group. The median follow-up period was 4.4 years. We investigated the effect of low-dose aspirin on preventing atherosclerotic events in groups receiving different diabetes management. RESULTS: At baseline, 326 patients were treated with insulin, 1,750 with oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs), and 463 with diet alone. The insulin group had the longest history of diabetes, the worst glycemic control, and the highest prevalence of diabetic microangiopathies. The diet-alone group had the opposite characteristics. The incidence of atherosclerotic events was 26.6, 14.6, and 10.4 cases per 1,000 person-years in the insulin, OHA, and diet-alone groups, respectively. In the insulin and OHA groups, low-dose aspirin did not affect atherosclerotic events (insulin: hazard ratio [HR] 1.19 [95% CI 0.60-2.40]; OHA: HR 0.84 [0.57-1.24]). In the diet-alone group, low-dose aspirin significantly reduced atherosclerotic events, despite the lowest event rates (HR 0.21 [0.05-0.64]). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose aspirin reduced atherosclerotic events predominantly in the diet-alone group and not in the insulin or OHA groups.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaspirin 3aatherosclerosis 3adiet 3aglycemic control 3ahypoglycemic agents 3ainsulin 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3atherapeutics 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAspirinxadministration & dosage 2aAtherosclerosisxdrug therapyxprevention & control. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xcomplicationsxdiet therapyxdrug therapy. 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxdrug therapyxetiology. 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aInsulinxtherapeutic use 2aMiddle Aged1 aMorimoto, Takeshi1 aOgawa, Hisao1 aKanauchi, Masao1 aNakayama, Masafumi1 aUemura, Shiro1 aDoi, Naofumi1 aJinnouchi, Hideaki1 aWaki, Masako1 aSoejima, Hirofumi1 aSakuma, Mio1 aSaitō, Yoshihiko.0 tDiabetes care.g2011 June, v. 34, no. 6 p.1277-1283dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc10-24513Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02686naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002200128245007200150300001800222520099800240650001401238650002601252650001401278650001801292650001701310650001201327650001901339650005001358650004101408650001201449650004601461650005201507650002101559650001401580650001101594650004301605650001401648650003601662650004201698650003301740650003601773650001201809650005401821650003101875653001401906700002201920700001601942773010801958852000902066930003302075945001302108946001102121655001202132IND2048146720221120063234.0951006e199508  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204814672DNAL7 a85353022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoya-Quiles, M.R.10aEffect of the pyrethroid insecticide allethrin on membrane fluidity  ap. 1299-1308.  aAllethrin is a widely used pyrethroid insecticide with an alkenylmethylcyclopentenolone group in its structure. We have analyzed its interaction with model and native membranes using DPH and its polar derivative TMA-DPH fluorescence polarization. Allethrin modified the bilayer order in the temperature range of the phase transition when incorporated into liposomes made with dimyristoyl-(DMPC), dipalmitoyl-(DPPC) and distearoyl-(DSPC) phosphatidylcholine. In DMPC:allethrin mixtures the pyrethroid decreased the bilayer order in the gel phase, without altering the liquid-crystalline one. In native membranes, DPH and TMA-DPH fluorescence polarization remained unchanged after incubation with allethrin. The release of hemoglobin was notably facilitated by the incorporation of allethrin into human erythrocytes. The results are discussed in terms of a possible aggregation of the insecticide in the lipid bilayer to create special domains with a consequent increase in membrane instability. 3aallethrin 3amembrane permeability 3ahemolysis 3aphospholipids 3aerythrocytes 3amammals 3alipid bilayers 2a1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholinexchemistry 2aAllethrinsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aDimyristoylphosphatidylcholinexchemistry 2aErythrocyte Membranexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aFluorescent Dyes 2aHemolysis 2aHumans 2aInsecticidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aLiposomes 2aMembrane Fluidityxdrug effects 2aMicrosomesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMuscle, Skeletalxmetabolism 2aPhosphatidylcholinesxchemistry 2aRabbits 2aSarcoplasmic Reticulumxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 0aliposomes1 aMunoz-Delgado, E.1 aVidal, C.J.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1995 Aug., v. 36, no. 6 p.1299-1308x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02393naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245013600145300001600281520080800297650002301105650001201128650001401140650001301154650002201167650001701189650001201206650001101218650003101229650005201260650002601312650003201338650003401370650000901404650003001413650003001443650002201473650005401495650001701549650003201566653002601598653001501624653001801639700001801657700001601675773010601691852000901797930003301806945001301839946001101852655001201863IND2045497520221120054049.0950410e199502  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204549752DNAL7 a76633872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlinka, A.V.10aRoles of juvenile hormone, a brain factor and adipokinetic hormone in regulation of vitellogenin biosynthesis in Locusta migratoria  ap. 323-328.  aIn maturing adult female migratory locusts, the rises in JH and Vg in the hemolymph are greatly accelerated by enriched feeding; hereafter the JH titer fluctuates with vitellogenic cycles, falling to a low level at the oviposition stage. In fat bodies incubated in vitro, the JH analog, methoprene, and brain extract from well-fed locusts (but not starved locusts) stimulated Vg synthesis synergistically. Repeated washing of fat bodies from oviposition stage locusts led to a rise in Vg synthesis after 4 h, which was prevented by addition of locust adipokinetic hormone (AKH). We conclude that at least three hormonal factors interact in the control of Vg synthesis in locust fat body: JH and a brain factor stimulate, reflecting development and nutrition, while AKH inhibits at the oviposition stage. 3aLocusta migratoria 3afemales 3ahemolymph 3afat body 3ajuvenile hormones 3abiosynthesis 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGrasshoppersxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aHemolymphxmetabolism 2aInsect Hormonesxphysiology 2aJuvenile Hormonesxphysiology 2aMale 2aNeuropeptidesxphysiology 2aOligopeptidesxphysiology 2aOvaryxphysiology 2aPyrrolidonecarboxylic Acidxanalogs & derivatives 2aTime Factors 2aVitellogeninsxbiosynthesis 0aadipokinetic hormones 0aregulation 0avitellogenins1 aKleiman, A.M.1 aWyatt, G.R.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1995 Feb., v. 35, no. 2 p.323-328x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01714naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245018500130300001600315500002400331520073600355650002501091650002601116650001201142650002001154650001201174650001701186650001201203650000801215650001501223651001001238700001601248700002201264773008101286852000901367655001201376IND4458371320221120041853.0110527s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445837132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMwaura, Francis10aUsing research findings to formulate extension tools that incorporate stakeholders' aspirations: The case of tea farming in poverty reduction strategies among smallholders in Kenya  ap. 217-222.  aIncludes references  aKenya's tea research advisory committee (RAC) expressed its desire to tackle poverty and minimum landholding issues to improve the economics of tea farming in Kenya.

Plasmatic total cholesterol and triglyceride did not change in normal rats under the dietary regime, but both parameters decreased significantly in the diabetic animals after the consumption of either n-6 or n-3 fatty acids. Lipid analyses of erythrocyte membranes revealed a significant decrease in the total cholesterol together with an increase in the phospholipid amount in the diabetics compared to the normal rats. As a consequence, cholesterol/phospholipid ratio decreased in these groups of animals and markedly in those fed n-3 fatty acids. These changes would be responsible for the lower fluorescent polarization of DPH observed in the latter group. We conclude that equivalent and adequate amounts of dietary either n-6 or n-3 fatty acids produce plasmatic and red cell membrane lipid changes in diabetic rats that may improve the evolution of the disease. 3arats 3adietary fat 3adiabetes mellitus 3atriacylglycerols 3aerythrocytes 3acholesterol 3acell membranes 3ablood plasma 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aphospholipids 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effects 2aBlood Proteinsxchemistryxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxbloodxdrug therapy. 2aDiphenylhexatrienexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aErythrocyte Membranexchemistryxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xpharmacology 2aFatty Acids, Omega-6 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxpharmacology 2aFluorescence 2aGlycosylation 2aLipid Metabolism 2aLipidsxbloodxchemistry. 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aTriglyceridesxblood 0adiet 0acomposition 0alipids1 aGomez Dumm, N.T. de.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1996 Oct., v. 40, no. 3 p.459-467x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19970106b19970110c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02361naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245017800143300001600321500001500337520070600352650001401058650001901072650001101091650001601102650001501118650002501133650001401158650002101172650001401193650001901207650002901226650002801255650002001283650002901303650003801332650002201370650004301392650002101435650002501456650006001481653001701541653002301558653002101581653002601602700001901628773010601647852000901753930003301762945001301795946001101808655001201819IND2054443020221120033551.0961212e199610  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205444302DNAL7 a89083692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRout, M.K.10aPartial characterization of the lysine rich 280KD globulin from common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench): its antigenic homology with seed proteins of some other crops  ap. 587-595.  a2019-12-05  aA high molecular weight (HMW) globulin, the main storage protein in grains of the common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) has been partially characterized.

Armed conflicts may influence agriculture and livestock production in particular, but the specific impact of armed conflicts on urban livestock production is not well documented for Africa. This paper analyses that impact on urban livestock keeping in Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of Congo. Brazzaville has experienced a series of armed conflicts since 1993; the most dramatic event in 1997 was a serious threat for the population and the livestock keepers. Two surveys, one before the war (1993) and one after the war (2002), indicate that the conflict had a negative impact on livestock keeping, as most livestock keepers lost their animals. Financial resources were an important factor in rebuilding the flock after 1997. Further factors related to restarting livestock activities were: past experience in livestock raising; location; being the owner of the plot; and possessing Congolese nationality. 3aflocks 3alivestock production 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3asmall ruminants 3asurveys 3aurban agriculture 3aRepublic of the Congo1 aMfoukou-Ntsakala, A.1 aNkouika-Dinghani-Nkita, G.1 aHuylenbroeck, G. van1 aSpeybroeck, N.0 tOutlook on agriculture.g2010 Sept., v. 39, no. 3 p.159-167x0030-72707nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245007300144300001600217500001500233520090400248650002001152650001401172650002701186650002501213650001901238650001101257650002801268650007801296650002401374650001201398650001501410650002201425650001701447650001301464650004001477650002301517650003201540650002301572650002701595650002801622650003101650650002401681650002201705650004601727653001701773653002801790700001701818773010601835852000901941930003301950945001301983946001101996655001202007IND2041124420221120033507.0940728e199403  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204112442DNAL7 a75187212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStout, J.G.10aTissue distribution of ecto-Mg-ATPase in adult and embryonic chicken  ap. 745-753.  a2019-12-05  aWe have determined the distribution of chicken ecto-Mg-ATPase in a variety of tissues from adult and embryonic chicken. The presence of ecto-Mg-ATPase was identified by an antibody raised against a 12 amino acid residue peptide, NH2-KILSGEEEGVFG, derived from proteolysis and sequencing of the chicken gizzard ecto-Mg-ATPase. Adult chicken tissues were also assayed for ATPase activity in the presence/absence of stimulators/inhibitors of the ecto-ATPase in order to confirm the immunologic tissue distribution results. There is controversy in the literature as to the size(s) of ecto-Mg-ATPases. We demonstrate here that the apparent size of the enzyme(s) recognized by anti-peptide antibodies by Western blot analysis depends on the denaturation conditions used prior to electrophoresis. Lastly, we deduce that the chicken ecto-ATPase is not identical to T-cadherin, as has been recently proposed. 3aembryo (animal) 3amagnesium 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aamino acid sequences 3aanimal tissues 3achicks 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 2aAdenosine Triphosphatasesxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies 2aBlotting, Western 2aChick Embryo 2aChickens 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEpitopesxanalysis 2aGizzard, Avianxenzymology. 2aKidneyxenzymology 2aMicrosomesxenzymology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMuscle, Smoothxenzymology 2aMusclesxenzymology 2aOrgan Specificity 2aPeptide Fragmentsxchemistryximmunology. 0apurification 0amolecular sequence data1 aKirley, T.L.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1994 Mar., v. 32, no. 4 p.745-753x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02290naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245005300146300001600199520115300215650000901368650001401377650001601391650001001407650000901417650001401426650001301440650002701453650002701480650001201507650003801519650001101557650002201568650003501590650000901625650001501634650003601649650003901685773007701724852000901801939003301810946001301843655001201856IND8904081920221120033527.0890731e198905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890408192DNAL7 a27249212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoodard, L.F.10aAdjuvant activity of water-insoluble surfactants  ap. 222-225.  aA series of cationic amine and diamine surfactants, nonionic surfactants, and traditional vaccine adjuvants were compared for capacity to induce serum IgG antibody. With one exception, none of the aliphatic primary, secondary, tertiary or quaternary amines or diamines exhibited adjuvant activity beyond that of the dilute hexadecane emulsion vehicle nor was a structure-activity relationship determined. Avridine, a lipoidal diamine, potentiated the antibody response, but not to the level of some nonionic surfactant adjuvants or Freund's adjuvants. Among the nonionic surfactants, T1501 tetronic block copolymer, trehalose dimycolate, sorbitan trioleate, and glycerol trioleate were equivalent (P greater than 0.05) to Freund's complete adjuvant in their capacity to stimulate antibody. The latter two surfactants have not been reported previously. The results suggest that certain nonionic surfactants in dilute oil-in-water emulsions are effective replacements for Freund's adjuvants. Such adjuvant emulsions are easily prepared, easily injected and do not produce the grossly adverse reaction observed with Freund-type water-in-oil emulsions. 3amice 3aadjuvants 3asurfactants 3awater 3aoils 3aemulsions 3avaccines 3aanimal experimentation 2aAdjuvants, Immunologic 2aAnimals 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFemale 2aFreund's Adjuvant 2aImmunoglobulin Gxbiosynthesis 2aMice 2aSolubility 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aSurface-Active Agentsximmunology.0 tComparative medicine.g1989 May, v. 39, no. 3 p.222-225x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02253naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245012900143300001800272500001500290520087000305650001001175650001401185650001301199650001001212650002501222650002401247650001801271650002401289650002501313650002301338650002801361650002101389650002101410650002301431650003301454650002701487653002801514653002301542700001401565700001801579773010801597852000901705930003301714945001301747946001101760655001201771IND2058652620221120033449.0970726e199704  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205865262DNAL7 a91378352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, S.L.14aThe large ribosomal protein gene cluster of a cryptomonad plastid: gene organization, sequence and evolutionary implications  ap. 1035-1044.  a2019-12-05  aThe complete sequence of the major ribosomal protein gene cluster of the plastid genome of the cryptomonad alga Guillardia theta (formerly Cryptomonas phi) is presented. The ribosomal protein genes (corresponding to the S10, spc, alpha and L13/S9 operons of E. coli) are found upstream of the previously reported plastid str operon, and transcribed in the same orientation. The genes are very tightly packed with as little as two nucleotides between the rpl14 and rpl24 genes. The gene arrangement is very similar to that reported for the rhodophyte alga, Porphyra purpurea, and the chromophyte diatom, Odontella sinensis, indicating a close evolutionary relationship between these groups of algae. Northern analysis indicates that the 29 genes are arranged as one operon and are transcribed as a single mRNA that is subsequently processed into smaller transcripts. 3aalgae 3aribosomes 3aplastids 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aEukaryotaxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Rearrangement 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aPlastidsxgenetics 2aRibosomal Proteinsxgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic 0amolecular sequence data 0aalgae and seaweeds1 aLiu, X.Q.1 aDouglas, S.E.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1997 Apr., v. 41, no. 5 p.1035-1044x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02447naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245009900142300001600241500001500257520077400272650001801046650002601064650002701090650002001117650001601137650002001153650003901173650003801212650002401250650002901274650003301303650001901336650004001355650001101395650001101406650007301417650003001490650002001520650005901540650002401599653001701623653001501640653001701655653001201672700001801684700001901702773010601721852000901827930003301836945001301869946001101882655001201893IND2053294420221120024940.0960930e199606  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205329442DNAL7 a88288032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKit, Y.Y.10aPhosphorylation of different human milk proteins by human catalytic secretory immunoglobulin A  ap. 521-527.  a2019-12-05  aThe ability of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) from milk of healthy mothers to phosphorylate various milk proteins in the presence of gamma-[32P]-ATP was shown to be a property of the antibodies. The polyclonal sIgA was purified by sequential chromatography on Protein-A Sepharose and DEAE-cellulose, and then separated by chromatography on the ATP-Sepharose. The preparations containing all milk proteins except for protein kineses [integrated milk proteins (IMP)] were obtained by extraction of the kinase activities from the milk using their affinity to the insoluble crosslinked staphylococcus. Addition of sIgA fractions (having a different affinity to ATP) to the IMP led to phosphorylation of casein and several other milk proteins with different efficiencies. 3amilk proteins 3apolyclonal antibodies 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aimmunoglobulins 3abreast milk 3aphosphorylation 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAntibodies, Catalyticxmetabolism 2aCaseinsxmetabolism 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aDEAE-Cellulose 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin A, Secretoryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aMilk Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein Kinasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aTrypsinxmetabolism 0apurification 0aantibodies 0ainteractions 0aabzymes1 aSemenov, D.V.1 aNevinsky, G.A.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1996 June, v. 39, no. 3 p.521-527x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02133naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245013700213300001400350500002400364506007600388520067400464506003701138650002101175650001701196650001501213650002001228650001601248650001701264650001101281650001501292650001201307650002301319650000901342650001201351651001301363651001301376700002501389700001901414700003001433773010301463852000901566856008801575655001201663IND4458368320221207122126.0110527s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445836832DNAL7 a10.1080/1059924X.2011.5336122doi7 aPMC30412722pmcid7 a212131642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeibler, Jessica H.10aNo Evidence of Infection With Avian Influenza Viruses Among US Poultry Workers in the Delmarva Peninsula, Maryland and Virginia, USA  ap. 52-57.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIndustrial poultry workers may be at elevated risk of avian influenza infection due to intense occupational contact with live poultry. Serum samples from poultry workers and community members in the Delmarva Peninsula, one of the densest regions of poultry production in the United States, were analyzed for antibodies to strains of five avian influenza subtypes using microneutralization assays. No evidence of infection was found, suggesting inefficient transmission to humans or the absence of virus in these premises. Continued serological surveillance of workers in industrial food animal facilities is necessary to prevent the transmission of influenza A viruses.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOrthomyxoviridae 3aagromedicine 3aantibodies 3aavian influenza 3ablood serum 3afood animals 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apoultry 3apoultry production 3arisk 3aviruses 3aMaryland 3aVirginia1 aSilbergeld, Ellen K.1 aPekosz, Andrew1 aGray, G.

(1987) Biochem. Int. 15, 785-792] by incorporating CM-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography and chromatofocusing. The enzyme thus isolated could be resolved into one 26 kDa major and a minor 27 kDa protein bands on SDS-PAGE. The two components, however, could not be separated by gel filtration and they eluted, in a single peak corresponding to a molecular mass of 28.1 kDa. Among the various substrates tested, Z-Phe-Arg-MCA with a Km of 0.058 mM and hemoglobin with a Km of 1.449 micromolar were the most preferred synthetic and protein substrates respectively. It was found to be a glycoprotein with an acidic pI of 4.8. The enzyme was activated by various thiol-reducing reagents and inhibited by cysteine proteinase inhibitors, divalent cations, lysyl group modifiers, anti-inflammatory drug and denaturing agents. The hydrodynamic behaviour of cathepsin B suggested a compact and globular conformation. Immunodiffusion studies with anti-goat cathepsin B indicated a tissue/species dependence. 3aanimal physiology 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCathepsin Bxchemistryxpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aChromatography, Ion Exchangexmethods 2aCross Reactions 2aEnzyme Activation 2aFructose-Bisphosphate Aldolasexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aGoats 2aKinetics 2aProtease Inhibitorsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aRabbits 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aSpleenxchemistryxenzymology. 2aSulfhydryl Compoundsxmetabolismxpharmacology.1 aChoudhury, S.D.1 aLamsal, M.1 aKhan, M.Y.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1997 Sept., v. 42, no. 6 p.1215-1226x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02200naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002200129245009200151300001600243500001500259520106400274650002301338650001001361650001201371650001701383650001001400650002401410650001001434650001601444651001301460653002301473653001601496653004001512653001901552653001101571700001901582700001701601700002101618773007201639852000901711939003301720946001301753655001201766IND9103735220221122175038.0910924e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910373522DNAL7 a167269442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirkpatrick, J.F.10aPregnancy determination in uncaptured feral horses by means of fecal steroid conjugates  ap. 753-760.  a2019-12-04  aThis study was carried out to develop an accurate, rapid and inexpensive method for diagnosing pregnancy in uncaptured feral horses by analysis of fecal steroid metabolites and to compare the accuracy of this method with diagnosis by urinary estrone conjugates (E1C). Paired urine and fecal samples were collected from 40 sexually mature feral mares during August and October. Urine samples were extracted directly from the soil and analyzed by enzymeimmunoassay (EIA) for E1C. Water extracts of fecal samples were assayed by EIA for E1C and nonspecific progesterone metabolites (iPdG). Urinary E1C, fecal E1C and fecal iPdG concentrations for seven mares which produced fools were 3.9 +/- 1.3 (SEM) micrograms/mg creatinine, 4.2 +/- 0.8 ng/g feces and 1,411 +/- 569.6 ng/g feces, respectively. Urinary E1C and fecal E1C and iPdG concentrations for the 33 mares which did not produce foals were 0.1 +/- 0.0 micrograms/mg creatinine and 0.5 +/- 0.1 and 32.8 +/- 4.5 ng/g feces, respectively.

Forty ewes were given a soluble glass rumen bolus containing 150 mg melatonin on July 9 and were joined with two vasectomized rams on July 23 and with three fertile rams on August 6. A second group of 40 ewes was treated with an intravaginal progestagen pessary (60 mg medroxy-progesterone acetate) on July 23. Following pessary removal after 12 d, ewes were given 750 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG). Five fertile rams were joined with these ewes 48 h after progestagen removal. Melatonin concentrations were determined in single blood samples collected in early afternoon of July 21. Mating dates, lambing dates and litter sizes were recorded. Date of mating was significantly later in ewes treated with melatonin compared with those treated with progestagen plus PMSG (P < 0.0001). All ewes given melatonin were mated within 4 wk, and those on progestagen plus PMSG treatment within one day of fertile rain introduction. Thirty-four ewes (85%) allocated to melatonin treatment and 36 (90%) allocated to progestagen plus PMSG treatment lambed (P > 0.05). Mean (+/- SEM) lambing date was later in melatonin-treated ewes (January 17 +/- 1.2 d) compared to those given progestagen plus PMSG (December 30 +/- 0.6 d; P < 0.0001). Mean litter size was lower in melatonin-treated ewes (1.5 +/- 0.1) compared with those given progestagen plus PMSG (2.0 +/- 0.1; P < 0.001). Plasma melatonin concentrations indicated that 9 of 40 ewes treated with melatonin had circulating melatonin concentrations of less than 16 pg/ml. It is concluded that under conditions that existed in this experiment, treatment with progestagen plus PMSG in late anestrus resulted in more synchronous mating and lambing and a higher litter size than that following administration of a soluble glass rumen-degradable bolus containing melatonin. 3apregnant mare serum gonadotropin 3arumen 3alambing 3avagina 3alitter size 3aestrus 3amelatonin 3asexual reproduction 3aewes 3aovulation 3alambing rate 3amedroxyprogesterone 3amating behavior 3abreeding season 0asheep 0ainduction 0amating date 0alambing date 0aboluses1 aO'Callaghan, D.0 tTheriogenology.g1991 Apr., v. 35, no. 4 p.747-752x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01903naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002300148245008000171300001400251500002400265520075100289650001701040650001001057650001401067650003701081650001201118650002101130650001101151650001301162651001301175700002201188700002101210700001601231700002101247700002001268700001701288773010301305852000901408856008801417655001201505IND4458368020221122175108.0110527s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445836802DNAL7 a10.1080/1059924X.2011.5327622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSorensen, Julie A.10aResults From Inspections of Farmer-Installed Rollover Protective Structures  ap. 19-29.  aIncludes references  aThis study sought to assess the feasibility of self-installing rollover protective structures (ROPS) and to identify any patterns of self-installation deficiencies in a sample of New York ROPS Retrofit Rebate Program participants.

Viral antigen and lesions characteristic of acute SDAV infection, including rhinotracheitis, bronchitis and sialodacryoadenitis, were detected in both groups of rats during the first week. In euthymic rats, tissues were under repair and viral antigen was undetectable by day 17, and tissues were histologically normal by day 31 except for mild focal dacryoadenitis. In athymic rats, viral antigen and chronic active inflammation of respiratory tract, salivary and lacrimal glands persisted through day 90. Inflammation and viral antigen also were observed in the transitional epithelium of the renal pelvis and urinary bladder as late as day 90. Virus was isolated from nasopharynx, lung, salivary gland and Harderian gland of athymic rats through day 90. All euthymic rats seroconverted to SDAV by day 6, whereas all athymic rats remained seronegative through day 31, and two of six were seropositive by day 90. As judged by seroconversion of contact sentinels, six of six athymic rats shed virus through 6 weeks, and five of six through 10 weeks. These results indicate that SDAV persists in athymic rats, and that normal T cell function is required for host defenses against SDAV. 3aRat coronavirus 3athymus gland 3aimmunosuppression 3aviruses 3aviral antigens 3arats 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Viralxanalysis 2aCoronaviridaexgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aCoronaviridae Infectionsxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aNecrosis 2aRats 2aRats, Mutant Strainsxmicrobiology 2aRats, Nudexmicrobiology 2aSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms 0aimmunosuppression (physiological) 0alesions 0apersistence1 aJacoby, R.O.1 aPaturzo, F.X.1 aJohnson, E.A.1 aArdito, R.B.0 tComparative medicine.g1990 Mar., v. 40, no. 2 p.138-143x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02615naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002100128245008800149300001800237500001500255520089800270650001201168650001601180650001801196650001401214650002101228650002501249650002201274650001801296650001201314650000901326650001401335650002101349650001401370650001001384650002401394650001201418650004501430650002501475650002601500650001801526650002101544650002101565650002101586650001401607650004701621650002301668650001601691653001401707653003401721700001801755700001801773700002401791773010801815852000901923930003301932945001301965946001101978655001201989IND2048188520221122153922.0951010e199508  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204818852DNAL7 a75810072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchleicher, C.H.10aMolecular evolution of the multigene family of intracellular lipid-binding proteins  ap. 1117-1125.  a2019-12-05  aThe intracellular lipid-binding proteins are a group of homologous proteins which bind and facilitate the transport of fatty acids, bile acids and retinoids. The evolutionary relationship of 51 family members from vertebrates and invertebrates was analyzed. The inferred phylogeny implies the occurrence of at least 14 gene duplications and contains five regions where the branching order is statistically non-significant-this uncertainty explaining most inconsistencies between previous phylogenetic analyses. The phylogeny also suggests that the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein and the liver fatty acid-binding protein/ileal lipid-binding protein subfamilies diverged from the other subfamilies before the vertebrate-invertebrate split. Finally, results presented herein indicate that the putative fatty acid-binding domain of NMDA receptor 1 is unlikely to be a member of this family. 3ainsects 3afatty acids 3aaspartic acid 3aphylogeny 3abinding proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3asequence homology 3aretinoic acid 3amammals 3afish 3areceptors 3amultigene family 3avitamin A 3abirds 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCarrier Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aIntestinesxchemistry 2aInvertebrates 2aLipid Metabolism 2aLiverxchemistry 2aMultigene Family 2aPhylogeny 2aReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartatexchemistry 2aSequence Alignment 2aVertebrates 0aevolution 0an-methyl-d-aspartate receptor1 aCordoba, O.L.1 aSantome, J.A.1 aDell'Angelica, E.C.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1995 Aug., v. 36, no. 5 p.1117-1125x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03725naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245011600159300001600275520250900291650002002800650001502820650002002835650000902855650000802864650002102872650001002893650002002903650001702923650002102940653001102961653001502972653002302987700001503010700001603025700001803041773007903059852000903138856008503147930003303232945001303265946001303278655001203291IND2206431320221118041857.0000815s2000    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220643132DNAL7 a10.1080/019041600093820262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, M.10aYield and protein content of barley as affected by release rate of coated urea and rate of nitrogen application  ap. 401-412.  aCoated urea consists of a urea core and a polymer coating. It meters out urea over a period of time. In the market place, price is favorable for high protein content feed barley. The objectives of this study were to determine release rate of urea from coated urea products and relative effectiveness of urea, coated urea or a mixture of coated urea products with different release rates in increasing yield and protein content of barley. Release rate of coated urea Mini I (quick release) and Mini II (slow release) in water was determined at 23 degrees C by recovering ten pre-weighed granules from 500 mL water at 6 h, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 days. The recovered granules were dried and then weighed. Barley (Hordium vulgare L. cv. Duke) was grown in potted soil (2 L) at 15 degrees C for 90 days in a growth chamber with treatments of Nil, non-coated urea, Mini I, Mini II, Mixture I(1/3 urea+1/3 MiniI+1/3 Mini II) and Mixture II (1/5 urea+2/ 5 MiniI+2/5 Mini II). The nitrogen (N) application rates were 100, 200 and 300 kg N ha-1. Above-ground plant samples were taken at 22, 44, 66, and 90 (maturity) days after seeding, and dry matter mass per pot and N content of the plant samples were determined. The release of urea from Mini I and Mini II followed a lognomial pattern. Increasing N application rate increased dry matter yield of barley. Dry matter yield from urea tended to be higher than other treatments at each rate of N application, but that did not couple with high grain protein content. At 100 kg N ha-1, there was no post anthesis N assimilation (PANA) for urea and Mini I, but there were 4, 14, and 13% PANA for Mini II, Mixture I, and Mixture II, respectively. However, when N application rate was increased to 200 and 300 kg N ha-1, there was PANA even for urea treatment. Protein content of barley grain was higher with coated urea or mixture treatments than with urea at each rate of N application. The potential N loss (i.e., difference between percent N released from fertilizers and percent fertilizer N recovered by barley) was Mini II<Mini I<Mixture II<Mixture I for the same N application rate, and was 100<200<300 kg N ha-1 for the same fertilizer treatment. In conclusion, at a limited N application rate, coated urea with a slow release rate or a combination of two coated urea products (quick and slow release) with urea increased grain protein content of barley. The potential N loss was less with coated urea applied alone than with a mixture of coated urea and urea. 3aHordeum vulgare 3acrop yield 3aprotein content 3aurea 3aage 3anitrogen content 3aseeds 3anutrient uptake 3abarley straw 3aapplication rate 0alosses 0adry matter 0acontrolled release1 aNyborg, M.1 aMalhi, S.S.1 aSolberg, E.D.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2000, v. 23, no. 3 p.401-412x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041600093820263Available from publisher's Web site  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02854naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245006700159300001600226520156200242650001801804650002201822650001301844650002001857650001101877650002601888650002201914650002001936650002201956650001101978650001001989650002001999650001402019650001302033650002202046650001002068650002302078653000902101653001502110700001502125773007902140852000902219856008502228930003302313945001302346946001302359655001202372IND2206511520221118041900.0000818s2000    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220651152DNAL7 a10.1080/019041600093820312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Z.10aDiurnal patterns of nitrate assimilation in Kentucky bluegrass  ap. 443-456.  aKentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) is a major C3-type forage and turfgrass, but it is less efficient than many grasses in utilizing nitrogen (N). To determine how this grass can accommodate its greater N need, diurnal patterns of nitrate reductase activity (NRA) and nitrite reductase activity (NiRA) in its leaves and roots were examined and compared with those in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Plants were grown under greenhouse or growth room conditions and assayed for NRA and NiRA by optimized in vivo methods. The diurnal patterns of NRA and NiRA indicated that Kentucky bluegrass could assimilate nitrate during the night at rates greater than or similar to those during the day. Leaf NRA of Kentucky bluegrass was minimal approximately 4 and 10 h after illumination commenced and increased at night. The diurnal pattern of leaf NRA among Kentucky bluegrass cultivars did not differ significantly. In roots, NRA of Kentucky bluegrass was high in the morning and decreased sharply during the afternoon and evening, but increased again late at night. Unlike Kentucky bluegrass, barley exhibited greater leaf NRA during the day than during the night and exhibited the greatest activity 6 or 10 h after illumination commenced. In both species, the equilibrium leaf nitrate pool was 20 to 30 times larger than the ammonium pool and 3,000 to 13,000 times larger than the nitrite pool. Leaf nitrate pool size showed a diurnal pattern complementary to that of leaf NRA. Our results suggest that a nighttime N use strategy might exist in Kentucky bluegrass. 3aPoa pratensis 3adiurnal variation 3anitrates 3anutrient uptake 3aforage 3anutrient requirements 3anitrate reductase 3aenzyme activity 3anitrite reductase 3aleaves 3aroots 3aHordeum vulgare 3acultivars 3anitrites 3anutrient reserves 3alight 3aammonium compounds 0adark 0aefficiency1 aHull, R.J.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2000, v. 23, no. 4 p.443-456x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041600093820313Available from publisher's Web site  a20001204b20001212c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02430naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245009900162300001600261500001500277520112900292650002301421650002701444650001801471650002301489650002001512650002301532650001801555650002601573650002001599650002101619650002101640651001401661653000801675653001101683653001201694700001901706700001501725773007901740852000901819856008501828930003301913945001301946946001301959655001201972IND2206511220221118041931.0000818s2000    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220651122DNAL7 a10.1080/019041600093820292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPitman, W.D.10aResponse of Texas bluegrass to season of nitrogen fertilization on the Louisiana Coastal Plain  ap. 423-429.  a2019-12-04  aTexas bluegrass (Poa arachnifera Torr.) has shown potential for use as a cool-season perennial pasture grass in the southern Great Plains, where it occurs as a natural component of rangeland plant communities, and into the western Coastal Plain. Responsiveness of this grass to nitrogen (N) fertilization appeared to be limited to the spring growing period in initial evaluations in Louisiana. A field plot experiment was conducted to assess forage production and quality responses to season of N fertilization on the Syn-1 population of Texas bluegrass. Winter forage production responses to 50 kg N ha-1 were obtained in the 1997-98 growing season but not in 1998-99 after stands had been depleted by summer drought. Greatest yield increases resulted from spring N application, however, fall plus winter fertilization provided the most uniform distribution of forage through the cool season. Forage fiber fractions, in vitro digestibility, and crude protein were not affected by N fertilization. Both amount and distribution of Texas bluegrass forage, but not forage quality, can be manipulated by time of N fertilization. 3aapplication timing 3ain vitro digestibility 3adietary fiber 3abiomass production 3anutritive value 3aseasonal variation 3acrude protein 3afield experimentation 3aPoa arachnifera 3aammonium nitrate 3aapplication rate 3aLouisiana 0aPoa 0aforage 0aquality1 aRedfearn, D.D.1 aRead, J.C.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2000, v. 23, no. 4 p.423-429x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041600093820293Available from publisher's Web site  a20001204b20001212c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02684naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009600164300001600260520130300276650002001579650001301599650001301612650001901625650001401644650002201658650001001680650001101690650002001701650001401721650001101735650001401746650001501760650001301775650002101788650002101809653001101830653001101841653000901852653002101861700001701882700001801899700001701917773007901934852000902013856008502022930003302107945001302140946001302153655001202166IND2206395120221118040628.0000814s2000    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220639512DNAL7 a10.1080/019041600093820612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaalbaki, R.Z.10aEffect of nitrogen source and salinity level on salt accumulation of two chickpea genotypes  ap. 805-814.  aThis study aimed at investigating mechanisms of salt tolerance and ionic relations of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) cultivars with different nitrogen (N) sources. Two resistant genotypes, ILC-205 and ILC-1919, were subjected to four levels of salinity (0.5, 3.0, 6.0, and 9.0 dS m-1). Nitrogen sources consisted of inoculation with two resistant Rhizobium strains, CP-29 and CP-32, mineral N additions, and no N application. Data was collected on root and shoot contents of sodium (Na+) chlorine, (Cl-,) and potassium (K+), and shoot to root Na+ ratio, as well as shoot K+ to Na+ ratio. Salinity affected shoot Na+ and Cl- contents, but nodulating plants had higher shoot Na+ contents than plants supplied with mineral N. Shoot to root Na+ ratios were lower in the mineral N treatment than in nodulating treatments at 3.0 dS m-1, indicating that root compartmentalization and shoot exclusion were only possible at low salinities. Potassium levels of nodulating plant shoots were lower than those of non-nodulating plants only at low salinities. N-source significantly affected shoot K+/Na+ ratio, with nodulating plants having lower ratios than non-nodulating plants, indicating that rhizobial infection or nodule formation may lead to salt entry curtailing the selective ability of chickpea roots. 3aCicer arietinum 3anitrogen 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3aRhizobium 3anitrogen fixation 3aroots 3ashoots 3amineral content 3achlorides 3asodium 3apotassium 3anodulation 3agenotype 3aapplication rate 3aammonium nitrate 0aratios 0auptake 0asalt 0anutrient sources1 aZurayk, R.A.1 aAdlan, M.A.M.1 aSaxena, M.C.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2000, v. 23, no. 6 p.805-814x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041600093820613Available from publisher's Web site  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02739naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245007600159300001600235500001500251520141500266650001701681650001401698650002101712650001001733650001001743650001001753650000901763650002501772650002001797650002801817650001501845650002001860650001401880650001301894650001301907650000901920651001001929653001901939653001101958700001601969700001601985773007902001852000902080856008502089930003302174945001302207946001302220655001202233IND2206394920221118040546.0000814s2000    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220639492DNAL7 a10.1080/019041600093820592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, F.H.10aAccumulation and utilization efficiency of potassium in ramie varieties  ap. 785-792.  a2019-12-04  aDifference in nutrient utilization efficiency of genotypes of crops is attracting more and more attention of plant nutrition and breeding scientists. This experiment was carried out to reveal whether genotypic variation of potassium (K) utilization efficiency exists in ramie [Boehmeria nivea (L.) Gaud.], by measuring K concentrations and accumulations in different organs in relation to the dry matter and fiber productivity of six field growing ramie varieties with evident dissimilarity in growth vigor. Potassium concentration decreased in leaves, petioles and seeding organ, but increased in stem wood and in the raw fiber of high raw fiber yield (RFY) varieties at the late growth stage. For different parts, stem bark attained the largest K concentration, followed in order by petiole, stem wood, seeding organs, raw fiber and leaves. Potassium concentration of stem wood, bark and raw fiber, respectively, demonstrated positive and significant correlation with RFY. Potassium utilization efficiency declined by harvest time. The results suggested that the ramie varieties with high biomass and RFY and K consumption such as Xiyeqing can be planted under the condition of abundant K resource, while Nindu-Ramie variety may be used as high K efficient genetic resource for its ratios of RFY (g) and biomass (g) to K consumption (g) are over 25 and 114, respectively, in spite of its low biomass and RFY. 3aharvest date 3acultivars 3anutrient content 3avigor 3aseeds 3astems 3awood 3adevelopmental stages 3anutrient uptake 3adry matter accumulation 3acrop yield 3aBoehmeria nivea 3apotassium 3agenotype 3apetioles 3abark 3aChina 0ause efficiency 0aleaves1 aLiang, X.N.1 aZhang, S.W.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2000, v. 23, no. 6 p.785-792x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041600093820593Available from publisher's Web site  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02387naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245015500161300001600316520088100332650002401213650001901237650001001256650002201266650002401288650002001312650001501332650000901347650002001356650003501376650001101411650003001422650002101452650002701473653001501500653001101515700002001526700001801546700001601564700002501580700002301605700002101628773007901649852000901728856008501737930003301822945001301855946001301868655001201881IND2206426920221118040555.0000815s2000    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220642692DNAL7 a10.1080/019041600093820192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWahid, P.A.10aEffect of rare earth elements on growth and nutrition of coconut palm and root competition for these elements between the palm and Calotropis gigantea  ap. 329-338.  aAbsorption of rare earth elements (REEs) namely lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), and neodymium (Nd) by coconut, competition between coconut and Calotropis gigantea L. for these elements in mixed culture and the effects of the REEs on growth and nutrition of the palm were studied in a pot culture. At a low rate of application, REEs promoted root growth in coconut, but at a higher level, absorption of phosphorus (P) and zinc (Zn) by the palm was reduced significantly. Absorption of REEs by the palm tended to increase with increasing application rates, but the increases were not statistically significant. Although Calostropis gigantea accumulated more REEs per unit dry matter than coconut, it failed to compete effectively for REEs in mixed culture with coconut.

Lara Persian (English) walnut (Juglans regia). Dropped fruit showed a brown patch at the blossom end and blackening and rot of inner tissues. The disease, called brown apical necrosis (BAN), was investigated on fruit collected in Italy and France in 1999. In 2000, studies were carried out in three walnut orchards located in Italy and in France to substantiate the etiology of BAN. Isolations performed from inner diseased fruit tissues yielded several fungi, in decreasing frequency of isolation: species of Fusarium and Alternaria, and one species each of Cladosporium, Colletotrichum, and Phomopsis. However, only Fusarium spp. were recovered from stigmas of BAN-affected fruit. The fungi associated with BAN-diseased fruit and species composition differed among locations and over time, confirming results obtained in previous investigations. The species of Fusarium used in pathogenicity tests reproduced BAN-disease symptoms when inoculated on fruit, whereas an Alternaria alternata isolate caused only limited necrosis of the style. However, the role of the other fungi commonly isolated from BAN-diseased fruit remains to be defined. The walnut blight pathogen, Xanthomonas arboricola pv. juglandis, occasionally was isolated from BAN-diseased fruit. No correlation was found between the extent of external brown patches and the size of inner lesions. Repeated isolations from and inoculations of fruit demonstrated that BAN can be considered a complex disease, and the inner infections originate from the style of the fruit. 3aetiology 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aorchards 3aXanthomonas 3aJuglans regia 3anecrosis 3aAlternaria 3amixed infection 3aColletotrichum 3apathogenicity 3aincidence 3aCladosporium 3aDiaporthe 3aFusarium 3aFrance 3aItaly 0aPhomopsis 0asymptoms 0alesions 0aexperimental infections 0adrop 0afruits 0axanthomonas arboricola pv. juglandis1 aMaccaroni, M.1 aCorazza, L.1 aBalmas, V.1 aValier, A.0 tPlant disease.g2002 June, v. 86, no. 6 p.599-602x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.6.5993Available from publisher's Web site  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02181naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002700146245008000173300001600253520091200269650001201181650002001193650002401213650001301237650001001250650002301260650001501283650002101298650002701319650002501346650003801371651001501409653001301424653001701437700002401454700001601478700001601494773007101510852000901581856008601590930003301676945001301709946001301722655001201735IND2328088620221118040710.0020717e200206  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232808862DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.6.6032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez-Alvarado, G.10aPepper mottle virus causing disease in chile peppers in southern New Mexico  ap. 603-605.  aThe primary pepper producing areas of southern New Mexico were surveyed to identify the viruses causing severe disease in chile peppers over a 2-year period.

Plant samples were collected in Michigan from diseased plants in soybean fields with Phytophthora root and stem rot symptoms. Eighty-seven isolates of P. sojae were evaluated for virulence using 13 differential soybean cultivars. Rps 3b, 3a, 1b, 1k, and 6 were resistant to 81, 77, 74, 69, and 66% of the isolates, respectively, while Rps 1a and 7 were resistant to only 12 to 13% of the isolates. Races 2, 25, 41, and 44 of P. sojae were identified among the isolates and reported for the first time in Michigan. Virulence formulae of 69 isolates did not match those of currently known races of P. sojae. Nine isolates were considered nonpathogenic. Incorporating Rps genes 1b, 1k, 3a, 3b, and 6 in soybean cultivars with good field tolerance, in conjunction with other control measures, should offer improved protection of soybeans from Phytophthora root and stem rot in Michigan. 3aGlycine max 3aPhytophthora 3apathotypes 3astems 3astrains 3acultivars 3aroot rot 3afungal diseases of plants 3aMichigan 0asymptoms 0afungus control1 aHart, L.P.1 aSafir, G.R.0 tPlant disease.g2001 Oct., v. 85, no. 10 p.1103-1106x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.10.11033Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02044naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245008600166300001800252500001500270520079900285650001401084650001401098650002301112650000801135650002601143650001401169650001501183650002401198650001901222650001901241650001401260650002001274653001601294653002601310653001501336700001701351773007401368852000901442856008801451930003301539945001301572946001301585655001201598IND2326131620221118040423.0020321e200110  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232613162DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.10.10522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCousins, P.M.12aA technique for screening grape germplasm for resistance to Meloidogyne incognita  ap. 1052-1054.  a2019-12-04  aA technique to evaluate the root-knot nematode resistance of grape seedlings was developed. Seedlings of rootstock crosses and nematode-susceptible Vitis vinifera cvs. Colombard and Carignane were inoculated with Meloidogyne incognita juveniles. Reproduction of nematodes on individual plants was measured by counting the number of egg masses stained with eosin and the number of eggs present. Egg mass counts were highly correlated with egg counts. Resistant and susceptible cultivars could be clearly distinguished by the number of egg masses produced on vegetatively propagated cuttings. It is concluded that egg mass counting can substitute for the more laborious and time-consuming methods of counting nematode eggs or juveniles in the evaluation of root-knot nematode resistance in Vitis. 3agermplasm 3acultivars 3agenetic resistance 3aova 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aseedlings 3arootstocks 3asexual reproduction 3aplant cuttings 3aVitis vinifera 3ascreening 3apest resistance 0amethodology 0abiological resistance 0aevaluation1 aWalker, M.A.0 tPlant disease.g2001 Oct., v. 85, no. 10 p.1052-1054x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.10.10523Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02923naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001500147245013300162300001800295500001500313520134200328650001501670650004701685650001701732650004201749650001801791650003001809650002201839650001801861650002301879650002201902650001501924650002001939651001601959653002101975653002801996653002202024653001602046653001202062700001702074700001402091700001402105700001302119700001402132773009202146852000902238856008702247930003302334945001302367946001302380655001202393IND2325818520221118040514.0020305e200109  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232581852DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.9.10132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHyun, J.W.10aPathological characterization and molecular analysis of Elsinoe isolates causing scab diseases of citrus in Jeju Island in Korea  ap. 1013-1017.  a2019-12-04  aTwo scab diseases are recognized currently on citrus: (i) citrus scab caused by Elsinoe fawcettii, which has several pathotypes; and (ii) sweet orange scab caused by E. australis. Pathogenicity and cultural characteristics among 36 isolates collected from Jeju Island were investigated. Of 30 isolates from satsuma mandarin, yuzu, and kinkoji, all were E. fawcettii; 27 were similar to the Florida broad host range pathotype and 3 were similar to the Florida narrow host range pathotype by inoculation of differential hosts. Six isolates from natsudaidai were nonpathogenic to satsuma mandarin, rough lemon, sour orange, grapefruit, cleopatra mandarin, and natsudaidai leaves, and were only pathogenic to natsudaidai fruit. Isolates from natsudaidai usually produced unique tomentose colonies on potato dextrose agar compared with isolates from other citrus species. The colonies were relatively fast growing, radially sulcate, larger, and more expansive than the gummy, mucoid colonies of other isolates. Isolates from Florida, Australia, Argentina, and Jeju Island (Korea) were genetically differentiated using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. E. fawcettii from Korea, Florida, and Australia, E. australis from Argentina, and natsudaidai isolates clustered closely within groups, but were clearly distinguishable among groups. 3ahost range 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aCitrus junos 3apathological processes and conditions 3aCitrus unshiu 3afungal diseases of plants 3aElsinoe fawcettii 3apathogenicity 3aCitrus natsudaidai 3agenetic variation 3apathotypes 3agenetic markers 3aSouth Korea 0acitrus obovoidea 0aexperimental infections 0aelsinoe australis 0agrowth rate 0aElsinoe1 aTimmer, L.W.1 aLee, S.C.1 aYun, S.H.1 aKo, S.W.1 aKim, K.S.0 tPlant disease.g2001 Sept., v. 85, no. 9 p.1013-1017wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.9.10133Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02943naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009600164300001600260500002400276520178300300650001402083650002502097650001302122650001202135650002502147650001502172650001402187650001902201650001202220650001202232650002402244650001802268700002402286700002202310700002202332700002202354773010002376852000902476856004802485655001202533IND4399410720221118040448.0071226e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439941072DNAL7 a10.1007/s00497-007-0057-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkada, Takashi13aAn Hieracium mutant, loss of apomeiosis 1 (loa1) is defective in the initiation of apomixis  ap. 199-211.  aIncludes references  aAsexual seed formation (apomixis) in Hieracium aurantiacum occurs by mitotic embryo sac formation without prior meiosis in ovules (apomeiosis), followed by fertilization-independent embryo and endosperm development. Sexual reproduction begins first in Hieracium ovules with megaspore mother cell (MMC) formation. Apomixis initiates with the enlargement of somatic cells, termed aposporous initial (AI) cells, near sexual cells. AI cells grow towards sexually programmed cells undergoing meiosis, which degrade as the dividing nuclei of AIs obscure and displace them. Following Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of an aneuploid Hieracium aurantiacum apomict, a somaclonal mutant designated “loss of apomeiosis 1” (loa1) was recovered, which had significantly lost the ability to form apomictic seed. Maternal apomictic progeny were rare and low levels of germinable seedlings were primarily derived from meiotically derived eggs. Cytological analysis revealed defects in AI formation and function in loa1. Somatic cells enlarged some distance away from sexual cells and unlike AI cells, these expanded away from sexual cells without nuclear division. Surprisingly, many accumulated callose in the walls, a marker associated with meiotically specified cells. These defective AI (DAI) cells only had partial sexual identity as they failed to express a marker reflecting entry to meiosis that was easily detected in MMCs and they ultimately degraded. DAI cell formation did not lead to a compensatory increase in functional sexual embryo sacs, as collapse of meiotic embryo sacs was prevalent in the aneuploid somaclonal mutant. Positional cues that are important for AI cell differentiation, growth and fate may have been disrupted in the loa1 mutant and this is discussed. 3aHieracium 3aPilosella aurantiaca 3aapomixis 3acallose 3acell differentiation 3aembryo sac 3aendosperm 3amegasporocytes 3ameiosis 3amutants 3asexual reproduction 3asomatic cells1 aCatanach, Andrew S.1 aJohnson, Susan D.1 aBicknell, Ross A.1 aKoltunow, Anna M.0 tSexual plant reproduction.g2007 Dec., v. 20, no. 4 p.199-211dSpringer-Verlagx0934-08827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-007-0057-5 7aarticle02696naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245008300185300001600268500002400284520109400308650001301402650001601415650001101431650001801442650002401460650002001484650001601504650001001520650001101530650002601541650003801567650003201605650004701637650001201684650003301696650002101729650002401750650002501774650002401799650002201823650004501845650003001890700001601920700001701936700001601953773013301969852000902102856005502111655001202166IND4459852320221118040348.0110708e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445985232DNAL7 a210399332pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2010.01071.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, S.10aPerformance of crossbred calves with dietary supplementation of garlic extract  ap. 449-455.  aIncludes references  aTwelve crossbred calves (Holstein cross) in their pre-ruminant stage were used to study the effect of garlic extract feeding on their performance and they were randomly allotted into treatment and control groups in equal number. Performance was evaluated by measuring average body weight (BW) gain, feed intake [dry matter (DM); total digestible nutrient (TDN) and crude protein (CP)], feed conversion efficiency (DM, TDN and CP), fecal score and fecal coliform count. Diets were same for both groups. In addition, treatment group received garlic extract supplementation at 250 mg/kg BW/day/calf. BW measured weekly, feed intake measured twice daily, proximate analysis of feeds and fodders analysed weekly, fecal scores monitored daily and fecal coliform count done weekly. There was a significant (p < 0.01) increase in mean BW gain and feed intake and a significant (p < 0.01) decrease in severity of scours as measured by fecal score in the treatment group compared to the control group.

Our ability to use this tool has gone through different phases. The first began in the 1970s with the demonstration of empirical relationships between the oxygen isotope ratio of tree‐ring cellulose and climate. These empirical relationships, however, did not provide us with the confidence that they are robust through time, across taxa and across geographical locations. The second phase began with a rudimentary understanding of the physiological and biochemical mechanisms responsible for the oxygen isotope ratios of cellulose, which is necessary to increase the power of this tool. This phase culminated in a mechanistic tree‐ring model integrating concepts of physiology and biochemistry in a whole‐plant system. This model made several assumptions about leaf water isotopic enrichment and biochemistry which, in the nascent third phase, are now being challenged, with surprising results. These third‐phase results suggest that, contrary to the model assumption, leaf temperature across a large latitudinal gradient is remarkably constant and does not follow ambient temperature. Recent findings also indicate that the biochemistry responsible for the incorporation of the cellulose oxygen isotopic signature is not as simple as has been assumed. Interestingly, the results of these challenges have strengthened the tree‐ring model. There are several other assumptions that can be investigated which will improve the utility of the tree‐ring model. 3aGeographical Locations 3aambient temperature 3abiochemical mechanisms 3acellulose 3aclimate 3aleaves 3amechanistic models 3aoxygen 3aphysiology 3astable isotopes 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aOxygen Isotopes 2aTreesxmetabolism0 tnew phytologist.g2009, v. 181, no. 3 p.553-562dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02661.x 7aarticle02935naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001400148245011700162300001800279500001500297520152600312650003101838650001501869650003301884650002201917650001801939650001601957650002001973650003001993650002502023650002002048650001402068650002202082653001902104653002802123653001202151700001302163700001702176700001502193700001502208773007402223852000902297856008802306930003302394945001302427946001302440655001202453IND2325624520221118040323.0020226e200111  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232562452DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.11.11832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, W.S.10aMolecular detection and differentiation of Erwinia pyrifoliae and host range analysis of the Asian pear pathogen  ap. 1183-1188.  a2019-12-04  aThe recently described pathogen Erwinia pyrifoliae, isolated from Nashi pear fruit trees in Korea, resembles the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora in some of its properties. The two pathogens were classified into different species by DNA hybridization kinetics and microbiological criteria. From the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region as well as extracellular polysaccharide (EPS)-encoding genes, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed that specifically detect E. pyrifoliae but not the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora, and these primers were also applied to identify E. pyrifoliae in necrotic plant material. The genomes of several strains were digested with the restriction enzyme SpeI, and the DNA fragments were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Three groups of patterns could be distinguished for the isolated E. pyrifoliae strains, all different from various E. amylovora strains, which produce a relatively homogeneous PFGE pattern after SpeI digests. Typical fire blight host plants were assayed in a growth chamber or an experimental field for their susceptibility to E. pyrifoliae. A strong preference was found for pear varieties, whereas apple, cotoneaster, hawthorn, or raspberry rarely produced necrotic symptoms. E. pyrifoliae was readily detected in samples from pear orchards in South Korea during 1995 to 1998; however, the Asian pear pathogen was not recovered in necrotic plant tissue from 1999 and 2000. 3anucleic acid hybridization 3ahost range 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aErwinia amylovora 3aribosomal RNA 3ahost plants 3aPyrus pyrifolia 3apolymerase chain reaction 3anucleotide sequences 3apolysaccharides 3adetection 3adisease diagnosis 0aidentification 0amolecular sequence data 0aErwinia1 aJock, S.1 aPaulin, J.P.1 aRhim, S.L.1 aGeider, K.0 tPlant disease.g2001 Nov., v. 85, no. 11 p.1183-1188x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.11.11833Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03310naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001600146245012100162300001600283500001500299520187600314650002802190650001502218650001302233650003302246650001802279650001302297650003802310650002502348650003802373650000802411650001402419650002202433650001102455653002402466653001302490653001802503700001602521700002102537700001502558700001802573773007102591852000902662856008602671930003302757945001302790946001302803655001202816IND2322427820221118040333.0010807e200102  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232242782DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.2.2082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, P.L.10aCharacterization of a virus from pigeonpea with affinities to species in the genus Aureusvirus, family Tombusviridae  ap. 208-215.  a2019-12-04  aIn attempts to identify the causal agent of pigeonpea sterility mosaic disease (PSMD), which is transmitted by eriophyid mites, a virus was isolated with great difficulty from some PSMD-affected pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) plants from different locations in India. Once isolated from pigeonpea, the virus was transmitted readily by mechanical inoculation to several herbaceous species, reaching very high concentrations in some species. The virus was transmitted experimentally through soil to herbaceous test plants but not to pigeonpea. When virus particles were purified and inoculated mechanically to healthy pigeonpea, the virus induced necrosis in inoculated leaves only and did not spread systemically. Therefore, the virus is not the causal agent of PSMD. The virus has isometric particles approximately 30 nm in diameter that sediment as a single component and had a buoyant density in CsCl and Cs2SO4 of 1.34 and 1.27 g(.)cc-1, respectively. Purified virus particle preparations contained a single major protein of approximately 44 kDa and three RNA species of approximately 4,300, 2,700, and 1,500 nucleotides. Only the largest RNA species was infective to plants; the two smaller species were encapsidated subgenomic species of the 3' end of the larger genomic RNA. The viral genome was sequenced and showed 93% homology to that of Pothos latent virus (PoLV), a recently described virus in the genus Aureusvirus, family Tombusviridae, and was indistinguishable from PoLV in gel double-diffusion serological tests. This virus, therefore, is regarded as a pigeonpea isolate of PoLV (PoLV-PP). In field studies in different locations in India, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction detected PoLV-PP in 10.7% of PSMD-affected and 8.1% of asymptomatic pigeonpea plants. The significance of these findings is discussed. 3ainterspecific variation 3ahost range 3aetiology 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aCajanus cajan 3anecrosis 3aPigeon pea sterility mosaic virus 3adisease transmission 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aRNA 3avirulence 3avirus replication 3aleaves 0aspecies differences 0asymptoms 0apathogenicity1 aJones, A.T.1 aSreenivasulu, P.1 aFenton, B.1 aReddy, D.V.R.0 tPlant disease.g2001 Feb., v. 85, no. 2 p.208-215x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.2.2083Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02661naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001100146245010000157300001600257520152200273650001801795650001701813650002801830650001801858650002201876650001301898650003001911653001301941653002801954653001101982700001701993700002202010773008902032852000902121856008602130930003302216945001302249946001302262655001202275IND2322717920221118040317.0010827e200107  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232271792DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.7.7452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Z.10aEffects of water stress on Botryosphaeria blight of pistachio caused by Botryosphaeria dothidea  ap. 745-749.  aThe effects of water potential (psi) on spore germination, germ tube elongation, mycelial growth of Botryosphaeria dothidea, and development of Botryosphaeria blight of pistachio caused by this fungus were studied in the laboratory and greenhouse. In laboratory tests, spore germination, germ tube elongation, and mycelial growth of B. dothidea increased as psi decreased from 0 to -2.0 MPa and declined as psi decreased below -2.0 MPa. Water stress (psi < -0.260 MPa) increased the severity of Botryosphaeria blight on young detached pistachio leaves. In greenhouse inoculation experiments, drought-stressed 2-year-old pistachio trees (leaf psi < -0.635 MPa) developed more severe Botryosphaeria blight disease than the nonstressed trees (psi > -0.485 MPa) in both 1999 and 2000 experiments. In a similar experiment using 1-year-old potted pistachio trees in 2000, withholding water treatments did not cause enough drought stress in pistachio leaves (psi > -0.584 MPa) and did not result in higher disease than the nonstressed trees (psi = -0.466 MPa). The correlation coefficient between psi and disease index for 1999 experiments was 0.954, and for 2000 experiments I and II was 0.981 and 0.939, respectively. These results indicate that drought stress can be a major predisposing factor of pistachio to infection by B. dothidea. Results from this study can be used to better understand the disease outbreaks in California pistachio orchards and to develop integrated management strategies by adjusting irrigation. 3aPistacia vera 3awater stress 3aBotryosphaeria dothidea 3afungal spores 3aspore germination 3amycelium 3afungal diseases of plants 0asymptoms 0aexperimental infections 0agrowth1 aMorgan, D.P.1 aMichailides, T.J.0 tPlant disease.g2001 July, v. 85, no. 7 p.745-749wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.7.7453Available from publisher's Web site  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle04071naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001500146245013100161300001600292500001500308520259500323650002402918650001402942650001602956650000802972650001502980650002402995650002303019650002603042650001203068651001403080653001603094653002603110653001703136700001703153700001403170700001603184700002003200700001603220700002103236700001703257700001503274700002103289773008903310852000903399856008603408930003303494945001303527946001303540655001203553IND2322719320221118040302.0010827e200107  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232271932DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.7.7602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, S.Y.10aSoybean cyst nematode population development and associated soybean yields of resistant and susceptible cultivars in Minnesota  ap. 760-766.  a2019-12-04  aThe soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, is a major soybean yield-limiting factor, and the use of resistant cultivars is one of the most effective means to manage the nematode. During the past decade, a number of resistant cultivars in maturity groups I and II have been developed and made available to growers. A total of 47 resistant cultivars and nine susceptible cultivars were evaluated at 15 SCN-infested field sites and two noninfested sites during 1996 to 1998 in Minnesota. As expected, more nematodes developed on susceptible cultivars than on resistant cultivars. Egg density on susceptible cultivars increased by 1.9- to 10.6-fold during the growing season at 12 sites and did not change at the other three sites. Average egg density decreased over time for resistant cultivars at all sites, except where the initial egg density was low (less than or equal to 455 eggs per 100 cm3 soil). Nematode reproduction factors (Rf = egg density at harvest/egg density at planting) for individual resistant and susceptible cultivars were highly consistent across the eight sites where initial SCN density was more than 1,000 eggs per 100 cm3 soil. Resistance, however, varied among the cultivars, with the average Rf of individual resistant cultivars across the sites ranging from 0.3 to 1.7. Resistant cultivars produced an average yield of 3,082 kg/ha compared with 2,497 kg/ha by susceptible cultivars at eight of 10 sites where egg density at planting was greater than 700 eggs per 100 cm3 soil. In contrast, no difference in yield was observed between resistant and susceptible cultivars at sites where egg density at planting was lower than 500 eggs per 100 cm3 soil. Yield differences between resistant and susceptible cultivars increased with increasing initial SCN egg density. In six fields infested with initial densities of more than 5,000 eggs per 100 cm3 soil, resistant cultivars produced 28.4% (676 kg/ha) more yield on average than susceptible cultivars. Soybean yield increased when cultivars with increasing resistance to the SCN (lower Rf or females formed on roots) were grown in fields infested with SCN. Average relative yield (yield of a cultivar/average yield of all resistant cultivars at a site) of individual resistant cultivars across all SCN-infested sites ranged from 0.76 to 1.10. Yield consistency of soybean cultivars was low among the different sites, indicating that many other factors affected yield. Our results suggest growing resistant cultivars is an effective method to manage SCN in Minnesota while minimizing yield loss due to SCN. 3aHeterodera glycines 3acultivars 3aGlycine max 3aova 3acrop yield 3asexual reproduction 3adisease resistance 3afield experimentation 3adensity 3aMinnesota 0ainfestation 0abiological resistance 0ayield losses1 aPorter, P.M.1 aOrf, J.H.1 aReese, C.D.1 aStienstra, W.C.1 aYoung, N.D.1 aWalgenbach, D.D.1 aSchaus, P.J.1 aArlt, T.J.1 aBretenbach, F.R.0 tPlant disease.g2001 July, v. 85, no. 7 p.760-766wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.7.7603Available from publisher's Web site  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02728naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001600146245010200162300001600264500001500280520144100295650003901736650002601775650003301801650001701834650001801851650001901869650001101888650001401899650001001913650002201923650001401945651001501959653002801974653001802002700001602020700002102036773007102057852000902128856008602137930003302223945001302256946001302269655001202282IND2322427020221118040456.0010807e200102  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232242702DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.2.1692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarak, J.D.10aRole of crop debris and weeds in the epidemiology of bacterial leaf spot of lettuce in California  ap. 169-178.  a2019-12-04  aBacterial leaf spot of lettuce (BLS), caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. vitians, has increased in importance in California over the past 5 years. The pathogen can be seedborne, but it was not recovered from selected commercial lettuce seed lots planted during this time. Survival of X. campestris pv. vitians in association with plant debris was investigated in a 3-year field experiment in Salinas, CA. The initial lettuce spring crop was spray inoculated with X. campestris pv. vitians, which resulted in 100% disease incidence. Spring crops were followed by a 1-month summer fallow period, whereas fall crops were followed by a 5-month winter fallow period. High populations of X. campestris pv. vitians (up to 10(6) CFU/g) were recovered from lettuce plant debris after the 1-month summer fallow and BLS developed on all subsequent fall lettuce crops. During the winter fallow period, X. campestris pv. vitians populations associated with plant debris declined and, by 2 months after harvest, only small populations were detected. Spring crops also developed BLS, but at reduced levels. X. campestris pv. vitians was recovered from leaves of several symptomless weed species collected around commercial infested fields, but not from weeds collected around previously infested fields during fallow periods. During the course of this study, an X. campestris pv. vitians-specific polymerase chain reaction primer pair was developed. 3aXanthomonas campestris pv. vitians 3adiagnostic techniques 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aepidemiology 3acrop residues 3aLactuca sativa 3afallow 3aleaf spot 3aweeds 3aalternative hosts 3aincidence 3aCalifornia 0aexperimental infections 0aleaf spotting1 aKoike, S.T.1 aGilbertson, R.L.0 tPlant disease.g2001 Feb., v. 85, no. 2 p.169-178x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.2.1693Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02881naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245014200166300001800308500001500326520127000341650001801611650001901629650003401648650002901682650003501711650002601746650001301772650002001785650003801805650001401843650002101857653003001878653003401908653001801942700002201960700002001982700001802002700001802020700001902038700001902057700001502076700001402091700001602105773007402121852000902195856008802204930003302292945001302325946001302338655001202351IND2333125120221118040549.0030619e200210  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233312512DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.10.11092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbouzid, A.M.10aSerological studies using polyclonal antisera prepared against the viral coat protein of four begomoviruses expressed in Escherichia coli  ap. 1109-1114.  a2019-12-04  aPolyclonal rabbit antisera were produced to the coat protein of Bean golden mosaic virus Brazil isolate (BGMV), Cabbage leaf curl virus (CabLCV), Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), and Tomato mottle virus (ToMoV), all expressed in Escherichia coli by the pETh expression vector. The expressed coat protein of each virus was purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for use as an immunogen. The antisera to BGMV, CabLCV, TYLCV, and ToMoV reacted in indirect (plate-trapping) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with extracts from begomovirus-infected tissue. The antisera to BGMV, CabLCV, TYLCV, and ToMoV also reacted specifically with the test begomovirus antigens in leaf imprint blots and Western blots. The CabLCV and TYLCV antisera were used to detect Bean golden yellow mosaic virus antigens by immunogold labeling of thin sections of infected bean tissues. In tissue blot immunoassays, the TYLCV antiserum reacted well with TYLCV antigens but not with ToMoV antigens, while CabLCV antiserum reacted well with ToMoV antigens and weakly with TYLCV antigens.

In all, 66 two-way pathogen associations were tested. Of these, 39 associations were negative (occurred together less often than expected at random), 1 was positive (occurred together more often than expected at random), and, in 16 cases, the pathogens were not associated. An association between C. orbiculare and D. bryoniae occurred 24 times and, each time, the relationship was negative. This result, combined with different environmental requirements for infection, suggests that these pathogens either occupy different niches in the plant canopy or are antagonistic. No relationship between the cultivars grown or the fungicides applied and the pathogens isolated from specific field sites was found. Information on the dominant pathogens responsible for leaf spot epidemics in North Carolina's cucumber fields will be useful to target breeding and disease control strategies. 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aColletotrichum orbiculare 3aAlternaria cucumerina 3aCucumis sativus 3adisease prevalence 3aDidymella bryoniae 3aplant pathogens 3aCorynespora cassiicola 3aleaf spot 3aPseudoperonospora cubensis 3acrop rotation 3aleaves 3aNorth Carolina 0aetiology 0aAlternaria 0aleaf spotting1 aCampbell, C.L.0 tPlant disease.g2002 Oct., v. 86, no. 10 p.1094-1100x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.10.10943Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02276naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245011500166300001800281520114000299650001601439650001201455650002201467650002101489650001801510650002501528650001801553651001701571653002801588700001301616700001701629700001401646773007401660852000901734856008801743930003301831945001301864946001301877655001201890IND2333406420221118040446.0030708e200211  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233340642DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.11.12272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoorman, G.W.10aIdentification and characterization of Pythium species associated with greenhouse floral crops in Pennsylvania  ap. 1227-1231.  aDuring 1996 to 2001, samples submitted to clinics from commercial greenhouses involved 11 species and two unidentified isolates of Pythium from 110 plant samples, five potting soil tests, and five tests of irrigation water. Pythium irregulare was found in 45% of the plant samples, four of the five water samples, and three of the five potting soils. Pythium aphanidermatum accounted for 29% of all plant but 77% of the poinsettia samples. The Pelargonium samples received were infected with P. aphanidermatum, P. dissotocum, P. heterothallicum, group F, P. irregulare, P. myriotylum, and P. ultimum. The base pair sequence of the ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2 regions of ribosomal DNA effectively differentiated the species encountered. The ras-related protein gene sequence did not differentiate P. aphanidermatum, P. arrhenomanes, and P. deliense from one another. One isolate each of P. cylindrosporum, P. dissotocum, P. heterothallicum, P. splendens, and P. ultimum exhibited resistance to the phenylamide fungicide mefenoxam, an isomer of metalaxyl, while 38% of the P. aphanidermatum and 37% of the P. irregulare isolates were resistant. 3agreenhouses 3aPythium 3aspecies diversity 3airrigation water 3agrowing media 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal DNA 3aPennsylvania 0amolecular sequence data1 aKang, S.1 aGeiser, D.M.1 aKim, S.H.0 tPlant disease.g2002 Nov., v. 86, no. 11 p.1227-1231x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.11.12273Available from publisher's Web site  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02640naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245010600165300001800271520154300289650002801832650001801860650002501878650002101903650001601924650001701940650001401957650001601971651001201987700002001999700001702019773007402036852000902110856008802119930003302207945001302240946001302253655001202266IND2333406720221118040625.0030708e200211  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233340672DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.11.12402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, G.L.10aSensitivity of Sclerotinia homoeocarpa isolates to propiconazole and impact on control of dollar spot  ap. 1240-1246.  aIn response to reports of reduced efficacy of propiconazole for control of dollar spot, isolates of Sclerotinia homoeocarpa were collected from several locations in Georgia and tested for sensitivity to propiconazole and other demethylation-inhibiting (DMI) fungicides. Two discriminatory concentrations of propiconazole (0.02 and 0.2 microgram ml(-1)) were used to detect lower in vitro sensitivity in two populations that had been exposed repeatedly to propiconazole than in four nonexposed populations. Mean 50% effective concentration (EC50) values for a nonexposed population (baseline) and a DMI-exposed population were 0.0049 and 0.0283 micrograms ml(-1), respectively. Positive correlations were significant among log10 EC50 values for propiconazole, fenarimol, and myclobutanil but not between triadimefon and any of the other three fungicides, indicating cross-resistance relationships in this pathogen may not be universal among the DMIs. In greenhouse experiments, propiconazole-treated bentgrass was inoculated with seven isolates of S. homoeocarpa differing in sensitivity to propiconazole. Incubation period decreased and relative area under the disease progress curve and disease severity 28 days after inoculation increased linearly with increasing log10 EC50 value of the isolate. Results of this study confirm a significant relationship between in vitro sensitivity of S. homoeocarpa and in planta control efficacy of propiconazole and provide evidence of field resistance to propiconazole in S. homoeocarpa in Georgia. 3aSclerotinia homoeocarpa 3apropiconazole 3afungicide resistance 3across resistance 3alethal dose 3amyclobutanil 3afenarimol 3atriadimefon 3aGeorgia1 aStevenson, K.L.1 aBurpee, L.L.0 tPlant disease.g2002 Nov., v. 86, no. 11 p.1240-1246x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.11.12403Available from publisher's Web site  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03050naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001600146245010800162300001600270520187100286650001902157650001602176650001802192650002402210650001102234650001302245650001702258650002002275651001102295653000902306653001102315653001102326653001702337700001702354700001302371773009002384852000902474856008602483930003302569945001302602946001302615655001202628IND2332819420221118040454.0030530e200209  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233281942DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.9.9332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSipes, B.S.10aInteractions between Rotylenchus reniformis and Pineapple mealybug wilt associated virus-1 in Pineapple  ap. 933-938.  aThe individual and combined effects of Pineapple mealybug wilt associated virus-1 (PMWaV-1) infection in pineapple, Ananas comosus, and Rotylenchus reniformis on pineapple growth were evaluated under greenhouse and field conditions. Under greenhouse conditions, no effect of PMWaV-1 infection on pineapple growth or nematode reproduction was observed. Under field conditions, the interaction of PMWaV-1 and nematodes was evaluated in plant and ratoon crops. In the plant crop, pineapple in plots treated with the nematicide 1,3-dichloropropane showed increased vegetative growth, whereas virus infection had no effect on vegetative growth. Nematodes reduced the average fruit weight (P = 0.01), whereas PMWaV-1 infection did not (P > 0.14). However, more fruit in the largest size classes (sizes 7 and 8) were produced in PMWaV-1-free plots than in PMWaV-1-infected plots (P = 0.03). The average fruit weight decreased in the presence of virus or nematodes. The smallest fruits were from PMWaV-1-infected plants infested with R. reniformis. More early-ripening fruit (30%) were produced by plants infected with PMWaV-1 than by PMWaV-free plants (P < 0.05). PMWaV-1 infection may be one of the reasons for asynchronous fruit ripening, which is a top limiting factor for pineapple production in Hawaii. In the ratoon crop, PMWaV-1 infection reduced fruit weight by 9% (P < 0.01). whereas nematode effects were similar across treatments (P > 0.10). More fruit in the three largest size categories were produced in PMWaV-1-free plots than in PMWaV-1-infected plots (P < 0.01). PMWaV-1 infection reduced the number of fruit produced in the ratoon crop (P < 0.02). An interaction (P < 0.03) between R. reniformis and PMWaV-1 infection status was detected in the ratoon crop. The fewest fruit were produced in plots with PMWaV-1-infected plants that were nematode infected. 3aAnanas comosus 3aRotylenchus 3aplant viruses 3asexual reproduction 3aweight 3aripening 3aharvest date 3amixed infection 3aHawaii 0asize 0afruits 0agrowth 0ainteractions1 aSether, D.M.1 aHu, J.S.0 tPlant disease.g2002 Sept., v. 86, no. 9 p.933-938wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.9.9333Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02733naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001800147245011700165300001800282500001500300520147100315650001401786650002201800650001201822650002101834650002501855650001401880650001201894650002601906650001401932650002101946651001201967653001901979653001101998653001202009700002002021700001702041773007402058852000902132856008702141930003302228945001302261946001302274655001202287IND2332821420221118040601.0030530e200209  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233282142DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.9.10192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMertely, J.C.10aTiming of fungicide applications for Botrytis cinerea based on development stage of strawberry flowers and fruit  ap. 1019-1024.  a2019-12-04  aDuring the 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 growing seasons, field experiments were conducted to identify the developmental stage(s) of strawberry flowers and fruit that requires fungicide applications to control Botrytis fruit rot. Fenhexamid, a protectant fungicide, was applied to individual newly opened flowers or fruit of cultivar Sweet Charlie at defined intervals after anthesis. In 1999-2000, a single application of fenhexamid at anthesis controlled Botrytis fruit rot as well as multiple weekly applications beginning at anthesis. During both seasons, disease control deteriorated as applications were delayed 7 and 14 days after anthesis. This trend was described by linear regression equations relating the time of application to Botrytis fruit rot incidence. Additional treatments tested the effects of emasculation and petal removal 3 to 7 days after anthesis. Emasculation significantly reduced disease incidence in 2000-2001. Petal removal produced modest but significant reductions in 1999-2000, but not in 2000-2001. These results demonstrate that strawberry flowers are more susceptible to Botrytis cinerea than green fruit, and suggest that stamens are the principal infection court. Fungicide applications should focus on peak bloom periods to minimize fungicide use and optimize control of preharvest Botrytis fruit rot. During these periods, applications should be made at close intervals (less than or equal to 7 days) to minimize losses to Botrytis. 3acultivars 3aFragaria ananassa 3acorolla 3aBotrytis cinerea 3adevelopmental stages 3aphenology 3astamens 3afield experimentation 3aincidence 3aapplication rate 3aFlorida 0afungus control 0afruits 0aflowers1 aMacKenzie, S.J.1 aLegard, D.E.0 tPlant disease.g2002 Sept., v. 86, no. 9 p.1019-1024x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.9.10193Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03256naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245010800165300001800273520204200291650001702333650001702350650003002367650002702397650001002424650001402434650001402448650002102462650001302483650003002496650001602526651001002542653002802552700001802580773009202598852000902690856008802699930003302787945001302820946001302833655001202846IND2332460620221118040642.0030508e200212  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233246062DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.12.13572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilcox, W.F.10aIdentities and geographic distributions of Phytophthora spp. causing root rot of red raspberry in Chile  ap. 1357-1362.  aFive identified and two unidentified Phytophthora spp. were isolated from diseased roots of dead or declining red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) plants sampled from 18 plantations along a >1,000-km north-south axis in Chile. The array of Phytophthora spp. isolated was strongly associated with geographical location. P. fragariae var. rubi was recovered from 75 and 60% of the plantations in the southern (40 degrees 16' to 40 degrees 53' S latitude) and central (34 degrees 35' to 37 degrees 23' S latitude) production sectors, respectively, but was not recovered from any plantation in the northern sector (32 degrees 43' to 33 degrees 45' S latitude). Similarly, P. megasperma and P. gonopodyides were recovered from multiple plantations in the southern and central sectors but were not recovered in the northern sector. In contrast, P. cryptogea was recovered from 80% of the plantations in both the northern and central sectors but not from any plantation in the south, whereas P. citricola was isolated from diseased plants in all sectors. In subsequent pathogenicity trials, P. citricola, P. cryptogea, and an unidentified Phytophthora sp. were equally and highly virulent on 'Heritage' red raspberry in each of three greenhouse experiments. The other species were less virulent in the experiment when soil temperatures were highest (mean weekly maximum = 27.5 degrees C) relative to the other two experiments when temperatures were more moderate (mean weekly maxima of 19.9 and 23.7 degrees C). Isolates identified as P. cryptogea were very similar to P. cryptogea isolates recovered previously from kiwi fruit in Chile and from deciduous fruit trees in California with respect to morphological characters and electrophoretic banding patterns of soluble mycelial proteins. Using the same criteria, isolates identified as P. gonopodyides were very similar to isolates recovered earlier from deciduous fruit crops in New York, which previously were identified as P. cryptogea sensu lato but are hereby reclassified as P. gonopodyides. 3aRubus idaeus 3aPhytophthora 3ageographical distribution 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aroots 3avirulence 3acultivars 3asoil temperature 3aroot rot 3afungal diseases of plants 3aplantations 3aChile 0aexperimental infections1 aLatorre, B.A.0 tPlant disease.g2002 Dec., v. 86, no. 12 p.1357-1362wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.12.13573Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02887naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245013600177300001600313500001900329500002400348520168100372650001502053650001302068650001302081650001102094650002102105650002302126651002202149653003502171653001702206653003702223653002402260700002502284700001902309773010902328852000902437856005502446655001202501IND4433197520221118040528.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443319752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00643.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZafra Calvo, Noelia.10aDiscerning the impact of human-mediated factors on biodiversity using bioclimatic envelope models and partial regression techniques  ap. 300-309.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncludes references  aHuman-related pressures are growing in species-rich regions and pose a threat to the conservation of biodiversity. Here, we use the available data for five taxonomic groups (ferns, monocotyledons, dicotyledons, birds and monkeys) to exemplify a procedure directed to discriminate the degree of conflict between human actions and biodiversity. Bioko island, Equatorial Guinea. Using bioclimatic envelope modelling techniques devoted to produce estimations of the potential distributions, we generated geographical representations of the variation in the total number of species as well as in the number of endemic and threatened species. We then employed partial regression techniques to determine how and to what extent current environmental, habitat and human-derived variables are associated with these potential species richness values. Although the type of associations we looked for was sometimes difficult to discern since the same patterns could be explained by different types of variables, our results show that potential species richness values are generally positively associated with human-related factors (mainly agriculture and bushmeat hunting activities), suggesting that the localities with environmental conditions favourable to higher species richness tend to be those exploited by humans. We propose that the combined use of distribution models and partial regression techniques can support a better understanding of the relationship between species occurrences/preferences and human-related factors and inform future conservation initiatives, particularly in small but hyperdiverse territories, in which dispersal limitations do not play a prominent role. 3aLiliopsida 3abushmeat 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aspecies richness 3athreatened species 3aEquatorial Guinea 0aBioclimatic envelope modelling 0aBioko island 0ahuman-biodiversity relationships 0apartial regressions1 aRodriguez, Miguel A.1 aLobo, Jorge M.0 tDiversity & distributions.g2010 Mar., v. 16, no. 2 p.300-309dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1366-95167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00643.x 7aarticle01373naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245006100172300001600233500002400249520051300273650001800786650002500804650002900829650001400858773013200872852000901004856009401013655001201107IND4460022220221118040524.0110715s1987    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446002222DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1987.tb00417.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDicks, Brian.14aThe FSC Oil Pollution Research Unit-the 1980s and beyond  ap. 111-126.  aIncludes references  aResearch into the effects of oil contamination in estuaries and coastal waters has been the fundamental aim of OPRU since its inception in 1967.

Methods and Results: A total of 106 quinolone-resistant Shigella isolates obtained from paediatric patients during hospital-based surveillance from January 2003 to June 2010 were screened for the presence of various PMQR determinants. Of 106 isolates, 8 (7·5%) showed the presence of aac (6′)-Ib-cr and 3 (2·8%) harboured the qnrB genes with 2 (1·9%) of these isolates showing the presence of both. All the 9 isolates had uniform mutations in gyrA (S83L) and in parC (S80I). Conclusions: The prevalence of fluoroquinolone-acetylating aminoglycoside acetyltransferase {aac (6′)-Ib-cr} gene is higher than qnrB gene among the clinical Shigella isolates. These PMQR determinants were detected in the Shigella isolates obtained from 2008-2010, indicating that it happens in a stepwise manner following the multiple mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions increase or extend resistance to quinolones or fluoroquinolones. Significance and Impact of Study: The prevalence of these genes are of grave concern as it may be horizontally transferred to other human pathogenic bacteria and can lead to therapeutic failure as a consequence of antimicrobial resistance, not only for the islands but also for the entire south-east region. The results obtained should encourage further studies on the implications of the presence, distribution, association and variation of these determinants in our quest for understanding PMQR. 3aShigella 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3afluoroquinolones 3agenes 3ahumans 3aislands 3amonitoring 3amutation 3apatients 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aChild, Preschool 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDysentery, Bacillaryxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aFemale 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPrevalence 2aQuinolonesxpharmacology 2aShigellaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 3aAndaman and Nicobar Islands 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aBhattacharjee, H.1 aThamizhmani, R.1 aSayi, D.S.1 aBharadwaj, A.P.1 aSinghania, M.1 aSugunan, A.P.1 aRoy, S.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2011 Aug., v. 53, no. 2 p.247-251dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2011.03092.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02222naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245012300171300001400294500002400308520121000332650002801542650001601570650001401586650001601600650001701616650001101633650001001644700002101654773013001675852000901805856009401814655001201908IND4459821920221118040712.0110708s1986    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445982192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1986.tb01771.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDodson, Gary10aExamination of two morphs of gall-forming Aciurina (Diptera: Tephritidae): ecological and genetic evidence for species  ap. 63-79.  aIncludes references  aAciurina bigeloviae (Cockerell) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a gall-forming tephritid fly associated with rubber rabbitbrush, Chrysothamnus nauseosus (Pallas) Britton (Compositae), throughout the western United States. Two distinct gall morphologies were found among A. bigeloviae populations, each associated with its own morphologically distinct group of subspecies of C. nauseosus. Adults emerging from these galls can be distinguished on the basis of wing morphology and pronotal colour. Electrophoretic analysis of these two morphs suggested limited, unidirectional gene flow between them. Results of several other investigations were consistent with a restricted gene flow hypothesis. Heterotypic matings occurred in the laboratory, but at a depressed level. Host plant preferences, ovipositional success on the different host plant groups, and two life history parameters differed between the two fly types. Based on these multiple lines of evidence, we concluded that these two morphs of Aciurina represent two species: A. bigeloviae and A. trixa Curran. Reasons why these flies might be more appropriately viewed as host races are discussed as are scenarios which might account for their divergence. 3aChrysothamnus nauseosus 3aTephritidae 3agene flow 3ahost plants 3alife history 3amorphs 3araces1 aGeorge, Sarah B.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1986 Sept., v. 29, no. 1 p.63-79dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw4674x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1986.tb01771.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03064naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245014800189300001600337500002400353520135000377650001401727650002701741650002601768650002101794650002701815650001101842650000901853650001901862650002201881650001901903650001001922650001801932650002001950650002001970650002901990650003802019650006002057650003002117650001802147650002502165650002302190650003002213650001702243651001602260651001402276651001602290773011502306852000902421856009202430655001202522IND4459835820221118040753.0110708s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445983582DNAL7 a215854052pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2011.03086.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWohlsen, T.D.10aComparative evaluation of chromogenic agar CM1046 and mFC agar for detection of E. coli and thermotolerant coliform bacteria from water samples  ap. 155-160.  aIncludes references  aAims: The equivalence of Oxoid (CM 1046) Brilliance⁽TM⁾E. coli/coliform selective agar to mFC agar, as used in the Australian/New Zealand Standard Method to detect thermotolerant coliforms and Escherichia coli in water samples, was assessed. Methods and Results: A total of 244 water samples were analysed in parallel over a 5-month period. Sewage effluent samples (n = 131, sites = 43), freshwater (n = 62, sites = 18) and marine/brackish water samples (n = 51, sites = 23) were analysed. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test showed a varying degree of statistical difference between the two methods. All matrices had a higher recovery in the trial method. Enterococci faecalis, Aeromonas spp. and Vibrio spp. did not grow on the CM1046 agar, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter aerogenes were inhibited. Conclusions: The use of CM 1046 for the detection and enumeration of E. coli and thermotolerant coliforms in water samples is a suitable alternative to the AS/NZS Standard Method. Significance and Impact of the study: The use of CM1046 agar was less labour intensive and time consuming, as no secondary confirmation steps were required. Confirmed results could be reported within 24 h of sample analysis, as compared to 48 h with the reference method.

Methods and Results: A Matlab algorithm was developed for the estimation of model parameters. Glucose fermentation by B. bruxellensis was studied by varying its concentration (5, 9·3, 13·8, 16·5, 17·6 and 21·4%). The increase in substrate concentration up to a certain limit was accompanied by an increase in ethanol and biomass production; at a substrate concentration of 50-138 g l⁻¹, the ethanol and biomass production were 24, 59 and 6·3, 11·4 g l⁻¹, respectively. However, an increase in glucose concentration to 165 g l⁻¹ led to a drastic decrease in product formation and substrate utilization. Conclusions: The model successfully simulated the batch kinetic observed in all cases. The confidence intervals were also estimated at each phase at a 0·95 probability level in a t-Student distribution for f degrees of freedom. The maximum ethanol and biomass yields were obtained with an initial glucose concentration of 138 g l⁻¹. Significance and Impact of the Study: These experiments illustrate the importance of using a mathematical model applied to kinetic behaviour on glucose concentration by B. bruxellensis. 3aalgorithms 3abiomass production 3aconfidence interval 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3aglucose 3amathematical models 3ayeasts 2aBatch Cell Culture Techniques 2aBiomass 2aBrettanomycesxmetabolism 2aDNA, Fungal 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aFood Microbiology 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aModels, Biological1 aGarcia-Alvarado, Y.1 aGomez-Rodriguez, J.1 aPhister, T.1 aDelia, M.L.1 aStrehaiano, P.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2011 Aug., v. 53, no. 2 p.141-149dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2011.03081.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03507naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245007200123300001600195500014400211520203600355650001302391650001002404650001602414650002502430650001702455650001402472650001202486650001202498650001302510650001402523650001802537650002202555650001002577650002302587650001702610650000902627650001702636650001002653650001202663650001202675650001802687651001102705651001802716700001802734700001702752700001502769773014502784856005102929852000902980655001202989IND4511273120221118040305.0150409e20150220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451127312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGera, A.10aTrends in ornamental production, virus detection and identification  ap. 141-148.  aPaper presented at the XIII International Symposium on Virus Diseases of Ornamental Plants held June 24-29, 2012, Ski and Grimstad (Norway)  aThe economic importance of ornamentals has been increasing in many countries, and international demand has rapidly expanded. Cut flowers represent the largest segment of the industry followed by flowering pot plants, tree and nursery crops, flower bulbs, and other propagation material. The horticultural sector has seen much structural change both nationally and internationally over the last decades, but the implications for plant health have been neglected. We review the trends in ornamental production in the context of recent developments including the movement towards a global horticultural market, the rise of the horticultural industry of many developing countries, and the risk of plant virus diseases. Over the decade, there have been many changes in the ornamental production and marketing. This has resulted from the introduction of many innovations in production, handling, and transport. These changes have contributed to a marked increase in the international exchange of plant material. In all continents, there is a general trend towards fewer and larger horticultural growers, an increasing role of supermarkets and a concentration of the retail pathways. However, the increase in volume of new materials carries new risks of the introduction of both new viruses and new vectors, and of new, potentially more severe isolates of those viruses that have been known for many years. New production facilities are expanding in South America and in emerging centers of cut flower production in Africa. An important trend in the international flower market is the increased emphasis on novelties and high quality. Morphology and plant architecture have gained increasing importance in breeding programs of ornamental plants. Quality factors related to flower longevity, as well as tolerance and resistance against pest and diseases, including viroids and viral diseases are essential criteria in a competitive floriculture market. As competition in the world market increases, quality becomes a more important factor. 3abreeding 3abulbs 3acut flowers 3adeveloping countries 3afloriculture 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agrowers 3aindustry 3alongevity 3anursery crops 3aornamental plants 3apests 3aplant architecture 3aplant health 3arisk 3asupermarkets 3atrees 3aviroids 3aviruses 3aworld markets 3aAfrica 3aSouth America1 aBeckelman, E.1 aMaslenin, L.1 aZeidan, M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Feb. 20, , no. 1072 p.141-148dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1072/1072_17.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013700125300001400262500014400276520111500420650002801535650002701563650001101590650001401601650001201615650001401627650001201641650001101653650001101664650002201675650001201697650001601709650001101725700001801736700001701754700001801771700001901789773014301808856005001951852000902001655001202010IND4511272320221118040328.0150409e20150220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451127232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjorke, L.10aDifferences in yield of cuttings and cultivation performance between virus-free and virus-infected plants of Kalanchoe Blossfeldiana  ap. 91-96.  aPaper presented at the XIII International Symposium on Virus Diseases of Ornamental Plants held June 24-29, 2012, Ski and Grimstad (Norway)  aThis publication describes experiments with stock plants and pot-plant production to quantify the performance of virus-free plants of four cultivars of Kalanchoe compared to plants infected with Kalanchoe mosaic virus (KMV). Virus infection with KMV affected the production of cuttings in sensitive cultivars. The total fresh weight of cuttings produced by virus-infected stock plants of the cultivar âCharmâ was up to 40.6% lower than the total fresh weight of cuttings produced by virus-free stock plants.The less sensitive cultivars had negligible or no fresh or dry weight reduction. The sensitive cultivar âCharmâ had a seven days shorter production period from rooting to flowering as compared to virus-free plants of the same cultivar grown during the autumn. From our results we can conclude that KMV affects a sensitive cultivar as âCharmâ in autumn and winter, but the virus infection has less or no effect on cutting production and time to flowering in the less sensitive cultivars. The recovery and tolerance to virus infection is most pronounced in spring and summer. 3aKalanchoe blossfeldiana 3aKalanchoe mosaic virus 3aautumn 3acultivars 3acutting 3aflowering 3arooting 3aspring 3asummer 3avirus-free plants 3aviruses 3aweight loss 3awinter1 aWillumsen, K.1 aSkjeseth, G.1 aHaugslien, S.1 aBlystad, D.

Sometimes only the strength of selection varies, its direction remaining constant, but sometimes the direction of selection also changes. Selection of a food may be more intense as that food becomes rarer, or vice versa. I discuss here the situations in which animals, particularly predators, may maximize their feeding efficiency by behaving in ways that result in frequency-dependent selection of their food. These include cases in which different types of prey occupy different ecological niches, those in which there are benefits or costs to mixed diets for the predator, those in which rarer types of prey provide easier targets, those in which the different types of prey provide unequal benefits to the animal eating them, those in which direct comparison of the benefits is possible, those in which sampling is necessary because the benefits are unknown, and Batesian and other mimicries. Frequency-dependent selection of food is likely to be common and widespread: to assume frequency independence, without testing, may often be misleading. 3aanimals 3adiet 3afoods 3aingestion 3aniches 3apredators0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1984 , v. 23, no. 2/3 p.177-199dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw4671x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1984.tb00137.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01262naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245005400172300001600226500002400242520039300266650001400659650001600673650002700689650002100716700001500737773012900752852000900881856009400890655001200984IND4459816020221118040429.0110708s1984    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445981602DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1984.tb00132.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPartridge, L.10aMechanisms for frequency-dependent mating success  ap. 113-132.  aIncludes references  aWe consider ways in which non-frequency-dependent processes could generate negatively frequency-dependent male mating success (the rare male effect).

In contrast to domestic mango market, there are high quality requirements for export mango in terms of uniform shape and size. As fruit development takes place during the dry season, irrigation becomes important to improve fruit production. However, due to lacking water resources and expanding mango area, farmers are facing increasing water shortage. Therefore, deficit irrigation strategies such as partial rootzone drying (PRD) were developed to increase water use efficiency and solve the problem of fruit weight reduction during development. However, partial rootzone drying might cause drought stress response, producing proline to balance cell solution and affects fruit development. In addition, PRD might affect tree vigor and yield in the long-term. During two seasons, mango trees in a commercial orchard were irrigated by micro sprinklers, calculating application depth from evapotranspiration (ETo). Two treatments were applied: (i) full irrigation with 100% ETc; (ii) PRD irrigation with 50% ETc. Leaves were collected every week during fruit growth for proline analysis. Fruit growth and yield were recorded to determine physiological response. It was found that the differences in average proline concentration between PRD and full irrigation were not significant. However, a strong correlation was found between proline concentration and average water content. The fruit growth rates, yield and water use efficiency were similar in both treatments with a share of more than 90% marketable fruit. 3acrop yield 3adeficit irrigation 3adry season 3aevapotranspiration 3aexports 3afarmers 3afruiting 3aincome 3airrigation rates 3aleaves 3amangoes 3amarkets 3aprices 3aproline 3aroot zone drying 3asprinklers 3astress response 3atrees 3avigor 3awater content 3awater shortages 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3aweight loss 3aThailand1 aSringarm, K.1 aSruamsiri, P.1 aOngprasert, S.1 aSpreer, W.1 aSchulze, K.1 aMüller, J.,0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Jan. 21, , no. 1066 p.85-94dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1066/1066_8.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245008500172300001400257500002400271520160300295650001001898650001301908650001601921650001501937650001301952650003001965650001201995650001002007650001102017650002402028650001102052651001202063773012402075852000902199856009402208655001202302IND4459820920221118040355.0110708s1986    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445982092DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1986.tb01747.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanski, Ilkka10aPopulation dynamics of shrews on small islands accord with the equilibrium model  ap. 23-36.  aIncludes references  aThree of the six species of shrew in Finland, Sorex araneus, S. caecutiens, and S. minutus, are common on the mainland and widespread on islands in lakes. The islands range from 0.01 to 500 ha in area, and from 10 to 3000 m in isolation (distance from the mainland). The species-area relationship, the lack of importance of habitat diversity, the increasing frequency of unoccupied small islands with isolation, and direct observations of small populations, all suggest that populations on small islands have a high extinction rate. Demographic stochasticity is the main cause of extinctions in the superior competitor, S. araneus, which occurs consistently on islands greater than 2 ha. The small species, S. caecutiens and S. minutus, are more sensitive to environmental stochasticity than is S. araneus, and are inferior to it in interspecific competition; these factors probably contribute to the absence of the small species from many islands tens of hectares in area. Frequent colonization of islands less than 500 m from the mainland is indicated by large numbers of shrews trapped from tiny islets where breeding is not possible, by increasing epigenetic divergence of island populations with isolation, and by observations of dispersal to and colonization of islands. Dispersal ability decreases with decreasing individual size, which may partly explain the absence of the small shrews from many relatively large islands. The shrew populations persist in a dynamic equilibrium on the islands. Epigenetic morphological variation is a useful tool in ecological studies of island populations. 3aSorex 3abreeding 3aepigenetics 3aextinction 3ahabitats 3ainterspecific competition 3aislands 3alakes 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3ashrews 3aFinland0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1986 May, v. 28, no. 1-2 p.23-36dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1986.tb01747.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle05178naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245006400174300001600238500002400254520390100278650001504179650001304194650001004207650001904217650001504236650001004251650002404261650001104285650001604296650001704312650002304329650001204352650001204364650001404376650001204390650001704402651001404419651001804433651001804451700002204469773012604491852000904617856009404626655001204720IND4459820720221118040459.0110708s1986    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445982072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1986.tb01753.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorgan, Gary S.10aExtinction and the zoogeography of West Indian land mammals  ap. 167-203.  aIncludes references  aThe timing and causes of extinctions of West Indian land mammals during three time intervals covering the last 20000 years (late Pleistocene and early Holocene, Amerindian, and post-Columbian) are discussed in detail. Late Pleistocene extinctions are attributed to climatic change and the post-glacial rise in sea level, whereas most late Holocene extinctions are probably human caused, resulting from predation, habitat destruction and introduction of exotic species. Extinctions have dramatically altered the composition of the non-volant mammal fauna, but have had a lesser impact on bats. Of the 76 recognized species of living and extinct non-volant mammals in the West Indies, 67 species (88%) have gone extinct since the late Pleistocene, whereas only eight of the 59 species of bats (14%) have disappeared during this same time interval. A larger percentage of Antillean bat species (24%) have suffered localized extinction on certain islands, particularly obligate cave-dwelling forms. These local extinctions occurred primarily on small islands, and probably resulted from changes in cave microclimates and flooding of low-lying caves by rising sea levels. The majority of West Indian bats and all of the edentates, primates and rodents are Neotropical in origin. The South American fossil record indicates that most West Indian terrestrial mammals did not evolve until the early Miocene or thereafter. The Caribbean islands had assumed essentially their modern position and configuration by the Miocene, thus leaving overwater dispersal as the primary mechanism by which these endemic South American mammal groups reached the islands. The primitive insectivores, Solenodon and Nesophontes, are derived from Early Tertiary forms in North America that may have reached the islands through vicariance by way of a proto-Antillean archipelago. Many of the bats are either conspecific or congeneric with mainland taxa, suggesting that most species reached the islands by overwater dispersal during the Late Cenozoic, primarily from Central and South America. Two hypothetical immigration rates are calculated for West Indian land mammals, one assuming the earliest colonization in the late Eocene and the other based on an early Miocene origin. The known Late Quaternary and living Antillean land mammal fauna was derived from approximately 50 separate colonization events (13 for non-volant mammals and 37 for bats) giving immigration rates of one species per 800000 years since the late Eocene, or one species per 400000 years since the early Miocene. Immigration rates for bats are approximately three times greater than those for non-volant mammals throughout the Tertiary and eight times greater in the Pleistocene, presumably reflecting their greater dispersal abilities. These immigration rates should be considered rough values, owing to deficiencies in the fossil record, especially the absence of pre-Pleistocene fossils. Extinction rates calculated for the last 20 000 years demonstrate that an average of one species of mammal went extinct every 267 years during that time period. Since the arrival of man in the West Indies some 4500 years ago, 37 species of non-volant mammals have disappeared giving the rapid extinction rate of one species every 122 years. Island area-species diversity curves are plotted for both the current and late Pleistocene mammal faunas. All Caribbean islands with a reasonably complete fossil record have more species in the late Pleistocene and Holocene than in the living fauna. The living non-volant mammals of the West Indies do not constitute a natural fauna, but are an impoverished subset of species that managed to escape the extinctions that decimated the remainder of the fauna. Historical or theoretical biogeographic analyses of Antillean mammals that fail to incorporate extinct forms will be unlikely to elicit any meaningful patterns. 3aChiroptera 3aPrimates 3acaves 3aclimate change 3aextinction 3afauna 3ahabitat destruction 3ahumans 3aimmigration 3ainsectivores 3aintroduced species 3aislands 3arodents 3asea level 3atropics 3azoogeography 3aCaribbean 3aNorth America 3aSouth America1 aWoods, Charles A.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1986 May, v. 28, no. 1-2 p.167-203dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1986.tb01753.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02430naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002400154245015200178300001300330500002400343520130500367650001401672650001501686650001401701650001201715650001301727650001601740650001401756651001501770700002001785700001701805700002601822773012901848852000901977856009401986655001202080IND4459819520221118040258.0110708s1985    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445981952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1985.tb01549.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNilsson, L.

In a primary forest on the Central Plateau of Madagascar Angraecum arachnites Schltr. was found to be pollinated by and adapted to a single species of hawk-moth, Panogena lingens (Butler), despite abundance of many concurrent Sphingidae of which several were also long-tongued. Furthermore, P. lingens was dimorphic in the length and breadth of its proboscis and only the morph with the longest and most slender proboscis was recorded to pollinate A. arachnites. Exclusive and precise adaptation to the latter morph of P. lingens existed in floral morphology and probably in other characteristics such as flowering phenology and chemical signalling. Several concurrently flowering orchid species were sharing P. lingens as a pollinator resource. The monophily in A. arachnites is interpreted as a result of a refined long-term specialization developed within an archaic evolutionary relationship in a relatively stable environment. The extraordinary number and diversity of long-spurred Orchidaceae in Madagascar appears to be a direct coevolutionary consequence of an Old-World-unique diversity of long-tongued archaic Sphingidae that has persisted in this isolated land. 3aAngraecum 3aSphingidae 3aflowering 3aforests 3aplateaus 3apollination 3aproboscis 3aMadagascar1 aJönsson, Lars.1 aRASON, LYDIA1 aRANDRIANJOHANY, EMILE0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1985 Sept., v. 26, no. 1 p.1-19dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw4673x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1985.tb01549.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01925naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245011600173300001400289500002400303520086900327650001701196650000901213650001301222650001101235650002101246650001401267650001001281651001401291651001101305651001301316651001301329773013001342852000901472856009401481655001201575IND4459819720221118040236.0110708s1985    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445981972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1985.tb01551.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReid, David G.10aHabitat and zonation patterns of Littoraria species (Gastropoda: Littorinidae) in Indo-Pacific mangrove forests  ap. 39-68.  aIncludes references  aThe zonation of 15 species of Littoraria in the scabra group is described, using a transect method, at 13 mangrove localities in Australia, Thailand, Malaysia and Hawaii. At these localities the littorinids occurred only on trees, and showed both vertical and horizontal patterns of zonation, with broad overlaps between co-occurring species. It is suggested that vertical distribution is determined mainly by behavioural responses, while the landward limits of horizontal distribution may be set by physiological tolerance. Several species occurred predominantly on either leaf or bark substrates, but no consistent associations with tree species were found. On the basis of local distribution patterns, Littoraria species can be classified as continental or oceanic in character. Oceanic species may be less tolerant of sediment in the water or on the substrate. 3aLittorinidae 3abark 3ahabitats 3aleaves 3amangrove forests 3asediments 3atrees 3aAustralia 3aHawaii 3aMalaysia 3aThailand0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1985 Sept., v. 26, no. 1 p.39-68dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw4673x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1985.tb01551.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02422naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245012300170300001600293500002400309520121700333650001501550650001201565650001101577650001301588650002501601650001001626650002401636650002001660650002601680650001601706650001101722700001501733700001901748700001801767773014801785852000901933856009401942655001202036IND4459818220221118040337.0110708s1985    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445981822DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1985.tb00168.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVACEK, D.C.10aFeeding and oviposition preferences of Drosophila buzzatii for microbial species isolated from its natural environment  ap. 175-187.  aIncludes references  aMature, mated female Drosophila buzzatii were given a choice of nine microbial communities actively growing on cactus homogenate in laboratory population cages. All communities contained identical naturally occurring bacteria, and comprised bacteria only and bacteria plus one of eight yeast species. Relative frequency of each yeast species ingested and number of eggs laid on each community were measured daily for three successive days. Flies generally preferred to feed and oviposit on those yeast species which are most abundant in rots of Opuntia cactus, and Pichia caclophila was the most preferred yeast. Light intensity, position of the yeast in the cage, and probably aggregation behaviour affected preference. Direct observation of adults was found to be inadequate for determining feeding preference. The ability of the flies to discriminate between yeasts developed with time. By day three, there was a significant correlation (r= 0.96) between the yeasts preferred for feeding and those preferred for oviposition. Feeding preference may be determined in part by oviposition preference; and the latter appears to be the most fruitful avenue for future research into habitat selection by D. buzzatii. 3aDrosophila 3aOpuntia 3aPichia 3abacteria 3acacti and succulents 3acages 3afeeding preferences 3alight intensity 3amicrobial communities 3aoviposition 3ayeasts1 aEAST, P.D.1 aBARKER, J.S.F.1 aSOLIMAN, M.H.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1985 Feb., v. 24, no. 2 p.175-187dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw4642wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1985.tb00168.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03946naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024005700111040001800168100002000186245008800206300001600294520233100310650002502641650002102666650001202687650006902699650003102768650002902799650003202828650001102860650007902871650002202950650007102972650000903043650002603052650004403078700002003122700002103142700001403163700002203177773010403199852000903303856010703312930003303419945001303452946001103465655001203476IND2324512820221118040314.0011217e200108  gau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232451282DNAL7 a115475452pmid7 a10.1562/0031-8655(2001)074<0126:CPIBHI>2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamuhabwa, A.R.10aCellular photodestruction induced by hypericin in AY-27 rat bladder carcinoma cells  ap. 126-132.  aIn a recent clinical study we showed that hypericin accumulates selectively in urothelial lesions following intravesical administration of the compound to patients. In the present study the efficacy of hypericin as a photochemotherapeutic tool against urinary bladder carcinoma was investigated using the AY-27 cells (chemically induced rat bladder carcinoma cells). The uptake of hypericin by the cells increased by prolonging the incubation time and increasing the extracellular hypericin concentration. Photodynamic treatment of the cells incubated with 0.8 and 1.6 micromolar hypericin concentrations resulted in remarkable cytotoxic effects the extent of which depended on the fluence rates. Photoactivation of 1.6 micromolar hypericin by 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mW/cm2 for 15 min resulted in 3, 30 and 95% of the antiproliferative effect, respectively. Increasing the photoactivating light dose from 0.45 to 3.6 J/cm2 resulted in a five-fold increase in hypericin photodynamic activity. Irrespective of the fluence rates and irradiation times incubation of the cells with 10 micromolar hypericin induced rapid and extensive cell death in all conditions. The type of cell death (apoptosis or necrosis) induced by photoactivated hypericin depended largely on the hypericin concentration and the postirradiation time. At lower hypericin concentrations and shorter postirradiation times apoptosis was the prominent mode of cell death; increasing the hypericin concentration and/or prolonging the postirradiation time resulted in increased necrotic cell death. Cell pretreatment with the singlet oxygen quencher histidine, but not with the free-radical quenchers, significantly protected the cells from photoactivated hypericin-induced apoptosis, at least when a relatively low concentration (1.25 micromolar) was used. This result suggests the involvement of a Type-II photosensitization process. However, cells treated with higher hypericin concentrations (2.5-5 micromolar) were inadequately protected by histidine. Since hypericin is thus shown to be a potent and efficient photosensitizer, and since the conditions used were the same as when hypericin is used clinically to locate early-stage urothelial carcinoma lesions, hypericin may well become very important for the photodynamic treatment of superficial bladder carcinoma. 3aHypericum perforatum 3amedicinal plants 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aCell Deathxdrug effects 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aPerylenexadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivativesxtherapeutic use. 2aPhotochemotherapy 2aPhotosensitizing Agentsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aRats 2aTumor Cells, Cultured 2aUrinary Bladder Neoplasmsxdrug therapy1 aAgostinis, P.M.1 aD'Hallewin, M.A.1 aBaert, L.1 aWitte, P.A.M. de.0 tPhotochemistry and photobiology.g2001 Aug., v. 74, no. 2 p.126-132wJournal:19520x0031-86557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1562/0031-8655(2001)074<0126:CPIBHI>2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02521naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024005700111040001800168100001400186245005200200300001600252520109000268650002501358650002101383650001201404650004001416650005201456650001301508650001101521650000901532650000901541650002401550650004201574650005101616650002201667650002601689700001501715700001401730700001601744700001401760773010401774852000901878856010701887930003301994945001302027946001102040655001202051IND2324512720221118040241.0011217e200108  gau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232451272DNAL7 a115475442pmid7 a10.1562/0031-8655(2001)074<0120:ACAOHI>2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlank, M.10aAnti-cancer activities of hypericin in the dark  ap. 120-125.  aThe potent photodynamic properties of hypericin (HY) elicit a range of light-dependent virucidal and tumoricidal activities. Yet, a relatively low reduction/oxidation potential endows HY with electron accepting and donating properties enabling it to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent. HY can thus compete as an electron acceptor from bioenergized reduction/oxidation reactions generating its excitation energy for biological activities from physiological reduction/oxidation reactions in the absence of light. Our studies show that HY can inhibit the growth of highly metastatic murine breast adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma tumors in culture. Furthermore, we show that HY can interfere with the growth of these tumors in mice reducing tumor size and prolonging animal survival in complete absence of light. While there is no evidence that HY induces apoptosis in these cells in the dark, 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA was significantly reduced indicating effects that are apparently cytostatic in nature compared to the cytocidal effects of HY with light. 3aHypericum perforatum 3amedicinal plants 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aCell Survivalxdrug effectsxradiation effects. 2aDarkness 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aNeoplasms, Experimentalxdrug therapy 2aPerylenexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aPhotochemotherapy 2aTumor Cells, Cultured1 aMandel, M.1 aHazan, S.1 aKeisari, Y.1 aLavie, G.0 tPhotochemistry and photobiology.g2001 Aug., v. 74, no. 2 p.120-125wJournal:19520x0031-86557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1562/0031-8655(2001)074<0120:ACAOHI>2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle01735naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002400154245007200178300001300250500002400263500001500287520077200302650001801074650001701092650001101109650001601120650001801136653001301154700002301167773012801190852000901318856009401327655001201421IND4459818420221118040311.0110708s1985    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445981842DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1985.tb00156.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRothschild, Miriam.10aCarotenoids and bile pigments in Danaid and swallowtail butterflies  ap. 1-14.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe carotenoids found in adult kite swallowtails (Graphium spp.) and the Danaid glassy tigers (Ideopsis, Tirumala and Parantica), butterflies with exposed blue/green pigmented wing membranes (which contain pterobilins) and a modified scale vestiture, were compared with those of related species of Papilios and Danaids with concealed wing membranes an an entire scale vestiture.

The first two remain allopatric, Quistrachia having a more eastern range, while Westraltrachia overlaps both ranges. In the zone of sympatry, with changes proceeding from east to west, Westraltrachia diverges in feeding, and there is massive, gradual convergence in shell size, shape and colour between Amplirhagada and Westraltrachia. Shells of both genera depart markedly from their distinctive allopatric appearances to form a new morphotype in the north-west Napier Ranges. The species there are so similar in appearance that the two genera cannot be identified at a distance of 0.5 m. Thirteen species-level taxa are involved in these changes, four allopatric Amplirhagada, seven allopatric Westraltrachia, Quistrachia monogramma and Rhagada basedowana. Westraltrachia species, the only large land snails in their main area of distribution (south-east Kimberlcy), are pre-adapted to graze on an occasionally present food resource, algal-fungal blooms on limestone seepage faces. They entered the Oscar and Napier Ranges, where this food resource is more abundant, and large land snails that are generalized feeders, Amplirhagada or Quistrachia, were already present and abundant. Hence feeding divergence occurred. Such specialization by Westraltrachia to minimize competition is readily understandable. The selective pressures that led to the striking convergence in shell features in north-west Napier taxa are unknown. 3aMonogramma 3acolor 3afoods 3agrazing 3alimestone 3aseepage 3asnails 3asympatry 3aWestern Australia0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1985 Feb., v. 24, no. 2 p.143-163dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw4642x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1985.tb00166.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03238naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001500159245012100174300001600295520179000311650001202101650003802113650006102151650002402212650001102236650002002247650001102267650001402278650001102292650000902303650001402312650007002326650002102396650003902417651001402456700001702470700001802487700001802505700001602523773006802539852000902607856008102616930003302697945001302730946001302743655001202756IND2060348120221118040255.0971030e199706  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206034812DNAL7 a91647742pmid7 a10.1542/peds.99.6.8082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuel, M.T.10aImpact of zinc supplementation on morbidity from diarrhea and respiratory infections among rural Guatemalan children  ap. 808-813.  aObjective. A community-based, randomized, double-blind intervention trial was conducted to measure the impact of zinc supplementation on young Guatemalan children's morbidity from diarrhea and respiratory infections. Methods. Children aged 6 to 9 months were randomly assigned to receive 4 mL of a beverage containing 10 mg of zinc (as zinc sulfate) daily (7 d/wk) for 7 months (n = 45) or a placebo (n = 44). Morbidity data were collected daily. Diagnoses of diarrhea, fever, and anorexia were based on mothers' definitions. Respiratory infections were defined as the presence of at least two of the following symptoms: runny nose, cough, wheezing, difficulty breathing, or fever. Results. High rates of diarrhea and respiratory infections were reported. Children from the placebo group had a 20% episodic prevalence of diarrhea, with 8 episodes/100 d, and a 7% episodic prevalence of respiratory infections, with 3 episodes/100 d. The median incidence of diarrhea among children who received zinc supplementation was reduced by 22% (Wilcoxon rank test), with larger reductions among boys and among children with weight-for-length at baseline lower than the median of the sample (39% reductions in both subgroups). Zinc supplementation also produced a 67% reduction in the percentage of children who had one or more episodes of persistent diarrhea (chi squares test). No significant effects were found on the episodic prevalence of diarrhea, the number of days per episode, or the episodic prevalence or incidence of respiratory infections. Conclusions. The large impact of zinc supplementation on diarrhea incidence suggests that young, rural Guatemalan children may be zinc deficient and that zinc supplementation may be an effective intervention to improve their health and growth. 3ainfants 2aDeficiency Diseasesxepidemiology 2aDiarrhea, Infantilexepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aFood, Fortified 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMorbidity 2aRespiratory Tract Infectionsxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aRural Population 2aZincxdeficiencyxtherapeutic use. 0aGuatemala1 aRivera, J.A.1 aSantizo, M.C.1 aLonnerdal, B.1 aBrown, K.H.0 tPediatrics.g1997 June, v. 99, no. 6 p.808-813x0031-40057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.99.6.8083Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdIH1  aOther US 7aarticle04620naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001900159245008700178300001600265520325000281650002803531650006203559650003003621650001503651650001103666650001103677650001103688650003003699650000903729650002703738650002403765650002203789650001703811651001103828651001103839700001603850700001703866700001903883700001903902773006803921852000903989856008103998930003304079945001304112946001304125655001204138IND2057961220221118040341.0970624e199703  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205796122DNAL7 a90413032pmid7 a10.1542/peds.99.3.4452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVictoria, C.G.10aPacifier use and short breastfeeding duration: cause, consequence, or coincidence?  ap. 445-453.  aObjectives. Pacifiers are related to a shorter duration of breastfeeding. However, it is unclear whether this association is causal, because confounding, reverse causality, and self-selection of mothers may play a role. These issues were investigated through a combination of epidemiologic and ethnographic research in southern Brazil. Methodology. A population-based cohort of 650 mothers and infants were visited shortly after delivery and at 1, 3, and 6 months. The rate of complete follow-up was 96.8%. A subsample of 80 mothers and infants was selected for the ethnographic study, which included indepth interviews and participant observations in the age range of 2 to 6 months with a mean of 4.5 visits. Results. The epidemiologic study showed that pacifier use was common with 85% of users at 1 month. However, this was a dynamic process, with many infants starting or abandoning the pacifiers in any age range. Children who stopped breastfeeding in a given period were likely to take up the pacifier during that period. Further analyses excluded all infants not breastfed at 1 month of age and those who reportedly had breastfeeding problems, leaving 450 infants with full data. Intense pacifier users at 1 month (children who used the pacifiers during most of the day and at least until falling asleep) were four times more likely to stop breastfeeding by 6 months of age than nonusers. Users also had fewer daily breastfeedings than nonusers. After adjustment for several confounding variables, logistic regression showed that pacifier use was still associated with an odds ratio of 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.40 to 4.01) for stopping breastfeeding. The ethnographic analysis showed that pacifier use was widely regarded as a positive behavior and that mothers often strongly stimulated the infants to accept it. Although few mothers openly admitted that pacifiers might shorten breastfeeding, a considerable group effectively used pacifiers to get their infants off the breast or to increase the interval between feedings. The latter also had rigid breastfeeding styles that increased maternal-infant distance, had important concerns about objective aspects of infant growth and development, and were highly sensitive to infant crying. These behaviors were linked to intense comparison between themselves and other mothers and to a lack of self-confidence. Nonwhite mothers, those who delivered vaginally, and mothers of infant girls seemed to be more confident and less affected by these difficulties. The epidemiologic analysis confirmed that pacifier use was more closely associated with breastfeeding duration among nonwhite mothers and for normally delivered infants. Conclusions. Pacifiers may be an effective weaning mechanism used by mothers who have explicit or implicit difficulties in breastfeeding, but they are much less likely to affect infants whose mothers are confident about nursing. Breastfeeding promotion campaigns aimed specifically at reducing pacifier use will fail unless they also help women face the challenges of nursing and address their anxieties. The combination of epidemiologic and ethnographic methods was essential for understanding the complex relations between pacifier use and breastfeeding. 3aepidemiological studies 2aBottle Feedingxstatistics & numerical dataxutilization. 2aBreast Feedingxethnology 2aEthnicity. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Carexutilization. 2aMale 2aMother-Child Relations 2aProspective Studies 2aRandom Allocation 2aTime Factors 3aBrazil 0aBrazil1 aBehague, P.1 aBarros, F.C.1 aOlinto, M.R.A.1 aWeiderpass, E.0 tPediatrics.g1997 Mar., v. 99, no. 3 p.445-453x0031-40057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.99.3.4453Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdIH1  aOther US 7aarticle01964naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100004100145245006500186300001600251500001900267500002400286520103900310650001301349650001301362650001301375650001001388650002201398650001501420650001701435650001601452651001401468773008701482852000901569856004801578655001201626IND4435685620221118040600.0100416e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443568562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-009-0117-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez Carretero, Eduardo Enrique14aThe synanthropic flora in the Mendoza (Argentina) urban area  ap. 237-242.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncludes references  aThe synanthropic flora in the Mendoza urban area was studied in terms of its three most relevant sub-environments: house and school gardens, parks and borders of narrow ditches used to irrigate the whole city. The current synanthropic flora comprises 487 species, 8 native and 479 alien species. Neophytes include 282 genera and 104 families, with the dominant families being Fabaceae, comprising 41 species, Myrthaceae (38 spp), Rosaceae and Oleaceae (24 spp), all of which together represent 26% of the total richness recorded. Ephemerophytes, non-naturalized plants, represent 25.4% of the urban flora. Xenoergasiophytes and ergasiophytes are dominant in gardens and parks, whereas xenophytes grow in irrigation ditches across the city. Considering life forms, nanophaerophytes are prevalent in all three sub-environments, but succulents and therophytes are absent from ditches. The number of non-native plant species is increasing in the urban area of Mendoza, especially in the suburbs, and many of them at times become invasive. 3aFabaceae 3aOleaceae 3aRosaceae 3aflora 3aintroduced plants 3airrigation 3asynanthropes 3aurban areas 3aArgentina0 tUrban ecosystems.g2010 June, v. 13, no. 2 p.237-242dSpringer USx1083-81557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-009-0117-8 7aarticle02614naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245013800179300001600317520148700333650000801820650002201828650002001850650001001870650000901880650001701889650001401906650002501920650001201945650001301957700002301970700002601993773018102019856005502200852000902255655001202264IND60617296820221118040655.0181025s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061729682DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00462.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTucker, Priscilla K.10aPhylogenetic relationships in the subgenus Mus (genus Mus, family Muridae, subfamily Murinae): examining gene trees and species trees  ap. 653-662.  aOver eight kilobases (kb) of sequence from eight genes including two mitochondrial loci, Cyt b and 12S, and six nuclear loci, B2m, Zp3, Tcp1, Sry, Smcx and Smcy, were used to investigate phylogenetic relationships among 11 taxa representing eight species within the rodent genus Mus. Particular attention was given to discerning relationships among species within the subgenus Mus including members of a Palearctic clade (M. musculus, M. spicilegus, M. macedonicus and M. spretus) and members of an Asian clade (M. caroli, M. cookii and M. cervicolor), as previous studies using different datasets have produced different topologies for taxa within these two groups. While parsimony analyses of the combined eight-gene dataset yielded a single, fully resolved tree, support values were lower for nodes resolving relationships within the Palearctic and Asian clades than they were elsewhere in the tree. In addition, a maximum likelihood analysis of the same eight-gene dataset yielded different topologies for both the Palearctic and the Asian clades. Both observations are indicative of clade instability. The nature of this instability was explored through a comparison with our previous study in which we included the two mitochondrial loci and only four of the six nuclear genes, and through an analysis of partitioned data, specifically mitochondrial vs. nuclear genes. This study underscores the importance of considering among-site rate variation in phylogeny reconstruction. 3aMus 3aPalearctic region 3adata collection 3agenes 3aloci 3amitochondria 3aphylogeny 3aprobability analysis 3arodents 3atopology1 aSandstedt, Sara A.1 aLundrigan, Barbara L.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2005 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.653-662dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00462.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002700154245006100181300001600242520140200258650001701660650002101677650001501698650001401713650001001727650001401737650001201751650001901763650001901782650001001801650000901811650001401820650001201834650002001846650001101866651001901877700002401896700001901920700002201939773018101961856005502142852000902197655001202206IND60617296920221118040542.0181025s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061729692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00463.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVyskočilová, Martina10aDoes geography matter in hybrid sterility in house mice?  ap. 663-674.  aHybrid sterility can prevent gene flow between diverging subpopulations and hence might contribute to speciation. The hybrid sterility 1(Hst1) gene was originally described in male progeny obtained from a cross between laboratory inbred mouse strains C57BL/10 and C3H, and wild Mus musculus musculus, sampled at localities in Prague, Czech Republic. This study asked whether the presence of sterility associated with the Hst1 gene is limited to one local population or is extended over geographically distant regions. We studied the progeny derived from a wild population of M. m. musculus sampled in Studenec, Czech Republic, 160 km south-east from Prague, crossed reciprocally to C57BL/10 mice. Spermatogenesis was examined in 251 hybrid males; among them 109 males (43.4%) were sterile and 142 (56.6%) were fertile. Sterile males had significantly lower testis mass and lower epididymis mass compared with fertile males. The size of the reproductive organs was dependent on cross reciprocity within the classes of sterile and fertile males. Although our phenotype data resemble those presented in the original description of Hst1, molecular analysis revealed incomplete segregation of sterility and fertility in male progeny and markers from the Hst1 region in some families. Therefore, there are probably additional genes affecting hybrid sterility that are polymorphic in wild M. m. musculus. 3aMus musculus 3aanimal fertility 3aepididymis 3agene flow 3agenes 3ageography 3ahybrids 3amale fertility 3amale sterility 3amales 3amice 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3aspermatogenesis 3atestes 3aCzech Republic1 aTrachtulec, Zdeněk1 aForejt, Jiří1 aPiálek, Jaroslav0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2005 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.663-674dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00463.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245011400178300001600292520095900308650001701267650003701284650002301321650001001344650002001354650001201374650001901386650001001405650001801415650000901433650002201442650003701464650001301501650005201514650001801566650002001584650001101604700001901615700002001634700002301654700002101677700002001698773018101718856005501899852000901954655001201963IND60617296620221118040516.0181025s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061729662DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00460.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrachtulec, Zdenžk10aPositional cloning of the Hybrid sterility 1 gene: fine genetic mapping and evaluation of two candidate genes  ap. 637-641.  aThe Hybrid sterility 1 (Hst1) gene affects fertility of male hybrids between certain laboratory strains (such as C57BL/10) and some Mus musculus musculus mice by causing a breakdown of spermatogenesis at the stage of primary spermatocytes. In the process of positional cloning of the Hst1 gene, we generated a contig of bacterial artificial chromosomes and subsequently a low coverage sequence of the candidate region of the 129S1/SvImJ strain. Development of new genetic markers allowed us to narrow the Hst1 region from 580 to 360 kb. The products of two genes from this region, TATA-binding protein (Tbp) and proteasome subunit beta 1 (Psmb1), accumulate during spermatogenesis. These proteins have been described previously as having conserved C-terminal sequences and species-specific N-termini. We evaluated the candidacy of these genes for Hst1 by allelic sequencing and by real-time semiquantitative reverse-transcription PCR of testicular mRNAs. 3aMus musculus 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahybrids 3amale fertility 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amolecular cloning 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aproteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspermatocytes 3aspermatogenesis 3atestes1 aMihola, Ondrej1 aVlcek, Cestmír1 aHimmelbauer, Heinz1 aPacčes, Václav1 aForejt, Jirří0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2005 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.637-641dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00460.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245009300178300001600271520141900287650001001706650001701716650001101733650001301744650002001757650001701777650001601794650001401810650001601824650000901840650002301849650000901872650001101881650001101892650001201903651001401915651001101929700002001940700001901960700001601979700001901995700002202014773018102036856005502217852000902272655001202281IND60617296320221118040454.0181025s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061729632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00458.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingleton, Grant R.10aOne hundred years of eruptions of house mice in Australia – a natural biological curio  ap. 617-627.  aThe house mouse has adapted well to the cereal crops of south-eastern Australia where populations show aperiodic  outbreaks over large areas. A 20-year population study has provided a wealth of information on breeding ecology,  demographic changes, spatial behaviour and epidemiology. The breeding season can be as short as 4.5 months and  as long as 10 months with litter size changing seasonally from high values in spring to low values in autumn. There  are marked changes in litter size between years. Rates of increase of populations also vary between years. The rate  of change of populations during the breeding season is independent of density effects, but if the population density  is high at the commencement of breeding then the litter size is depressed throughout that breeding season. There are  density-dependent effects on survival during the non-breeding season. Rates of increase of populations over spring  and summer are highly correlated with accumulated rainfall from the previous winter–spring (April–October). Stud-  ies of helminths and viruses indicate that Australian mice carry only a subset of the helminths found in Europe.  There have been no published studies on murine viruses in Europe. Perhaps a reduced diversity of diseases partially  accounts for the ability of mice to increase rapidly to extreme population densities in cereal-growing areas of south-  eastern Australia. 3aCurio 3aMus musculus 3aautumn 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3aepidemiology 3agrain crops 3ahelminths 3alitter size 3amice 3apopulation density 3arain 3aspring 3asummer 3aviruses 3aAustralia 3aEurope1 aBrown, Peter R.1 aPech, Roger P.1 aJacob, Jens1 aMutze, Greg J.1 aKrebs, Charles J.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2005 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.617-627dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00458.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002100154245011400175300001600289500002400305520158500329650001001914650002601924650001501950650001401965650002001979650001401999773012902013852000902142856009402151655001202245IND4460033020221118040601.0110715s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446003302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1991.tb00557.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aROLSTAD, JØRUND10aConsequences of forest fragmentation for the dynamics of bird populations: conceptual issues and the evidence  ap. 149-163.  aIncludes references  aThis paper reviews the consequences of forest fragmentation for the dynamics of bird populations. Owing to high mobility and large home ranges, birds usually perceive fragmented forests in a finegrained manner, i.e. embrace several forest fragments in functional home ranges. On a regional scale, however, coarse-grained clusters of fine-grained fragments (hierarchical fragmentation may sub-divide bird populations into isolated demes, which enter a domain of metapopulation dynamics. Distinctions are made between pure distance-area or population-level effects and more indirect community-level effects due to changes in landscape composition. Distance-area effects, such as insularization and decreasing fragment size, directly prevent dispersal and reduce population size. Landscape effects, such as reduced fragment-matrix and interior-edge ratios, increase the pressure from surrounding predators, competitors, parasites and disease. In short, forest fragmentation can be viewed as a two-step process. Initially, fine-grained fragmentation triggers distance-area and landscape effects on a local scale, which in turn, results in a range retraction of a population to non-fragmented or less fragmented parts of a region. At a certain point, non-fragmented areas become so widely spaced out that regional distance-area effects come into operation, giving rise to metapopulation dynamics. Although few bird metapopulations have yet been documented, metapopulation dynamics probably is a common characteristic of bird populations confined to ‘hierarchical' fragmented forests. 3abirds 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahome range 3aparasites 3apopulation size 3apredators0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1991 , v. 42, no. 1/2 p.149-163dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw4312x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1991.tb00557.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01903naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245010100172300001600273500002400289520099200313650000901305650001501314650001001329650001601339650001501355650001101370773012901381852000901510856009401519655001201613IND4460032920221118040530.0110715s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446003292DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1991.tb00556.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSJÖGREN, PER10aExtinction and isolation gradients in metapopulations: the case of the pool frog (Rana lessonae)  ap. 135-147.  aIncludes references  aLoral extinction along the intrinsic isolation gradient within metapopulations is reviewed with particular reference to a study of the pool frog (Rana lessonaé) on the northern periphery of its geographical range. As in the pool frog, many other different tax a show significantly increased extinction probabilities with increased interpopulation distance. Present data imply that the relative impact of demographic and genetic factors in such stochastic extinctions depends on the genetic history of the metapopulation; data also imply that populations fluctuate more greatly in size than predicted from demographic models which have been commonly referred to. By mitigating such fluctuations and inbreeding, and compensating for emigration, immigration undoubtedly ‘rescues' local populations from extinction. In this way, and not just in terms of recolonization, connectivity is concluded to be a key to metapopulation persistence. Implications for conservation are also presented. 3aRana 3aextinction 3afrogs 3aimmigration 3ainbreeding 3amodels0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1991 , v. 42, no. 1/2 p.135-147dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw4312x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1991.tb00556.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01767naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245007700160300001600237500001900253500002400272520087800296650001901174650001101193650001301204650001101217650002301228650001201251650002101263773011201284852000901396856004801405655001201453IND4406562020221118040631.0080606e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440656202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-008-9159-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNew, T.

Endemism and speciation lessons from island insects have contributed significantly to wider understanding of aspects of insect diversification. The twin complexes of threats to island insects involve (1) internal processes, essentially habitat changes by human activity, and their consequences and (2) externally-imposed effects from alien invasive species, both of these operating in environments that may lack much of the buffer capability present in larger continental areas or in richer communities. Many island insects now persist only in small inaccessible remnant habitats, and protecting these is a key theme in planning insect conservation on islands. The possible effects of climate change may be severe, particularly on 'low islands' such as many coral cays. 3aclimate change 3acorals 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3ainsects 3ainvasive species0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2008 July, v. 12, no. 3-4 p.197-204dSpringer Netherlandsx1366-638X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-008-9159-0 7aarticle01482naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002500154245011400179300001400293500002400307520034300331650000800674650002600682650001600708650002600724650001000750651001300760651001100773651001100784700002100795700002100816700002900837700002500866773012600891852000901017856009401026655001201120IND4460032220221118040533.0110715s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446003222DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1990.tb00820.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGERASIMOV, SVETOSLAV10aMorphometric stepwise discriminant analysis of the five genetically determined European taxa of the genus Mus  ap. 47-64.  aIncludes references  aUnivariate and multivariate analyses have been performed on skull and mandible measurements for the five biochemically defined groups of the genus Mus in Europe.

Chain-length distribution analysis of the glucans of cyanidian algae demonstrated that while the glucans of Cyanidium caldarium and Galdieria sulphuraria are of the glycogen type, those of C. merolae are of the semiamylopectin type, as in other lineages of the Rhodophyta. Gel permeation chromatography, however, showed that the glucans of C. merolae do not include amylose, being different from those of other Bangiophycidae species. Identification by MALDI-TOF-MS and enzyme assaying of glucan granule-bound proteins indicated that phosphorylase, but not starch synthase, is included. Thus, C. merolae has an unusual glucan and bound-protein composition for the Bangiophycidae, appearing to be a member of the Florideophycidae. The finding that the alga does not contain amylose or the related enzyme, granule-bound starch synthase, is, however, consistent with previously reported results of molecular phylogenetic analysis of starch synthases. Our results support an evolutionary scenario defined by the loss of starch and reversion to glycogen synthesis during the evolution of cyanidian algae, and suggest the possibility that a C. merolae-like primitive rhodophyte might have evolved into the Florideophycidae. 3aCyanidium caldarium 3aNDP-glucose-starch glucosyltransferase 3aPorphyridiales 3aalgae 3aamylose 3acell physiology 3agel chromatography 3aglycogen 3aphosphorylase 3aphylogeny 3astarch synthase1 aIzumo, Asako1 aFujiwara, Shoko1 aTadokoro, Yukie1 aShimonaga, Takahiro1 aKonishi, Mai1 aBarakan, Mayumi Yoshida.1 aFujita, Naoko1 aNakamura, Yasunori1 aYoshida, Masaki1 aKuroiwa, Tsuneyoshi1 aTsuzuki, Mikio0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2010 May, v. 51, no. 5 p.682-693dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcq0463Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02743naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245012800171300001600299500001900315500002400334520171300358650002702071650001102098650001502109650001302124650001802137650002202155650002002177650001502197651001902212700001802231773008702249852000902336856004802345655001202393IND4432779520221118040132.0100213e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443277952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-009-0107-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTzoulas, Konstantinos10aMaking biodiversity measures accessible to non-specialists: an innovative method for rapid assessment of urban biodiversity  ap. 113-127.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncludes references  aUrban biodiversity studies provide important inputs to studying the interactions between human societies and ecological systems. However, existing urban biodiversity methods are time intensive and/or too complex for the purposes of rapid biodiversity assessment of large urban sites. In this paper the authors present a biodiversity assessment method that is innovative in its approach, is reliable, and from which the data generated can be presented in an understandable way to non-ecologists. This method is based on measuring the land cover of different vegetation structures and the diversity of vascular plants, and then combining these into an overall biodiversity score. The land cover of vegetation structures was recorded by using a checklist in combination with Tandy's Isovist Technique and the Domin cover scale. Vascular plant diversity was recorded at genus level by walking along defined transects within circular sampling areas of sixty five meter radius and using a checklist. A scoring procedure assigns an overall biodiversity score to different combinations of land cover of vegetation structures and vascular plant diversity. This method was tested in three urban locations in the United Kingdom which differed according to size, design and land use. Descriptive statistics of the resulting biodiversity scores differentiated between the biodiversity distribution within each one of the three locations, as well as across them. The main strength of this rapid biodiversity assessment method is its simplicity. Furthermore, by producing accurate results this biodiversity assessment method can be most useful in rapidly identifying areas where more detailed ecological surveys are needed. 3adescriptive statistics 3ahumans 3aland cover 3aland use 3arapid methods 3aspecies diversity 3avascular plants 3avegetation 3aUnited Kingdom1 aJames, Philip0 tUrban ecosystems.g2010 Mar., v. 13, no. 1 p.113-127dSpringer USx1083-81557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-009-0107-x 7aarticle03116naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002100144245024100165300001800406500001500424520162200439650001702061650000802078650002002086650002502106650002602131650002002157650001402177650001502191650001702206650001602223650001502239650001302254650001202267650002402279650001502303653002002318653002102338700002802359700002302387700001602410700002302426773008102449852000902530930003302539945002502572946001302597655001202610IND4371292920141222000000.0050613e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437129292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

[Erratum: 2005 Aug., v. 135, no. 8, p. 2010.]  ap. 1393-1399.  a2019-12-05  aA number of nutrients are known to be effective in preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD). We investigated the possible effects of a daily intake of low amounts of these nutrients on risk factors and clinical parameters in patients with peripheral vascular disease and intermittent claudication (PVD-IC). Male PVD-IC patients (n = 60) were randomly allocated into 2 groups. The supplement (S) group consumed 500 mL/d of a fortified dairy product containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), oleic acid, folic acid, and vitamins A, B-6, D, and E. The control (C) group consumed 500 mL/d of semiskimmed milk with added vitamins A and D. The patients received lifestyle and dietary recommendations, and they were instructed to consume the products in addition to their regular diet. Blood extractions and clinical explorations were performed after 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo. Plasma concentrations of EPA, DHA, oleic acid, folic acid, and vitamins B-6 and E increased after treatment with supplements (P < 0.05). Plasma total cholesterol and ApoB concentrations decreased in the S group, and total homocysteine decreased in those patients with high initial concentrations. Walking distance before the onset of claudication increased in the S group (P < 0.001), and ankle-brachial pressure index values increased (P < 0.05). The inclusion in the everyday diet of certain nutrients known to promote cardiovascular health improved clinical outcomes while reducing a variety of risk factors in men with PVD-IC, providing new evidence of the potential role of nutrition in the reduction of PVD-IC symptoms. 3ablood lipids 3amen 3aatherosclerosis 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aapolipoproteins 3avitamin E 3apyridoxine 3arisk factors 3acholesterol 3afolic acid 3apatients 3awalking 3adietary supplements 3aoleic acid 0ablood chemistry 0awalking distance1 aLópez-Huertas, Eduardo1 aSalmerón, Luis M.1 aBaró, Luis1 aRos, E.q(Eduardo)0 tJournal of nutrition.g2005 June, v. 135, no. 6 p.1393-1399x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20051214b20060102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/01  aOther US 7aarticle03796naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002400163245016500187300001800352520162200370650000901992650001802001650001402019650002002033650002502053650001502078650001002093650002002103650001202123650002302135650002102158650001402179650001002193650002902203650002002232650003002252650001802282650003102300650001202331650003302343650002002376650002902396650003802425650001102463650002902474650004502503650003502548650002502583650002502608650001402633650003402647650003802681650003102719650000902750650001702759650004002776700002202816700002102838700002002859700002202879773008102901852000902982930003302991945002503024946001303049655001203062IND4371292720221118040405.0050613e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437129272DNAL7 a159304412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLillycrop, Karen A.10aDietary Protein Restriction of Pregnant Rats Induces and Folic Acid Supplementation Prevents Epigenetic Modification of Hepatic Gene Expression in the Offspring  ap. 1382-1386.  aEnvironmental constraints during early life result in phenotypic changes that can be associated with increased disease risk in later life. This suggests persistent alteration of gene transcription. DNA methylation, which is largely established in utero, provides a causal mechanism by which unbalanced prenatal nutrition results in such altered gene expression. We investigated the effect of unbalanced maternal nutrition on the methylation status and expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) genes in rat offspring after weaning. Dams were fed a control protein (C; 180 g/kg protein plus 1 mg/kg folic acid), restricted protein (R; 90 g/kg casein plus 1 mg/kg folic acid), or restricted protein plus 5 mg/kg folic acid (RF) diet throughout pregnancy. Pups were killed 6 d after weaning (n = 10 per group). Gene methylation was determined by methylation-sensitive PCR and mRNA expression by semiquantitative RT-PCR. PPAR[alpha] gene methylation was 20.6% lower (P < 0.001) and expression 10.5-fold higher in R compared with C pups. GR gene methylation was 22.8% lower (P < 0.05) and expression 200% higher (P < 0.01) in R pups than in C pups. The RF diet prevented these changes. PPAR[gamma] methylation status and expression did not differ among the groups. Acyl-CoA oxidase expression followed that of PPAR[alpha]. These results show that unbalanced prenatal nutrition induces persistent, gene-specific epigenetic changes that alter mRNA expression. Epigenetic regulation of gene transcription provides a strong candidate mechanism for fetal programming. 3arats 3aanimal models 3apregnancy 3adietary protein 3aprotein deficiencies 3afolic acid 3aliver 3agene expression 3aprogeny 3amaternal nutrition 3aperinatal period 3areceptors 3agenes 3atranscription (genetics) 3aDNA methylation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3amessenger RNA 2aAcyl-CoA Oxidasexgenetics 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxmetabolism 2aDNA Methylation 2aDiet, Protein-Restricted 2aEpigenesis, Geneticxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aLiverxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPPAR alphaxgenetics 2aPPAR gammaxgenetics 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animalxphysiology 2aPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aReceptors, Glucocorticoidxgenetics1 aPhillips, Emma S.1 aJackson, Alan A.1 aHanson, Mark A.1 aBurdge, Graham C.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2005 June, v. 135, no. 6 p.1382-1386x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20051214b20060102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/01  aOther US 7aarticle02129naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245008600188300001400274520053900288650001900827650002300846650001200869650002900881650004600910650004300956650000900999650003201008650005001040650000901090650001701099650003001116650004001146650003801186653001601224653001101240653003201251700002101283700002301304700002101327700002501348773012401373852000901497856008501506930003301591946001101624655001201635IND4439436620221118040015.0100702e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443943662DNAL7 a211134502pmid7 a10.1007/s10517-010-0866-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalalyeyeva, T.

The importance of establishing a quality control protocol is related to the opportunity to identify problems on time comparing the microCT images acquired in different time points, and in this way to verify the performance of the device. The proposed quality control protocol was applied for a long-time monitoring period to verify the stability of the micro-tomographic system over time. The protocol proposed in this study was applied to the histomorphometric characterization of bone tissue, but it can be used on a wide range of in vitro microCT applications. Noise and uniformity tests, taken and adapted to micro-tomographic system by medical standard guidelines of quality control, were performed by the use of a water phantom. An accuracy test was designed and performed by the use of a morphometric calibrated phantom. All these tests were performed during a long-time monitoring period to control the stability of the system. Specific control charts and monitoring parameters for each test were used to represent the monthly measures collected during 20 months and an out of control condition was defined. The reference values (baseline), calculated to control the stability of micro-tomographic system over time, were calculated during acceptance/status test. During the period, no out of control conditions in noise, uniformity and accuracy tests were recorded. However, a changing condition was found in noise test, as showed by using statistical C (P < 0.01) and Kruskal-Wallis (P < 0.05) tests. In particular, a Wilcoxon rank sum test with Bonferroni correction (P < 0.0125) was applied in noise test to investigate which of the comparisons among first five acquisitions of year 2004 (group B.L.) and each group was significant (P < 0.0125). The noise showed a slight but significant increase over the years compared to baseline value; however, no out of control conditions were recorded. Nonetheless, a maintenance service to control the performance of mechanical components of microCT was required and performed. 0aPhantoms 0aquality control protocol 0aX-ray microtomography1 aTASSANI, S.1 aPERILLI, E.1 aBARUFFALDI, F.1 aVICECONTI, M.0 tJournal of microscopy.g2010 May, v. 238, no. 2 p.162-172dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-27207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03338.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100416b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03206naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245012600169300001600295500001500311520136300326650001601689650001201705650001001717650002601727650001301753650001601766650001401782650001201796650001001808650001401818650001601832650001401848650001501862650001201877650001601889650001501905650002301920650001601943650001301959650001201972651001701984651001202001651001502013653002202028653002102050653001402071653003502085700001602120700001502136700002002151700002302171700002002194700002602214700001602240700001602256773012702272852000902399856009202408930003302500946001102533655001202544IND4438653420221118040214.0100618e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443865342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0418.2009.01450.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorowiec, N.10aIncreasing distribution and damage to palms by the Neotropical whitefly, Aleurotrachelus atratus (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae)  ap. 498-510.  a2019-12-04  aIn recent years, the coconut whitefly, Aleurotrachelus atratus Hempel, has been recorded from various islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean. Field surveys in La Réunion, the Seychelles, the Comoros and glasshouses in Paris have allowed us to record this whitefly on 56 palm species, some of which are endemic and/or threatened species. Most of trees showed low infestation levels, except for the coconut palm that is its main host plant. Such a wide host range has facilitated the rapid geographical dissemination of this whitefly. A field study was conducted in 2006 in La Réunion, to gain a better understanding of the bioecology of A. atratus in a tropical insular ecosystem. The whitefly was found throughout the island, from sea level to 800-m altitude. Five parasitoid species (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) were found associated with the populations of this pest, with Eretmocerus cocois Delvare being the dominant one. A laboratory study showed that the pre-imaginal development of A. atratus is around 48 days at 25-27°C, which is relatively long compared to other whitefly species. With a sex ratio of one male per 1022 females collected in La Réunion, it appears that the whitefly reproduces by thelytoky. It represents a threat to ornamental and agricultural palms as well as to natural palm ecosystems in the absence of effective parasitoids. 3aparasitoids 3aislands 3atrees 3afield experimentation 3aaltitude 3agreenhouses 3asea level 3atropics 3amales 3asex ratio 3aEretmocerus 3athelytoky 3aecosystems 3afemales 3aAleyrodidae 3ahost range 3athreatened species 3ahost plants 3acoconuts 3asurveys 3aIndian Ocean 3aComoros 3aSeychelles 0adevelopment cycle 0ahost-plant range 0aHemiptera 0aSouthwest Indian Ocean islands1 aQuilici, S.1 aMartin, J.1 aIssimaila, M.A.1 aChadhouliati, A.C.1 aYoussoufa, M.A.1 aBeaudoin-Ollivier, L.1 aDelvare, G.1 aReynaud, B.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2010 July, v. 134, no. 6 p.498-510dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-20487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2009.01450.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02817naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245010500180300001600285520104400301650003501345650001201380650001101392650001101403650001701414650000901431650001101440650001101451650002701462650001401489650001001503650000901513650002201522650002101544650002901565650003301594650001901627650002801646650001101674650002301685650003001708650003101738650001901769651001001788651001001798653002701808653002301835653001701858700001701875700002001892700001901912773013401931852000902065856008502074930003302159946001102192655001202203IND4430998120221118040107.0100108e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443099812DNAL7 a192059122pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-0751-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Bing 10aEnhanced anthropogenic heavy metal dispersal from tidal disturbance in the Jiaozhou Bay, North China  ap. 349-358.  aHeavy metal contamination in surface sediments of the Jiaozhou Bay was investigated in this study. Sediment sample was collected from the Jiaozhou Bay and its rivers. Heavy metal concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The result shows that river sediment in the east coast of the Jiaozhou Bay was heavily polluted especially for the Cu, Pb, Cd, and Zn. A slightly increase of heavy metal concentration was observed at stations near the east coast in the Jiaozhou Bay; however, contaminated sediment from polluted river was constrained mostly near shore within 3-4 km. Downstream decrease of heavy metals in river mouth suggested dilution from strong tidal current. Rapid seaward decline in the east coast and alongshore band dispersal pattern of heavy metals in surface sediment indicated mixing and remobilizing enhanced by large tidal range that regulated dispersal of sediments and anthropogenic heavy metals in the Jiaozhou Bay area. 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3acoasts 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amixing 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3atides 3azinc 2aCadmiumxanalysis 2aCopperxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysis 2aLeadxanalysis 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aRivers 2aSeawaterxanalysis 2aSpectrophotometry, Atomic 2aWater Pollutants, Chemical 2aZincxanalysis 3aChina 0aChina 0aAnthropogenic activity 0aSediment dispersal 0aJiaozhou Bay1 aZhang, Jing 1 aZhang, Guirong 1 aZhou, Juzheng 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 Feb., v. 161, no. 1-4 p.349-358dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0751-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100108b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02897naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245008000172300001600252520188000268653001802148653002702166653003602193653002602229653002602255653002402281653002202305773011802327852000902445856008502454930003302539946001102572655001202583IND4436751820221118040207.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443675182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00422-010-0378-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFleischer, Andreas G. 10aSchema generation in recurrent neural nets for intercepting a moving target  ap. 451-473.  aThe grasping of a moving object requires the development of a motor strategy to anticipate the trajectory of the target and to compute an optimal course of interception. During the performance of perception-action cycles, a preprogrammed prototypical movement trajectory, a motor schema, may highly reduce the control load. Subjects were asked to hit a target that was moving along a circular path by means of a cursor. Randomized initial target positions and velocities were detected in the periphery of the eyes, resulting in a saccade toward the target. Even when the target disappeared, the eyes followed the target's anticipated course. The Gestalt of the trajectories was dependent on target velocity. The prediction capability of the motor schema was investigated by varying the visibility range of cursor and target. Motor schemata were determined to be of limited precision, and therefore visual feedback was continuously required to intercept the moving target. To intercept a target, the motor schema caused the hand to aim ahead and to adapt to the target trajectory. The control of cursor velocity determined the point of interception. From a modeling point of view, a neural network was developed that allowed the implementation of a motor schema interacting with feedback control in an iterative manner. The neural net of the Wilson type consists of an excitation-diffusion layer allowing the generation of a moving bubble. This activation bubble runs down an eye-centered motor schema and causes a planar arm model to move toward the target. A bubble provides local integration and straightening of the trajectory during repetitive moves. The schema adapts to task demands by learning and serves as forward controller. On the basis of these model considerations the principal problem of embedding motor schemata in generalized control strategies is discussed. 0aSchema theory 0aFeedforward controller 0aInterception of a moving target 0aEye-hand coordination 0aRecurrent neural nets 0aNeural field theory 0aPopulation coding0 tBiological cybernetics.g2010 June, v. 102, no. 6 p.451-473dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-12007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00422-010-0378-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01468naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245008900171300001600260520046100276650001300737650001500750650001100765651000900776653001000785653002000795653002000815700001900835700002200854773010700876852000900983856009200992930003301084946001301117655001201130IND4437271320221118040254.0100522e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443727132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7429.2010.00639.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBravo, Adriana10aPreference for Collpa Water by Frugivorous Bats (Artibeus): An Experimental Approach  ap. 276-280.  aSeveral species of stenodermatine bats congregate in large numbers at collpas in southeastern Peru to drink water.

BBP, which readily leaches from these products, is one of the most important environmental contaminants, and the increased awareness of its adverse effects on human health has led to a dramatic increase in research aimed at removing BBP from the environment via bioremediation. This review highlights recent progress in the degradation of BBP by pure and mixed bacterial cultures, fungi, and in sludge, sediment, and wastewater. Sonochemical degradation, a unique abiotic remediation technique, and photocatalytic degradation are also discussed. The degradation pathways for BBP are described, and future research directions are considered.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3abioremediation 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3afungi 3ahuman health 3aphotocatalysis 3aphthalates 3aplasticizers 3apollution 3asediments 3asludge 3atiles 3awastewater 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aEndocrine Systemxdrug effects 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediation 2aFungixmetabolism 2aHumans 2aPhthalic Acidsxchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 0aEndocrine disrupter 0aPhthalate 0aButyl benzyl phthalate 0aMonoesters 0aDegradation pathway1 aKarlovsky, Petr 0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 June, v. 87, no. 1 p.61-73dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2570-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04027naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245023800192300001600430520147700446650002501923650001501948650002601963650001201989650001002001650003702011650001502048650001002063650001202073650001402085650001102099650001102110650001702121650003002138650001202168650002402180650002402204650006202228650005902290650002502349650003802374650001302412650002402425650003202449650006602481650003502547650002802582650001302610650006802623650005202691650002302743650003402766650003602800653003702836653003402873653002302907700001902930700002002949700002502969700002402994700002003018773011003038852000903148856009203157930003303249946001103282655001203293IND4431614520221118040244.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443161452DNAL7 a199060432pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04066.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes, Francisca14aThe nucleotide sugar transporters AtUTr1 and AtUTr3 are required for the incorporation of UDP-glucose into the endoplasmic reticulum, are essential for pollen development and are needed for embryo sac progress in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 423-435.  aUridine 5′-diphosphate (UDP)-glucose is transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the Arabidopsis nucleotide sugar transporter AtUTr1 has been proposed to play a role in this process; however, different lines of evidence suggest that another transporter(s) may also be involved. Here we show that AtUTr3 is involved in the transport of UDP-glucose and is located at the ER but also at the Golgi. Insertional mutants in AtUTr3 showed no obvious phenotype. Biochemical analysis in both AtUTr1 and AtUTr3 mutants indicates that uptake of UDP-glucose into the ER is mostly driven by these two transporters. Interestingly, the expression of AtUTr3 is induced by stimuli that trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR), a phenomenon also observed for AtUTr1, suggesting that both AtUTr1 and AtUTr3 are involved in supplying UDP-glucose into the ER lumen when misfolded proteins are accumulated. Disruption of both AtUTr1 and AtUTr3 causes lethality. Genetic analysis showed that the atutr1 atutr3 combination was not transmitted by pollen and was poorly transmitted by the ovules. Cell biology analysis indicates that knocking out both genes leads to abnormalities in both male and female germ line development. These results show that the nucleotide sugar transporters AtUTr1 and AtUTr3 are required for the incorporation of UDP-glucose into the ER, are essential for pollen development and are needed for embryo sac progress in Arabidopsis thaliana. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aembryo sac 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afemales 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agerm cells 3amales 3amutants 3aphenotype 3apollen 3asugars 3atransporters 3aunfolded protein response 3auridine 3auridine diphosphate 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxchemistryxembryologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiological Transport 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxmetabolism 2aGenotype 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGolgi Apparatusxmetabolism 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aNucleotide Transport Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPollenxembryologyxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aUridine Diphosphatexmetabolism 0auridine 5′-diphosphate-glucose 0anucleotide sugar transporters 0agamete development1 aLeón, Gabriel1 aDonoso, Maribel1 aBrandizzí, Federica1 aWeber, Andreas P.M.1 aOrellana, Ariel0 tPlant journal.g2010 Feb., v. 61, no. 3 p.423-435dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04066.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100122b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03848naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002100193245015400214300001600368520164000384650002502024650001002049650004202059650004202101650007902143650001502222650002002237650004402257650001902301650002202320650007402342650002302416650003802439650001102477650008602488650001602574650006802590650004202658650007002700653001502770653002702785653005502812653003302867700002302900700001702923700002302940700002202963700002002985773010803005852000903113856009203122930003303214946001103247655001203258IND4431041120221118040211.0100111e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443104112DNAL7 a198249142pmid7 aPMC28144642pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03171.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMantegani, Paola10aPerturbation of the natural killer cell compartment during primary human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection primarily involving the CD56bright subset  ap. 220-233.  aWe investigated the distribution of natural killer (NK) cell subsets, their activating and inhibitory receptors, and their cytolytic potential, in primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected (PHI) individuals at baseline and during 1 year of follow-up with or without antiretroviral therapy, and compared the results with those obtained in treatment-naïve, chronically HIV-infected (CHI) individuals, and HIV-seronegative (HN) healthy individuals. The proportion of the CD56dim and CD56bright subsets decreased with disease progression, whereas that of the CD56⁻ CD16⁺ subset increased. In the CD56dim subset, the proportion of cells with natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) decreased with disease progression, and their cytolytic potential was reduced. Conversely, the CD56bright subset was characterized by a high proportion of NCR-positive, killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-positive NKG2A⁺ cells in both CHI and PHI individuals, which was associated with an increase in their cytolytic potential. During the 1 year of follow-up, the PHI individuals with high viraemia levels and low CD4⁺ T-cell counts who received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) had a similar proportion of NK subsets to CHI individuals, while patients with low viraemia levels and high CD4⁺ T-cell counts who remained untreated had values similar to those of the HN individuals. Our results indicate a marked perturbation of the NK cell compartment during HIV-1 infection that is multifaceted, starts early and is progressive, primarily involves the CD56bright subset, and is partially corrected by effective HAART. 3anatural killer cells 2aAdult 2aCD56 Antigenxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aAntiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active 2aCD4-Positive T-Lymphocytesxdrug effectsximmunologyxpathologyxvirology. 2aCell Count 2aCell Separation 2aCytotoxicity, Immunologicxdrug effects 2aFlow Cytometry 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHIV Infectionsxdrug therapyximmunologyxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aHIV Seronegativity 2aHIV-1ximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aHumans 2aKiller Cells, Naturalxdrug effectsximmunologyxmetabolismxpathologyxvirology. 2aMiddle Aged 2aNK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily Cxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, KIRxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Natural Cytotoxicity Triggeringxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aactivation 0acell surface molecules 0aflow cytometry/fluorescence-activated cell sorting 0ahuman immunodeficiency virus1 aTambussi, Giuseppe1 aGalli, Laura1 aDin, Chiara Tassan1 aLazzarin, Adriano1 aFortis, Claudio0 tImmunology.g2010 Feb., v. 129, no. 2 p.220-233dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03171.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100111b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02831naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245009700177300001600274520164000290650001901930650001101949650001301960650001001973650001501983650002201998650001102020650002802031650001902059650001002078653001102088653002302099653002302122700002502145773011802170852000902288856009202297930003302389946001102422655001202433IND4439336520221118040240.0100702e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443933652DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2311.2010.01212.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGRIFFITHS, HANNAH M.10aHitchhiking and the removal of microbial contaminants by the leaf-cutting ant Atta colombica  ap. 529-537.  a1. The ecologically dominant leaf-cutting ants exhibit one of the most complex forms of morphological caste-based division of labour in order to efficiently conduct tasks, ranging from harvesting fresh leaf material to caring for the vulnerable fungal crop they farm as food. While much of their division of labour is well known, the role of the smallest workers on foraging trails is puzzling. Frequently these minim workers hitchhike on leaf fragments and it has been suggested that they may act to reduce the microbial contamination of leaf material before they enter the nest. Here we investigated this potentially important role of minims with field colonies of Atta colombica. 2. We experimentally increased the microbial load of leaf fragments and found that this resulted in minims hitchhiking on leaf fragments for longer. Furthermore, we show that leaves naturally have a significant microbial load and that the presence of hitchhikers reduces the microbial load of both experimentally manipulated and natural leaf fragments. 3. Intriguingly, the microbial load of leaves high in the canopy where ants were foraging was much lower than closer to the ground where the ants avoided cutting leaves. This suggests that the often perplexing foraging patterns of leaf-cutting ants may in part be explained by the ants avoiding leaves that are more heavily contaminated with microbes. 4. The removal of microbial contaminants is therefore an important role of hitchhiking minim workers in natural colonies of Atta leaf-cutting ants, although other tasks such as trail maintenance and defence also explain their occurrence on trails. 3aAtta colombica 3acanopy 3aforaging 3afungi 3aharvesting 3aleaf-cutting ants 3aleaves 3amicrobial contamination 3amicrobial load 3anests 0aCastes 0adivision of labour 0ahygienic behaviour1 aHUGHES, WILLIAM O.H.0 tEcological entomology.g2010 Aug., v. 35, no. 4 p.529-537dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2010.01212.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100702b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02727naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245007600170300001400246520115800260650003001418650003401448650001601482650002701498650001301525650001201538650002501550650000801575650001301583650003801596650001201634650001501646650002301661650002301684650001301707650002401720650001201744651001601756653002501772653000901797653001001806653003101816653002301847700001801870700001701888700001401905773012101919852000902040856009202049930003302141946001102174655001202185IND4438642720221118040215.0100618e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443864272DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7348.2010.00406.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelmiglio, C.10aIncidence of cereal and pasture viruses in New Zealand's native grasses  ap. 25-36.  aThis study provides evidence for frequent and multiple invasions of New Zealand's native grasses by exotic cereal and pasture viruses. Fifteen native and three exotic grasses from 29 North Island and six South Island sites were surveyed for the presence of viruses using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Barley yellow dwarf virus and Cereal yellow dwarf virus (BYDV, CYDV: Luteoviridae) and Cocksfoot mottle virus (CoMV, Sobemovirus) are widespread throughout New Zealand. CoMV, previously considered to have a natural host range restricted to Dactylis and Triticum, was detected in Poa anceps, P. cita, Festuca novae-zelandiae, and Chionochloa rubra. New virus host reports include BYDV-PAV in Microlaena stipoides and Dichelachne crinita; BYDV-MAV in P. cita, F. novae-zelandiae and Hierochloe redolens; and CYDV-RPV in P. cita and M. stipoides. Nominal logistic regression analyses showed a correlation between the presence of exotic grass species and virus incidence. Host range experiments for BYDV-PAV and CoMV were performed with selected native and exotic grasses, and the results are discussed in context of the field-survey findings. 3aBarley yellow dwarf virus 3aCereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV 3aChionochloa 3aCocksfoot mottle virus 3aDactylis 3aFestuca 3aMicrolaena stipoides 3aPoa 3aTriticum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agrasses 3ahost range 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3apastures 3aregression analysis 3aviruses 3aNew Zealand 0aBiological invasions 0aBSMV 0aCnMoV 0alow-input pastoral systems 0aplant conservation1 aPearson, M.N.1 aLister, R.A.1 aGuy, P.L.0 tAnnals of applied biology.g2010 July, v. 157, no. 1 p.25-36dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0003-47467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7348.2010.00406.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03427naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245015900182300001600341520158300357650002301940650001601963650001601979650001801995650001102013650001402024650001502038650001902053650001402072650001902086650001802105650002502123650001302148650001402161650001202175650003902187650002902226650004202255650005302297650000902350650001202359650003902371651001002410651001002420653001902430653002302449653001702472653001902489700002002508700002502528773013402553852000902687856008502696930003302781946001102814655001202825IND4439129420221118040218.0100625e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443912942DNAL7 a194843652pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-1020-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadhu, N.

During this period, the estuary was dominated by nutrient-rich freshwater, whereas the coastal waters were characterized with higher salinity values (>30 psu) and less nutrients. The average surface chlorophyll a concentrations and primary production rates were higher in the estuary (average 13.7 mg m ⁻ ³ and 432 mgC m ⁻ ³ day ⁻ ¹) as compared to the coastal waters (5.3 mg m ⁻ ³ and 224 mgC m ⁻ ³ day ⁻ ¹). The nanoplankton community formed the major fraction of chlorophyll a and primary production, both in the estuary (average 85 ± SD 8.3% and 81.2 ± SD 3.2%) and the coastal waters (average 73.2 ± SD 17.2% and 81.9 ± 15.7%). Nanoplankton had the maximum photosynthetic efficiency in the coastal waters (average 4.8 ± SD 3.9 mgC mgChl a m ⁻ ³ h ⁻ ¹), whereas in the estuary, the microplankton had higher photosynthetic efficiency (average 7.4 ± 7 mgC mgChl a m ⁻ ³ h ⁻ ¹). The heavy cloud cover and increased water column turbidity not only limit the growth of large-sized phytoplankton in the Cochin estuary and coastal waters but also support the proliferation of nanoplankton community during the monsoon season, even though large variation in nanoplankton chlorophyll a and production exists between these two areas. 3abiomass production 3achlorophyll 3acloud cover 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3amonsoon season 3anutrients 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytoplankton 3aprimary productivity 3asalinity 3aturbidity 2aBiomass 2aChlorophyllxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFresh Waterxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aPhytoplanktonxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aRain 2aSeasons 2aSeawaterxchemistryxmicrobiology. 3aIndia 0aIndia 0aSize structure 0aPrimary production 0aNanoplankton 0aCochin estuary1 aJyothibabu, R. 1 aBalachandran, K.

Both isolates showed susceptibility patterns suggestive of harbouring a plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamase (pACBL) and a plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance (PMQR). PCR-based replicon, MOB typing, plasmid profile and Southern hybridization analyses revealed that both isolates coharboured blaDHA₋₁ and qnrB genes on the same IncL/M-MOBP₁₃ plasmid approximately 70 kb in size. Together with the fact that both plasmids were conjugative in the laboratory, these results strongly suggest that a horizontal transfer event could take place in vivo. This is the first report of an isolate of S. marcescens harbouring a pACBL. The only phenotypic method that suggests the presence of a pACBL in an isolate harbouring an inducible chromosomal AmpC enzyme is the observation of scattered colonies near the edge of the inhibition zones of some β-lactams. The presence of both resistance genes on the same plasmid and the reported increase in PMQR could perhaps explain the widespread distribution of blaDHA₋₁ genes. 3aEscherichia coli 3aSerratia marcescens 3aSouthern blotting 3abeta-lactamase 3abeta-lactams 3agenes 3apatients 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquinolones 3areplicon 0aplasmid-mediated β-lactamases 0aplasmid-mediated quinolone resistance 0aincompatibility groups 0arelaxases1 aMiró, Elisenda1 aMirelis, Beatriz1 aGarcillán-Barcia, Maria Pilar1 aCruz, Fernando de la.1 aColl, Pere1 aNavarro, Ferran0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2010 July, v. 308, no. 1 p.24-28dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2010.01980.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100604b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02448naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010200165300001600267520112100283650002601404650001201430650001601442650001401458650001601472650001701488650001601505650001301521650002101534650001001555650001101565650000901576653001701585653002901602653002301631653002601654700001801680700002001698700002401718773011001742852000901852856008501861930003301946946001101979655001201990IND4435583420221118040155.0100416e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443558342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-010-0053-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKummerová, M. 10aEffect of zinc and cadmium on physiological and production characteristics in Matricaria recutita  ap. 308-314.  aEffects of zinc (12-180 μM) alone and in mixtures with 12 μM Cd on metal accumulation, dry masses of roots and shoots, root respiration rate, variable to maximum fluorescence ratio (FV/FM), and content of photosynthetic pigments were studied in hydroponically cultivated chamomile (Matricaria recutita) plants. The content of Zn in roots and shoots increased with the increasing external Zn concentration and its accumulation in the roots was higher than that in the shoots. While at lower Zn concentrations (12 and 60 μM) the presence of 12 μM Cd decreased Zn accumulation in the roots, treatment with 120 and 180 μM Zn together with 12 μM Cd caused enhancement of Zn content in the root. Presence of Zn (12-120 μM) decreased Cd accumulation in roots. On the other hand, Cd content in the shoots of plants treated with Zn + Cd exceeded that in the plants treated only with 12 μM Cd. Only higher Zn concentrations (120 and 180 μM) and Zn + Cd mixtures negatively influenced dry mass, chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoid content, FV/FM and root respiration rate.

The ten isolates were classified into three groups: (1) Group 1, consisting of four isolates showed: (a) high resistance to complement, (b) high virulence, and different pattern between 35 and 40 kDa with a weak peptide band at 35 kDa. (2) Group 2, consisting of one isolate showed: (a) high resistance to complement, (b) low virulence, and a weak peptide band at 35 kDa. (3) Group 3, consisting of five isolates showed: (a) low resistance to complement, (b) low virulence, and identical OMP pattern between 35 and 40 kDa exhibiting a strong peptide band at 35 kDa. The results suggest that high resistance to complement may be necessary but no sufficient for virulence and that OMP banding patterns may be a marker for virulence. 3acomplement 3abiomarkers 3astrain differences 3abacterial proteins 3acell membranes 3amolecular weight 3avirulence 3aEscherichia coli 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxchemistry 2aBiomarkers. 2aChickens 2aComplement Fixation Testsxveterinary 2aComplement System Proteinsximmunology 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEscherichia colixchemistryximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsximmunologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aPoultry Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aVirulence 0aresistance 0apathogenicity1 aHeller, E.D.1 aSchwartsburd, B.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g1999 Feb. 12, v. 64, no. 4 p.323-332x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03341naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002600161245007800187300001800265500016000283500001500443520189100458650002402349650001702373650002502390650002902415650002902444650002602473650001202499650003102511650002002542650002102562650002602583650002302609653002002632653002302652653001702675700001702692773008202709852000902791930003302800945002502833946001302858655001202871IND4376877420221118040128.0051225e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437687742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This led to several clinical studies in the late 1970s and early 1980s that aimed to evaluate the potential benefits of BCAA supplementation in nutritional support of the critically ill. The data on burn, trauma, and sepsis are, however, far from convincing. Besides significant discrepancies in their results and the fact that most of these studies involved very small populations of patients, few of them meet the current standards of therapeutic evaluation. However, some positive results in specific studies suggest that the underlying concept may be correct but that interpretation has been faulty. Indeed, we know now that while the BCAAs possess regulatory properties on protein metabolism, leucine is by far the most potent, while isoleucine and valine are inefficient. However, in the above-mentioned studies, BCAA-supplemented nutrition very frequently supplied almost equivalent amounts of all 3 BCAAs. Moreover, several studies were performed without adequate basal nutritional support, which most probably hampered the correct metabolic utilization of these amino acids. Taken together, these factors mean that the demonstrations of BCAA efficacy were fortunate in the least. In contrast, more recently, leucine was demonstrated to positively affect protein synthesis in an experimental model of sepsis or burn. In parallel, 2 prospective controlled trials of BCAA supplementation in septic patients also demonstrated an improvement in patients' nutritional status and outcome. Thus, we should abandon the concept of BCAA-supplemented nutrition for a more promising leucine-supplemented nutrition that requires further evaluation. 3aprotein supplements 3aacute course 3abasal metabolic rate 3aphysiological regulation 3anutritional intervention 3aanimal disease models 3aleucine 3abranched chain amino acids 3ahuman nutrition 3aburns (injuries) 3aamino acid metabolism 3asepsis (infection) 0aanimal injuries 0aliterature reviews 0adiet therapy1 aCynober, Luc0 tJournal of nutrition.g2006 Jan., v. 136, no. 1S p.308S-313Sx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20060613b20060702c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/05/23  aOther US 7aarticle03008naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002400144245011200168300001800280500016000298500001500458520166100473650001202134650001202146650003102158650002002189650001802209650002002227650002602247650000902273653002302282653002302305700002102328700002202349700002202371700001902393773008202412852000902494930003302503945002502536946001302561655001202574IND4376875820221118040208.0051225e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437687582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, it remains unclear how BCAAs regulate muscle protein metabolism and lead to anabolism in vivo. We examined muscle protein synthesis rate and breakdown rate simultaneously during BCAA infusion in muscle atrophy models as well as in normal healthy rats. Corticosterone-treated rats and hindlimb-immobilized rats were used as muscle atrophy models. Muscle protein synthesis rate and breakdown rate were measured as phenylalanine kinetics across the hindlimb. In anesthetized normal rats, BCAAs stimulated muscle protein synthesis despite low insulin concentration and did not suppress muscle protein breakdown. In corticosterone-treated rats, BCAAs failed to restore inhibited muscle protein synthesis, but reduced muscle protein breakdown. Immobilization of hindlimb increased muscle protein breakdown within a day. BCAAs did not change muscle protein metabolism, although essential amino acids (EAAs) suppressed muscle protein breakdown in hindlimb-immobilized rats. We also evaluated changes of fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of skeletal muscle protein during infusion of leucine alone or EAAs for 4 h in anesthetized normal rats. FSR showed a transient increase at 15-30 min of leucine infusion and then declined, whereas FSR stayed elevated throughout EAA infusion. We concluded that 1) BCAAs primarily stimulate muscle protein synthesis in normal rats independently of insulin; 2) EAAs are required to maintain the BCAA stimulation of muscle protein synthesis; and 3) The effects of BCAAs on muscle protein metabolism differ between atrophy models. 3aleucine 3aatrophy 3abranched chain amino acids 3askeletal muscle 3aanimal models 3ahuman nutrition 3aamino acid metabolism 3arats 0aliterature reviews 0aprotein metabolism1 aKatō, Hiroyuki.1 aHirabayashi, Yuri1 aMurakami, Hitoshi1 aSuzuki, Hiromi0 tJournal of nutrition.g2006 Jan., v. 136, no. 1S p.234S-236Sx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20060613b20060702c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/05/23  aOther US 7aarticle02127naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245009400143300001800237500016000255500001500415520078000430650002201210650001901232650001701251650002901268650002001297650003101317650001201348650002001360650002601380650002001406653002301426653002301449700001401472700002201486700002301508773008201531852000901613930003301622945002501655946001301680655001201693IND4376875420221118040055.0051225e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437687542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

It has been more recently recognized, but not understood, that humor factors present in states of acute and chronic inflammation could have a strong impact on protein turnover. Most recently, the role of amino acids, acting as signaling molecules, has become increasingly clarified. In aggregate, these factors (together with neuromuscular activity) determine the balance of body protein mass. We will review some of these data, particularly focusing on amino acids, insulin, and the growth hormone axis and their actions in muscle and how these relate to whole-body protein metabolism. 3aprotein synthesis 3amuscle protein 3asomatotropin 3aphysiological regulation 3askeletal muscle 3abranched chain amino acids 3ainsulin 3ahuman nutrition 3aamino acid metabolism 3aglucocorticoids 0aliterature reviews 0aprotein metabolism1 aLong, Wen1 aFryburg, David A.1 aBarrett, Eugene J.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2006 Jan., v. 136, no. 1S p.212S-217Sx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20060608b20060702c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/05/23  aOther US 7aarticle03396naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002100127245006400148300001800212500016000230520219900390650003102589650002602620650002002646650001202666650001502678650001102693650002602704650001902730650002202749650002902771653002302800700002502823773008202848852000902930930003302939945002502972946001302997655001203010IND4376875220221118040157.0051225e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437687522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBrosnan, John T.10aBranched-Chain Amino Acids: Enzyme and Substrate Regulation  ap. 207S-211S.  aPaper presented at the symposium on "Branched-Chain Amino Acids: Metabolism, Physiological Function, and Application," May 23-24, 2005, Versailles, France.  aThe three branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are the most hydrophobic of the amino acids and play crucial roles in determining the structures of globular proteins as well as the interaction of the transmembrane domains of membranous proteins with phospholipid bilayers. However, the three BCAAs do not behave identically. In terms of protein secondary structure, valine and isoleucine exhibit a definite preference for the {szligbeta}-structure, whereas leucine has a higher preference for the [alpha]-helix. Although mutation of one BCAA to another is commonly regarded as conservative, there are well-documented examples of such substitutions that have a significant effect on protein function. The occurrence of BCAA in nature is, therefore, attributable to their primary role in protein structure, not to their secondary metabolic roles. These functions are important for almost all proteins; therefore, BCAA commonly account for [approximately]20-25% of most dietary proteins. Dietary BCAA largely escape first-pass splanchnic metabolism. The first steps in their catabolism are common to all three, involving the BCAA aminotransferase (BCAT) and branched-chain [alpha]-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD). Their further metabolism employs distinct pathways to different end-products (glucose and/or ketone bodies). However, the fact that the flux-generating step for the catabolism of the three BCAAs occurs at one of the common steps indicates that the production of these downstream products are not individually regulated and, hence, may not play important individual roles. The catabolism of the BCAAs is highly regulated by both allosteric and covalent mechanisms. BCKD is inhibited by phosphorylation and activated by dephosphorylation. Allosteric inhibition of the kinase by the branched-chain keto acids (BCKA) (particularly by [alpha]-ketoisocaproate) serves both as a mechanism for promoting the catabolism of excess quantities of these amino acids as well as for conserving low concentrations of these dietary essential amino acids. Cytosolic and mitochondrial isoenzymes of BCAT have been identified. They are thought to play an important role in brain neurotransmitter metabolism. 3abranched chain amino acids 3aamino acid metabolism 3ahuman nutrition 3aleucine 3aisoleucine 3avaline 3aessential amino acids 3atransamination 3aenzyme substrates 3aphysiological regulation 0aliterature reviews1 aBrosnan, Margaret E.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2006 Jan., v. 136, no. 1S p.207S-211Sx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20060608b20060702c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/05/23  aOther US 7aarticle03202naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002000146245011100166300001600277520147100293650002001764650002201784650001401806650001001820650002101830650002301851650001301874650001701887650001901904650002801923650001801951650001201969650001001981650000901991650002002000650004302020650005602063650002502119650001102144650001102155650001102166650001602177650001702193650003202210650000802242653002302250653002502273700002402298700002402322700002602346700002102372700002402393773007902417852000902496930003302505945002502538946001302563655001202576IND4376874520221118040244.0051225e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437687452DNAL7 a163650772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, coffee and tea also contain polyphenols, which exhibit anticarcinogenic properties. A hospital-based, case-control study was conducted to evaluate the role of coffee, decaffeinated coffee, and black tea in breast cancer etiology. Study participants included 1932 cases with primary, incident breast cancer and 1895 hospital controls with nonneoplastic conditions. All participants completed a comprehensive epidemiological questionnaire. Among premenopausal women, consumption of regular coffee was associated with linear declines in breast cancer risk (P for trend = 0.03); consumers of [>/=]4 cups/d experienced a 40% risk reduction (odds ratio = 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.98). No clear associations between intake of black tea or decaffeinated coffee and breast cancer risk were noted among premenopausal women, although black tea was associated with a protective effect unique to a subsample of cases with lobular histology. Among postmenopausal women, breast cancer risk was not associated with consumption of coffee, tea, or decaffeinated coffee. Results among postmenopausal women did not differ by histologic subtype. Our findings support a protective effect of coffee intake on premenopausal, but not postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings. 3ahuman nutrition 3acoffee (beverage) 3ablack tea 3awomen 3abreast neoplasms 3amiddle-aged adults 3acaffeine 3arisk factors 3adecaffeination 3aepidemiological studies 3adose response 3aelderly 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBody Mass Index 2aBreast Neoplasmsxprevention & control 2aCaffeinexadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCoffee 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aPremenopause 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aTea 0acaffeinated coffee 0adecaffeinated coffee1 aBeehler, Gregory P.1 aSawant, Abhishek C.1 aJayaprakash, Vijayvel1 aMcCann, Susan E.1 aMoysich, Kirsten B.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2006 Jan., v. 136, no. 1 p.166-171x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20060608b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/05/23  aOther US 7aarticle03287naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133072001700151072001700168100001900185245010200204300001400306520169000320650000902010650001802019650002302037650002702060650001702087650001102104650002302115650002502138650001902163650001102182650001302193650002602206650001402232650001302246650001402259650001202273650002202285650004202307650004802349650001102397650000902408650000902417650002402426700002002450700002602470700002002496700002402516773007702540852000902617930003302626945002502659946001302684655001202697IND4376875320221118040304.0051225e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437687532DNAL7 a163650532pmid7 aPMC27185702pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKuo, Yien-Ming10aCopper Transport Protein (Ctr1) Levels in Mice Are Tissue Specific and Dependent on Copper Status  ap. 21-26.  aStudies were conducted to determine distribution of the copper transporter, Ctr1, a transmembrane protein responsible for cellular copper uptake, in adult mice and in suckling mice nursed by either copper-adequate (Cu+) or copper-deficient (Cu-) dams. Western immunoblot analyses, using immunopurified antibody, detected monomeric (23 kDa) and oligomeric forms of Ctr1 in the membrane fraction of several mouse organs. Immunohistochemical analyses detected abundant Ctr1 protein in liver canaliculi; kidney cortex tubules; small intestinal enterocytes; the choroid plexus and capillaries of brain; intercalated disks of heart; mature spermatozoa; epithelium of mammary ducts; and the pigment epithelium, outer limiting membrane, and outer plexiform layer of the retina. Duodenal Ctr1 distribution was different in the adult compared with suckling mice; adult mice demonstrated strong intracellular staining of the enterocyte, whereas apical staining predominated in suckling mice. In Cu- mice at postnatal d 16 (P16), Ctr1 staining was augmented in kidney, duodenum, and choroid plexus, compared with Cu+ mice. Brain immunoblot data indicated that Ctr1 protein in membrane fractions of Cu- mice was 56% higher than Cu+ mice. Cu- mice had lower hemoglobin (56% of Cu+), and lower copper concentration (% of Cu+) in liver (15%), brain (26%), and kidney (65%). These results suggest that Ctr1 protein is expressed in multiple tissues and found in higher levels in selected organs after perinatal copper deficiency. Enhanced Ctr1 levels and redistribution might compensate in part for the decrease in copper supply. Mechanisms for the enhancement in Ctr1 staining remain to be established. 3amice 3aanimal models 3anutrient transport 3atransmembrane proteins 3atransporters 3acopper 3anutritional status 3aspatial distribution 3aanimal tissues 3aadults 3aneonates 3anutrient deficiencies 3apregnancy 3asuckling 3alactation 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Suckling 2aCation Transport Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCopperxdeficiencyxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMice 2aTissue Distribution1 aGybina, Anna A.1 aPyatskowit, Joshua W.1 aGitschier, Jane1 aProhaska, Joseph R.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2006 Jan., v. 136, no. 1 p.21-26x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20060608b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/05/23  aOther US 7aarticle01125naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245009800132300001600230300002400246520020000270650001400470650002500484650002000509650002500529650002800554650001700582650001100599650002600610773007500636852001300711939003300724945000800757946001300765852000900778655001200787991625322170742620221118040124.0900622e199004  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900006952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoward, L.J.14aThe neurologic syndrome of vitamin E deficiency: Laboratory and electrophysiologic assessment  ap. 169-177.  ap. 169-177. charts.  aThis article discusses vitamin E deficiency and its effects on the nervous system, eyes, and blood cells.

  1 aTroen, Aron M.10aUnmetabolized Folic Acid in Plasma Is Associated with Reduced Natural Killer Cell Cytotoxicity among Postmenopausal Women  ap. 189-194.  aFolic acid (FA) supplements and food fortification are used to prevent neural tube defects and to lower plasma homocysteine. Through exposure to food fortification and vitamin supplement use, large populations in the United States and elsewhere have an unprecedented high FA intake. We evaluated dietary and supplemental intakes of folate and FA in relation to an index of immune function, natural killer cell (NK) cytotoxicity, among 105 healthy, postmenopausal women. Among women with a diet low in folate (<233 [micro]g/d), those who used FA-containing supplements had significantly greater NK cytotoxicity (P = 0.01). However, those who consumed a folate-rich diet and in addition used FA supplements > 400 [micro]g/d had reduced NK cytotoxicity compared with those consuming a low-folate diet and no supplements (P = 0.02). Prompted by this observation, we assessed the presence of unmetabolized FA in plasma as a biochemical marker of excess FA. Unmetabolized folic acid was detected in 78% of plasma samples from fasting participants. We found an inverse relation between the presence of unmetabolized FA in plasma and NK cytotoxicity. NK cytotoxicity was [approximately]23% lower among women with detectable folic acid (P = 0.04). This inverse relation was stronger among women [>/=] 60 y old and more pronounced with increasing unmetabolized FA concentrations (P-trend = 0.002). Because of the increased intake of FA in many countries, our findings highlight the need for further studies on the effect of long-term high FA intake on immune function and health. 3awomen 3aelderly 3afolic acid 3ametabolism 3anatural killer cells 3acytotoxicity 3adietary supplements 3abiomarkers 3aimmune response 3ahuman health 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosagexbloodxmetabolism. 2aHematinicsxadministration & dosagexbloodxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aKiller Cells, Naturalximmunology 2aMiddle Aged 2aPostmenopausexblood1 aMitchell, Breeana1 aSorensen, Bess1 aWener, Mark H.1 aJohnston, Abbey1 aWood, Brent1 aSelhub, Jacob1 aMcTiernan, Anne1 aYasui, Yutaka1 aOral, Evrim1 aPotter, John D.1 aUlrich, Cornelia M.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2006 Jan., v. 136, no. 1 p.189-194x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20060608b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/05/24  aOther US 7aarticle01893naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245004900150300001200199300002000211500001500231520077800246650002301024650001201047650002701059650001401086650001501100650002401115650001201139650001201151650002101163650004501184650003401229653001501263653002301278653001101301773007101312852001301383939003301396945000801429946001301437852000901450655001201459991625321850742620221118040215.0860902e198601  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860110332DNAL7 a30059322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoland, R.L.10aPlants as a source of vitamin D3 metabolites  ap. 1-8.  ap. 1-8. charts.  a2019-12-05  aData are examined on the occurrence, synthesis, and role of vitamin D3 sterols in plants, and studies providing information about the biological activity and metabolism of plant vitamin D3 derivatives in animals are reviewed.

  1 aCross, Heide S.10aNutrients Regulate the Colonic Vitamin D System in Mice: Relevance for Human Colon Malignancy  ap. 561-564.  aDihydroxycholecalciferol bound to its receptor functions as a potent antimitotic, prodifferentiating, proapoptotic hormone in different cell types and tissues. Epidemiological studies have linked low human serum concentrations of the vitamin D precursor hydroxycholecalciferol to colorectal cancer incidence. We have demonstrated in human colorectal tissue and cells the conversion of the precursor to dihydroxycholecalciferol, as well as the existence of the vitamin D catabolic pathway. These findings suggest a role for the colonic vitamin D system in tumor prevention. Low calcium intake has been found to be associated with human colorectal cancer incidence. In mice fed calcium equivalent to a low human intake, the degradative vitamin D pathway was increased, mainly in the ascending colon. Refeeding the mice high levels of vitamin D and calcium lowered tissue 25-hydroxycholecalciferol 24-hydroxylase activity, but only replenishment of folic acid normalized expression of the degradative pathway completely. Normalization occurred also when mice consuming low calcium diets were fed soy or the phytoestrogen genistein. These results indicate that colonic vitamin D synthesis is not only under stringent control of nutritional calcium, but also of folate, a methyl donor, which suggests epigenetic control of vitamin D hydroxylases. 3adietary minerals 3ahydroxycholecalciferols 3acalcium 3afolic acid 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3avitamin metabolism 3amice 3aanimal models 3acolorectal neoplasms 3avitamin deficiencies 3aplant estrogens 3aepigenetics 3agenistein 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3achemoprevention 3aplant-based foods 3afortified foods 3avitamin-mineral supplements 3afood intake 3acolon 3arenal function 2aAnimals 2aCalcitriolxbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aCalcium, Dietary 2aColonxpathologyxphysiology. 2aColonic Neoplasmsxepidemiology 2aColorectal Neoplasmsxepidemiology 2aHumans 2aKidneyxmetabolism 2aMice 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aVitamin Dxbloodxphysiology. 2aVitamin D Deficiencyxcomplications1 aLipkin, Martin1 aKállay, Enikö0 tJournal of nutrition.g2006 Mar., v. 136, no. 3 p.561-564x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20060510b20060607c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/05/05  aOther US 7aarticle03489naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002000146245013500166300001600301520163500317650000901952650001801961650001601979650001001995650001402005650001602019650001602035650001902051650001402070650002102084650001502105650001802120650002102138650001402159650001702173650001202190650004402202650001202246650002802258650003002286650002502316650001402341650003502355650001102390650002802401650000902429650002902438650001602467700002902483700002602512700002002538700001502558700001702573700002302590700002102613700002202634773007902656852000902735930003302744945002502777946001302802655001202815IND4377362520221118040000.0060122e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437736252DNAL7 a164241202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKim, Hye-Kyeong10aGenistein Decreases Food Intake, Body Weight, and Fat Pad Weight and Causes Adipose Tissue Apoptosis in Ovariectomized Female Mice  ap. 409-414.  aGenistein, an isoflavone in soybean products, has estrogenic activity and is used as a natural substitute for estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women. Genistein was also shown to decrease fat pad weight in female mice. The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of genistein on adipose tissue apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and mature adipocytes were treated with 0, 1, 10, 100, and 400 [micro]mol/L genistein and then assayed for apoptosis, whereas only mature adipocytes were assayed for viability. Mature adipocytes treated with genistein demonstrated a dose-related increase in apoptosis. Ovariectomized female mice (9 mo old) were given 0, 150, or 1500 mg/kg genistein in the semipurified phytoestrogen-free casein-based diet for 3 wk (n = 10). After mice were killed, body composition was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry analysis, and parametrial (PM), inguinal (ING), and retroperitoneal (RP) fat pads were weighed and assayed for apoptosis (% DNA fragmentation). Genistein (1500 mg/kg) reduced food intake (FI) by 14% (P < 0.01) and body weight (BW) by 9% (P < 0.01). Body composition was not significantly affected, but PM and ING weights were decreased 22% (P < 0.05) and 19% (P < 0.07), respectively, by 1500 mg/kg genistein. Apoptosis in ING fat was increased 290% (P < 0.05) by 1500 mg/kg genistein. These findings show that oral genistein treatment can reduce BW, mobilize body fat, and induce apoptosis of adipose tissue in ovariectomized female mice. Thus, genistein may be useful in treating or preventing increased adiposity after menopause. 3amice 3aanimal models 3aovariectomy 3awomen 3agenistein 3afood intake 3aweight loss 3aadipose tissue 3aapoptosis 3asoybean products 3aadipocytes 3adose response 3abody composition 3amenopause 3ahuman health 3aelderly 2aAdipose Tissuexcytologyxdrug effects. 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Line 2aFeeding Behaviorxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aGenisteinxpharmacology 2aMice 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aOvariectomy1 aNelson-Dooley, Cassandra1 aDella-Fera, Mary Anne1 aYang, Jeong-Yeh1 aZhang, Wei1 aDuan, Jiuhua1 aHartzell, Diane L.1 aHamrick, Mark W.1 aBaile, Clifton A.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2006 Feb., v. 136, no. 2 p.409-414x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20060608b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/05/24  aOther US 7aarticle03608naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002500146245013800171300001600309520147400325650002101799650001501820650002901835650002701864650002001891650002901911650002601940650002001966650001901986650001202005650001702017650002102034650003102055650001602086650001802102650002302120650004402143650002102187650002702208650004402235650001102279650004502290650003302335650004002368650002002408650004602428650003202474650002402506650004702530650006902577650005202646653002402698700002102722700001902743700002502762773007902787852000902866930003302875945002502908946001302933655001202946IND4377362720221118040321.0060122e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437736272DNAL7 a164241222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDegner, Stephanie C.10aConjugated Linoleic Acid Attenuates Cyclooxygenase-2 Transcriptional Activity via an Anti-AP-1 Mechanism in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells  ap. 421-427.  aOverexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is regarded as a causative factor in the onset of tumorigenesis of the breast. In this study, we investigated the effects of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on COX-2 transcription in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Results of transient transfection studies revealed that treatment with a CLA mix or selected isomers (c9, t11-CLA; t10, c12-CLA) at concentrations ranging from 20 to 80 [micro]mol/L, attenuated COX-2 transcription induced by the proinflammatory agent 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). In addition, the CLA mix inhibited TPA-induced activity of the collagenase-1 promoter. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we found that the CLA mix reduced TPA-induced recruitment of nuclear proteins to a cAMP response element (CRE) in the COX-2 promoter and a consensus TPA-responsive element (TRE) in the collagenase-1 promoter. Both CRE and TRE are binding sites for activator protein-1 (AP-1). Binding studies revealed that the t10, c12-CLA isomer was more effective than the CLA mix or c9, t11-CLA in reducing binding of cJun to either the COX-2 CRE or collagenase-1 TRE, whereas linoleic acid increased binding to both elements. Overexpression of the AP-1 member, c-Jun, reversed the inhibitory effects of the CLA mix on COX-2 transcription, and restored binding of nuclear proteins to the CRE and TRE. Collectively, these results suggest that CLA represses AP-1-mediated activation of COX-2 transcription. 3abreast neoplasms 3acell lines 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aenzyme activity 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3agene expression 3acarcinogenesis 3aisomers 3ainflammation 3apromoter regions 3agene expression regulation 3acollagenase 3abinding sites 3abinding properties 2aBreast Neoplasmsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCyclic AMPxmetabolism 2aCyclooxygenase 2xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxpharmacology 2aNuclear Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aProtein Binding 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-junxmetabolism 2aResponse Elementsxgenetics 2aSignal Transduction 2aTetradecanoylphorbol Acetatexpharmacology 2aTranscription Factor AP-1xantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Geneticxdrug effectsxgenetics. 0aactivator protein-11 aKemp, Michael Q.1 aBowden, G.

  1 aWang, Hong10aGinseng Extract Inhibits Lipolysis in Rat Adipocytes In Vitro by Activating Phosphodiesterase 4  ap. 337-342.  aElevated concentrations of plasma free fatty acids (FFA) may cause insulin resistance. Inhibition of lipolysis reduces FFA availability and improves insulin sensitivity. Ginseng extract (Panax spp., GE) was shown to improve glycemia in Type 2 diabetes. In the present study, the antilipolytic effect of GE in rat adipocytes and the signaling pathway for GE antilipolysis were investigated. Adipocytes were isolated from rat fat tissue by collagenase digestion. The ability of GE to inhibit lipolysis was assessed by measuring glycerol and FFA release into the incubation medium. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor and various phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors were applied to investigate the signaling pathway for GE antilipolysis. The present study showed that insulin and GE inhibited lipolysis by 42.4 and 49% compared with basal, respectively (P < 0.05). Unlike insulin, the PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin did not reverse GE antilipolysis, and GE did not affect phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB). The nonselective PDE inhibitor enprofylline reversed both insulin and GE antilipolysis. The specific phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor cilostamide reversed insulin antilipolysis completely, but did not significantly affect GE antilipolysis. The specific phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor rolipram did not significantly affect insulin antilipolysis, but almost completely reversed GE antilipolysis. Moreover, the combination of PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitors completely reversed GE antilipolysis. None of the ginsenosides (Rb1, Re, Rg1, Rc, Rb2, and Rd) were responsible for GE antilipolysis. The results suggest that ginseng exerts its antilipolytic effect through a signaling pathway different from that of insulin. GE antilipolysis is mediated in part by activating PDE4 in rat adipocytes. 3arats 3aanimal models 3aadipocytes 3alipolysis 3aPanax 3aplant extracts 3aphosphoric diester hydrolases 3aenzyme activation 3afree fatty acids 3ainsulin resistance 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3asignal transduction 3ain vitro studies 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aenzyme inhibitors 3ainsulin 3acyclic AMP 3aprotein phosphorylation 2a3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aAdipocytesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aCyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3 2aCyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxmetabolism 2aGlycerolxmetabolism 2aInsulinxpharmacology 2aLipolysisxdrug effects 2aMale 2aPanaxxchemistry 2aPhosphorylationxdrug effects 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-aktxmetabolism 2aQuinolonesxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 0aphosphodiesterase 4 0awortmannin 0aphosphatodiesterase 3 0acilostamide 0arolipram1 aReaves, Lisa A.1 aEdens, Neile K.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2006 Feb., v. 136, no. 2 p.337-342x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20060608b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/05/24  aOther US 7aarticle01465naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245005900115300001200174500001500186520063200201650000900833650001000842650002500852650001500877650002000892650003200912651001000944653001100954773012300965852000901088939003301097945000801130946001301138655001201151991625312540742620221118034902.0790926e197811  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794849792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aResearch expenditure helps meet India's nutrition goal  ap. 1-2.  a2019-12-06  aProduction of high-yielding wheat varieties in India rose to over 28 million tons in 1975/76.

The substitution of wheat for chickpea and other crops after 1966/67 led not only to an increase in production of energy per hectare but also of protein. Therefore, a primarily yield-oriented plant breeding strategy has had a favorable impact on the nutritional well-being of the people in the case of wheat and similar strategy is called for with other cereals as well as grain legumes. 3adiet 3awheat 3adeveloping countries 3acrop yield 3afood production 3afood and nutrition programs 3aIndia 0agrains0 tLeague for International Food Education newsletter.g1978 Nov.,  p.1-2aLeague For International Food Education.7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19790926c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01571naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002000117245006300137300001200200520068100212650002000893650001700913650003200930651001000962653003000972653003301002653002501035653001801060653004601078700002101124773005001145852000901195939003301204945000801237655001201245991625312340742620221118034902.0770901e197702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794421902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaudhuri, S.N.10aCINI NUTRIMIX: Catalyst in a grass roots nutrition program  ap. 1-3.  aA program in South Calcutta that involved the community in the production and distribution of CINI NUTRIMIX, a low cost nutritional supplement, resulted in the improved nutritional status of pre school children.

Anecdotal evidence suggests many farmers apply excessive amounts of irrigation. Additional precise information on crop water use is required to assist farmers improve their irrigation practices by matching irrigation to crop water demand. This paper presents results from a field experiment to determine the water requirements of mature date palm trees ('Lulu'). The experiments are being conducted at the International Centre for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA), near Dubai. Tree water use is measured directly using sap flow sensors placed in the tree trunks, and indirectly using TDR (time domain reflectometry) waveguides placed in the root-zone soil, to a depth of 2.0 m. Local weather data used to calculate the hourly and daily potential evaporation rate (ETO), and derive an appropriate value for the crop factor, KC. Preliminary data shows the water use of the palm trees to be less than half the amount suggested by the FAO-56 guidelines. Information from field experiments is used to parameterize a decision support tool for irrigation allocation. This is being developed for the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD) to improve the management and sustainability of groundwater usage for date palms in the United Arab Emirates. 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3acrops 3adecision support systems 3adesert soils 3aevaporation rate 3afarmers 3afield experimentation 3agroundwater 3airrigation rates 3ameteorological data 3arhizosphere 3asap flow 3atime domain reflectometry 3atree trunk 3awater allocation 3awater requirement 3aUnited Arab Emirates1 aGreen, S.

Understanding the relationship between occurrence and microhabitat factors should be helpful in  managing this species, though our current understanding of this relationship is inadequate. Therefore, we conducted a study in  western Tennessee during 2000–2002 to determine this association. Occurrence (capture) data were assessed from results of  live trapping at 176 and 112 trap sites during winter and summer, respectively, at three sites. A maximum of 26 habitat variables  were measured at each trap location; all grids were combined for statistical analyses to account for varying relationships  between occurrence and microhabitat factors across different landscapes. Univariate and stepwise logistic-regression analyses  were used to assess associations among microhabitat variables and occurrence. Resulting models were validated through the  jackknife procedure. Predictive equations were constructed from logistic-regression models to compute capture probabilities.  Univariate analyses yielded numerous significant variables with those representing forest characteristics and proximity to water  generally the most significant. Strong concordance was observed between winter and summer seasons for most variables though  several differed (number of large hardwood snags, ground dens, and plant food species, distance to potential water and roads).  Such temporal variability was expected due to seasonal differences in habitat components and biological needs of Raccoons.  Variables included in derived models were similar to those scoring highest in univariate analyses; classification rates for models  (winter = 72%; summer = 78%) were among the highest recorded for generalist species. By accounting for landscape attributes  and replicating across sites, more accurate and useful models were developed. Such models should provide the information  required to effectively manage this species. 3aProcyon lotor 3aequations 3aforests 3ahardwood 3alandscapes 3amicrohabitats 3amodels 3anesting 3aprediction 3arabies 3aroads 3aseasonal variation 3asnags 3asongbirds 3astatistical analysis 3asummer 3atrapping 3awinter 3aTennessee1 aHouston, Allan E.1 aKennedy, Michael L.1 aLiu, Pin Shuo0 tCanadian field-naturalist.g2006 , v. 120, no. 2 p.225-231dOttawa Field-Naturalists' ClubwJournal:12174x0008-35507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v120i2.291  aDNAL 7aarticle01189naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002800145245008600173300001600259520033900275650001000614650002900624650002300653650002700676650001500703651001100718773012700729856004600856852000900902655001200911IND60591086520221118035033.0180315e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059108652DNAL7 a10.22621/cfn.v120i2.2922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBunker-Popma, Katherine10aScoter, Melanitta spp., Migrations Interrupted by Confederation Bridge: An Update  ap. 232-233.  aContinued monitoring over 10 years of scoter migrations through Northumberland Strait confirmed that these birds continue to perceive the Confederation Bridge (completed in 1997) as an obstacle.

Hybrid necrosis occurs due to dominant complementary interaction of two genes, Ne1 and Ne2. A cross between wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties C306 (drought tolerant, Ne1 carrier) and WL711(high yielding, Ne2 carrier) produced necrotic F1 hybrids, which died before ear emergence and produced no seeds. To overcome the problem of hybrid necrosis, ears enclosed in the leaf sheath were taken and cultured to maturity in liquid medium containing 5% sucrose and 0.04% glutamine. The necrotic hybrids produced only a few seeds per ear compared to parents, but individual grain weight was similar in the hybrid and the parents. The F1 ear culture study has been repeated for three years and F2 seeds obtained. In 1996-97, the cultured ears of F1 hybrids produced 62 seeds, of which only 52 showed germination and were grown under normal field conditions. Out of the 52 seeds, 50% were non-necrotic and showed segregation for various physiological traits. The results reveal that hybrids ears had the potential to form viable seeds. Culturing of wheat ears before ear emergence and production of viable F2 seeds from necrotic hybrids is a simple and efficient method for overcoming the problem of hybrid necrosis. 3aviability 3agene transfer 3ain vitro culture 3aseeds 3adose response 3aglutamine 3asucrose 3aTriticum aestivum 3agenes 3amicropropagation 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3aculture media 0ahybrid necrosis 0ane1 genes 0amethodology 0ane2 genes1 aLakshmi, K.V.S.V.1 aKhanna-Chopra, R.1 aBharti, S.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g1999, v. 59, no. 2 p.151-154x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02339naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245007100170300001600241520146500257650001701722653001401739653001901753700002401772773011901796852000901915856009301924930003302017946001102050655001202061IND4391568320221122094528.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439156832DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00510.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalbec, Odile14aThe mast cell IgG receptors and their roles in tissue inflammation  ap. 206-221.  aMast cells are effector cells of the innate immune system, but because they express Fc receptors (FcRs), they can be engaged in adaptive immunity by antibodies. Mast cell FcRs include immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgG receptors and, among these, activating and inhibitory receptors. The engagement of mast cell IgG receptors by immune complexes may or may not trigger cell activation, depending on the type of mast cell. The coengagement of IgG and IgE receptors results in inhibition of mast cell activation. The Src homology-2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase-1 is a major effector of negative regulation. Biological responses of mast cells depend on the balance between positive and negative signals that are generated in FcR complexes. The contribution of human mast cell IgG receptors in allergies remains to be clarified. Increasing evidence indicates that mast cells play critical roles in IgG-dependent tissue-specific autoimmune diseases. Convincing evidence was obtained in murine models of multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, bullous pemphigoid, and glomerulonephritis. In these models, the intensity of lesions depended on the relative engagement of activating and inhibitory IgG receptors. In vitro models of mature tissue-specific murine mast cells are needed to investigate the roles of mast cells in these diseases. One such model unraveled unique differentiation/maturation-dependent biological responses of serosal-type mast cells. 3ainflammation 0amast cell 0aFcγ receptors1 aDaëron, M.q(Marc)0 tImmunological reviews.g2007 June, v. 217, no. 1 p.206-221dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00510.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02060naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001700143245012500160300001600285500001500301520100400316650001501320650001501335650001101350650001901361650001801380653002701398773012301425852000901548856008301557930003301640945001301673946001301686990002301699655001201722IND2040378920221122065828.0940620e199402  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204037892DNAL7 a10.1002/jmor.10521902072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCicero, J.M.10aComposite, haustellate mouthparts in netwinged beetle and firefly larvae (Coleoptera, Cantharoidea: Lycidae, Lampyridae)  ap. 183-192.  a2019-12-04  aDuring lycid embryogenesis, labral and mandibular anlagen develop separately. Each anterolateral corner of the labrum elongates into a stylet, while the whole of each mandible involutes into a flute that is open to the lateral aspect. The stylets and flutes interlock in such a way as to leave canals, fashioning left and right haustellate apparatuses. During lampyrid embryogenesis, only one pair of anlagen forms instead of two. The pair matures into sharp, arcuate appendages that appear to be typical mandibles, but nevertheless a canal forms internally. The canal is not formed by coadaptation of two appendages; instead, cells within the pair create the canal autonomously. Indications are that the canal is homologous between these two families. It is suggested that in lampyrids, labral and mandibular cell fields develop together in the same anlage but behave according to their own respective programs, forming the canal with morphogenetic movements that are comparable to those of lycids. 3aColeoptera 3amouthparts 3alarvae 3aultrastructure 3aembryogenesis 0aanatomy and morphology0 tJournal of morphology.g1994 Feb., v. 219, no. 2 p.183-192aJournal of morphology (Philadelphia, Pa.)x0362-25257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmor.10521902073Available from publisher's Web site  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02303naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245011500160300001600275500002400291520125900315650002501574650001101599650002101610650001401631650001301645650001301658650001601671700001601687700002001703700001501723700001701738700001801755773011101773852000901884856004801893655001201941IND4384965220061202000000.0061105e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438496522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-006-0262-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Hui10aChanges of contents and antioxidant activities of polyphenols during fruit development of four apple cultivars  ap. 743-748.  aIncludes references  aPolyphenols are functional components in apples and can be separated into four groups by Sephadex LH-20 as epicatechin, procyanidolic oligomers, chlorogenic acid and procyanidolic polymers.

It was found that procyanidolic oligomers and procyanidolic polymers influenced the total polyphenols content (measured by Folin-Ciocalteu method) much more in Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Fuji and Guoguang four apple cultivars. The Fe-reducing activity of procyanidolic oligomers in the four apple cultivars increased significantly during the development while the other three compounds changed irregularly. And the Fe-reducing activities of epicatechin and procyanidin contributed much more to the total Fe-reducing activities during the fruit development in the four apple cultivars. The DPPH scavenging activities of four compounds in Jonagold and Golden Delicious decreased during fruit development and that of Fuji and Guoguang changed irregularly.

In the thymus, morphogen signal pathways consisting of WNT, Hedgehog, and the transforming growth factor-β superfamily are active and have been implicated in various developmental processes including proliferation, survival, and differentiation of maturing thymocytes. Intriguingly, it has been inferred that some of these morphogen signal pathways differentially affect γδ and αβ T-cell development or maintenance, but their role in T-cell lineage commitment has not been directly probed. We have recently identified a modulator of morphogen signaling that significantly influences binary γδ versus αβ T-cell lineage diversification. In this review, we summarize functions of morphogens in the thymus and provide a highly speculative model of integrated morphogen signals, potentially directing the γδ versus αβ T-cell fate determination process. 0amorphogen 0aγδ T cell 0aαβ T cell 0alineage commitment1 aKang, Joonsoo0 tImmunological reviews.g2007 Feb., v. 215, no. 1 p.32-45dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2006.00469.x3electronic resource  a20070204b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02429naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245011100176300001600287520128500303653001901588653001301607653001301620653003501633653001801668700001901686700002301705700003001728700002101758700002001779700002001799773011901819852000901938856007601947930003302023946001102056655001202067IND4387479320221122043247.0070204e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438747932DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2006.00473.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshikawa, Hiromichi10aCurriculum vitae of intestinal intraepithelial T cells: their developmental and behavioral characteristics  ap. 154-165.  aThe alimentary tract has an epithelial layer, consisting mainly of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), that is exposed to the exterior world through the intestinal lumen. The IEC layer contains many intestinal intraepithelial T cells (IELs), and the total number of IELs constitutes the largest population in the peripheral T-cell pool. Virtually all γδ-IELs and many αβ-IELs in the mouse small intestine are known to express CD8αα homodimers. A wide range of evidence that supports extrathymic development of these CD8αα⁺ IELs has been collected. In addition, while several studies identified cells with precursor T-cell phenotypes within the gut epithelium, how these precursors, which are dispersed along the length of the intestine, develop into γδ-IELs and/or αβ-IELs has not been clarified. The identification of lymphoid cell aggregations named 'cryptopatches' (CPs) in the intestinal crypt lamina propria of mice as sites rich in T-cell precursors in 1996 by our research group, however, provided evidence for a central site, whereby precursor IELs could give rise to T-cell receptor-bearing IELs. In this review, we discuss the development of IELs in the intestinal mucosa and examine the possibility that CPs serve as a production site of extrathymic IELs. 0aCD8αα⁺-IEL 0aγδ-IEL 0aαβ-IEL 0aextrathymic development of IEL 0acryptopatches1 aNaito, Tomoaki1 aIwanaga, Toshihiko1 aTakahashi-Iwanaga, Hiromi1 aSuematsu, Makoto1 aHibi, Toshifumi1 aNanno, Masanobu0 tImmunological reviews.g2007 Feb., v. 215, no. 1 p.154-165dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2006.00473.x3electronic resource  a20070204b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle00853naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245007000132300001500202520011200217650001500329650001200344650001700356653002400373653002000397653001900417773006600436852000900502939003300511945000800544946001100552655001200563991573778580742620221122043100.0830303s1982    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830018322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoward, R.J.10aAlterations in surface membrane of red blood cells during malaria  ap. 67-107.  amalaria, alterations in proteins and glycoproteins of surface membranes of infected red blood cells, review 3aPlasmodium 3amalaria 3aerythrocytes 0aGlycoproteins, Host 0aMembranes, Host 0aProteins, Host0 tImmunological Reviews.g1982, v. 61 p.67-107x0105-28967nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830303c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02079naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245013100174300001300305520112400318653001901442653000901461653000801470653000801478653001101486700001901497773011601516852000901632856009201641930003301733946001101766655001201777IND4397426020221122012909.0071104e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439742602DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00560.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTemkin, Vladislav10aFrom death receptor to reactive oxygen species and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase: the receptor-interacting protein 1 odyssey  ap. 8-21.  aDeath receptors (DRs) are more than simple killers: they control cell growth, proliferation, and survival, thereby playing a pivotal role in immune and inflammatory responses. Some of these phenomena might be explained by aberrant reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and metabolism, which can lead to oxidative stress. A key signaling molecule of DR-initiated intracellular pathways, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), orchestrates a complex control of multiple responses and may link DR-associated signaling complexes to ROS production by mitochondria. Yet, RIP1 is also an important regulator of endogenous anti-oxidants and ROS scavenging enzymes, because it is required for nuclear factor κB activation that results in expression of anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant proteins. Alteration of RIP1 function may result in ROS accumulation and abnormal c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase activation, affecting inflammatory responses, innate immunity, stress responses, and cell survival. These molecular mechanisms may be involved in neoplastic, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases. 0adeath receptor 0aRIP1 0aROS 0aJNK 0aNF-κB1 aKarin, Michael0 tImmunological reviews.g2007 Dec., v. 220, no. 1 p.8-21dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00560.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071104b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02087naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245016300165300001600328500002400344520096900368650002001337650001901357650000801376650001201384650001101396650001301407650001401420651001401434700002401448700002501472700001701497700002001514700002401534773009801558852000901656856004801665655001201713IND4445166020221121231046.0101113e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444516602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-010-9935-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKopp, Robert E.14aThe impact of Greenland melt on local sea levels: a partially coupled analysis of dynamic and static equilibrium effects in idealized water-hosing experiments  ap. 619-625.  aIncludes references  aLocal sea level can deviate from mean global sea level because of both dynamic sea level (DSL) effects, resulting from oceanic and atmospheric circulation and temperature and salinity distributions, and changes in the static equilibrium (SE) sea level configuration, produced by the gravitational, elastic, and rotational effects of mass redistribution. Both effects will contribute to future sea level change. To compare their magnitude, we simulated the effects of Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) melt by conducting idealized North Atlantic “water-hosing” experiments in a climate model unidirectionally coupled to a SE sea level model. At current rates of GIS melt, we find that geographic SE patterns should be challenging but possible to detect above dynamic variability. At higher melt rates, we find that DSL trends are strongest in the western North Atlantic, while SE effects will dominate in most of the ocean when melt exceeds ~20 cm equivalent sea level. 3aair temperature 3aclimate models 3aice 3amelting 3aoceans 3asalinity 3asea level 3aGreenland1 aMitrovica, Jerry X.1 aGriffies, Stephen M.1 aYin, Jianjun1 aHay, Carling C.1 aStouffer, Ronald J.0 tClimatic change.g2010 Dec., v. 103, no. 3-4 p.619-625dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-010-9935-1 7aarticle02090naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245004900169300001600218520085300234650002501087650002001112650001101132653001201143653001401155700002201169700001901191700002101210700001701231700002301248700002401271700001901295700001901314700002201333700002501355700002401380773011901404852000901523856009201532930003301624946001101657655001201668IND4395073120221121142834.0070916e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439507312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00551.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUeno, Hideki10aDendritic cell subsets in health and disease  ap. 118-142.  aThe dendritic cell (DC) system of antigen-presenting cells controls immunity and tolerance. DCs initiate and regulate immune responses in a manner that depends on signals they receive from microbes and their cellular environment. They allow the immune system to make qualitatively distinct responses against different microbial infections. DCs are composed of subsets that express different microbial receptors and express different surface molecules and cytokines. Our studies lead us to propose that interstitial (dermal) DCs preferentially activate humoral immunity, whereas Langerhans cells preferentially induce cellular immunity. Alterations of the DC system result in diseases such as autoimmunity, allergy, and cancer. Conversely, DCs can be exploited for vaccination, and novel vaccines that directly target DCs in vivo are being designed. 3aHealth and Pathology 3adendritic cells 3ahumans 0asubsets 0aphagocyte1 aKlechevsky, Eynav1 aMorita, Rimpei1 aAspord, Caroline1 aCao, Tinghua1 aMatsui, Toshimichi1 aDi Pucchio, Tiziana1 aConnolly, John1 aFay, Joseph W.1 aPascual, Virginia1 aPalucka, A.

To determine whether lean and obese children of glucose-intolerant pregnancies can be distinguished from similar children of glucose-tolerant pregnancies, we measured body composition, abdominal and gluteal adipocyte size, fasting free fatty acid (FFA), and fasting and stimulated glucose and insulin concentrations during an oral glucose tolerance test in prepubertal children of glucose-intolerant and prediabetic mothers. Each group ranged in adipocity from 6 to 40 per cent body fat. Age, weight, height, and percentage of body fat were similar in the two groups. There were no significant differences in adipocyte size or in glucose, FFA, C-peptide, and insulin concentrations between the groups. The correlation between abdominal adipocyte size and fasting insulin concentration (r = .91 and .18, t = 2.8, P = .01) was stronger in children from glucose-intolerant than from glucose-tolerant pregnancies, respectively. In terms of the parameters we measured, there are no major differences between children of glucose-intolerant and glucose-tolerant pregnancies.(author) 3adiabetes 3apregnant women 3ainfants 3abody composition 3aadipocytes 3afatty acids 3aobesity 3aglucose tolerance 2aAdipose Tissuexcytology 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Composition 2aC-Peptidexblood 2aChild 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xphysiopathology 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHumans 2aIndians, North American 2aInsulinxblood 2aMale 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy in Diabeticsxphysiopathology 0aArizona1 aThuillez, P.1 aHoward, B.V.1 aBennett, P.H.1 aSalans, L.B.1 aCushman, S.W.1 aReaven, G.M.1 aFoley, J.E.0 tDiabetes.g1986 Oct., v. 35, no. 10 p.1077-1080x0012-17977nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19870715c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002800152245009700180300001400277520121900291650001701510653001501527653001501542653003501557700001601592700002401608700002101632700001801653700002201671773011701693852000901810856009201819930003301911946001101944655001201955IND4395074020221121111813.0070916e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439507402DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00559.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsorio y Fortéa, José10aUnveiling pathways used by Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes to subvert macrophage function  ap. 66-74.  aThis article provides a summary and discussion of properties of Leishmania amazonensis-loaded mouse macrophages. It illustrates how high-throughput analysis is expected to contribute to deciphering features displayed by macrophages when they are subverted as host cells for replicating Leishmania amastigotes. Firstly, we discuss features of mouse mononuclear phagocytes in steady-state conditions, including the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Secondly, we discuss results from ongoing investigations aimed at characterizing transcriptional signatures displayed by BALB/c mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages housing replicating L. amazonensis amastigotes. After a brief presentation on the feasibility of high-throughput microscopy relying on our robust culture system, we share some perspectives on the perpetuation of L. amazonensis in their hosts. Within this latter context, a novel question is formulated and its relevance is discussed: do the Leishmania amastigotes that persist within the mammalian dermis reach a non-replicating developmental stage?

Sperm capacitation-like status was investigated using the fluorescent dye chlortetracycline (CTC). There was no difference in capacitation-like status between colloid-selected and non-selected spermatozoa. Sperm motility decreased significantly during cold storage, whereas the proportion of apparently capacitated spermatozoa increased. There was no change in the proportion of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa. In conclusion, SLC through Androcoll™-E does not adversely affect the capacitation-like status of stallion spermatozoa, although it did increase with time during cold storage. 3aacrosome reaction 3acentrifugation 3acold storage 3adyes 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3astallions 2aAcrosome Reactionxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aCell Separationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aCentrifugationxadverse effectsxmethodsxveterinary. 2aChlortetracycline 2aCold Temperature 2aColloids 2aFluorescent Dyes 2aHorses 2aMale 2aSemen Preservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSperm Capacitationxphysiology 2aSperm Motilityxphysiology 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology1 aJohannisson, A.1 aBäckgren, L.1 aDalin, A.M.1 aRodriguez-Martinez, H.1 aMorrell, JM0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2011 Feb., v. 46, no. 1 p.e74-e78dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2010.01637.x 7aarticle02077naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001200127245005900139300001300198500013200211500001500343520111900358650001401477650001601491650001801507650001601525653001801541700001901559773009301578852000901671930003301680945002501713946001301738655001201751IND4385203120221121052017.0061114e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438520312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Biomass is one of the technologies within NEMS, which plays a key role in several scenarios. An endogenously determined biomass supply schedule is used to derive the price-quantity relationship of biomass. There are four components to the NEMS biomass supply schedule including: agricultural residues, energy crops, forestry residues, and urban wood waste/mill residues. The EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2005 includes updated estimates of the agricultural residue portion of the biomass supply schedule. The changes from previous agricultural residue supply estimates include: revised assumptions concerning corn stover and wheat straw residue availabilities, inclusion of non-corn and non-wheat agricultural residues (such as barley, rice straw, and sugarcane bagasse), and the implementation of assumptions concerning increases in no-till farming. This article will discuss the impact of these changes on the supply schedule. 3abioenergy 3awheat straw 3awood residues 3acorn stover 0acrop residues1 aEasterly, J.L.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2006 Spring, v. 129-132 p.3-21x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20070806b20070902c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/12/08  aOther US 7aarticle02563naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245007300166300001600239520161200255650001301867653000901880653001001889653000801899653000901907653001301916700002301929700002101952773011901973852000902092856009202101930003302193946001102226655001202237IND4393102020221121052020.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439310202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00538.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMor, Adam10aSmall GTPases and LFA-1 reciprocally modulate adhesion and signaling  ap. 114-125.  aLeukocyte-function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) is an integrin that is critical for T-cell adhesion and immunologic responses. As a transmembrane receptor and adhesion molecule, LFA-1 signals bidirectionally, whereby information about extracellular ligands is passed outside-in while cellular activation is transmitted inside-out to the adhesive ectodomain. Here, we review the role of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) in LFA-1 signaling. Rap1, a Ras-related GTPase, appears to be central to LFA-1 function. Rap1 is regulated by receptor signaling [e.g. T-cell receptor (TCR), CD28, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4)] and by adapter proteins [e.g. adhesion and degranulation-promoting adapter protein (ADAP) and Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein of 55 kDa (SKAP-55)]. Inside-out signaling flows through Rap1 to regulator of adhesion and cell polarization enriched in lymphoid tissues (RAPL) and Rap1-GTP interacting adapter molecule (RIAM) that act in conjunction with the cytoskeleton on the cytosolic domain of LFA-1 to increase adhesion of the ectodomain. Outside-in signaling also relies on small GTPases such as Rho proteins. Vav-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho proteins, is activated as a consequence of LFA-1 engagement. Jun-activating binding protein-1 (JAB-1) and cytohesin-1 have been implicated as possible outside-in signaling intermediates. We have recently shown that Ras is also downstream of LFA-1 engagement: LFA-1 signaling through phospholipase D (PLD) to RasGRP1 was required for Ras activation on the plasma membrane following stimulation of TCR. 3aadhesion 0aRap1 0aLFA-1 0aRas 0aRac1 0aintegrin1 aDustin, Michael L.1 aPhilips, Mark R.0 tImmunological reviews.g2007 Aug., v. 218, no. 1 p.114-125dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00538.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02285naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245012000141300001400261500013200275520128700407650001401694653003101708653003501739700001901774700001601793773009401809852000901903930003301912945002501945946001301970655001201983IND4385203820221121052028.0061114e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438520382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Ranking of biomass collection systems is based on cost of delivered biomass, quality of biomass supplied, emissions during collection, energy input to the chain operations, and maturity of supply system technologies. The assessment methodology is used to evaluate alternatives for collecting 1.8 x 10(6) dry t/yr based on assumptions made on performance of various assemblies of biomass collection systems. A proposed collection option using loafer/stacker was shown to be the best option followed by ensiling and baling. Ranking of biomass transport systems is based on cost of biomass transport, emissions during transport, traffic congestion, and maturity of different technologies. At a capacity of 4 x 10(6) dry t/yr, rail transport was shown to be the best option, followed by truck transport and pipeline transport, respectively. These rankings depend highly on assumed maturity of technologies and scale of utilization. These may change if technologies such as loafing or ensiling (wet storage) methods are proved to be infeasible for large-scale collection systems. 3abioenergy 0abiomass collection systems 0abiomass transportation systems1 aSokhansanj, S.1 aFlynn, P.C.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2006 Spring, v. 129-132 p.71-87x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20070806b20070902c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/12/04  aOther US 7aarticle02149naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001900127245009600146300001600242500013200258520112600390650001501516650001801531650001801549650002401567650002001591700001901611700001701630773009601647852000901743930003301752945002501785946001301810655001201823IND4385206520221121041246.0061114e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438520652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In previous work with cellulase, artificial chaperones were integrated into the foam fractionation process in order to reduce the loss of enzymatic activity. In this study, other factors were introduced to further reduce the loss of cellulase activity: type of cyclodextrin, cyclodextrin concentration, dilution ratio cyclodextrin to the foamate and holding time. alpha-Cyclodextrin was almost as effective as beta-cyclodextrin in refolding the foamed cellulase-Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide mixture. beta-Cyclodextrin (6.5 mM) was almost as effective as 13 mM beta-cyclodextrin in refolding. The dilution ratio, seven parts foamate and three parts beta-cyclodextrin solution, was found to be most effective among the three ratios tested (7:3, 1:1, and 3:7). The activity after refolding at this dilution ratio is around 0.14 unit/mL The refolding time study showed that the refolding process was found to be most effective for the short refolding times (within 1 h). 3acellulases 3acyclodextrins 3afractionation 3aprotein degradation 3aprotein folding1 aProkop, Aleš.1 aTanner, R.D.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2006 Spring, v. 129-132 p.247-255x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20070806b20070902c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/12/04  aOther US 7aarticle01996naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001300136245010700149300001800256520113100274650001301405650002801418650002001446650002601466700001901492700001901511773009601530852000901626930003301635945001301668946001301681655001201694IND2057256720221121041237.0970522e199702  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205725672DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Y.10aIGF-binding protein-2 is induced during development of urinary bladder hypertrophy in the diabetic rat  ap. E297-E303.  aBecause the locally produced insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBP) may influence bladder hypertrophy, either directly or by their interaction with insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), we studied the IGF system during the development of urinary bladder hypertrophy in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Messenger RNA for IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-4 was determined by solution hybridization. The bladder wet weight was elevated after 7 days. DNA synthesis was increased and peaked at 2 days, whereas DNA content per bladder wet weight was decreased by 7 days. The IGF-I mRNA did not change during the first 7 days and then decreased, and IGFBP-4 mRNA was increased transiently on day 7. On the other hand, IGFBP-2 mRNA was significantly increased after 1 day (2-fold), peaked by 7 days (6.4-fold), and then declined to approximately 50% above control at the end of experiment. This was associated with an increased IGFBP-2 protein content. Our results suggest that both stretching of the bladder due to diuresis and the diabetic state contribute to changes of the IGF system in the hypertrophying bladder. 3amedicine 3ahuman health and safety 3ahuman nutrition 3adiet-related diseases1 aGustafsson, B.1 aArnqvist, H.J.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1997 Feb., v. 272, no. 2:pt.1 p.E297-E303x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02963naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245009100147300001800238500001500256520140700271650002401678650001901702650001001721650002301731650001801754650001501772650001101787650002201798650001501820650002201835650001601857650001601873650001501889650003601904650001201940650002601952650001601978650001101994650002302005650002002028650001602048650000902064653001602073653001702089653001902106700001702125700001802142700001602160700001502176700001702191773008502208852000902293930003302302945001302335946001302348655001202361IND2323186920221120162642.0010921e200107  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232318692DNAL7 a115019002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaughey, S.A.10aDetermination of clenbuterol residues in bovine urine by optical immunobiosensor assay  ap. 1025-1030.  a2019-12-05  aClenbuterol (CBL) is an orally active beta2-adrenoceptor agonist which has been used in veterinary medicine as a broncodilator and an agent of uterine relaxation. It has however become better known as a drug used illegally to promote growth in farm animals. A rapid and sensitive biosensor assay was developed to detect CBL residues in bovine urine. The method involved a simple extraction procedure using tert-butyl methyl ether followed by analysis on the biosensor with results obtained against a buffer calibration curve. The assay allowed up to 88 samples to be analyzed per working day, with each cycle on the biosensor taking approximately 7 min to complete. The limit of detection (LOD) was determined as 0.27 ng/mL using 20 EU reference blank urine samples. The intra-assay S(r) ranged from 4.7-7.6% for 3 control samples while the interassay S(r) ranged from 9.2-12.7%. The recovery was found to be approximately 95%. A series of incurred urine samples were assayed and the results compared by Enzyme immunoassay (EIA), radio-immunoassay (RIA), and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. Urine samples taken from local abattoirs were also analyzed by the biosensor method and by EIA analysis. The antibody used in the biosensor test exhibited high cross reactivity with at least 7 other beta-agonists allowing detection of these compounds at less than 1 ng/mL in bovine urine. 3aenzyme immunoassays 3across reaction 3aurine 3agas chromatography 3adrug residues 3aantibodies 3acattle 3aradioimmunoassays 3aextraction 3amass spectrometry 3aclenbuterol 3aethyl ether 3abiosensors 2aAdrenergic beta-Agonistsxurine 2aAnimals 2aBiosensing Techniques 2aCalibration 2aCattle 2aClenbuterolxurine 2aCross Reactions 2aImmunoassay 2aMice 0acomparisons 0aimmunoassays 0aurine analysis1 aBaxter, G.A.1 aElliott, C.T.1 aPersson, B.1 aJonson, C.1 aBjurling, P.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2001 , v. 84, no. 4 p.1025-1030x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02743naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001900136245008400155300001800239500002400257520149500281650001401776650001401790650002901804650001301833650001301846650001901859650002201878650001901900650001301919650002101932650001401953650001901967650001401986650001302000650002002013650001202033650001302045650001102058650001402069651001202083700001902095773011102114852000902225856003902234655001202273IND4413796820221120162551.0081212e20081230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441379682DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.71212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMast, M.

Burned and unburned drainages were monitored from December 2003 through August 2007 for streamflow, major constituents, nutrients, and suspended sediment following the fires. Stream-water nitrate concentrations showed the greatest response to fire, increasing up to tenfold above those in the unburned drainage just prior to the first post-fire snowmelt season. Concentrations in winter base flow remained elevated during the entire study period, whereas concentrations during the growing season returned to background levels after two snowmelt seasons. Annual export of total nitrogen from the burned drainage ranged from 1·53 to 3·23 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ compared with 1·01 to 1·39 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ from the unburned drainage and exceeded atmospheric inputs for the first two post-fire water years. Fire appeared to have minimal long-term effects on other nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, and major constituents with the exception of sulfate and chloride, which showed increased concentrations for 2 years following the fire. There was little evidence that fire affected suspended-sediment concentrations in the burned drainage. Sediment yields in subalpine streams may be less affected by fire than in lower elevation streams because of the slow release rate of water during spring snowmelt.

Our aim is to develop an engineered Escherichia coli system for heterologous production of paromamine. We have constructed a mutant of E. coli BL21 (DE3) by disrupting glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (pgi) of primary metabolic pathway to increase glucose-6-phosphate pool inside the host. Disruption was carried out by λ Red/ET recombination following the protocol mentioned in the kit. Recombinants bearing 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose (DOI), DOS and paromamine producing genes were constructed from butirosin gene cluster and heterologously expressed in engineered host designed as E. coli BL21 (DE3) Δpgi. Secondary metabolites produced by the recombinants fermentated in 2YTG medium were extracted, and analysis of the extracts showed there is formation of DOI, DOS and paromamine. Escherichia coli system is engineered for heterologous expression of paromamine derivatives of aminoglycoside biosynthesis. This is the first report of heterologous expression of paromamine gene set in E. coli. Hence a new platform is established in E. coli system for the production of paromamine which is useful for the exploration of novel aminoglycosides by combinatorial biosynthesis of 4,5- and 4,6-disubtituted route of DOS-containing aminoglycosides. 3aEscherichia coli 3aaminoglycosides 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3aglucose-6-phosphate isomerase 3aheterologous gene expression 3amultigene family 3amutants 3asecondary metabolites 2aAminoglycosidesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aBacillusxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aGlucose-6-Phosphate Isomerasexgenetics 2aHexosaminesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aInositolxanalogs & derivativesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aMultigene Family 2aProtein Engineering 0a2-deoxystreptamine 0aheterologous expression 0ametabolic engineering 0aparomamine1 aLiou, K.1 aSohng, J.K.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2010 May, v. 108, no. 5 p.1780-1788dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04582.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100409b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02563naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245009500166300001600261500002400277520153700301650002301838650001201861650002001873650001701893650001101910650001201921650001301933650001101946650002201957650001201979700002401991700002002015773010902035852000902144856004802153655001202201IND4403711920221120152312.0080328e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440371192DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-007-9307-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Mark P.10aDispersal mode and assessments of recovery on the shores of Gruinard, the 'anthrax island'  ap. 721-732.  aIncludes references  aFormaldehyde run-off was an unintended impact of the anthrax decontamination procedure on the island of Gruinard. The death of intertidal organisms was observed where formaldehyde reached the shore during 1986. The extent to which shores on Gruinard have recovered was assessed with survey work in 2000. Recovery estimates were based on the hypothesis that the process of recolonization is partly dependent on species' dispersal capability. Underdevelopment of the assemblage of species lacking planktonic dispersal stages (direct developers) is therefore evidence that the process of recolonization is ongoing, rather than complete. A novel multivariate test showed that, when comparing quadrats from Gruinard and nearby mainland shores, assemblages of direct developing molluscs were significantly more distinct than assemblages of molluscs with planktonic dispersal stages. The average densities of species with direct development were generally lower on Gruinard than on mainland shores. While some species with direct development have similar densities on Gruinard and on the surrounding shores, the recovery of the overall assemblage was still incomplete after 14 years. In contrast, the harvested species, Littorina littorea, appeared to benefit from the absence of humans visiting Gruinard's shores. Populations of L. littorea on Gruinard contained significantly higher proportions of large individuals. Depending on the dispersal capabilities of different species, Gruinard is either still in recovery or acts as a reserve. 3aLittorina littorea 3aanthrax 3adecontamination 3aformaldehyde 3ahumans 3aislands 3amolluscs 3arunoff 3aspecies dispersal 3asurveys1 aPye, S.q(Sankurie)1 aAllcock, Louise0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2008 Apr., v. 17, no. 4 p.721-732dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-007-9307-y 7aarticle03415naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159100001700176245011300193300001800306520208100324650001602405650001902421650002302440650001602463650002102479650001402500650001202514650001102526650003502537650003102572650001602603650001202619650002102631650001702652650002802669650002402697773007602721852000902797856008002806930003302886945002502919946001302944655001202957IND4373921620221120152158.0050901e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437392162DNAL7 a162065702pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.9.14702doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSiopes, T.D.10aSpontaneous recovery of photosensitivity by turkey breeder hens given prolonged exposure to long day lengths  ap. 1470-1476.  aThree experiments were done to examine spontaneous photosensitivity (SP) and the associated renewal of egg production in Large White turkey breeder hens. In experiment 1, hens were photostimulated with 16 h of light:8 h of dark in December for 54 wk. In experiment 2, SP was examined in a different season than experiment 1. One group of hens was recycled and then photostimulated with 16 h of light:8 h of dark for 23wk. Another group of hens was not recycled and received 16 h of light:8 h of dark throughout the experiment. Egg production was used to assess SP in both experiments 1 and 2. Experiment 3 was designed to produce SP and renewed egg production during prolonged exposure (64 wk) to constant, long day lengths and to evaluate circulating thyroid hormones immediately prior to the renewal of egg production. Egg production was recorded daily to assess SP, and blood samples were taken weekly for radioimmunoassay for thyroid hormones. In both experiments 1 and 2, there was SP and renewed egg production, and this occurred in the fall season. Egg production increased gradually from less than 5% to a peak of 67% (experiment 1) and 38% (experiment 2) in November. In experiment 3, SP occurred in the fall, and egg production increased gradually and was similar to control hens from 8 wk of lay to the end of the experiment. Both groups also had similar declines in egg production following a decrease in photoperiod at wk 24 of the experiment. In the 8-wk period preceding the onset of laying, there were no significant differences between control and SP hens in plasma thyroid hormone levels. In both groups, there was a significant time effect for plasma triiodothyronine, expressed as a parabolic pattern of change. It was concluded that for turkey hens maintained in prolonged and constant long day lengths that SP and renewal of egg production occurs in the fall season. This response was independent of season of photostimulation, did not alter photoresponsiveness to shorten day lengths, and was preceded by a parabolic increase in plasma triiodothyronine. 3aturkey hens 3aphotoperiodism 3alaying performance 3aphotoperiod 3atriiodothyronine 3aovulation 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aOvipositionxradiation effects 2aOvumxgrowth & development 2aPhotoperiod 2aSeasons 2aThyroxinexblood 2aTime Factors 2aTriiodothyroninexblood 2aTurkeysxphysiology0 tPoultry science.g2005 Sept., v. 84, no. 9 p.1470-1476x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.9.14703Available from publisher's Web site  a20051025b20051102c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/09/14  aOther US 7aarticle02304naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001500136245011500151300001800266520143700284650002001721650002601741700002001767700001501787700001901802700001701821773009601838852000901934930003301943945001301976946001301989655001202002IND2057255520221120131658.0970522e199702  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205725552DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangan, P.10aRegulation of colonic H-K-ATPase in large intestine and kidney by dietary Na depletion and dietary K depletion  ap. C685-C696.  aActive K absorption in the rat distal colon is energized by an apical membrane H-K-ATPase, whereas K absorption in the distal collecting duct is generally believed to be modulated by a related renal H-K-ATPase. Experiments were performed to establish the mechanism(s) by which dietary Na depletion (with resulting elevated aldosterone levels) and K depletion stimulate K absorption. A colonic H-K-ATPase-specific cDNA probe and a polyclonal antibody were utilized to measure mRNA (Northern blot analyses) and protein (Western blot and immunofluorescence studies) abundance in the distal and proximal colon and renal collecting ducts and cortex of dietary Na- and K-depleted rats. Dietary Na depletion, but not K depletion, upregulated H-K-ATPase-specific mRNA and protein expression in the distal and proximal colon; Na depletion also stimulated H-K-ATPase activity in the distal colon. In contrast to the distal colon, H-K-ATPase-specific protein level in the outer medulla was enhanced by dietary K depletion, but not by Na depletion. This study establishes that 1) dietary Na depletion stimulates colonic H-K-ATPase activity most likely by a transcriptional process and 2) the regulation of colonic H-K-ATPase expression by dietary Na depletion and dietary K depletion is not identical in the large intestine and differs in the kidney from the colon, suggesting the presence of two (or more) H-K-ATPase isoforms in the rat colon. 3ahuman nutrition 3adiet-related diseases1 aRajendran, V.M.1 aMann, A.S.1 aKashgarian, M.1 aBinder, H.J.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1997 Feb., v. 272, no. 2:pt.1 p.C685-C696x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle04217naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245016700166300001600333520268100349650001903030650001303049650001503062650002503077650001503102650001003117650001103127650001103138650002303149650001403172650001103186650002003197650001603217650001303233650001103246651001103257651002503268653001603293653001403309653001503323653002103338700002503359700001903384700002303403700001703426773010603443852000903549856008503558930003303643946001103676655001203687IND4436719920221120121429.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443671992DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-009-9927-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyer, Claudine 10aImpacts of environmental changes on the hydrology and sedimentary processes at the confluence of St. Lawrence tributaries: potential effects on fluvial ecosystems  ap. 163-183.  aThis study examines the effects of changes in St. Lawrence water levels and in hydrological regimes of two tributaries of the St. Lawrence, the Richelieu and Saint-François Rivers, on the sedimentary dynamics of their confluence in an historical context and in response to projected climate changes. Analysis of historical data indicates that alteration to St. Lawrence mean water levels and spring flood characteristics (duration, timing, and magnitude) have already impacted flow and sediment dynamics at tributary confluences. The major progradation of more than 1.5 km of the sedimentary front of the Saint-François delta into the shallow water of the fluvial Lake Saint-Pierre between 1859 and 2001 is associated with the combined effect of water level reduction in the lake, as a consequence of dredging of the navigation channel, and discharge regulation. High tributary discharges during periods of low water levels in the St. Lawrence have also contributed to accelerated delta front progression. Increases in temperature and changes in the precipitation regime projected for the current century were used into the HSAMI model to obtain hydrological simulations for the tributaries. Results indicate that the greatest hydrological changes will be observed during the winter and spring seasons, a time that is critical for many ecosystems. The mean spring discharge is projected to decrease by 17% for the Richelieu and 40% for the Saint-François by the end of the century. During this season, the frequency of discharge higher than the sediment transport threshold will decrease by 63% for the Saint-François and by 17% for Richelieu when compared to the reference period. However, during winter, the frequency of these high discharges will be four times higher for both rivers. These changes are expected to occur simultaneously with a decrease of the St. Lawrence water levels, a situation that will have significant impacts on sedimentary processes. A hydro-sedimentological modeling approach based on SEDROUT was used to investigate the morphological response of the river beds to the projected changes on the hydrology of St. Lawrence tributaries and to three base level scenarios. Results show that the combined hydrology and base level effects will lead to an increase in sediment supply compared to the current state, and to the extension of accumulation zones. While the effects will vary among the tributaries according to their particular characteristics, the projected increase in sediment supply will modify the extent of freshwater wetlands at the mouth of the St. Lawrence tributaries with feedback effects on local flow and sediment distributions. 3aclimate change 3adredging 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3afreshwater 3alakes 3amodels 3arivers 3asediment transport 3asediments 3aspring 3astream channels 3atemperature 3awetlands 3awinter 3aQuebec 3aSaint Lawrence River 0aSt.Lawrence 0aTributary 0aConfluence 0aRiver adjustment1 aVerhaar, Patrick M. 1 aRoy, André G.1 aBiron, Pascale M. 1 aMorin, Jean 0 tHydrobiologia.g2010 June, v. 647, no. 1 p.163-183dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9927-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03061naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158100002000175245008500195300001800280520199900298650002002297650002702317650002902344650001902373650001802392700001602410700001902426700001702445773007602462852000902538856008102547930003302628945002502661946001302686655001202699IND4375944620221120121433.0051110e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437594462DNAL7 a10.1093/ps/84.11.16982doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aChowdhury, S.R.10aEffects of feed-borne Fusarium mycotoxins on hematology and immunology of turkey  ap. 1698-1706.  aFeeding grains naturally-contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins has been shown to alter the metabolism and performance of turkeys. The objectives of the current experiment were to examine the effects of feeding turkeys with grains naturally contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins on their hematology and immunological indices (including functions), and the possible protective effect of feeding a polymeric glucomannan mycotoxin adsorbent (GMA). Two hundred twenty-five 1-d-old male turkey poults were fed corn, wheat, and soybean meal-based starter (0 to 3 wk), grower (4 to 6 wk), developer (7 to 9 wk), and finisher (10 to 12 wk) diets formulated with uncontaminated grains, contaminated grains, or contaminated grains with 0.2% GMA. The chronic consumption of Fusarium mycotoxins caused minor and transient changes in hematocrit (0.33 L/L) and hemoglobin (106 g/L) concentrations as well as in blood basophil (0.13 x 10(9)/L) and monocyte counts (3.42 x 10(9)/L) compared with controls. Supplementation of the contaminated diet with GMA prevented these effects on blood cell counts. Biliary IgA concentrations were significantly increased (4.45-fold) when birds were fed contaminated grains compared with controls, but serum IgA concentrations were not affected. Contact hypersensitivity to dinitrochlorobenzene, which is a CD8(+) T-cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity response, was decreased (48%) by feed-borne mycotoxins compared with the control. By contrast, the primary and secondary antibody response to sheep red blood cells, a CD4(+) T-cell-mediated response, was not affected. It was concluded that chronic consumption of grains naturally contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins exerts only minor adverse effects on the hematology and some immunological indices of turkeys. Consumption of grains naturally contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins may, however, increase the susceptibility of turkeys to infectious agents against which CD8(+) T cells play a major role in defense. 3aleukocyte count 3acell-mediated immunity 3adelayed hypersensitivity 3atrichothecenes 3amycotoxicosis1 aSmith, T.K.1 aBoermans, H.J.1 aWoodward, B.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Nov., v. 84, no. 11 p.1698-1706x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.11.16983Available from publisher's Web site  a20051222b20060102c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/11/16  aOther US 7aarticle03469naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001600211245016500227300001800392500001500410520170600425650001702131650001702148650003602165650001602201650002302217650002202240650001602262650001202278650001602290650003502306650002802341650000902369650003702378650002002415650000902435650001202444650003402456650002102490650002202511651001302533653002102546700001502567700001402582700002002596700001402616773007602630852000902706856008102715930003302796945002502829946001302854655001202867IND4375947220221120111418.0051110e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437594722DNAL7 a164639682pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.11.17162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The average maximum and minimum temperatures recorded were 39 and 32 degrees C, respectively. An average relative humidity was 58.2% during the experimental period. Three levels of dietary Na(+) (0.20, 0.25, and 0.30%) and Cl(-) (0.30, 0.40, and 0.50%) were used in 3 x 3 factorial arrangement while maintaining a dietary electrolyte balance (DEB) of 250 mEq/kg. Higher weight gain (P < 0.002) and maximum water consumption (P < 0.05) were observed for birds fed diets containing 0.25 and 0.30% Na(+), respectively. Litter moisture was significantly higher (P < 0.05) for birds fed diets containing 0.25% Na(+) and 0.40 and 0.50% Cl(-). High dietary Na(+) (0.30%) tended to increase breast yield (P < 0.003) and decreased abdominal fat (P < 0.001). There was no effect of Na(+) on blood pH or serum HCO3(-). Diets containing 0.40% Cl(-) increased the dressing percentage (P < 0.001) and leg yield (P < 0.001) and decreased serum HCO3(-) (P < 0.001). There was no effect of dietary Cl(-) on blood pH, feed intake, weight gain, feed:gain, water intake, water:feed intake, or mortality. Significant dietary effect of Na(+) x Cl(-) was noted only for litter moisture (P < 0.001), dressing percentage (P < 0.05), breast (P < 0.05) and leg (P < 0.001) yields, abdominal fat (P < 0.002), and serum HCO3(-) (P < 0.001). Birds fed diet containing 0.25% Na(+) and 0.30% Cl(-) performed as well as those fed other diets when the cyclic temperature ranged from 32 to 39 degrees C. 3aelectrolytes 3abicarbonates 3adietary cation anion difference 3aheat stress 3aanimal performance 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aChloridesxpharmacology 2aDiet 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHot Temperature 2aMale 2aSeasons 2aSodium, Dietaryxpharmacology 2aTropical Climate 2aWaterxmetabolism 3aPakistan 0afeed formulation1 aSarwar, M.1 aNawaz, H.1 aAslam Mirza, M.1 aAhmad, T.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Nov., v. 84, no. 11 p.1716-1722x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.11.17163Available from publisher's Web site  a20051222b20060102c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/11/17  aOther US 7aarticle03197naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001500211245013900226300001800365520167900383650002402062650001802086650002002104650002302124650001902147650001602166650001202182650004202194650000902236650002402245650003702269650002402306650001102330650006502341650002802406700001602434700001602450773007602466852000902542856008102551930003302632945002502665946001302690655001202703IND4375269320221120111331.0051018e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437526932DNAL7 a163351212pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.10.15332doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHebert, K.10aEffect of dietary folic acid supplementation on egg folate content and the performance and folate status of two strains of laying hens  ap. 1533-1538.  aEnrichment of eggs with folate is possible when dietary folic acid levels are increased. However, development of optimal strategies for the production of folate-enriched eggs requires knowledge as to differences due to strain of bird and a greater understanding of the factors limiting egg folate deposition. To this end, a study was designed to determine the response of two leghorn strains that differ in production performance. Hyline W36 and W98 hens (n = 6 per diet) received a barley-based ration containing 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 mg/kg of crystalline folic acid for 21 d. Response criteria included production parameters, measures of blood folate status, and egg folate content. Significant (P < 0.05) main effects of folate supplementation were observed for egg folate content and plasma folate, which increased, and homocysteine concentrations, which decreased with supplementation; performance, however, was not affected. The Hyline W98 strain had significantly (P < 0.05) higher total egg and yolk weights and feed consumption when compared with the W36. Significant (P < 0.05) ration x strain interactions were observed for egg and yolk weight, egg folate content, and plasma homocysteine. The higher egg mass producing strain, Hyline W98, benefited from increased folic acid through a reduction in plasma homocysteine concentrations, suggesting that this strain has a higher requirement for folate than the W36 strain. Overall, egg folate content is maximized when crystalline folic acid is supplemented to the diet at 2 mg/kg or higher. Higher levels of egg folate are not achieved due to the saturation of the precursor pool for egg folate deposition. 3avitamin supplements 3adose response 3aegg composition 3astrain differences 3afeed additives 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aChickensxclassificationxphysiology. 2aDiet 2aDietary Supplements 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEgg Yolkxchemistry 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosagexanalysisxpharmacology. 2aOvipositionxphysiology1 aHouse, J.D.1 aGuenter, W.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Oct., v. 84, no. 10 p.1533-1538x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.10.15333Available from publisher's Web site  a20051114b20051202c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/10/24  aOther US 7aarticle02421naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245009800133300001500231520134500246650001901591650002401610650001801634650002601652650001701678650001001695650001501705650001601720650001801736650001001754650001801764700003301782700002601815700002001841700001901861700002101880773006701901852000901968939003301977946001302010655001202023IND4479493320221120101534.0140418s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447949332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIturritxa, Eugenia10aEffect of alternative disinfection treatments against fungal canker in seeds of Pinus radiata  ap. 88-110.  aSeeds and seedlings of Pinus radiata may be seriously damaged by the canker fungi Diplodia pinea and Fusarium circinatum. This study evaluated alternative seed disinfection treatments against these canker fungi. Experiments were conducted to determine both inhibitory and fungicide effects on colony growth of D. pinea and F. circinatum. Treatments included 24 chemicals at four doses of 1, 10, 100 and 1000 μg mL−1, eight essential oils at five dilutions of 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100% v/v, two antagonistic organisms, Trichoderma harzianum and Trichoderma harzianum, from Basque Country plantations, and four thermotherapy treatments of 55 °C for 8, 9, 10 and 11 hours in vitro. Fungicide and fungistatic effects on inhibition of fungal colony growth were evaluated and phytotoxicity of treatments on P. radi ata seeds analyzed. Fusarium circinatum and D. pinea responded in similar ways to the tested treatments, although D. pinea was often inhibited at lower doses of chemical fungicides and higher doses of essential oils. Thermotherapy and Trichoderma treatments showed greater effectiveness against the D. pinea strain than the F. circinatum strain. Germination of P. radiata seeds was highly affected by essential oils application, causing a strong inhibitory effect (≥ 92.25% germination inhibition) with most of the tested oils. 3aDiplodia pinea 3aFusarium circinatum 3aPinus radiata 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3adisinfection 3afungi 3afungicides 3agermination 3aphytotoxicity 3aseeds 3athermotherapy1 aDesprez-Loustau, Marie Laure1 aGarcia-Serna, Ignacio1 aQuintana, Eneka1 aMesanza, Nebai1 aAitken, Jennifer0 tSeed technology.g2011, v. 33, no. 2 p.88-110x1096-07247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b00000000c20140418  aOther US 7aarticle02922naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002700171245006500198300001800263520135900281650001401640650001101654650000901665650002401674650002201698650002001720650002401740650002101764650001601785650001401801650002001815650002301835650002201858650002501880650002001905650002301925650002301948653002401971653002601995653000802021653003202029653002002061653001802081700003102099773011702130852000902247856009202256930003302348946001102381655001202392IND4437300820221120042849.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443730082DNAL7 a204655812pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04641.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThibert-Plante, Xavier10aWhen can ecological speciation be detected with neutral loci  ap. 2301-2314.  aIt is not yet clear under what conditions empirical studies can reliably detect progress toward ecological speciation through the analysis of allelic variation at neutral loci. We use a simulation approach to investigate the range of parameter space under which such detection is, and is not, likely. We specifically test for the conditions under which divergent natural selection can cause a 'generalized barrier to gene flow' that is present across the genome. Our individual-based numerical simulations focus on how population divergence at neutral loci varies in relation to recombination rate with a selected locus, divergent selection on that locus, migration rate and population size. We specifically test whether genetic differences at neutral markers are greater between populations in different environments than between populations in similar environments. We find that this expected signature of ecological speciation can be detected under part of the parameter space, most consistently when divergent selection is strong and migration is intermediate. By contrast, the expected signature of ecological speciation is not reliably detected when divergent selection is weak or migration is low or high. These findings provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of using neutral markers to infer ecological speciation in natural systems. 3agene flow 3agenome 3aloci 3amathematical models 3anatural selection 3apopulation size 2aComputer Simulation 2aEcologyxmethods 2aEnvironment 2aGene Flow 2aGenetic Fitness 2aGenetic Speciation 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aModels, Genetic 2aPopulation Density 2aSelection, Genetic 0adivergent selection 0aecological speciation 0aFST 0aindividual-based simulation 0aneutral markers 0aporous genome1 aHendry, A.

Comparative studies between full-length and truncated mutant molecules included initial rate kinetics, fluorescence and CD spectrometric properties, substrate binding and hydrolysis abilities, thermostability, and thermodenaturation kinetics. Kinetic analyses revealed that the overall catalytic efficiency, kcat/Km, was slightly increased for the truncated enzymes toward the soluble 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-N'-diacetyl chitobiose or 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-N"-N[triple prime]-triacetyl chitotriose or insoluble α-chitin substrate. By contrast, changes to substrate affinity, Km, and turnover rate, kcat, varied considerably for both types of chitin substrates between the full-length and truncated enzymes. Both truncated enzymes exhibited significantly higher thermostabilities than the full-length enzyme. The truncated mutants retained similar substrate-binding specificities and abilities against the insoluble substrate but only had approximately 75% of the hydrolyzing efficiency of the full-length chitinase molecule. Fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that both C-terminal deletion mutants retained an active folding conformation similar to the full-length enzyme. However, a CD melting unfolding study was able to distinguish between the full-length and truncated mutant molecules by the two phases of apparent transition temperatures in the mutants. These results indicate that up to 145 amino acid residues, including the putative C-terminal chitin-binding region and the fibronectin (III) motif of B. licheniformis chitinase, could be removed without causing a seriously aberrant change in structure and a dramatic decrease in insoluble chitin hydrolysis. The results of the present study provide evidence demonstrating that the binding and hydrolyzing of insoluble chitin substrate for B. licheniformis chitinase was not dependent solely on the putative C-terminal chitin-binding region and the fibronectin (III) motif. 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aamino acids 3acatalytic activity 3achitin 3achitinase 3afibronectins 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahydrolysis 3amelting 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aLin, Hsu-Yang1 aLin, Fu-Pang0 tFEBS journal.g2008 May, v. 275, no. 9 p.2240-2254dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06376.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04151naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007200092040001800164100001700182245010900199300001600308520285800324650001303182650001403195650001903209650002703228650002003255650001803275650001903293653001403312700001503326700001603341700001503357700001603372700001703388773012303405852000903528856012203537930003303659945001303692946001303705990002303718655001203741IND2051687920221120043017.0960613e199606  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205168792DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199606)228:3<287::AID-JMOR2>3.0.CO;2-#2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDennis, J.E.10aMicrostructure of matrix and mineral components of eggshells from White Leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus)  ap. 287-306.  aThe avian eggshell is a composite structure of organic matrix and mineral (calcium carbonate) that is rapidly and sequentially fabricated in the oviduct in < 24 hr. The eggshell is an excellent vehicle for the study of biomineralization processes and the role of the organic matrix in the mineral-matrix composite. The organic matrix components of eggshells from White Leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus) were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and optical microscopy. The mineral phase was analyzed by TEM, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray compositional microanalysis, and electron diffraction. Ultrastructural examination of the matrices within the calcified eggshell reveals a complex architecture that differs within each of the major zones of the eggshell: the shell membranes, the mammillary zone, the palisade region, and the cuticle. The mammillary layer consists of the calcium reserve assembly (CRA) and crown region, each with a unique substructure. TEM images show that the matrix of the CRA consists of a dense, flocculent material partially embedded within the outer shell membrane (a mostly noncalcified region of the shell). The mantle of the collagen fibers of the shell membranes is rich in polyanions (cuprolinic blue-positive), as is the CRA matrix. The CRA is capped by a centrally located calcium reserve body sac (CRB sac) that contains numerous 300-400 nm, electron-dense, spherical vesicles. Directly above the CRB sac is a zone of matrix consisting of stacks of interconnected vesicles (similar in morphology to CRA vesicles) that are interspersed with a granular material. The palisade region, the largest of the mineralized zones, contains hollow vesicles approximately 450 nm (s.d. = 75 nm) in diameter, with a crescent-shaped, electron-dense fringe. An interconnecting matrix material is also found between the vesicles in the palisades region. The cuticle is composed of two layers, a mineralized inner layer and an outer layer consisting of only organic matrix. The bulk of the mineral within the eggshell is calcite, with small amounts of needlelike hydroxyapatite in the inner cuticle and occasionally, vaterite micro crystals found at the base of the palisade (cone) region. The well-crystallized calcite crystals within the palisade are columnar, typically approximately 20 micrometer wide by 100-200 micrometer long; aside from numerous entrapped vesicles and occasional dislocations, they are relatively defect-free. The bulk of the matrix found in the palisade and crown regions are thought to be residual components of the rapid mineralization process. The unique matrix structure within the CRB corresponds to the region of preferentially solubilized calcite used by the developing embryo and the hydroxyapatite found in the inner cuticle may play a role in the cessation of mineral growth. 3achickens 3aegg shell 3aultrastructure 3aanatomy and morphology 3amineral content 3acalcification 3ahistochemistry 0astructure1 aXiao, S.Q.1 aAgarwal, M.1 aFink, D.J.1 aHeuer, A.H.1 aCaplan, A.I.0 tJournal of morphology.g1996 June, v. 228, no. 3 p.287-306aJournal of morphology (Philadelphia, Pa.)x0362-25257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199606)228:3<287::AID-JMOR2>3.0.CO;2-#3Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02780naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245008800176300001800264520168900282650001501971650001401986650001402000650001402014650002002028650001102048650001302059650002102072650002902093700001802122700002202140773011102162852000902273856009202282930003302374946001102407655001202418IND4404904720221120035239.0080425e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440490472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06373.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudhakar, Cherukuri10aSp1-like sequences mediate human caspase-3 promoter activation by p73 and cisplatin  ap. 2200-2213.  aCaspase-3 is a cysteine protease that plays a central role in the execution of apoptosis induced by a wide variety of stimuli. However, little is known about the mechanisms involved in the regulation of caspase-3 gene transcription. This study was carried out to characterize the human caspase-3 promoter and to understand the mechanisms involved in the induction of caspase-3 gene expression in response to the anticancer drug cisplatin and p73. Caspase-3 gene expression was induced by treatment of cells with cisplatin, which also induced p73 protein in HeLa and K562 cells. The human caspase-3 promoter was cloned and characterized. p73β strongly activated the caspase-3 promoter, whereas p73α showed less activation. Cisplatin treatment increased caspase-3 promoter activity. Basal and cisplatin-induced promoter activity was inhibited by the p73 inhibitor p73DD. Deletion analysis defined a minimal promoter of 120 base pairs, which showed good basal and p73β-induced activity. The examination of the minimal promoter sequence showed several putative Sp1 sites, but no p53/p73 site. The caspase-3 promoter was activated by Sp1 in Sp1-deficient Drosophila SL-2 cells. Sp1-induced promoter activity was further enhanced by p73β in SL-2 cells. Mutation of Sp1 sites in the minimal promoter resulted in a loss of basal and p73-induced promoter activity. These results show that caspase-3 gene transcription is induced by cisplatin, which is mediated partly by p73. We have identified p73 and Sp1 as activators of the caspase-3 promoter. Sp1-like sequences in the minimal promoter not only sustain basal promoter activity, but also mediate p73-induced activation of the promoter. 3aDrosophila 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acisplatin 3agene expression 3ahumans 3amutation 3apromoter regions 3atranscription (genetics)1 aJain, Nishant1 aSwarup, Ghanshyam0 tFEBS journal.g2008 May, v. 275, no. 9 p.2200-2213dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06373.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02145naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245005400142300001600196520139400212650003201606653002201638700001601660700001501676773009601691852000901787930003301796945002501829946001301854655001201867IND4372787420221120035359.0050728e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437278742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The three types of enzymes involved in this process are endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and beta-glucosidases. One of the best fungal cellulase producers is Trichoderma reesei RUT C30. However, the amount of beta-glucosidases secreted by this fungus is insufficient for effective cellulose conversion. We investigated the production of cellulases and beta-glucosidases in shake-flask cultures by applying three pH-controlling strategies: (1) the pH of the production medium was adjusted to 5.8 after the addition of seed culture with no additional pH adjustment performed, (2) the pH was adjusted to 6.0 daily, and (3) the pH was maintained at 6.0 by the addition of Tris-maleate buffer to the growth medium. Different carbon sources-Solka Floc 200, glucose, lactose, and sorbitol-were added to standard Mandels nutrients. The lowest beta-glucosidase activities were obtained when no pH adjustment was done regardless of the carbon source employed. Somewhat higher levels of beta-glucosidase were measured in the culture filtrates when daily pH adjustment was carried out. The effect of buffering the culture medium on beta-glucosidase liberation was most prominent when a carbon source inducing the production of other cellulases was applied. 3acellulolytic microorganisms 0aenzyme production1 aEgyhazi, A.1 aReczey, K.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2005 Spring, v. 121-124 p.243-254x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20060419b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/04/19  aOther US 7aarticle03564naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245013700173300001800310520170400328650001602032650002102048650001602069650001602085650002102101650002202122650001502144650002002159650002602179650001002205650001302215650001102228650002502239650002202264650001702286650002102303650003202324650002002356650000902376650001702385650002602402650001602428650001302444650002102457650001202478650003002490650001002520700002302530700002102553700001902574700002102593700002002614700001802634700001702652773011202669852000902781856009202790930003302882946001102915655001202926IND4404902320221120035150.0080425e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440490232DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06412.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamauchi, Shinya10aMolecular cloning and characterization of two soybean protein disulfide isomerases as molecular chaperones for seed storage proteins  ap. 2644-2658.  aProtein disulfide isomerase family proteins play important roles in the folding of nascent polypeptides and the formation of disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum. In this study, we cloned two similar protein disulfide isomerase family genes from soybean leaf (Glycine max L. Merrill. cv Jack). The cDNAs encode proteins of 525 and 551 amino acids, named GmPDIL-1 and GmPDIL-2, respectively. Recombinant versions of GmPDIL-1 and GmPDIL-2 expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited oxidative refolding activity for denatured RNaseA. Genomic sequences of both GmPDIL-1 and GmPDIL-2 were cloned and sequenced. The comparison of soybean genomic sequences with those of Arabidopsis, rice and wheat showed impressive conservation of exon-intron structure across plant species. The promoter sequences of GmPDIL-1 apparently contain a cis-acting regulatory element functionally linked to unfolded protein response. GmPDIL-1, but not GmPDIL-2, expression was induced under endoplasmic reticulum-stress conditions. GmPDIL-1 and GmPDIL-2 promoters contain some predicted regulatory motifs for seed-specific expression. Both proteins were ubiquitously expressed in soybean tissues, including cotyledon, and localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Data from coimmunoprecipitation experiments suggested that GmPDIL-1 and GmPDIL-2 associate with proglycinin, a precursor of the seed storage protein glycinin, and the α'-subunit of β-conglycinin, a seed storage protein found in cotyledon cells under conditions that disrupt the folding of glycinin or β-conglycinin, suggesting that GmPDIL-1 and GmPDIL-2 are involved in the proper folding or quality control of such storage proteins as molecular chaperones. 3aArabidopsis 3aEscherichia coli 3aGlycine max 3aamino acids 3abeta-conglycinin 3acomplementary DNA 3acotyledons 3adisulfide bonds 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agenes 3aglycinin 3aleaves 3amolecular chaperones 3amolecular cloning 3apolypeptides 3apromoter regions 3aprotein disulfide-isomerase 3aquality control 3arice 3aseed storage 3aseed storage proteins 3asoy protein 3asoybeans 3astorage proteins 3atissues 3aunfolded protein response 3awheat1 aWadahama, Hiroyuki1 aIwasaki, Kensuke1 aNakamoto, Yumi1 aNishizawa, Keito1 aIshimoto, Masao1 aKawada, Teruo1 aUrade, Reiko0 tFEBS journal.g2008 May, v. 275, no. 10 p.2644-2658dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06412.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03168naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024007100110040001800181100001300199245011800212300001400330520165600344650002302000650001602023650001202039650003702051650002502088650002102113650001102134650002502145650003202170650002802202650003502230650001302265650001002278650003302288650003002321650003102351700001802382773012102400852000902521856012102530930003302651945001302684946001302697655001202710IND2197280120221123042034.0990227e199810  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219728012DNAL7 a97685032pmid7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199810)238:1<71::AID-JMOR6>3.0.CO;2-Q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeng, S.10aCompressive loading on bone surfaces from muscular contraction: an in vivo study in the miniature pig, Sus scrofa  ap. 71-80.  aSeveral authors have speculated that muscles contracting adjacent to bony surfaces may cause compressive loads against the bone and thus influence skull development. This study was undertaken to evaluate the premise of this argument. A flat, semiconductor pressure transducer was surgically placed on bony surfaces beneath muscle attachments. Pressures were recorded during normal mastication (n = 7) and while overlying muscles were stimulated in anesthetized pigs (n = 15). The transducer was highly specific; no pressure was recorded in quiescent or passively stretched muscles or when other muscles were stimulated. Contraction of the overlying muscles exerted high normal loads on the bone, always exceeding systolic blood pressure (16 kPa). Temporal fossa pressure during mastication followed temporalis electromyographic (EMG) signals with a lag period approximating the twitch contraction time. When three different sites were compared in anesthetized animals, compressive load was highest on the temporal fossa (111.4 +/- 56.5 kPa, n = 15), intermediate on the mandibular angle (58.4 +/- 28.3 kPa, n = 4), and lowest on the medial side of the zygomatic arch (37.2 +/- 19.7 kPa, n = 15). Pressure amplitudes were not related to body size or relative muscle size. Muscle complexity and compartmental constraints did appear to influence pressure. Disruption of the external aponeurosis of the masseter decreased pressure on the mandibular angle by 45%, confirming the importance of tendinous constraint in determining pressure production. Thus, contracting muscles exert substantial but site-specific compressive loads on adjacent bone surfaces. 3amuscle contraction 3amastication 2aAnimals 2aCompressive Strengthxphysiology 2aElectric Stimulation 2aElectromyography 2aFemale 2aMandiblexphysiology 2aMasseter Musclexphysiology 2aMasticationxphysiology 2aMuscle Contractionxphysiology 2aPressure 2aSwine 2aSwine, Miniaturexphysiology 2aTemporal Bonexphysiology 2aWeight-Bearingxphysiology1 aHerring, S.W.0 tJournal of morphology.g1998 Oct., v. 238, no. 1 p.71-80aJournal of morphology (Philadelphia, Pa.)x0362-25257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199810)238:1<71::AID-JMOR6>3.0.CO;2-Q3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle04009naa a2200865 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180100001400197245014900211300001800360500001500378520138500393650002701778650002001805650002101825650001901846650001701865650002101882650001901903650001801922650002601940650001401966650001001980650001601990650002502006650000902031650002502040650002302065650001602088650002202104650002202126650003002148650001202178650002802190650003702218650002802255650005402283650003902337650002602376650003702402650002402439650003702463650003402500650000902534650004802543650004702591650006802638650003702706650000902743650003302752650000902785650002202794653001402816700001602830700001702846700001702863700001702880700001302897700001402910700002402924700001602948773008902964852000903053930003303062945002503095946001103120655001203131IND4366883620221123042212.0050201e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436688362DNAL7 a155009352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Treatment with the extract significantly decreased the number of larger ACF (with four or more crypts per focus) in the large intestine in the early stage, while the number of methylated DNA adducts was not decreased compared with that in the AOM-treated group. In the post-initiation stage, the extract significantly decreased the total number of ACF and the number of larger ACF, accompanied by a decrease in the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-labeling index and an increase in the induction of apoptotic cells in the colonic mucosa. The incidences of neoplasms, the numbers of adenocarcinomas in the small intestines and entire intestines, and sizes of neoplasms in the entire intestines in rats fed C. asiatica extract at a dose of 10 mg/kg were smaller than those in rats given AOM alone (p < 0.05). The extract at a dose of 100 mg/kg significantly reduced the multiplicity of neoplasms in the small intestine (p < 0.05). These results suggest that inhibition of the formation of AOM-induced ACF by C. asiatica extract is associated with modification of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in colonic crypts and that the extract has a chemopreventive effect on colon tumorigenesis. 3aantimutagenic activity 3achemoprevention 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aazoxymethane 3aoxidative stress 3acarcinogenesis 3adose response 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3acolon 3amutagenesis 3acolorectal neoplasms 3arats 3aantioxidant activity 3acell proliferation 3aDNA adducts 3aintestinal crypts 3aCentella asiatica 3aanticarcinogenic activity 2aAnimals 2aAnticarcinogenic Agents 2aAntimetabolitesxdiagnostic use. 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aAzoxymethanexantagonists & inhibitorsxtoxicity. 2aBromodeoxyuridinexdiagnostic use. 2aCarcinogensxtoxicity 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCentellaxchemistry 2aColonxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aDNA Methylationxdrug effects 2aDiet 2aGuaninexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aIntestinal Mucosaxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aIntestinal Neoplasmsxchemically inducedxprevention & control. 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344 0aneoplasms1 aKataoka, K.1 aArimochi, H.1 aNakayama, H.1 aKuwahara, T.1 aBando, Y1 aIzumi, K.1 aVinitketkumnuen, U.1 aOhnishi, Y.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2004 Dec., v. 42, no. 12 p.1987-1997x0278-69157nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/02/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03833naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180100001600197245008700213300001800300520174600318650001802064650002502082650002402107650002102131650002002152650000902172650002302181650002002204650001802224650001902242650001502261650002002276650001402296650001402310650001402324650003702338650003002375650002202405650001202427650002102439650002602460650002602486650002602512650000902538650002502547650001102572650002502583650000902608650002802617650002902645650005902674650000902733650002202742650002402764650002202788650003002810700001502840700001802855700001702873700001802890773008902908852000902997930003303006945002503039946001103064655001203075IND4366883320221123042152.0050201e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436688332DNAL7 a155009322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Control males and females (50 rats each) were maintained on basal diet. Animals were observed for 104 weeks. There were no treatment-related clinical signs of toxicity in the treated groups. Body weights, feed consumption, survival rates and hematological findings for exposed rats of both sexes showed no variations among the groups. There was a slight but significant dose-dependent decrease in relative spleen weights in all treated groups, albeit with no histopathological variation. Overall histopathological evaluation of neoplasms and all tissues after 2 years showed that tumors developed in all groups including the controls. There was a non-significant tendency for increase in the incidence of pituitary gland adenomas in the high dose-treated females (45.5%) as compared to controls (27.7%), with a slight increase in hemorrhage incidences, but values for males were low and similar in both control and treated rats. There were no apparent effects of isoquercitrin on development of kidney neoplasms, hyperplasias or chronic nephropathy. Parathyroid adenomas or hyperplasias were found not affected by isoquercitrin treatment, and there were no differences in mammary gland fibroadenomas or hyperplasias between treated and control rats. Various tumors were found in other organs with no significant differences between the groups. In conclusion, under the conditions of this 2-year feeding experiment, no evidence was obtained of carcinogenicity of enzymatically modified isoquercitrin in male or female F344 rats. 3aisoquercitrin 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzymatic treatment 3atoxicity testing 3acarcinogenicity 3arats 3aexperimental diets 3anutrient intake 3adose response 3ahistopathology 3ahematology 3ablood chemistry 3amortality 3amorbidity 3aneoplasms 3astructure-activity relationships 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3anatural additives 2aAnimals 2aBlood Cell Count 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aCarcinogenicity Tests 2aCarcinogensxtoxicity 2aDiet 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aGrowthxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aQuercetinxanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344 2aSex Characteristics 2aSurvival Analysis 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects1 aKaneko, M.1 aWanibuchi, H.1 aMorimura, K.1 aFukushima, S.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2004 Dec., v. 42, no. 12 p.1949-1969x0278-69157nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/02/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02485naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007100092040001800163100001900181245015000200300001400350500001500364520145700379650001001836650001201846653002701858773012101885852000902006856012102015930003302136945001302169946001302182655001202195IND2196271320221123042416.0990105e199807  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219627132DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199807)237:1<69::AID-JMOR6>3.0.CO;2-J2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopowics, T.E.10aOntogeny of postcanine tooth from the ferret, Mustela putorius (Carnivora: Mammalia), and the evolution of dental diversity within the Mustelidae  ap. 69-90.  a2019-12-04  aThis study describes dental development within the ferret, Mustela putorius, through study of the form of the carnassial teeth and the upper first molar at progressive growth stages. Primordial teeth were serially sectioned in sagittal and transverse planes and three-dimensional reconstructions of tooth primordia were generated using MacReco software. Regional growth of the crown and asynchronous maturation of the dental tissues were observed in each tooth. The upper carnassial blade develops early and the tooth increases in length rapidly. Lingual growth of the upper carnassial is less pronounced and the protocone and its surrounding region mature late. The lower carnassial blade develops early and the talonid is late to mature. Development of the upper first molar differs from carnassial development in the early emphasis upon transverse growth and reduced lengthwise expansion. The early development of the carnassial blades in the ferret is shared with other carnivores, and may reflect the functional significance of this feature. Later stages of tooth ontogeny differ among carnivoran taxa and the specialized morphology of ferret teeth results from an apparently truncated period of late tooth ontogeny. This suggests that carnivoran species may share a common path of early development that specifies the ontogeny of homologous tooth features and that in later stages developmental differences result in species-specific tooth forms. 3ateeth 3aferrets 0aanatomy and morphology0 tJournal of morphology.g1998 July, v. 237, no. 1 p.69-90aJournal of morphology (Philadelphia, Pa.)x0362-25257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199807)237:1<69::AID-JMOR6>3.0.CO;2-J3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle03012naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024007100110040001800181100001800199245017200217300001400389520144200403650001301845650002001858650001101878650001501889650001901904650001201923650002501935650001301960650002201973650002401995650001102019650005102030650001402081650003102095650002902126650004302155700001602198700001802214773012102232852000902353856012102362930003302483945001302516946001302529655001202542IND2200279820221123020355.0990824e199901  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220027982DNAL7 a99180982pmid7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199901)239:1<75::AID-JMOR5>3.0.CO;2-D2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElbrond, V.S.10aDifferences in epithelial morphology correlate to Na+ -transport: a study of the proximal, mid, and distal regions of the coprodeum from hens on high and low NaCl diet  ap. 75-86.  aA study was performed to correlate regional morphology and amiloride inhibitable Na+-transport in the coprodeal epithelium in hens, Gallus domesticus, on low-NaCl diet and in controls. Proximal (close to colon), mid and distal (close to urodeum) regions were examined using light microscopy, transmission- and scanning electron microscopy. Na+-transport was measured electrophysiologically in Ussing-chambers in the proximal and distal regions. The epithelium, simple and columnar, is composed of absorptive intestinal epithelial cells, goblet cells, brush cells, migrating lymphoid cells, and enteroendocrine cells. Brush cells, identified in avians for the first time, occur in highest number in the proximal part of the coprodeum in low-NaCl hens. Na+-transport is high in the low-NaCl hens, ranging from 347 microA/cm2 (proximal) to 187 microA/cm2 (distal). In control hens, which correspond to hens on high-NaCl diet, it is low in all regions (0-4 micro A/cm2). Absorptive intestinal epithelial cells as well as brush cells adapt to variations in transepithelial Na+-transport by regulating height and packing density of their microvilli, number, size, and localization of apical vesicles, and the width of the intercellular space. Regional differences in the epithelial cell composition and ultra-structure are closely correlated to transepithelial Na+-transport but only in low-NaCl hens, as controls do not show these variations. 3achickens 3asodium chloride 3asodium 3aepithelium 3aultrastructure 2aAnimals 2aBiological Transport 2aChickens 2aElectrophysiology 2aExtracellular Space 2aFemale 2aIntestinal Mucosaxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aLiposomes 2aMicrovillixultrastructure 2aSodiumxpharmacokinetics 2aSodium Chloride, Dietaryxpharmacology1 aDantzer, V.1 aSkadhauge, E.0 tJournal of morphology.g1999 Jan., v. 239, no. 1 p.75-86aJournal of morphology (Philadelphia, Pa.)x0362-25257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199901)239:1<75::AID-JMOR5>3.0.CO;2-D3Available from publisher's Web site  a19991003b19991007c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02617naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007100092040001800163100001700181245011400198300001400312520153700326650002901863650001001892650001001902650001901912653002001931700001501951700001501966773012101981852000902102856012102111930003302232945001302265946001302278655001202291IND2201763120221123020134.0991129e199904  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220176312DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199904)240:1<15::AID-JMOR2>3.0.CO;2-K2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngioy, A.M.10aFunctional morphology of the dorsal vessel in the adult fly Protophormia terraenovae (Diptera, Calliphoridae)  ap. 15-31.  aThe morphology and ultrastructure of the contractile tubular vessel acting as the cardiac pump in Protophormia terraenovae flies were analyzed by means of light microscopy, SEM and TEM. The results provide a novel anatomical picture of the two vessel portions, the abdominal heart and the aorta, and lay the foundations for an interpretation of the cardiocirculatory function in the fly. In the thorax, the thin and unchambered aorta is without apertures, while the abdominal heart presents a very small caudal aperture and pairs of lateral ostia, one in each of the five chambers of which it is composed. The ostia of the four more distal chambers are of the incurrent type, which is to say that they act as valves ensuring that hemolymph flows only into the heart. Conversely, the ostia in the most proximal chamber allow hemolymph to flow both into and out of the heart. The entire vessel is composed of a single layer of myofibers that are oriented circularly around the lumen in the abdominal heart and longitudinally in the thoracic aorta. The abdominal heart has a thicker wall, a far more diffused and thick distribution of tracheoles, and a far greater number of mitochondria with respect to the aorta. This arrangement ensures a greater availability of oxygen and energy in the abdominal heart compared to the aorta and leads one to suppose that the high- and low-frequency contractions of the cardiac cycle (Thon, [1982] J. Insect Physiol. 28:411-416) can be attributed to the abdominal heart and the aorta, respectively. 3aProtophormia terraenovae 3aheart 3aaorta 3aultrastructure 0aabdominal heart1 aBoassa, D.1 aDulcis, D.0 tJournal of morphology.g1999 Apr., v. 240, no. 1 p.15-31aJournal of morphology (Philadelphia, Pa.)x0362-25257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199904)240:1<15::AID-JMOR2>3.0.CO;2-K3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02921naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008400128300001600212500001500228520165600243650001501899650001901914650001401933650001801947650001301965650001901978650001201997650001302009650002102022650002002043650002202063650002502085650001802110650001802128650001102146650001502157653003102172653002102203653002502224653001402249700002002263773009002283852000902373930003302382945001302415946001102428655001202439IND2207513820221123003317.0001026s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220751382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElkonin, L.A.10aInfluence of nitrogen and phosphorus on induction embryogenic callus of sorghum  ap. 115-123.  a2019-12-05  aFragments of young panicles and immature embryos of different cultivars of grain sorghum were cultured on modified MS and N6 media supplemented with L-asparagine (6.7 mM), L-proline (17.4 mM) and different concentrations of NO3-, NH4+ and PO4(3-). The panicle-derived cultures were used in experiments with different nitrogen sources; the influence of PO4(3-) level was studied in embryo-derived and panicle-derived cultures. An increase of NO3- and NH+4 levels in the media with amino acids significantly increased induction and growth of embryogenic callus (EC) and its regeneration ability. A new M2 medium, which contained 62.5 mM NH4+ and 72.4 mM NO3-, exceeded other media which were previously effective for obtaining EC of sorghum. The level of NO3- and NO3-/NH4+ ratio in the media supplemented with L-asparagine and L-proline were established to be the critical factors of friable EC formation in sorghum. High level of NH4+ with low level of NO3- resulted in formation of compact EC, while increase of NO3- concentration (39.9-82.4 mM) in MS or N6 media favoured proliferation of friable EC in some genotypes. Formation of compact EC in the NH4(+)-rich media was accompanied by strong pigmentation of the medium, which was never observed in cultures with friable EC. An increase of the PO(4)3- level (up to 8.8-14.2 mM) was shown to increase the frequency of somatic embryogenesis by 3-4 times, the EC mass by 1.5-2.0 times and its regeneration ability. Media with increased nitrogen or phosphorus could be used for maintenance of sorghum EC for 4-5 passages; for a more prolonged maintenance, their level in the medium should be decreased. 3aasparagine 3ainflorescences 3acultivars 3adose response 3anitrogen 3aembryo (plant) 3aproline 3aexplants 3amicropropagation 3aSorghum bicolor 3agenetic variation 3acell differentiation 3aembryogenesis 3aculture media 3acallus 3aphosphorus 0amurashige and skoog medium 0ain vitro culture 0aregenerative ability 0ainduction1 aPakhomova, N.V.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 61, no. 2 p.115-123x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20001231b20010109c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02532naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002100193245011100214300001400325520146000339653002001799653003401819653001201853653001201865700001901877700002601896700002201922773010501944852000902049856009202058930003302150946001102183655001202194IND4435138620221123003407.0100409e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443513862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03196.x2doi7 aPMC28557912pmcid7 a202019902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBashir, Nasreena10aMycobacterium tuberculosis conserved hypothetical protein rRv2626c modulates macrophage effector functions  ap. 34-45.  aSecretory proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are the major immunomodulators of the host immune response. Open reading frame (ORF) Rv2626c, encoding a conserved hypothetical protein eliciting a strong humoral immune response in patients with tuberculosis (TB), was shown to be up-regulated upon infection in mice under hypoxic conditions. We now show that recombinant Rv2626c protein (rRv2626c) can bind to the surface of murine macrophages and elicit the type-1 immune response, as manifested by nitric oxide (NO) secretion and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Significant induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-12 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α] was evident upon stimulation of murine macrophages, as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from patients with active TB disease, with rRv2626c. Stimulation with rRv2626c also enhanced the expression of costimulatory molecules such as B7-1, B7-2 and CD40 on murine macrophages. We further show that the production of NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to rRv2626c is mediated by the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and this was further confirmed using pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a specific pharmacological inhibitor of NF-κB. Rv2626c therefore appears to modulate macrophage effector functions by eliciting both innate and adaptive immune responses, suggesting its possible use as a vaccine candidate. 0aM. tuberculosis 0ainnate and adaptive responses 0aRv2626c 0avaccine1 aKounsar, Fozia1 aMukhopadhyay, Sangita1 aHasnain, Seyed E.0 tImmunology.g2010 May, v. 130, no. 1 p.34-45dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03196.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100409b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02317naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100003200157245007000189300001800259500002400277520102300301650001401324650002101338650002001359650003001379650002501409650000901434650001601443650001501459650002901474650002501503650003001528650004901558700001901607700002001626700002301646700002301669773011601692852000901808856007801817655001201895IND4397471520221123003347.0071104e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439747152DNAL7 a179253002pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erm1812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerrine-Walker, Francine M.10aInfection process and the interaction of rice roots with rhizobia  ap. 3343-3350.  aIncludes references  aMost rhizobial strains inhibit rice root growth in the presence of calcium or potassium nitrates, but not ammonium nitrate. Certain rhizobial strains, however, such as strain R4, do not inhibit rice growth and can enter rice roots and multiply in the intercellular spaces. By using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a visual marker, it was found that Rhizobium became intimately associated with rice seedling roots within 24-48 h. During this initial period it was observed that strain R4 could cause structural changes resembling infection threads within the rice root hairs. Generally, the sites of the emerging lateral roots provide a temporary entry point for rhizobia, either by root hair entry or crack entry. All tested GFP-labelled Rhizobium strains infected the root hairs near the base of growing lateral roots. This study suggests that some strains may have the ability to infect rice root tissues via root hairs located at the emerging lateral roots and to spread extensively throughout the rice root. 3aRhizobium 3aammonium nitrate 3acalcium nitrate 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aintercellular spaces 3arice 3aroot growth 3aroot hairs 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aOryzaxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aRhizobiumxgrowth & developmentxphysiology.1 aPrayitno, Joko1 aRolfe, Barry G.1 aWeinman, Jeremy J.1 aHocart, Charles H.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2007 Oct., v. 58, no. 12 p.3343-3350dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erm1813Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03062naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012600126300001400252500001500266520174600281650001202027650002102039650001502060650001402075650002102089650001802110650002602128650001802154650001302172650002702185650002302212650001002235650001802245650001102263650001102274653002802285653001902313653002502332700001602357700001502373700001302388700001302401773008802414852000902502930003302511945001302544946001102557655001202568IND2208147120221123003312.0001205s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220814712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnzidei, M.10aOrganogenesis and somatic embryogenesis in Foeniculum vulgare: histological observations of developing embryogenic callus  ap. 69-79.  a2019-12-05  aDifferent NAA plus kinetin or BA combinations were tested on Francia Pernod fennel seedlings for callus induction and plant regeneration. Callogenesis from hypocotyls was obtained in all auxin/cytokinin-containing media. The organogenic response was observed especially in presence of NAA plus kinetin. The highest frequency of shoot regeneration was found when the auxin and kinetin were used at a 1:1 ratio. Moreover, a prolonged culture period increased shoot formation. Somatic embryogenesis was tested on several fennel populations. The results gave evidence of the genotypic importance. Two different protocols were used for somatic embryo induction. Using the first protocol among the different fennel genotypes tested, only Francia Pernod showed embryogenic capacity. In this case, from a primary non-embryogenic callus cultured for 12 months in presence of 2,4-D, an embryogenic secondary callus was produced. When transferred to the medium without 2,4-D (agarized or liquid), this gave embryogenic plants in high frequency. As far as the second embryogenic method is concerned, secondary embryogenic callus developed only in the presence of 2,4-D plus kinetin in Francia Pernod genotype. Thereafter, the replacement of those growth regulators by GA3 into the medium greatly increased the somatic embryo development, especially in 'Francia Pernod', but also in 'Aboca erbe' callus, a population with a very poor embryogenic capacity. In Francia Pernod, the primary and secondary (embryogenic) calli showed different morphological and histological responses, either when the secondary callus was induced by 2,4-D alone or by 2,4-D plus kinetin. Ontogenetic processes leading to somatic embryo formation are described in this context. 3akinetin 3aapplication rate 3ahypocotyls 3ahistology 3agibberellic acid 3acell division 3asomatic embryogenesis 3abenzyladenine 3agenotype 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aFoeniculum vulgare 3a2,4-D 3aculture media 3acallus 3ashoots 0aplant growth substances 0aembryo (plant) 0aregenerative ability1 aBennici, A.1 aSchiff, S.1 aTani, C.1 aMori, B.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 61, no. 1 p.69-79x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01697naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001100110245011100121300001400232520069900246650002100945650001600966650002800982650002301010650001101033650002601044650001201070650001801082650001401100650001901114700001301133700001101146700001201157773008801169852000901257930003301266945001301299946001101312655001201323IND2208146820221122194217.0001205s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220814682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, C.10aSomatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration from litchi protoplasts isolated from embryogenic suspensions  ap. 51-58.  aHigh yields of protoplasts were isolated from litchi embryogenic suspensions, which were maintained by alternative culture in liquid and on solid media containing silver thiosulfate.

Because the phenotype of this cultivated poppy is similar to that of Papaver fauriei, which is endemic to Mt. Rishiri, Rishiri Island, residents on the island call the cultivated poppy “P. fauriei” although the origin of the cultivated poppy is uncertain. To estimate the origin of the cultivated poppy, its internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence was compared with those found in the Far East wild poppies P. fauriei, P. alboroseum, P. miyabeanum and P. nudicaule. Although the ITS sequence of the cultivated poppy was not identical to those found in the wild species, it was most similar to that of P. miyabeanum, indicating that the cultivated poppy is not P. fauriei. However, cultivated poppy seeds have been sown several times over a period of at least 20 years in wild P. fauriei habitats on Mt. Rishiri in the hope of aiding the recovery of P. fauriei populations in wild habitats. Poppy plants in the wild habitats where such seeds have been sown showed the same ITS sequences as those of the cultivated poppy, indicating that the cultivated poppy is established in these wild habitats. This is a case of a nonindigenous species being introduced to wild habitats through human actions. 3aPapaver 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aintroduced species 3aphenotype 3aseeds 3awild plants 3aJapan 0aInternal transcribed spacer (ITS) 0aMt.

Growth-related measurements on live birds  ap. 1341-1346.  aAn experimental line (F) selected over 34 generations for increased 16-wk BW was reciprocally crossed with a primary breeding sire line (C) from a large international turkey breeder to study the inheritance of growth-related traits measured on live birds. All genetic groups were grown intermingled in confinement with sexes reared in different houses. The traits measured included BW at 8, 16, and 20 wk of age and shank length, shank width, shank depth, breast width, and walking ability scores at 16 wk of age. Walking ability was rated from 1 to 5 with 1 representing birds with no leg defects and no difficulty walking and 5 indicating birds with extreme lateral deviations of the legs and great difficulty walking. Ratings of 2, 3, and 4 represented intermediate values. The F line had a different growth pattern than the C line with the F line being larger than the C line at 8 wk of age, but the reverse was true at 16 and 20 wk of age. The difference in BW between the C and F lines increased from 16 to 20 wk of age. The C line had wider breasts than the F line at 16 wk of age. The F line had longer shanks than the C line. Shank width was larger in the C line than the F line for females but not males. No line difference in shank depth was observed. Walking ability scores at 16 wk of age were lower (better) in the C line than in the F line for males but not females. Significant heterosis in BW of the crosses of the F and C lines was observed at all ages in males (range = 3.3 to 5.6%) and only at 8 wk of age in females (3.6%). These results were similar to an earlier study in which the F line was crossed with a primary-breeding sire line from 2 other international turkey breeders. No significant heterosis in the crosses of the C and F line was observed for breast width and shank measurements. Heterosis was significant for walking ability scores of females (-3.0%) but not males. Reciprocal effects, a measure of sex linkage and maternal influences, were noted only for shank length and the direction of the difference was not the same in the 2 sexes. 3abody weight 3aline differences 3agender differences 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aanimal growth 3abody measurements 3areciprocal crosses 3amaternal effect 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aHybrid Vigor 2aMale 2aSex Characteristics 2aTurkeysxgeneticsxgrowth & development.1 aAnderson, J.W.1 aVelleman, S.G.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Sept., v. 84, no. 9 p.1341-1346x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.9.13413Available from publisher's Web site  a20051025b20051102c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/09/12  aOther US 7aarticle02363naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245004400184300001400228500002400242520098000266650002201246650001601268650001701284650001401301650001201315650002801327650003601355650002501391650003701416650004301453650003101496653002901527653001701556653002001573653002701593653002801620653002501648700002001673700002001693700002101713773010201734852000901836856004801845655001201893IND4438798020221122194147.0100619e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443879802DNAL7 a204548582pmid7 a10.1007/s11120-010-9556-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKocsis, Péter.10aKinetic bacteriochlorophyll fluorometer  ap. 73-82.  aIncludes references  aA pump and probe fluorometer with a laser diode as single light source has been constructed for measurement of fast induction and relaxation of the fluorescence yield in intact cells, chromatophores and isolated reaction centers of photosynthetic bacteria.

  1 aBorwornpinyo, S.10aCulture of chicken embryos in surrogate eggshells  ap. 1477-1482.  aThe chick embryo is a classical model to study embryonic development. However, most researchers have not studied the effect of embryonic manipulation on chick hatchability. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of egg orientation and type of sealing film on the hatchability of cultured embryos. Windows were made in the small end of recipient surrogate chicken eggshells, and donor embryos were placed into the recipient eggshell for the first 3 d of incubation. Survival over the first 3 d was maximized (P < 0.05) when windowed eggs sealed with Saran Wrap were positioned with the window-end down compared with window-end up. Three-day-old cultured embryos were transferred into recipient turkey eggshells, sealed with cling film, and cultured until hatch. Water weight loss of the surrogate eggshell cultures regardless of cling film type was not significantly different from control intact eggs. The embryos cultured in turkey eggshells and sealed with Handi Wrap exhibited higher hatchability (75% +/- 10.2%) than cultures sealed with Saran Wrap (45.2% +/- 13.8%). Hatchability of control intact eggs (86.4% +/- 5.3%) was not significantly (P > 0.05) different from the hatchability of eggs sealed with Handi Wrap, which suggested that Handi Wrap was an excellent sealant for chick embryos cultured after 3 d of incubation. 3aembryo culture 3aegg hatchability 3aplastic film 2aAnimals 2aChick Embryoxgrowth & development 2aEgg Shell 2aTime Factors 2aTissue Culture Techniquesxmethodsxveterinary. 2aTurkeys1 aBrake, J.1 aMozdziak, P.E.1 aPetitte, J.N.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Sept., v. 84, no. 9 p.1477-1482x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.9.14773Available from publisher's Web site  a20051025b20051102c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/09/14  aOther US 7aarticle02713naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005200127300001400179520162800193650001101821650002801832650001801860650001001878650001201888650001201900650001301912650001101925650001301936650001901949650002701968650002101995650002402016653001602040653002302056653000902079653001902088700001802107773008802125852000902213930003302222945001302255946001102268655001202279IND2208145920221122124218.0001205s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220814592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShibli, R.A.10aSomatic embryogenesis in the endemic black iris  ap. 15-21.  aSomatic embryogenesis was achieved from callus, cell suspension and protoplast culture systems in the endemic black iris (Iris nigricans). Subculture of friable callus fragments on embryogenesis induction medium (EIM) containing 4.5 micromolar 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 0.5 micromolar kinetin, 4.5 micromolar 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 300 mg l-1 proline in the dark was necessary before transfer to regeneration medium (RM). Regeneration was studied by transferring friable callus fragments from EIM to RM containing (0.0, 4.5, 9.0, 13.5 micromolar) of either 6-benzyladenine (BA), 2-isopentenyladenine (2iP), zeatin or thidiazuron (TDZ) in combination with 0.49 micromolar indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), 0.45 micromolar 2,4-D. Maximum embryogenesis was obtained at 4.5 micromolar BA while zeatin and TDZ were not effective and embryogenesis did not occur with these treatments. Sucrose at 0.2 M was more effective for embryogenesis when compared to glucose or fructose. Growing cells in suspension culture on EIM containing 4.5 micromolar 2,4-D in combination with 0.2 M sucrose for four weeks and transferring cells to RM (containing 4.5 micromolar BA) gave significant embryogenesis with maximum number of embryos (3568 embryos/g cells). Using 4.5 micromolar 2,4-D in protoplast culture was necessary for the best protoplast division and colony formation. In all experiments, embryos developed on RM were transferred to hormone-free medium (HFM) and 90% converted to rooted plantlets. Produced plantlets gave 95% survival ex vitro. Plantlets developed to whole plants in the greenhouse and flowered. 3acallus 3acell suspension culture 3aculture media 3a2,4-D 3akinetin 3aproline 3aregrowth 3azeatin 3afructose 3atissue culture 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aapplication rate 3aindole butyric acid 0athidiazuron 0aprotoplast culture 0airis 0airis nigricans1 aAjlouni, M.M.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 61, no. 1 p.15-21x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01729naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245009900144300001600243520085700259650001201116650002601128650001901154650001601173700002001189700001401209700001601223773009601239852000901335930003301344945002501377946001301402655001201415IND4372788520221122124246.0050728e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437278852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Therefore, the establishment of its tolerance to metabolic inhibitors found in hydrolysates is of major interest. We studied the effects of selected aliphatic acids, phenolic compounds, and furfural. Acetic acid favored biomass production for concentrations <6.0 g/L. Formic acid was more toxic than acetic acid and induced xylitol accumulation (maximum yield of 0.21 g/g of xylose). All tested phenolics strongly decreased the specific growth rate. Increased toxicity was found for hydroquinone, syringaldehyde, and 4-methylcatechol and was correlated to the compound's hydrophobicity. Increasing the amount of furfural led to longer lag phases and had a detrimental effect on specific growth rate and biomass productivity. 3axylitol 3abiological production 3alignocellulose 3acell growth1 aCarvalheiro, F.1 aNeves, I.1 aCirio, F.M.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2005 Spring, v. 121-124 p.413-426x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20060419b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/04/19  aOther US 7aarticle01490naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001300127245007300140300001600213520072200229650001500951650001900966700001400985700001200999700001301011773009601024852000901120930003301129945002501162946001301187655001201200IND4372789620221122124251.0050728e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437278962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Simultaneous fermentations were conducted to compare the hydrolysate-based media with the controls having equivalent concentrations of glucose and Avicel cellulose. Six hydrolysates differing in the boiling durations in the hydrolysis procedure were evaluated. The hydrolysates were found to support cell growth and induce active cellulase synthesis.

In Brazil, a national program was launched in 2002 to evaluate the technical, economic, and environmental competitiveness of biodiesel in relation to the commercially available diesel oil. Several research projects were initiated nationwide to investigate and/or optimize biodiesel production from renewable lipid sources and ethanol derived from sugarcane (ethyl esters). Once implemented, this program will not only decrease our dependence on petroleum derivatives but also create new market opportunities for agribusiness, opening new jobs in the countryside, improving the sustainability of our energy matrix, and helping the Brazilian government to support important actions against poverty. This article discusses the efforts to develop the Brazilian biodiesel program in the context of technical specifications as well as potential oilseed sources. 3abiofuels 3aoilseeds1 aWilhelm, H.M.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2005 Spring, v. 121-124 p.807-820x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20060419b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/04/19  aOther US 7aarticle01609naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245015400141300001600295520066800311650001200979650002600991700001701017700002301034700002001057700002201077700002001099773009601119852000901215930003301224945002501257946001301282655001201295IND4372790920221122093435.0050728e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437279092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Jyothi. Leaf sections were initially cultured on 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) + benzyladenine (BA) and alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) + BA supplemented Murashige and Skoog (MS) media. Nodular embryogenic callus developed from the cut ends of explants on media containing 2,4-D and BA, whereas compact callus developed on media containing NAA and BA. The explants with primary callus were subsequently moved onto MS media containing zeatin and/or gibberellic acid (GA3) and BA. Treatment with zeatin (22.8 micromolar) and BA (10.0 micromolar) resulted in the induction of the highest number of somatic embryos directly from meristematic centres produced on the nodular tissue. Embryo induction and maturation took place on this medium. The cotyledonary stage embryos developed into complete plantlets on hormone-free MS medium. A distinct feature of this study is the induction of somatic embryogenesis in leaf cultures of potato which has not been reported previously. 3adose response 3ahistology 3aembryo (plant) 3azeatin 3aSolanum tuberosum 3agibberellic acid 3adevelopmental stages 3aexplants 3asomatic embryogenesis 3acultured cells 3abenzyladenine 3amicropropagation 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3a2,4-D 3aculture media 3aleaves 0amurashige and skoog medium 0amethodology 0aregenerative ability1 aPavan, U.1 aRamesh, M.1 aRao, A.V.1 aMohan Reddy, K.J.1 aSadanandam, A.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2001, v. 64, no. 1 p.13-17x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02009naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245008900144300001600233520126900249650002301518700001101541700001501552773009601567852000901663930003301672945002501705946001301730655001201743IND4372793020221122093500.0050728e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437279302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aShahbazi, A.10aApplications of sequential aqueous steam treatments to the fractionation of softwood  ap. 973-988.  aThe FIRST (Feedstock Impregnation and Rapid Steam Treatment) approach was used in this study to isolate extractives, hemicellulose, lignin, fibers, and cellulosic fines of softwood. With hydrolysis and fermentation of the hemicellulose and cellulosic fines fractions, this approach produces four co-products: extractives, cellulose, lignin, and ethanol. The first unit operation uses aqueous/alcohol to remove and recover the extractive rich fraction. The second unit operation uses steam treatment to destructure the matrix and solubilize a large fraction of the hemicelluloses. The third unit operation uses alkaline delignification to dissolve a lignin fraction. The fourth unit operation uses the refining process to separate fibers from cellulosic fines. The fibers are bleached. The yields of lignin and bleached cellulose were about 20.0 kg and 38.3 kg out of 100 kg initial dry pine, respectively. The recovered hemicelluloses were 23.3 kg (containing 16.1 kg hexoses and 5.0 kg pentoses) and the cellulose fines derived hexoses amounted to 3.4 kg out of 100 kg initial dry pine. When the two liquors containing the hemicellulose sugars and the cellulose fines-derived hexoses were fermented for ethanol production, an ethanol yield of 6.8 kg was obtained. 3aethanol production1 aLi, Y.1 aMims, M.R.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2005 Spring, v. 121-124 p.973-988x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20060419b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/04/19  aOther US 7aarticle02304naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245007400131300001400205500001500219520090200234650002501136650001801161650002101179650001001200650001801210650002101228650001301249650001101262650002701273650001201300650002001312650001401332650001301346650002301359650001801382650001501400650001901415650002601434650002101460650001301481653002501494653001601519653004401535653002401579700001701603773008801620852000901708930003301717945001301750946001101763655001201774IND2321174220221122093437.0010522s2001    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232117422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVesco, L.L. dal.14aThe effectiveness of nitrogen sources in Feijoa somatic embryogenesis  ap. 19-25.  a2019-12-05  aImmature and mature zygotic embryos excised from Feijoa fruits were employed as explants and the effects of NH4(+) and NO3(-) ionic concentration in basal LPm culture medium supplemented with 2,4-D (10 micromolar) were evaluated. Moreover, the addition of 4 mM of Asn, Gln, and Arg, and levels of Gln (0 to 8 mM) were tested. The original NH4(+) and NO3(-) concentration present in the LPm culture medium supplemented with Gln (4 mM) resulted in the highest somatic embryo number from immature zygotic embryos. For mature zygotic embryos, the addition of Asn, Gln or Arg to the basal LPm culture medium resulted in improved somatic embryogenesis induction. Ten weeks in culture allowed the highest somatic embryo number when mature zygotic embryos were used as explant.

Reaction conditions of temperature and H2O2 and Fe(II) concentrations were studied. The fermentability of prehydrolysate treated by Fenton's reaction was tested by using different inoculum sizes of thermotolerant strain Kluyveromyces marxianus CECT 10875. The highest percentages of toxic compound degradation (ranging from 71 to 93% removal) were obtained at the highest H2O2 concentration tested (50 mM). However, a negative effect on fermentability was observed at this H2O2 concentration at the lower inoculum loading. An increase in inoculum size to 0.6 g/L resulted in an enhanced ethanol fermentation yield of 95% relative to control. 3aethanol production1 aManzanares, P.1 aBallesteros, I.1 aNegro, M.J.1 aGonzalez, A.1 aBallesteros, M.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2005 Spring, v. 121-124 p.887-900x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20060419b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/04/19  aOther US 7aarticle01531naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245010200142300001600244500001500260520063100275650002300906650002100929653001500950653002100965700001200986700001500998700001601013773009601029852000901125930003301134945002501167946001301192655001201205IND4372792420221122095250.0050728e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437279242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Recovery of cellulase ranged from 60 to 66.6% and for cellobiase from 76.4 to 88%. Economic analysis shows that cost savings gained by enzyme recycling are sensitive to enzyme pricing and loading. At the demonstrated recovery of 60% and current loading of 15 Filter paper units of cellulase/g of glucan, enzyme recycling is expected to generate a cost savings of approx 15%. If recovery efficiency can be improved to 70%, the savings will increase to >25%, and at 90% recovery the savings will be 50%. 3aethanol production 3abeta-glucosidase 0acellulases 0aenzyme recycling1 aRaj, S.1 aNghiem, J.1 aStowers, M.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2005 Spring, v. 121-124 p.901-910x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20060417b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/04/17  aOther US 7aarticle02980naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003300110040001800143100001500161245011300176300001600289500001500305520119900320650002001519650001201539650001001551650001201561650002601573650001201599650002601611650003301637650003401670650003601704650002201740650000901762650002901771650004301800650004301843650002801886650003901914650003801953653003401991653002702025653001902052653004202071700001602113773012302129852000902252856008302261930003302344945001302377946001302390990002302403655001202426IND2045216920221122095251.0950323e199502  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204521692DNAL7 a78771842pmid7 a10.1002/jmor.10522302102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGundel, M.10aAnatomy of neurons crossing the tritocerebral commissures of the cockroach Periplaneta americana (Blattaria)  ap. 225-242.  a2019-12-04  aThe neuronal connections of the tritocerebral commissures of Periplaneta americana were studied in the brain-suboesophageal ganglion complex and the stomatogastric nervous system by means of heavy metal iontophoresis through cut nerve ends followed by silver intensification. The tritocerebral commissure 1 (Tc1) contains mainly the processes of the subpharyngeal nerve (Spn) whose neurons are located in both tritocerebral lobes and in the frontal ganglion. Some neurons of the frontal ganglion project through the Tc1 to the contralateral tritocerebrum. A few fibers in this commissure were observed projecting to the protocerebrum and the suboesophageal ganglion. There are tritocerebral neurons which pass through the Tc1 or the tritocerebral commissure 2 (Tc2) and extend on into the stomatogastric nervous system. One axon of a descending giant neuron appears in the Tc2. This neuron lies in the tritocerebrum and connects the brain to the contralateral side of the ventral nerve cord. In addition, sensory fibers of the labral nerve (Ln) traverse both commissures to the opposite tritocerebrum. The anatomical and physiological relevance of the identified neuronal pathways is discussed. 3aneurophysiology 3aneurons 3abrain 3aganglia 3aPeriplaneta americana 2aAnimals 2aAxonsxultrastructure 2aBrainxcytologyxphysiology. 2aDigestive Systemxinnervation 2aGanglia, Invertebratexcytology 2aLiverxphysiology 2aMale 2aNervous Systemxcytology 2aNervous System Physiological Phenomena 2aNeural Pathwaysxcytologyxphysiology. 2aNeuronsxultrastructure 2aPeriplanetaxcytologyxphysiology. 2aSynaptic Transmissionxphysiology 0astomatogastric nervous system 0aanatomy and morphology 0anervous system 0abrain-suboesophageal ganglion complex1 aPenzlin, H.0 tJournal of morphology.g1995 Feb., v. 223, no. 2 p.225-242aJournal of morphology (Philadelphia, Pa.)x0362-25257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmor.10522302103Available from publisher's Web site  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02390naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012300126300001400249500001500263520110700278650001801385650001601403650001301419650001801432650001301450650002101463650002701484650001701511650001801528650001101546653002101557653003101578653002101609653002601630653002501656653001601681653002101697653001501718700001701733700001601750773008801766852000901854930003301863945001301896946001101909655001201920IND2279277920221122072538.0010410s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND227927792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, P.S.10aMass multiplication of protocorm-like bodies using bioreactor system and subsequent plant regeneration in Phalaenopsis  ap. 67-72.  a2019-12-05  aProtocorm-like bodies (PLBs) formed on leaf segments in vitro were used as explants for bioreactor cultures. Continuous immersion cultures (air lift column and air lift-balloon bioreactor), and temporary immersion cultures (with or without charcoal filter attached) were used for the culture of PLB sections. A temporary immersion culture with charcoal filter attached was most suitable for PLB culture. About 18,000 PLBs were harvested from 20 g of inoculum (approximately 1000 PLB sections) in 2 l Hyponex medium after 8 weeks of incubation. Aeration in a bioreactor at 0.5 or 2.0 volume of air per volume of medium min-1 (vvm) yielded similar levels of biomass production. PLBs grown in bioreactors were cultured on solid Murashige and Skoog, Vacin and Went, Knudson C, Lindemann and Hyponex media. Hyponex medium was found to be suitable for conversion of PLBs into plantlets and 83% of PLBs transformed into plantlets on this medium. The feasibility of using PLBs for large-scale micropropagation was evaluated for scaled-up liquid cultures in bioreactors, rate of proliferation, and regeneration. 3adose response 3abioreactors 3aexplants 3abenzyladenine 3acharcoal 3amicropropagation 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aPhalaenopsis 3aculture media 3aleaves 0alindemann medium 0amurashige and skoog medium 0ain vitro culture 0avacin and went medium 0aregenerative ability 0amethodology 0aknudson c medium 0aprotocorms1 aMurthy, H.N.1 aYoeup, P.K.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 63, no. 1 p.67-72x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02842naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002300193245010700216300001600323520104600339650001601385650001401401650002401415650002801439650002001467650001501487650001101502650002301513650004901536650002201585650002801607650001301635650004201648650002801690650002401718650004201742650001901784653000701803653001401810653001401824653001601838653003901854653002301893700001701916700002001933700001301953700001701966700002001983773010402003852000902107856009202116930003302208946001102241655001202252IND4431149420221122072549.0100111e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443114942DNAL7 a199480062pmid7 aPMC35512592pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1600-0854.2009.01011.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoname, Jessica M.10aEfficient Internalization of MHC I Requires Lysine-11 and Lysine-63 Mixed Linkage Polyubiquitin Chains  ap. 210-220.  aThe downregulation of cell surface receptors by endocytosis is a fundamental requirement for the termination of signalling responses and ubiquitination is a critical regulatory step in receptor regulation. The K5 gene product of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates and downregulates several cell surface immunoreceptors, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Here, we show that K5 targets the membrane proximal lysine of MHC I for conjugation with mixed linkage polyubiquitin chains. Quantitative mass spectrometry revealed an increase in lysine-11, as well as lysine-63, linked polyubiquitin chains on MHC I in K5-expressing cells. Using a combination of mutant ubiquitins and MHC I molecules expressing a single cytosolic lysine residue, we confirm a functional role for lysines-11 and -63 in K5-mediated MHC I endocytosis. We show that lysine-11 linkages are important for receptor endocytosis, and that complex mixed linkage polyubiquitin chains are generated in vivo. 3aendocytosis 3aubiquitin 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aEndocytosisxphysiology 2aGenetic Linkage 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aLysinexmetabolism 2aMajor Histocompatibility Complexxphysiology 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPolyubiquitinxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Cell Surface 2aSignal Transduction 2aUbiquitin-Protein Ligasesxmetabolism 2aUbiquitination 0aK5 0alysine-11 0alysine-63 0aMHC class I 0amixed linkage polyubiquitin chains 0apolyubiquitination1 aThomas, Mair1 aStagg, Helen R.1 aXu, Ping1 aPeng, Junmin1 aLehner, Paul J.0 tTraffic.g2010 Feb., v. 11, no. 2 p.210-220dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1398-92197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2009.01011.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100112b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03381naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002000186245011200206300001800318506007600336520112600412506003701538650002501575650002501600650001801625650002401643650002801667650000901695650001401704650002501718650000901743650002601752650001201778650002201790650002501812650001501837650002001852650003501872650002001907650004801927650001101975650002501986650000902011650004302020650001402063650004402077650003802121650004902159650002602208653002502234653002102259653002702280653002102307700001802328700002202346700002102368700002202389773013402411852000902545856008502554930003302639946001102672655001202683IND4439170520221207091641.0100625e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443917052DNAL7 a203524682pmid7 aPMC28892842pmcid7 a10.1007/s00018-010-0347-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStock, Kristin 10aTranscription factor-based modulation of neural stem cell differentiation using direct protein transduction  ap. 2439-2449.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn contrast to conventional gene transfer strategies, the direct introduction of recombinant proteins into cells bypasses the risk of insertional mutagenesis and offers an alternative to genetic intervention. Here, we explore whether protein transduction of the gliogenic transcription factor Nkx2.2 can be used to promote oligodendroglial differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived neural stem cells (NSC). To that end, a recombinant cell-permeant form of Nkx2.2 protein was generated. Exposure of ESC-derived NSC to the recombinant protein and initiation of differentiation resulted in a two-fold increase in the number of oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, Nkx2.2-transduced cells exhibited a more mature oligodendroglial phenotype. Comparative viral gene transfer studies showed that the biological effect of Nkx2.2 protein transduction is comparable to that obtained by lentiviral transduction. The results of this proof-of-concept study depict direct intracellular delivery of transcription factors as alternative modality to control lineage differentiation in NSC cultures without genetic modification.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell differentiation 3aembryonic stem cells 3agene transfer 3agenetic engineering 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3amice 3aphenotype 3arecombinant proteins 3arisk 3atranscription factors 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Shape 2aCells, Cultured 2aEmbryonic Stem Cellsxcytology 2aGenetic Vectors 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aLentivirusxgenetics 2aMice 2aOligodendrogliaxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aPhenotype 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aStem Cellsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTransduction, Genetic 0aProtein transduction 0aNeural stem cell 0aNeural differentiation 0aOligodendrocytes1 aNolden, Lars 1 aEdenhofer, Frank 1 aQuandel, Tamara 1 aBrüstle, Oliver.0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2010 July, v. 67, no. 14 p.2439-2449dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-010-0347-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100628b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01652naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245012400163300001600287520063800303650001300941650002200954651001000976653001600986653001601002653000801018653001501026700001901041700002401060773009201084852000901176856008501185930003301270946001101303655001201314IND4436371320221122072623.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443637132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10267-009-0026-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYajima, Yuka 10aArcyria monticola from Hokkaido, northern Japan: its habit, detailed morphology, and comparison with Arcyria imperialis  ap. 242-247.  aArcyria monticola was found in Hokkaido, northern Japan. This is the first record of its locality, except for the type locality. The linearly expanding capillitium with many coils characterizing A. monticola consists of very elastic longitudinal tubes, short lateral tubes, and many small intricate nets. A longitudinal tube coils around a small intricate net, which forms a core. In contrast, A. imperialis, the other known Arcyria species with a linearly expanding capillitium, has neither short lateral tubes nor nets. The microscopic character of the A. imperialis capillitium is also totally different from that of A. monticola. 3aProtozoa 3aanimal morphology 3aJapan 0aArcyriaceae 0aCapillitium 0aSEM 0aTrichiales1 aKondō, Norio.1 aYamamoto, Yukinori 0 tMycoscience.g2010 May, v. 51, no. 3 p.242-247dJapan : Springer Japanx1340-35407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10267-009-0026-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02042naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008400126300001200210500001500222520068300237650000900920650001800929650001400947650001300961650002100974650002400995650001801019650001801037650002301055650002101078650002701099650001801126650002301144650001101167651001101178653001901189653002501208653001501233653003101248653003201279653002101311653002901332700002301361773008601384852000901470930003301479945001301512946001101525655001201536IND2321173120221122053811.0010522s2001    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232117312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFracaro, F.10aMicropropagation of Cunila galioides, a popular medicinal plant of south Brazil  ap. 1-4.  a2019-12-05  aAxillary buds of field plants of Cunila galioides Benth. were used to evaluate the effect of growth regulators and culture media on the in vitro shoot proliferation and growing.

The distribution of public spending between public health care and pollution abatement that maximizes equilibrium income is also derived.

Neurochem. (2010) 113, 692-703. The α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluR2, which regulates excitotoxicity and the inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) have both been implicated in motor neurone vulnerability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease. TNFα has been reported to increase cell surface expression of AMPAR subunits to increase synaptic strength and enhance excitotoxicity, but whether this mechanism occurs in motor neurones is unknown. We used primary cultures of mouse motor neurones and cortical neurones to examine the interaction between TNFα receptor activation, GluR2 availability, AMPAR-mediated calcium entry and susceptibility to excitotoxicity. Short exposure to a physiologically relevant concentration of TNFα (10 ng/mL, 15 min) caused a marked redistribution of both GluR1 and GluR2 to the cell surface as determined by cell surface biotinylation and immunofluorescence. Using fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester microfluorimetry, we showed that exposure to TNFα caused a rapid reduction in the peak amplitude of AMPA-mediated calcium entry in a PI3-kinase and p38 kinase-dependent manner, consistent with increased insertion of GluR2-containing AMPAR into the plasma membrane. This resulted in a protection of motor neurones against kainate-induced cell death. Our data therefore, suggest that TNFα acts primarily as a physiological regulator of synaptic activity in motor neurones rather than a pathological drive in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 0aAMPAR 0aamyotrophic lateral sclerosis 0acalcium-permeable 0aexcitotoxicity 0atrafficking 0atumour necrosis factor alpha1 aAndersson, David A.1 aWilliams, Robert J.1 aRattray, Marcus0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2010 May, v. 113, no. 3 p.692-703dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06634.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100409b20100501c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03150naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245008300168300001600251520143500267650002201702650001601724650002101740650001001761650001601771650001401787650002101801650002101822650001301843650001801856650001101874650001301885650001101898650001401909650001501923650003301938650001601971650002401987650001002011650001302021650001302034650002302047653001502070653002802085700001402113700001802127700001802145700001602163700001502179700001702194700001702211700001702228773014602245852000902391856009202400930003302492946001102525655001202536IND4435466620221122043027.0100416e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443546662DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2010.02224.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kunbo10aAnalysis of chemical components in oolong tea in relation to perceived quality  ap. 913-920.  aProperties of leaf and infusion colours, chemical components and volatile flavour compounds of oolong teas and their correlation with perceived quality score given by tea-tasting panel were analysed. The scores for appearance and infused leaf correlated strongly with concentrations of chlorophyll a (chl a), chlorophyll (chl b) and chlorophyll (chl) (r = 0.355-0.433, P < 0.05) and the total quality score (TQS) positively correlated with concentrations of chl a, chl b and chl (r = 0.517-0.533, P < 0.01). The perceived taste score and TQS positively correlated with the concentration of total free amino acid (r = 0.514, 0.694, P < 0.01) and theanine (r = 0.500, 0.684, P < 0.01). The volatile composition and their quantities varied widely among oolong tea samples. Nerolidol, indole, benzeneacetaldehyde, linalool, linalool oxide I, hexanal, benzyl nitrile, geraniol and 1-penten-3-ol were prevailing volatile compounds detected in most of oolong tea samples. Principal component analysis screened ten principal components with the first three (glutamic acid, total catechins and benzeneacetaldehyde) explaining 27.86%, 20.00% and 14.46% of the total variance, respectively. Regression analysis upon the ten principal components formulated a prediction model on the total quality score with 78.5% probability. The result showed that oolong teas could be partially classified by cluster analysis based on principal components. 3achemical analysis 3achlorophyll 3acluster analysis 3acolor 3acorrelation 3aflavanols 3aflavor compounds 3afree amino acids 3ageraniol 3aglutamic acid 3aleaves 3alinalool 3amodels 3anerolidol 3aoolong tea 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3ataste 3atheanine 3avariance 3avolatile compounds 0aoolong tea 0aperceived quality score1 aLiu, Fang1 aLiu, Zhonghua1 aHuang, Jianan1 aXu, Zhongxi1 aLi, Yinhua1 aChen, Jinhua1 aGong, Yushun1 aYang, Xinghe0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2010 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.913-920dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2010.02224.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100416b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03029naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245012500168300001800293520154200311650002501853650004301878650001701921650001901938650001601957650004401973650001402017650001602031650001402047650001902061650001102080650002302091650001702114700001902131700001502150700001202165700001302177700001802190700001802208700001702226700001602243700002002259773011102279852000902390856009202399930003302491946001102524655001202535IND4404902920221122043358.0080425e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440490292DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06352.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Yuhong10aPurification and structural characterization of a d-amino acid-containing conopeptide, conomarphin, from Conus marmoreus  ap. 1976-1987.  aCone snails, a group of gastropod animals that inhabit tropical seas, are capable of producing a mixture of peptide neurotoxins, namely conotoxins, for defense and predation. Conotoxins are mainly disulfide-rich short peptides that act on different ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, or transporters in the nervous system. They exhibit highly diverse compositions, structures, and biological functions. In this work, a novel Cys-free 15-residue conopeptide from Conus marmoreus was purified and designated as conomarphin. Conomarphin is unique because of its d-configuration Phe at the third residue from the C-terminus, which was identified using HPLC by comparing native conomarphin fragments and the corresponding synthetic peptides cleaved by different proteases. Surprisingly, the cDNA-encoded precursor of conomarphin was found to share the conserved signal peptide with other M-superfamily conotoxins, clearly indicating that conomarphin should belong to the M-superfamily, although conomarphin shares no homology with other six-Cys-containing M-superfamily conotoxins. Furthermore, NMR spectroscopy experiments established that conomarphin adopts a well-defined structure in solution, with a tight loop in the middle of the peptide and a short 3¹⁰-helix at the C-terminus. By contrast, no loop in l-Phe13-conomarphin was found, which suggests that d-Phe13 is essential for the structure of conomarphin. In conclusion, conomarphin may represent a new conotoxin family, whose biological activity remains to be identified. 3abioactive properties 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aion channels 3anervous system 3aneurotoxins 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apredation 3aproteinases 3areceptors 3asignal peptide 3asnails 3asynthetic peptides 3atransporters1 aHuang, Feijuan1 aJiang, Hui1 aLiu, Li1 aWang, Qi1 aWang, Yanfang1 aShao, Xiaoxia1 aChi, Chengwu1 aDu, Weihong1 aWang, Chunguang0 tFEBS journal.g2008 May, v. 275, no. 9 p.1976-1987dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06352.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02029naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007100092040001800163100001700181245015200198300001400350500001500364520084700379650001801226650001801244650001701262653002501279653002701304653002701331773012101358852000901479856012101488930003301609945001301642946001301655990002301668655001201691IND2049669420221122043437.0960131e199601  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204966942DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199601)227:1<81::AID-JMOR6>3.0.CO;2-S2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeller, K.G.10aUnusual abdomino-alary, defensive stridulatory mechanism in the bushcricket Pantecphylus cerambycinus (Orthoptera, Tettigonioidea, Pseudophyllidae)  ap. 81-86.  a2019-12-04  aThe bushcricket Pantecphylus cerambycinus has two types of stridulatory mechanisms and acoustical signals. The elytro-elytral mechanism typical for tettigonioid bushcrickets is used to produce a narrow-band calling song (peak frequency 15 kHz). An abdomino-alary mechanism is used for disturbance stridulation. Its stridulatory file is situated on the hind edge of the abdominal tergites and consists of 50-70 parallel ridges, covering the whole width of the tergite. The broad-band sound (peak frequency 10 kHz) is produced by the contact between the file and ribs situated on the upper side of the hindwings which are folded in such a way that their upper side is directed toward the tergites. Defensive stridulation in bushcrickets is reviewed here, and its function and evolution discussed in the context of predator avoidance strategies. 3aTettigoniidae 3aanimal organs 3astridulation 0aanimal communication 0aanatomy and morphology 0adefensive stridulation0 tJournal of morphology.g1996 Jan., v. 227, no. 1 p.81-86aJournal of morphology (Philadelphia, Pa.)x0362-25257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199601)227:1<81::AID-JMOR6>3.0.CO;2-S3Available from publisher's Web site  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02251naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245007200169300001800241520124100259650002501500650001901525650001101544650002101555650002201576650002101598650003601619650001401655773011101669852000901780856009201789930003301881946001101914655001201925IND4404902820221122043417.0080425e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440490282DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06366.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDicou, Eleni10aBiologically active, non membrane-anchored precursors - an overview  ap. 1960-1975.  aPeptides function as chemical signals between cells of multicellular organisms via specific receptors on target cells. Many hormones, neuromodulators and growth factors are peptides. Peptide hormones and other biologically active peptides are synthesized as higher molecular weight precursor proteins (pro-hormones), which must undergo post-translational modification to yield the bioactive peptide(s). In many instances, more than one biologically active peptide is generated from one and the same precursor. In most cases, these precursors are biologically inert and their existence is confined to the membrane-enclosed subcellular compartments where processing of the pro-hormones takes place. A class of growth factors that derive from membrane-anchored precursors which themselves are biologically active constitute an exception to this model. The list of the membrane-anchored biologically active precursors has been the subject of specialized reviews. The present review focuses on precursors other than membrane-anchored precursors, which were found to be biologically active and which often display different biological activities, and may mediate their effects via receptors independent from those of their generated peptides. 3abioactive properties 3agrowth factors 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aneurotransmitters 3apeptide hormones 3apost-translational modification 3areceptors0 tFEBS journal.g2008 May, v. 275, no. 9 p.1960-1975dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06366.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02706naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245010900184300001800293520098800311650002501299650002701324650002201351650004101373650001001414650001401424650003001438650001901468650004701487650003601534650003501570650004701605650004101652650003201693650002401725650002001749653002101769653003101790653002201821700002101843700001801864700001301882700001901895773013601914852000902050856008502059930003302144946001102177655001202188IND4433371020221122043601.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443337102DNAL7 a200629802pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-009-3379-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jian-hua.10aDetermination of diketopiperazines of Burkholderia cepacia CF-66 by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  ap. 1773-1779.  aBacteria communicate with each other by a process termed “quorum sensing” (QS), and diffusible, low-molecular-weight chemicals, called signal molecules, are used as the communication languages. In cell-free Burkholderia cepacia CF-66 culture supernatants, five compounds suspected of being signal molecules were identified. The gene (cepI) related with AHLs synthesis were not detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed that these compounds were not AHLs but the diketopiperazines (DKPs) cyclo(Pro-Phe), cyclo(Pro-Tyr), cyclo(Ala-Val), cyclo(Pro-Leu), and cyclo(Pro-Val), all of which were both d and l-type. Four kinds of DKPs had been isolated from other Gram-negative bacteria, but the other was a novel kind discovered in CF-66, and l-cyclo (Pro-Phe) was quantified by GC-MS. It was found that exogenous DKPs had a negative effect on the candidacidal activity of the culture supernatant extracts. 3aBurkholderia cepacia 3aGram-negative bacteria 3adiketopiperazines 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agenes 3alanguages 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquorum sensing 2aAntifungal Agentsxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aBurkholderia cepaciaxchemistry 2aCandida albicansxdrug effects 2aDiketopiperazinesxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMolecular Structure 2aStereoisomerism 0aSignal molecules 0aBurkholderia cepacia CF-66 0aDiketopiperazines1 aQuan, Chun-Shan 1 aQi, Xiao-Hui 1 aLi, Xin 1 aFan, Sheng-Di 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2010 Mar., v. 396, no. 5 p.1773-1779dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-009-3379-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20101001b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02087naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011200125300001400237500001500251520090500266650001801171650001601189650001901205650001601224650002501240650002401265650002601289650002101315650002101336650001801357650001901375650001801394650002101412653001501433653001801448653001601466700001701482773008801499852000901587930003301596945001301629946001101642655001201653IND2207513520221122043432.0001026s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220751352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIngram, B.10aEffect of bioreactor configuration on the growth and maturation of Picea sitchensis somatic embryo cultures  ap. 87-96.  a2019-12-05  aSomatic embryo suspension cultures of Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce) derived from two cell lines, SS03 and SS10, wee grown in shake flasks, air-lift, bubble, stirred tank and hanging stirrer bar bioreactors.

By the end of each division, cytoplasmic bridges flow to the center of the cyst, forming a complex, called the fusoma. During meiotic prophase I, spermatocytes I present desmosome-like junctions and meiotic cytoplasmic bridges. At the beginning of spermiogenesis, the fusoma moves to the future caudal end of the cyst, and at this time the early spermatids are linked by desmosome-like junctions. Throughout spermiogenesis, new and sometimes broad cytoplasmic bridges are formed among spermatids at times making them share cytoplasm. In this case the individualization of cells is assured by the presence of smooth cisternae that outline their structures. The more differentiated spermatids have in addition to narrow cytoplasmic bridges, plasmic membranes junctions. By the end of spermiogenesis, the excess cytoplasmic mass is eliminated leading to spermatid individualization. Desmosome-like junctions of spermatocytes I and early spermatids appear during the fusoma readjustment and segregations; on the other hand, plasmic membrane junctions appear in differentiating spermatids and are eliminated along with the cytoplasmic excess. These circumstances suggest that belt desmosome-like and plasmic membrane junctions are involved in the maintenance of the relative positions of male germ cells in D. hominis while they are inside the cysts. 3aspermiogenesis 3aDermatobia hominis 3acell division 3acytoplasm 3aspermatids 3acell differentiation 0agerm cells 0aspermatogenesis 0afusome 0adesmosome-like junctions1 aLello, E. de.0 tJournal of morphology.g1996 Feb., v. 227, no. 2 p.145-154aJournal of morphology (Philadelphia, Pa.)x0362-25257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199602)227:2<145::AID-JMOR2>3.0.CO;2-83Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01922naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245014600172300001800318520083100336650002801167650002501195650001701220650001501237650001201252650001201264650001301276700001701289700002101306773011201327852000901439856009201448930003301540946001101573655001201584IND4404902420221122012524.0080425e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440490242DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06413.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNachon, Florian10aInsights into substrate and product traffic in the Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase active site gorge by enlarging a back channel  ap. 2659-2664.  aTo test a product exit differing from the substrate entrance in the active site of acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7), we enlarged a channel located at the bottom of the active site gorge in the Drosophila enzyme. Mutation of Trp83 to Ala or Glu widens the channel from 5 Å to 9 Å. The kinetics of substrate hydrolysis and the effect of ligands that close the main entrance suggest that the mutations facilitate both product exit and substrate entrance. Thus, in the wild-type, the channel is so narrow that the 'back door' is used by at most 5% of the traffic, with the majority of traffic passing through the main entrance. In mutants Trp83Ala and Trp83Glu, ligands that close the main entrance do not inhibit substrate hydrolysis because the traffic can pass via an alternative route, presumably the enlarged back channel. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aactive sites 3ahydrolysis 3aligands 3amutants 3amutation1 aStojan, Jure1 aFournier, Didier0 tFEBS journal.g2008 May, v. 275, no. 10 p.2659-2664dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06413.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02227naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014900126300001600275500001500291520098600306650002101292650002101313650001701334650001001351650001301361650001301374650002701387650001601414650001801430650001101448650002701459650002301486650001101509650000901520650001801529653001301547653002601560653001101586700001601597773009001613852000901703930003301712945001301745946001101758655001201769IND2207036620221122012301.0001003s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220703662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKvaalen, H.10aCo-inoculation of Ceratocystis polonica and Heterobasidion annosum with callus of two Norway spruce clones with different in vivo susceptibility  ap. 221-228.  a2019-12-05  aWe have studied how callus cultures from two clones of Norway spruce influence the growth of two pathogens, Ceratocystis polonica and Heterobasidion annosum, when co-cultivated in vitro. In field experiments, trees of clone 409 were susceptible to both fungi, whereas clone 589 was less affected. Callus cultured on medium containing cytokinins (benzylaminopurine, kinetin) and with or without auxin (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid). For co-cultivation with fungus, one piece of callus was placed towards the edge of each Petri dish. One and 14 days after inoculation with callus the dishes were co-inoculated with the fungus. Both clones strongly stimulated the initial growth of both fungi. Clone 589 inhibited the growth of both fungi when the fungi were inoculated one day after the callus. When the callus was cultured on medium without auxin for 14 days before co-inoculation clone 589 strongly inhibited the growth of both fungi, whereas clone 409 inhibited H. annosum only. 3aclonal variation 3ain vitro culture 3aCeratocystis 3astems 3anecrosis 3amycelium 3aHeterobasidion annosum 3aPicea abies 3apathogenicity 3aphloem 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3aauxins 3abark 3aculture media 0asymptoms 0abiological resistance 0agrowth1 aSolheim, H.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 60, no. 3 p.221-228x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02956naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024007200110040001800182100001600200245008000216300001600296500001500312520118300327650001301510650001601523650001101539650001901550650001201569650002301581650002501604650005501629650001101684650006101695650003101756650002501787650003501812650004001847650002601887653001401913653002601927653001501953653002701968653001501995653002702010653001302037700001602050773012302066852000902189856012202198930003302320945001302353946001302366990002302379655001202402IND2051688420221122012640.0960613e199606  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205168842DNAL7 a86221842pmid7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199606)228:3<327::AID-JMOR4>3.0.CO;2-Z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasotti, G.10aFunctional morphology of the glomerular filtration barrier of Gallus gallus  ap. 327-334.  a2019-12-04  aThe anionic charge barrier and the endothelial and epithelial pore sizes on the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) were examined in white leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus). Ruthenium red was used to stain anionic charge sites on the GFB. The tissue was treated by normal dehydration and freeze substitution dehydration for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, the basal lamina was isolated for study. The results of our study indicate that G. gallus possess a thick, negatively charged glycocalyx surrounding the podocytes and slit diaphragm and on the endothelium. However, in all cases, little anionic charge is present in the basal lamina. The pores on the endothelium are elliptical and have mean dimensions of 148 X 110 nm. This is in contrast to mammals, which have smaller, round pores. The epithelial pores in G. gallus measure approximately 35 nm in length, approximately 4 times larger than those found in mammals. These results indicate that the avian glomerulus may allow the filtration of larger molecules from the plasma than occurs in mammals and that the charge on the molecule may not be as restrictive a filtration characteristic as in mammals. 3achickens 3aendothelium 3aanions 3aultrastructure 2aAnimals 2aAnionsxmetabolism 2aChickensxphysiology 2aEndothelium, Vascularxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aFemale 2aKidney Glomerulusxcytologyxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aKidney Tubulesxsecretion. 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aPorinsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aUric Acidxmetabolism 0apore size 0aglomerular filtration 0aglomerulus 0aanatomy and morphology 0aepithelium 0aanionic charge barrier 0abarriers1 aBraun, E.J.0 tJournal of morphology.g1996 June, v. 228, no. 3 p.327-334aJournal of morphology (Philadelphia, Pa.)x0362-25257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199606)228:3<327::AID-JMOR4>3.0.CO;2-Z3Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03576naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245009000174300001800264520203200282650002302314650001102337650001902348650002602367650003502393650001802428650001302446650002002459650001302479650001102492650001502503650001202518650001102530650000902541650002302550650001302573651000902586653002002595653001502615653002002630700002002650700002602670700002202696700002102718700001602739700002102755773012002776852000902896856008502905930003302990946001103023655001203034IND4436760120221122012531.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443676012DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-009-9512-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazari Samani, Aliakbar 10aFactors Controlling Gully Advancement and Models Evaluation (Hableh Rood Basin, Iran)  ap. 1531-1549.  aGully erosion is one of the most complicated and destructive forms of water erosion. In order to prevent this erosion, the important factors controlling gully heads must be understood. This paper examines gully head advancement in the Hableh Rood Basin, Iran by (1) observing gully head advance between 1957 and 2005 using field studies, aerial photography and GIS analysis and: (2) applying and evaluating widely used experimental models including the, Thompson (Trans ASAE 7(1):54-55, 1964), SCS (I) and SCS (II) models, for estimating migrating headcuts over the study period. The results showed that the highest mean gully advancement (0.26 m year ⁻ ¹) took place during the 1956-1967 period, with most gullies having lower and steady headcut retreat rates between 1967-2000 (0.21 m year ⁻ ¹) and 2000-2005 (0.15 m year ⁻ ¹). This suggests that the majority of gullies in the study area were still in the early stages of formation in the first study period and their formation may be linked to land use or climatic changes pre 1956. Analysis of the correlation between environmental characteristics of the study area and gully advancement indicated that the upslope area of head cuts and soluble mineral content of the soil were the two most important factors influencing the spatial and temporal variation of gully longitudinal development. Results of multiple regression revealed that the simple relation including upslope area and soluble minerals can explain 93% of total variance and relatively reflects the effects of runoff and waterfall process for headcut retreat. Application of statistical error analysis to evaluate the four gully advancement models showed that in comparison to other models, the second model of SCS has more reliable results for predicting longitudinal gully advancement in this study area and other similar regions. However, this study indicates that future modelling in the region should consider the role of soil soluble mineral content in predicting gully advancement. 3aaerial photography 3abasins 3aclimate change 3afield experimentation 3ageographic information systems 3agully erosion 3aland use 3amineral content 3aminerals 3amodels 3aprediction 3aravines 3arunoff 3asoil 3atemporal variation 3avariance 3aIran 0aEmpirical model 0aEvaluation 0aHeadcut retreat1 aAhmadi, Hassan 1 aMohammadi, Aliasghar 1 aGhoddousi, Jamal 1 aSalajegheh, Ali 1 aBoggs, Guy 1 aPishyar, Razieh 0 tWater resources management.g2010 June, v. 24, no. 8 p.1531-1549dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0920-47417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-009-9512-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03293naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011500127300001600242500001500258520200900273650000902282650001802291650001802309650001202327650001402339650001302353650002402366650002102390650001802411650001902429650002102448650002002469650001802489650002302507650001102530653003102541653002002572653002102592653001002613653001602623700001602639773009002655852000902745930003302754945001302787946001102800655001202811IND2207035920221122012030.0001003s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220703592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPattnaik, S.10aMorphogenic response of the alginate-encapsulated axillary buds from in vitro shoot cultures of six mulberries  ap. 177-185.  a2019-12-05  aAxillary buds obtained from in vitro shoot cultures of six mulberries (Morus alba L., M. australis Poir., M. bombycis Koidz., M. cathyana Hemsl., M. latifolia Poir., and M. nigra L.) were encapsulated in calcium alginate hydrogel containing Murashige and Skoog (1962) nutrients (MS) and 4.4 micromolar benzyladenine (BA). Morphogenic response of encapsulated buds to various planting media such as MS medium + 4.4 micromolar BA, MS basal medium, soilrite mix + half-strength MS medium, garden soil + half strength MS medium, soilrite mix + tap water and garden soil + tap water was evaluated. Encapsulated buds of M. alba, M. bombycis, M. latifolia and M. nigra exhibited shoot development in each of the six media tested whereas that of M. australis and M. cathyana responded only to the first four media. Analysis of variance revealed that the planting medium exhibited the greatest influence on shoot development. Of the six planting media evaluated, shoot development was highest in MS medium containing 4.4 micromolars BA and lowest in garden soil moistened with water. Of the six Morus species studies, one-step regeneration, i.e., both shoot and root formation, was recorded in M. alba, M. bombycis and M. latifolia. Rooted shoots were retrieved from encapsulated buds of these species on all planting media tested except the one that contained BA. Root development was significantly affected by the planting medium and the plant species with planting medium contributing the maximum amount (82%) of the total variation observed. Of the five planting media tested, the percentage of root development was highest in MS basal medium. Of the six Morus species studied, the best shoot and root development was observed in M. alba. Encapsulated buds of M. bombycis, M. latifolia and M. nigra stored for 90 days and those of M. alba, M australis and M. cathyana for 60 days at 4 degrees C still regenerated shoots. Plants regenerated from the encapsulated buds were hardened off and transferred to soil. 3abuds 3adose response 3amorphogenesis 3acalcium 3aalginates 3aexplants 3aindole butyric acid 3aartificial seeds 3aencapsulation 3apropionic acid 3amicropropagation 3aMorus australis 3aculture media 3aindole acetic acid 3ashoots 0amurashige and skoog medium 0amorus latifolia 0ain vitro culture 0aMorus 0aderivatives1 aChand, P.K.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 60, no. 3 p.177-185x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02823naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001800180245007400198300001800272520129300290650001801583650001901601650001501620650001501635650001601650650002301666650002201689650000901711650001001720650001501730650004101745650004901786650001601835650001201851650002801863650002301891650001601914650004501930650000901975650002201984650000902006650002202015700001802037700001902055700001602074773008902090852000902179930003302188945002502221946001102246655001202257IND4366881120221122012511.0050201e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436688112DNAL7 a153506832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBingham, A.K.10aIdentification and reduction of urinary aflatoxin metabolites in dogs  ap. 1851-1858.  aHydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS) is a phyllosilicate clay commonly used as an anticaking agent in animal feeds. HSCAS tightly and selectively adsorbs aflatoxin. In 1998, 55 dogs died in Texas after eating dog food containing aflatoxin (150-300 ppb). The corn in the diets was contaminated with aflatoxin. Six dogs were given a low-level, sub-clinical dose of aflatoxin B1. On average, 71.5% of aflatoxin M1 cleared within 6 h after dosing, increasing to 90.4% after 12 h. Aflatoxin M1 was no longer detectable in urine after 48 h. Aflatoxin P1 was not found in urine compared to large amounts of M1 and trace amounts of Q1. In a crossover study, six dogs randomly fed a commercial dog food (no-clay control) or coated with HSCAS (0.5% by weight) were subsequently administered a sub-clinical dose of aflatoxin B1. Diets were switched and the process repeated. The HSCAS-coated diet significantly reduced urinary aflatoxin M1 by 48.4% +/- 16.6 SD versus the control diet. In conclusion, HSCAS protects dogs fed diets with even minimal aflatoxin contamination. Despite regular and careful ingredient screening for aflatoxin, low concentrations may reach the final product undetected. Therefore, HSCAS may provide the pet food industry further assurance of canine diet safety. 3aclay minerals 3afeed additives 3aadsorbents 3aaflatoxins 3ametabolites 3afeed contamination 3atoxigenic strains 3adogs 3aurine 2aAdsorption 2aAflatoxinsxpharmacokineticsxurine. 2aAluminum Silicatesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDogsxurine 2aFood Contaminationxprevention & control 2aMale 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F3441 aHuebner, H.J.1 aPhillips, T.D.1 aBauer, J.E.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2004 Nov., v. 42, no. 11 p.1851-1858x0278-69157nnas  aDNAL  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/02/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02362naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245004900127300001600176500001500192520095500207650001801162650001801180650002101198650001101219650002101230650001501251650001301266650001801279650002301297650002101320650003601341650001301377650001801390650001101408650001101419653001601430653003101446653002101477653001801498653002301516653001601539653001701555653001601572653002301588653003401611700001901645773009001664852000901754930003301763945001301796946001101809655001201820IND2207035820221121235933.0001003s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220703582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLisowska, K.10aIn vitro propagation of Catalpa ovata G.

For shoot proliferation from shoot tips and nodal segments, Schenk and Hildebrandt (1972) or Lloyd and McCown (1980) basal media, supplemented with 6-benzyladenine (2.2-22.2 micromolar) alone or in combination with indole-3-acetic acid (0.6 micromolar), were used. Shoot regeneration through organogenesis was achieved by culturing cotyledons on Schenk and Hildebrandt medium containing indole-3-acetic acid (0.6 micromolar) and 6-benzyladenine (4.4 micromolar) or zeatin (22.8 micromolar). TLC and HPLC analysis showed that the multiple shoots and micropropagated plants exhibited similar iridoid patterns as those of the leaves of original plants of C. ovata. The highest levels of catalpol and catalposide (8.2 and 2.4% of dry weight, respectively) were found in aerial parts of three-month-old in vitro regenerated plants. 3aorganogenesis 3adose response 3agibberellic acid 3azeatin 3amedicinal plants 3acotyledons 3aexplants 3abenzyladenine 3aindole acetic acid 3amicropropagation 3achemical constituents of plants 3acatalpol 3aculture media 3acallus 3ashoots 0amethodology 0amurashige and skoog medium 0ain vitro culture 0acatalpa ovata 0awoody plant medium 0athidiazuron 0ashoot apices 0acatalposide 0airidoid glycosides 0aschenk and hildebrandt medium1 aWysokinska, H.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 60, no. 3 p.171-176x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03240naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245009200169300001800261520174400279650002002023650001702043650002602060650001102086650001602097650002202113650001402135650001902149650002102168650001102189650002002200650001702220650001902237650002202256650001002278651001102288653001602299653002202315653002002337653001602357653003502373700002802408700003702436773012302473852000902596856008502605930003302690946001102723655001202734IND4439161320221121235926.0100625e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443916132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-010-9845-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBudke, Jean Carlos 10aIntermediary disturbance increases tree diversity in riverine forest of southern Brazil  ap. 2371-2387.  aFloods are frequently associated with disturbance in structuring riverine forests and they lead to environmental heterogeneity over space and time. We evaluated the distribution of tree species, ecological groups, species richness and diversity from the point bar to the slope of a riverside forest in southern Brazil (Lat. 30°01′S, Long. 52°47′W) to analyze the effects of flooding on soil properties and forest structure. A plot of 50 × 200 m divided in five contiguous transects of 10 × 200 m parallel to the river was installed, where we measured all the individual trees with pbh ≥ 15 cm. A detailed topographical and soil survey was carried out across the plot and indicated significant differences in organic matter and most mineral nutrients through the topographical gradient. The 1,229 surveyed individuals belonged to 72 species and 35 families. We used Partial CCA and Species Indicator Analysis to observe the spatial distribution of species. Both analyses showed that species distribution was strongly related to the flooding gradient, soil properties and also by space and pure spatial structuring of species and environmental variables (spatial autocorrelation), although a large part of variation remains unexplained. The ecological groups of forest stratification, plant dispersal and requirements for germination indicated slight differences among frequently, occasional and non-flooded transects. Species richness and diversity were higher at intermediate elevations and were associated to the increased spatial-temporal environmental heterogeneity. Across the plot, the direct influence of flooding on tree species distribution created a vegetation zonation that is determined by predicted ecological traits. 3aautocorrelation 3abiogeography 3aenvironmental factors 3afloods 3agermination 3aindicator species 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3ariparian forests 3arivers 3asoil properties 3asoil surveys 3aspace and time 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aBrazil 0aDisturbance 0aEcological groups 0aFlooding regime 0aPartial CCA 0aSpecies richness and diversity1 aJarenkow, João André 1 aOliveira Filho, Ary Teixeira de.0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2010 July, v. 19, no. 8 p.2371-2387dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-010-9845-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100628b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01964naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008600125300001600211500001500227520093300242650001701175650002601192650001601218650002201234650002101256650002401277650002001301650002801321653001101349653001501360653001501375700001701390700001501407773009001422852000901512930003301521945001301554946001101567655001201578IND2207007220221121235854.0000929s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220700722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlieva, M.10aProduction of phosphohydrolases by Nicotiana tabacum 1507 cell suspension culture  ap. 155-158.  a2019-12-05  aThe time course of growth, biosynthesis and secretion of different phosphohydrolytic activities by Nicotiana tabacum 1507 cell suspension culture were investigated.

The highest enzyme activity was determined with bis-pNPP which is non-specific substrate for phosphodiesterases and for some nucleases (116.10(3) U/L at pH 5.7 and 51.10(3) U/L at pH 8.0). The different phosphohydrolytic activities were distinguished using specific substrates at pH 5.7 (20.10(3) U/L-5'-phosphodiesterases, 18, 8.10(3) U/L - 3' phosphodiesterases and 15, 5.10(3) U/L-phosphomonoesterases) and at pH 8.0 (10, 2.10(3) U/L-5'-phosphodiesterases, 9, 5.10(3) U/L-3'-phosphodiesterases and 6, 4.10(3) U/L-phosphomonoesterases). 3abiosynthesis 3aquantitative analysis 3acell growth 3aNicotiana tabacum 3amicropropagation 3aphosphodiesterase I 3aenzyme activity 3acell suspension culture 0atiming 0asubstrates 0ahydrolases1 aBakalova, A.1 aPavlov, A.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 60, no. 2 p.155-158x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03541naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245021500193300001400408520137900422650001501801650001301816650001701829650003701846650001201883650001501895650001201910650001201922650001401934650001501948650001201963650001201975650001101987650001001998650001602008650001202024650002802036650003802064650003702102650005702139650003302196650003602229650001502265650003902280650006102319650001502380650003102395650003702426650004402463653005102507653002002558700002502578700002502603773013002628852000902758856009202767930003302859946001102892655001202903IND4432308620221122000412.0100205e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443230862DNAL7 a201636742pmid7 a10.1111/j.1740-0929.2009.00716.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiarie, Elijah G.10aEffect of products derived from hydrolysis of wheat and flaxseed non starch polysaccharides by carbohydrase enzymes on net absorption in enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (K88) challenged piglet jejunal segments  ap. 63-71.  aEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection results in fluid and electrolyte losses in the small intestine. We investigated the effect of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) hydrolysis products of wheat middlings (WM) and flaxseed (FS) on net absorption of fluid and solutes during ETEC challenge. Products were generated by incubating WM and FS with a blend of carbohydrase enzymes to produce 2 products: 80% ethanol-soluble (ES) and 80% ethanol-insoluble (EI) which were studied in 2 experiments in which 2 factors were investigated: products (EI vs. ES) and time of ETEC challenge (before vs. after perfusion). Pairs of small-intestine segments, one non-challenged and the other ETEC-challenged were perfused with products for 7.5 h. ETEC reduced fluid absorption by more than 380 μL/cm² in saline (control) perfused segments, whereas this reduction was significantly (P < 0.05) less for the WM and FS products. Interaction (P > 0.05) between product and time of challenge was not observed. For WM, products effects on ETEC-challenged segments were such that perfusion of ES resulted in higher total solute (measured as osmolality) absorption than EI (138 vs. 103 μOsmol/cm²). In conclusion, hydrolysis products from WM and FS were beneficial in maintaining fluid balance during ETEC challenge, suggesting potential in controlling ETEC induced diarrhea in piglets. 3aabsorption 3adiarrhea 3aelectrolytes 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3aenzymes 3ahydrolysis 3ajejunum 3alinseed 3amiddlings 3aosmolality 3apiglets 3asolutes 3astarch 3awheat 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBody Fluidsxmetabolism 2aDiarrheaxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aFlaxxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxchemistry 2aHydrolysis 2aJejunumxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPolysaccharidesxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aSus scrofa 2aSwine Diseasesxmetabolism 2aTriticumxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aWater-Electrolyte Balancexdrug effects 0anon starch polysaccharides hydrolysis products 0apiglet diarrhea1 aSlominski, Bogdan A.1 aNyachoti, Charles M.0 tAnimal science journal =.g2010 Feb., v. 81, no. 1 p.63-71dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1344-39417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-0929.2009.00716.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20120413b20120504c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02434naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007200092040001800164100001600182245004300198300001600241500001500257520126700272650001301539650000901552650002501561650001501586650001901601653001501620653001701635653002701652700001701679700001601696773012301712852000901835856012201844930003301966945001301999946001302012990002302025655001202048IND2054574320221122000821.0961220e199612  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205457432DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199612)230:3<283::AID-JMOR3>3.0.CO;2-F2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirol, A.P.10aMast cells in the developing avian eye  ap. 283-290.  a2019-12-04  aMast cells are present in the eye of Gallus domesticus, appearing in the anterior uvea in embryos at stage 39 HH (13th day). In hatching and adult birds, they are present in the sclera, uvea, pectinate ligament, and conjunctiva. Mast cells are absent in the cornea, retina, and pecten oculi. Maturing mast cells in the anterior eye segment appear as round cells having eccentric nuclei and a few cytoplasmic metachromatic granules, whose fluorescence increases during development. Mature cells are more numerous in late development, and their cytoplasm is rich in metachromatic and intensely fluorescent granules. Ultrastructurally, maturing mast cells display progranules and a few electron dense and homogeneous granules on one side of the cell. Mast cells of adult birds possess homogeneous cytoplasmic granules, some of which display protuberances that penetrate hollows of adjoining granules. Heterogeneous granules exhibiting latticed and mottled patterns are also present. The existence of mast cells in the anterior eye segment indicates that these cells might perform a physiological role during development and in aqueous humor outflow. They might modulate exchanges between blood and aqueous humor through chemical mediators present in their granules. 3achickens 3aeyes 3adevelopmental stages 3amast cells 3aultrastructure 0amaturation 0adistribution 0aanatomy and morphology1 aOliani, S.M.1 aSmith, R.L.0 tJournal of morphology.g1996 Dec., v. 230, no. 3 p.283-290aJournal of morphology (Philadelphia, Pa.)x0362-25257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199612)230:3<283::AID-JMOR3>3.0.CO;2-F3Available from publisher's Web site  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02886naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245012800131300001600259500001500275520138200290650001701672650001801689650002301707650002201730650001401752650001301766650001601779650002201795650001801817650001601835650002501851650002001876650001901896650001701915650001801932650001001950650001701960653001401977653001001991653002202001653001502023653002102038653001402059653001502073700001902088700001502107700001602122700002602138773009002164852000902254930003302263945001302296946001102309655001202320IND2207006920221122001019.0000929s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220700692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoitel-Conti, M.10aInfluence of feeding precursors on tropane alkaloid production during an abiotic stress in Datura innoxia transformed roots  ap. 131-137.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of feeding tropane alkaloid precursors in transformed root culture of Datura innoxia Mill. were studied during a stress treatment. The permeabilizing effect of Tween 20 on tropane alkaloid production by hairy root cultures was studied in flasks with different feeding of precursors (L-ornithine, L-arginine, L-phenylalanine, DL-beta-phenyllactic acid, and tropinone). It has been shown that the addition of various precursors alone (0.5 m mol l-1) was ineffective in stimulating hyoscyamine production. In contrast, a short treatment with Tween 20, combined with L-phenylalanine feeding, amplified the level of hyoscyamine released into the medium compared with the Tween treatment alone. Thus, the total hyoscyamine content per flask was increased (+ 40%) compared with the control. When DL-beta-phenyllactic acid (0.5 m mol l-1) was used, this last effect became more pronounced (+ 60%). These results show that permeabilization with Tween modulates tropane alkaloid accumulation by a release of alkaloids into the medium and a restoration of hyoscyamine root content. The simultaneous feeding of DL-beta-phenyllactic acid and tropinone during the Tween treatment gave a similar effect to that obtained with DL-beta-phenyllactic acid and Tween, suggesting that the synthesis of the tropate moiety determines the flux at the level of the esterification of tropine. 3abiosynthesis 3adose response 3achemical reactions 3atransgenic plants 3aornithine 3aarginine 3ascopolamine 3aphenyllactic acid 3aculture media 3asurfactants 3abiochemical pathways 3astress response 3acultured cells 3aDatura metel 3aphenylalanine 3aroots 3apermeability 0atropinone 0atween 0atropane alkaloids 0aprecursors 0apermeabilization 0alittorine 0ahyoscamine1 aLaberche, J.C.1 aLanoue, A.1 aDucrocq, C.1 aSangwan-Norreel, B.S.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 60, no. 2 p.131-137x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle04291naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245012800172300001800300520298300318650001303301650001703314650001203331650001103343650001803354650001403372650001103386650001503397650001203412650000903424650001203433650001403445650001303459700002903472700001903501700002003520700002203540700002603562773011203588852000903700856009203709930003303801946001103834655001203845IND4404902120221122000947.0080425e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440490212DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06409.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasson, Patrick10aKinetic analysis of effector modulation of butyrylcholinesterase-catalysed hydrolysis of acetanilides and homologous esters  ap. 2617-2631.  aThe effects of tyramine, serotonin and benzalkonium on the esterase and aryl acylamidase activities of wild-type human butyrylcholinesterase and its peripheral anionic site mutant, D70G, were investigated. The kinetic study was carried out under steady-state conditions with neutral and positively charged aryl acylamides [o-nitrophenylacetanilide, o-nitrotrifluorophenylacetanilide and m-(acetamido) N,N,N-trimethylanilinium] and homologous esters (o-nitrophenyl acetate and acetylthiocholine). Tyramine was an activator of hydrolysis for neutral substrates and an inhibitor of hydrolysis for positively charged substrates. The affinity of D70G for tyramine was lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. Tyramine activation of hydrolysis for neutral substrates by D70G was linear. Tyramine was found to be a pure competitive inhibitor of hydrolysis for positively charged substrates with both wild-type butyrylcholinesterase and D70G. Serotonin inhibited both esterase and aryl acylamidase activities for both positively charged and neutral substrates. Inhibition of wild-type butyrylcholinesterase was hyperbolic (i.e. partial) with neutral substrates and linear with positively charged substrates. Inhibition of D70G was linear with all substrates. A comparison of the effects of tyramine and serotonin on D70G versus the wild-type enzyme indicated that: (a) the peripheral anionic site is involved in the nonlinear activation and inhibition of the wild-type enzyme; and (b) in the presence of charged substrates, the ligand does not bind to the peripheral anionic site, so that ligand effects are linear, reflecting their sole interaction with the active site binding locus. Benzalkonium acted as an activator at low concentrations with neutral substrates. High concentrations of benzalkonium caused parabolic inhibition of the activity with neutral substrates for both wild-type butyrylcholinesterase and D70G, suggesting multiple binding sites. Benzalkonium caused linear, noncompetitive inhibition of the positively charged aryl acetanilide m-(acetamido) N,N,N-trimethylanilinium for D70G, and an unusual mixed-type inhibition/activation (α > β > 1) for wild-type butyrylcholinesterase with this substrate. No fundamental difference was observed between the effects of ligands on the butyrylcholinesterase-catalysed hydrolysis of esters and amides. Thus, butyrylcholinesterase uses the same machinery, i.e. the catalytic triad S198/H448/E325, for the hydrolysis of both types of substrate. The differences in response to ligand binding depend on whether the substrates are neutral or positively charged, i.e. the differences depend on the function of the peripheral site in wild-type butyrylcholinesterase, or the absence of its function in the D70G mutant. The complex inhibition/activation effects of effectors, depending on the integrity of the peripheral anionic site, reflect the allosteric 'cross-talk' between the peripheral anionic site and the catalytic centre. 3aacetates 3aactive sites 3aamidase 3aamides 3abinding sites 3aesterases 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3aligands 3aloci 3amutants 3aserotonin 3atyramine1 aFroment, Marie-Thérèse1 aGillon, Emilie1 aNachon, Florian1 aLockridge, Oksana1 aSchopfer, Lawrence M.0 tFEBS journal.g2008 May, v. 275, no. 10 p.2617-2631dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06409.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02594naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245013400179300001600313500002400329520141100353650001401764650001501778650001401793650001201807650001801819650001201837650001401849650000901863650001401872650000901886650001201895650001601907650002101923651001401944700001901958700002301977773009902000852000902099856007602108655001202184IND4379666820221121230716.0060416s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437966682DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01561.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldsbrough, Claire L.10aFactors affecting retreat-site selection by coppertail skinks (Ctenotus taeniolatus) from sandstone outcrops in eastern Australia  ap. 326-336.  aIncludes references  aCoppertail skinks (Ctenotus taeniolatus) are medium-sized diurnal lizards that are widespread in eastern Australia. Field surveys on sandstone outcrops in the Sydney region showed that these animals use available rocks non-randomly: coppertails were found under large, sun-exposed rocks on deep soil. Choice trials in the laboratory documented selection of retreat sites that were warm, with substrate preferences shifting in a diel cycle. Lizards selected retreats with rock substrates during the day but with sandy substrates at night. Rocky retreats attain higher temperatures during daylight hours, but burrows in sand beneath rocks may provide greater protection against ingress by nocturnal predators. During fieldwork we rarely found lizards under rocks with either ants or centipedes, suggesting that coppertails may avoid these predatory invertebrates. Tongue-flick trials showed that the lizards could discriminate among common ant species based on chemosensory cues, but apparently could not detect centipede chemical cues. In experimental trials, the lizards did not avoid retreat sites scented by either ants or centipedes. Our data thus suggest that retreat-site selection in coppertails is driven by abiotic cues (rock size, sun exposure and substrate type) that may confer fitness benefits in terms of thermoregulation and predator avoidance, with biotic cues playing a less important role. 3aChilopoda 3aFormicidae 3aScincidae 3aburrows 3ainvertebrates 3alizards 3apredators 3asand 3asandstone 3asoil 3asurveys 3atemperature 3athermoregulation 3aAustralia1 aShine, Richard1 aHochuli, Dieter F.0 tAustral ecology.g2006 May, v. 31, no. 3 p.326-336dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01561.x3electronic resource 7aarticle03422naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245007900167300001600246500002400262520227700286650001802563650002002581650001702601650002602618650001302644650001702657650001302674650004002687650001602727650002302743650001002766650001902776651001602795700001402811700001402825773010002839852000902939856007602948655001203024IND4381055320221121230657.0060615s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438105532DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01609.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDENYER, K.10aBuffering of native forest edge microclimate by adjoining tree plantations  ap. 478-489.  aIncludes references  aIn the Waikato Region of New Zealand, Pinus radiata (D. Don) plantations are becoming increasingly common on land adjacent to native forest fragments. It is unclear whether this juxtaposition is beneficial or detrimental to native forest fragment quality and persistence. We hypothesized that adjacent dense plantations buffer native fragments from microclimatic exposure, reducing edge effects and expanding the area of interior-like native forest. Microclimate parameters were measured in native forest fragments adjacent to grazed pasture ('abrupt' edges) and in fragments adjacent to mature P. radiata plantations ('embedded' edges) during late summer. Photosynthetically active radiation, air temperature and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) were measured along transects perpendicular to edges during the mid-afternoon, when gradients were typically steady and maximal, to investigate spatial variation. At paired abrupt versus embedded edges these same variables were monitored for week-long periods to determine temporal variation. In fragments adjacent to pasture, conditions were significantly lighter and warmer (but not drier) than the interior along transects at distances up to 20 m from the edge. In contrast, no variables differed significantly along transects adjacent to pine. The different microclimate variables measured at edges (except VPD) contributed to edge effects at different times through a daily cycle. Photosynthetically active radiation was significantly different between abrupt and embedded edges at all times of the day. Air temperature was significantly different during mid-day and afternoon, but not during the morning nor at night. Vapour pressure deficit varied considerably over time and between sites, but was never consistently higher at one type of edge. We conclude that pine plantations in the Waikato Region provide valuable microclimate buffering during the day, principally due to their effect in reducing light and temperature to interior-like conditions at native forest edges. Consequently, plantations are a compatible neighbouring land use to forest fragments. Such buffering could be extended through the pine harvesting-replanting phase with appropriate management, such as leaving an undisturbed margin during harvest. 3aPinus radiata 3aair temperature 3aedge effects 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aland use 3amicroclimate 3apastures 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aplantations 3atemporal variation 3atrees 3avapor pressure 3aNew Zealand1 aBurns, B.1 aOGDEN, J.0 tAustral ecology.g2006 June, v. 31, no. 4 p.478-489dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01609.x3electronic resource 7aarticle02724naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245012100177300001600298500002400314500001500338520155300353650001501906650002601921650001801947650001301965650001701978650001301995650002202008650001502030650001002045650001202055651001502067653001202082700002402094700002302118773010002141852000902241856007602250655001202326IND4381055120221121220800.0060615s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438105512DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01606.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGRIMBACHER, PETER S.10aBeetle species' responses suggest that microclimate mediates fragmentation effects in tropical Australian rainforest  ap. 458-470.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aDespite the enormous contribution of invertebrates to global biodiversity and ecosystem function, the patterns and causes of insect responses to tropical rainforest destruction and fragmentation remain poorly understood. We studied the responses of beetles to these factors in a fragmented upland rainforest landscape in north-east Queensland, Australia. Beetles were sampled using flight interception traps from six replicate sites in rainforest interior, rainforest edge, small rainforest remnants and pasture, interspersed across about 600 km². Beetles from 10 family/subfamily groups were sorted to species. There were three major findings. First, converting rainforest into pasture has a very strong negative effect on beetle diversity and species composition. Very few beetle species were present in pasture and none of the most abundant species was more abundant in pasture than rainforest. Second, beetle assemblages appeared to respond to climate. Beetle species composition in drier rainforest habitats was different from that of moister rainforest and there were species unique to each rainforest type. Third, beetle species composition differed between small remnants and interior rainforest: drier-associated species were more abundant in small remnants, whereas wetter-associated species were more abundant in interiors. Edges tended to be intermediate. We argue that this pattern can be attributed to a fragmentation effect mediated by differences in microclimate rather than by floristic, structural, or area and isolation effects. 3aColeoptera 3atropical rain forests 3ainvertebrates 3apastures 3amicroclimate 3ahabitats 3aspecies diversity 3aecosystems 3atraps 3ainsects 3aQueensland 0aclimate1 aCATTERALL, CARLA P.1 aKITCHING, ROGER L.0 tAustral ecology.g2006 June, v. 31, no. 4 p.458-470dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01606.x3electronic resource 7aarticle03565naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245019300174300001600367500002400383520214900407650002302556650002302579650002702602650002802629650002502657650002302682650002302705650002302728650001702751650001202768650001102780650001902791650002302810650001402833650000902847650002002856650001602876700002202892700002102914773009902935852000903034856007603043655001203119IND4379668520221121220638.0060416s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437966852DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01608.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPryor, Rebecca J.10aWaterlogging duration: Interspecific comparison of Leptospermum scoparium (Forst et Forst.f.), Acacia melanoxylon (R.

Br.), Eucalyptus obliqua (L'Herit) and Nothofagus cunninghamii (Hook.). These species co-occur, but are restricted to particular microsites. The three waterlogging treatments applied to potted seedlings were: four cycles of 15 days, two cycles of 30 days or one 60-day cycle, followed by an equal period in freely drained conditions. Water potential, gas exchange, biomass accumulation and survival were not significantly affected by the duration of waterlogging in L. scoparium or A. melanoxylon. With increased waterlogging duration, N. cunninghamii had progressively decreased survival, had less biomass accumulation in all waterlogging treatments and more negative water potential after the 60-day waterlogging cycle. In contrast, E. obliqua had low survival under the 15-day waterlogging cycle treatment, although survival, biomass accumulation and maximum net photosynthesis were decreased by all waterlogging cycle treatments. Water potential was significantly lower (more negative) in E. obliqua than other species after the 30- and 60-day waterlogging cycle treatments only. When exposed to oxygen deficit in hypoxic nutrient culture for 5 days, L. scoparium had 100% survival and maximum net photosynthesis was not affected. Acacia melanoxylon had 80% survival and decreased photosynthesis from 2 days of exposure onwards. Nothofagus cunninghamii and E. obliqua had 70% and 30% survival, respectively, and their photosynthesis was significantly depressed after 1 day of exposure to hypoxic conditions. Relative tolerance of the species examined to waterlogging and hypoxia was consistent with adaptation to conditions of seasonal variation in water table height and soil oxygenation concentration observed at the microsites occupied by the respective species. The results indicate that duration of waterlogging may be a major determinant in the microsite distribution of the co-occurring species investigated. 3aAcacia melanoxylon 3aEucalyptus obliqua 3aLeptospermum scoparium 3aNothofagus cunninghamii 3aanaerobic conditions 3abiomass production 3adrained conditions 3aflooded conditions 3agas exchange 3ahypoxia 3aoxygen 3aphotosynthesis 3aseasonal variation 3aseedlings 3asoil 3awater potential 3awater table1 aDavidson, Neil J.1 aClose, Dugald C.0 tAustral ecology.g2006 May, v. 31, no. 3 p.408-416dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01608.x3electronic resource 7aarticle01811naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245010300143300001200246300001700258500001500275520066700290650001600957650001700973650001400990650001201004650001301016650001701029650002001046650001401066650002901080650004001109650002501149650002501174650005701199653001701256773007301273852000901346939003301355946001301388655001201401IND9101491920221121220718.0910321s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910149192DNAL7 a23673462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsen, K.10aPurification of nodule-specific uricase from soybean by arginine-sepharose affinity chromatography  ap. 1-9.  ap. 1-9. ill.  a2019-12-05  aA method to purify uricase from soybean root nodules is described. The separation uses a single affinity chromatography step on Arginine-Sepharose, which was constructed by coupling L-Arginine to Activated CH-Sepharose 4B. Crude extracts were loaded onto small columns of Arginine-Sepharose and a significant retardation of uricase was observed. With a re-run of the fraction containing maximal uricase activity on the same column highly purified enzyme was obtained. Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two protein bands. Analytical isoelectric focusing showed two isoforms of uricase, one dominating with pI 9.0 and a minor with pI 7.0. 3aGlycine max 3abiosynthesis 3auric acid 3aureides 3asoybeans 3aroot nodules 3aoxidoreductases 3aallantoin 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aIsoelectric Focusing 2aSoybeansxenzymology 2aUrate Oxidasexisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 0apurification0 tPreparative biochemistry.g1990, v. 20, no. 1 p.1-9x0032-74847nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02832naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011300124300001400237500001500251520130500266650001601571650001701587650002501604650001801629650002101647650001001668650001101678650001801689650001101707650002401718650001801742650001501760650001301775650002701788650001201815650001801827650002301845650001701868650001101885650002401896650001001920650002101930650002801951653002501979653001602004653003102020653001802051700001802069700001302087773008802100852000902188930003302197945001302230946001102243655001202254IND2279275520221121144025.0010410s2000    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND227927552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, A.T.10aCell suspension culture and plant regeneration in the latex-producing plant, Calotropis gigantea (Linn) R.Br  ap. 15-22.  a2019-12-05  aA procedure is outlined for the establishment of a proliferating cell suspension culture and subsequent plant regeneration of the latex-producing plant, Calotropis gigantea (Linn.) R. Br. Friable calluses were obtained by culturing hypocotyl explants on modified Murashige and Skoog medium with 2.69 micromolar alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid and 4.44 micromolar 6-benzyl-aminopurine. Friable calluses were transferred to modified Murashige and Skoog liquid medium containing 500 mg l-1 casein hydrolysate, 5% (v/v) coconut water and 5% (w/v) sucrose to initiate suspension cultures. Suspensions were subcultured every 10-12 days and supplemented with 13.56 micromolar 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). After 3-4 subcultures, suspensions consisted of small, highly cytoplasmic cell clumps and large vacuolate cells. Plating the suspension clumps on medium containing 4.52 micromolar 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and culturing in darkness produced macroscopic calluses, which subsequently produced a high number of shoots when placed in light and supplemented with 2.22 micromolar 6-benzyl-aminopurine and 0.45 micromolar 2,4-dicholorophenoxyacetic acid. Shoots were rooted using Bonner's solution containing 0.49 micromolar indole-3-butyric acid, and the plants successfully transferred to soil. 3acell growth 3aenergy crops 3adevelopmental stages 3abenzyladenine 3amicropropagation 3a2,4-D 3acallus 3aorganogenesis 3ashoots 3aCalotropis gigantea 3adose response 3ahypocotyls 3aexplants 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3akinetin 3aculture media 3aindole acetic acid 3ahydrocarbons 3azeatin 3aindole butyric acid 3alatex 3aplant morphology 3acell suspension culture 0aregenerative ability 0amethodology 0ap-chlorophenoxyacetic acid 0aplant anatomy1 aKoutoulis, A.1 aDe, D.N.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2000, v. 63, no. 1 p.15-22x0167-68577nnas  aDNAL  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01247naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099245004200117300001300159520051200172650001300684650001900697650001700716650002000733650001700753650001500770650002400785650002300809651001200832773005100844852000900895939003300904945000800937655001200945991573730810742620221121143958.0780901s1978    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894833732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aNutrition education campaign launched  ap. 8-10.  aThree phases of a mass media nutrition education campaign which is intended to produce awareness of the nutritional status of Jamaicans and the means whereby existing nutritional problems may be alleviated are described.

Females mate regularly and are able to store sperm for at least 6 months. If multiple mating is frequent, this would raise the intriguing question about the role of female choice and male-male competition in shaping the mating system of these fishes. Size-dependent alternate mating strategies occur in Xiphophorus; one such strategy is courtship with a sigmoid display by large dominant males, while the other is gonopodial thrusting, in which small subordinate males sneak copulations. Using microsatellite markers, we observed a frequency of multiple paternity in wild-caught Xiphophorus multilineatus in 28% of families analyzed, but the actual frequency of multiple mating suggested by the correction factor PrDM was 33%. The number of fathers contributing genetically to the brood ranged from one to three. Compared to other species in the family Poeciliidae, both frequency and degree of multiple paternity were low. Paternity was found to be highly skewed, with one male on average contributing more than 70% to the offspring. Hence in this Xiphophorus mating system, typically one male dominates and sneaker males do not appear to be particularly effective. Postcopulatory mechanisms, however, such as sperm competition, are also indicated by our data, using sex-linked phenotypes among the offspring. 3aXiphophorus 3acourtship 3afathers 3afemales 3afish 3amales 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apaternity 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3asexual selection 3asperm competition 3aspermatozoa 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aCyprinodontiformesxgenetics 2aDNAxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPaternity 2aPhenotype 2aReproductionxgenetics 2aSex Characteristics1 aSanetra, M.1 aSchartl, M.1 aMeyer, A.0 tJournal of heredity.g2005 July, v. 96, no. 4 p.346-355dPublished for the American Genetic Association by Oxford University Pressx0022-15037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esi0423Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01221naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245003200115300001400147300002800161520052000189650001600709650001200725650001500737650001200752653001800764773009800782852000900880939003300889945000800922946001300930655001200943991573727450742620221121051759.0800905s1978    xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800021812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aManaging the metric mystery  ap. 80-87.  ap. 80-87. ill., charts.  aThe ease of adjusting to the metric system for cooking and food shopping is stressed.

The "mycetome" is an aggregation of numerous granules of various sizes. We found no membrane encapsulating the aggregation of granules. Two types of granules are distinguishable: the smaller ones filled with electron-dense material and the larger ones with inclusion of myelin-like structures. Each of the granules has a limiting membrane. The limiting membrane is a simple unit membrane but shows no characteristics of cell walls. No nucleoid or nucleoplasm is detected in the granules. The "mycetome" takes up dyes whose specific incorporation into lysosomes has been demonstrated. In addition, a high activity of acid phosphatase is demonstrated in the "mycetome." These characteristics apparently indicated that the "mycetome" of Bactrothrips brevitubus is an aggregation of lysosomes but not a clump of microorganisms. Thus we propose that the structure being regarded as the mycetome should be renamed the "lysosomal aggregation." 3agranules 3aanatomy and morphology 3aultrastructure 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aoocytes 3aThysanoptera 0astructure 0aova1 aMatsuzaki, M.1 aHaga, K.0 tJournal of morphology.g1994 Aug., v. 221, no. 2 p.235-242aJournal of morphology (Philadelphia, Pa.)x0362-25257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmor.10522102113Available from publisher's Web site  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01907naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013100159520077200290592002801062650003401090650001501124650001701139650001801156650001101174650001501185650001301200650001701213650001201230700002601242700002901268700002301297700002201320773012101342856007301463852000901536655001201545IND60748770820221120155535.0210827e20210729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074877082DNAL7 a10.3390/v130814942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaykov, Ivan K.10aComputational and Rational Design of Single-Chain Antibody against Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus for Modifying Its Specificity  aTick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes 5−7 thousand cases of human meningitis and encephalitis annually.

This antibody exhibits a high affinity for binding with the D3 domain of the glycoprotein E of the Far Eastern subtype of the virus, but a lower affinity for the D3 domains of the Siberian and European subtypes. In this study, a 2.2-fold increase in the affinity of single-chain antibody sc14D5 to D3 proteins of the Siberian and European subtypes of the virus was achieved using rational design and computational modeling. This improvement can be further enhanced in the case of the bivalent binding of the full-length chimeric antibody containing the identified mutation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTick-borne encephalitis virus 3aantibodies 3aencephalitis 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3ameningitis 3amutation 3atherapeutics 3aviruses1 aDesyukevich, Pavel Y.1 aMikhaylova, Ekaterina E.1 aKurchenko, Olga M.1 aTikunova, Nina V.0 tViruses.g2021 July 29, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130814943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04003naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245012600204300001600330500002000346520224400366592002802610596004102638596007102679596010902750596004802859650002002907650001902927650001202946650002002958650001002978650003002988650001603018650001403034650002203048650001103070650001003081651003103091700006303122700002003185700002203205700006703227773012603294856008003420961001203500852000903512655001203521IND60761979820221123020445.0220106e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076197982DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.140562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, Peter W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8931-727110aEcological memory and regional context influence performance of adaptation plantings in northeastern US temperate forests  ap. 314-329.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSpecies distribution models predict shifts in forest habitat in response to warming temperatures associated with climate change, yet tree migration rates lag climate change, leading to misalignment of current species assemblages with future climate conditions. Forest adaptation strategies have been proposed to deliberately adjust species composition by planting climate‐suitable species. Practical evaluations of adaptation plantings are limited, especially in the context of ecological memory or extreme climate events. In this study, we examined the 3‐year survival and growth response of future climate‐adapted seedling transplants within operational‐scale silvicultural trials across temperate forests in the northeastern US. Nine species were selected for evaluation based on projected future importance under climate change and potential functional redundancy with species currently found in these ecosystems. We investigated how adaptation planting type (‘population enrichment’ vs. ‘assisted range expansion’) and local site conditions reinforce interference interactions with existing vegetation at filtering adaptation strategies focused on transitioning forest composition. Our results show the performance of seedling transplants is based on species (e.g. functional attributes and size), the strength of local competition (e.g. ecological memory) and adaptation planting type, a proxy for source distance. These findings were consistent across regional forests but modified by site‐specific conditions such as browse pressure and extreme climate events, namely drought and spring frost events. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight that managing forests for shifts in future composition represents a promising adaptation strategy for incorporating new species and functional traits into contemporary forests. Yet, important barriers remain for the establishment of future climate‐adapted forests that will most likely require management intervention. Nonetheless, the broader applicability of our findings demonstrates the potential for adaptation plantings to serve as strategic source nodes for the establishment of future climate‐adapted species across functionally connected landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data  a1920908cNational Science Foundation  a16JV11242307‐075cU.S. Forest Service, Northern Research Station  cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture McIntire‐Stennis Cooperative Forestry Research Program  cNortheast Climate Adaptation Science Center 3aapplied ecology 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aforest habitats 3afrost 3ageographical distribution 3anew species 3aseedlings 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3atrees 3aNortheastern United States1 aD'Amato, Anthony W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2570-43761 aEvans, Kevin S.1 aSchaberg, Paul G.1 aWoodall, Christopher W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8076-62140 tJournal of applied ecology.g2022 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.314-329dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.140563Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009900172300001600271520131900287592002801606650002301634650001101657650002801668650001201696650001101708650001201719650002201731650001201753653001601765653002101781653002001802653002001822653002101842700001801863700001601881700001401897773010401911856008702015852000902102655001202111IND60552606420221120172629.0161021e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055260642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yongjuan14aThe experimental and numerical investigation of pistol bullet penetrating soft tissue simulant  ap. 271-279.  aGelatin, a representative simulant for soft tissue of the human body, was used to study the effects of 9mm pistol bullet's penetration. The behavior of a bullet penetrating gelatin was quantified by the temporary cavity sizes in ballistic gelatin and the pressure values of bullet's impact. A numerical simulation model of a bullet penetrating the soft tissue simulant gelatin was built using the finite element method (FEM). The model was validated by the comparison between the numerical results and the experimental results. During a bullet penetrating ballistic gelatin, four stages were clearly observed in both the experiment and the numerical simulation: a smooth attenuation stage, a rolling stage, a full penetration stage, and a stage of expansion and contraction. The cavity evolution, equivalent stress field and the strain field in gelatin were analyzed by numerical simulation. Moreover, the effects of the bullet's impact velocities and angles of incidence on the temporary cavity in gelatin, its velocity attenuation, and its rolling angle were investigated, as well as the bullet's resistance and energy variation. The physical process and the interactive mechanism during a pistol bullet penetrating gelatin were comprehensively revealed. This may be significant for research in wound ballistics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangle of incidence 3aenergy 3afinite element analysis 3agelatin 3ahumans 3arolling 3asimulation models 3atissues 0aPenetration 0aCavity evolution 0aEnergy transfer 0aTissue simulant 0aWound ballistics1 aShi, Xiaoning1 aChen, Aijun1 aXu, Cheng0 tForensic science international.g2015 Apr., v. 249 p.271-279dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003900150245010300189300001600292520198500308592002802293650001002321650001302331650001802344650001302362650002502375650000902400650002102409650001502430650000902445650001402454650001602468650002502484650001202509653002802521653002302549653003402572653001902606653001402625653002902639700002102668700002102689700002302710700002402733773010702757856008502864852000902949655001202958IND60582839820221118053534.0180911e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058283982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.08.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakatounis, Panagiotis Eleftherios10aManagement of oil spill contamination in the Gulf of Patras caused by an accidental subsea blowout  ap. 578-588.  aA methodology is presented and applied to assess the oil contamination probability in the Gulf of Patras and the environmental impacts on the environmentally sensitive area of Mesolongi – Aitoliko coastal lagoons, and to examine the effectiveness of response systems. The procedure consists of the following steps: (1) Determination of the computational domain and the main areas of interest, (2) determination of the drilling sites and oil release characteristics, (3) selection of the simulation periods and collection of environmental data, (4) identification of the species of interest and their characteristics, (5) performance of stochastic calculations and oil contamination probability analysis, (6) determination of the worst-cases, (7) determination of the characteristics of response systems, (8) performance of deterministic calculations, and (9) assessment of the impact of oil spill in the areas of interest. Stochastic calculations that were performed for three typical seasonal weather variations of the year 2015, three oil release sites and specific oil characteristics, showed that there is a considerable probability of oil pollution that reaches 30% in the Mesolongi – Aitoliko lagoons. Based on a simplified approach regarding the characteristic of the sensitive birds and fish in the lagoons, deterministic calculations showed that 78–90% of the bird population and 2–4% of the fish population are expected to be contaminated in the case of an oil spill without any intervention. The use of dispersants reduced the amount of stranded oil by approximately 16–21% and the contaminated bird population of the lagoons to approximately 70%; however, the affected fish population increased to 6–8.5% due to the higher oil concentration in the water column. Mechanical recovery with skimmers “cleaned” almost 10% of the released oil quantity, but it did not have any noticeable effect on the stranded oil and the impacted bird and fish populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3acleaning 3acoastal water 3adrilling 3aenvironmental impact 3afish 3afish communities 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apollution 3aprobability 3aprobability analysis 3aweather 0aOil spill contamination 0aOil spill modeling 0aOil contamination probability 0aSubsea blowout 0aMesolongi 0aAitoliko coastal lagoons1 aSkancke, Jørgen1 aFlorou, Evanthia1 aStamou, Anastasios1 aBrandvik, Per Johan0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017 Dec., v. 231 p.578-588dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.08.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152024003900171040001800210100002300228245011400251300001600365506007600381520122300457592002801680596008301708596008301791596008801874596010601962596004702068596006102115506003702176650002502213650001702238650002302255650001702278650001102295650001002306650001402316650001902330650002102349650001802370650001502388650001202403700002402415700002902439773015302468856008202621852000902703655001202712IND60633790820221207100345.0190321e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063379082DNAL7 a10.1007/s40626-019-00142-02doi7 aPMC66600142pmcid7 a313551282pmid7 a10.1007/s40626-019-00142-02chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Pedro F.

As obligate cellular parasites with very small genomes, viruses rely on their hosts for replication, assembly, intra- and intercellular movement, and attraction of vectors for dispersal. Chloroplasts are photosynthesis and are the site of replication for several viruses. When viruses replicate in chloroplasts, photosynthesis, an essential process in plant physiology, is inhibited. The mechanisms underlying molecular and biochemical changes during compatible and incompatible plants–virus interactions, are only beginning to be elucidated, including changes in proteomic profiles induced by virus infections. In this review, we highlight the importance of proteomic studies to understand plant–virus interactions, especially emphasizing the changes in photosynthesis-related protein accumulation. We focus on: (a) chloroplast proteins that differentially accumulate during viral infection; (b) the significance with respect to chloroplast-virus interaction; and (c) alterations in plant’s energetic metabolism and the subsequently the plant defense mechanisms to overcome viral infection.  aPublisher supplied data  a308107/2013-6cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a306202/2017-4cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a431511/2016-0cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (BR)  a88887.162856/2018-00cFundação Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (BR)  aR01GM120108cNational Institutes of Health  a1007272cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achloroplast proteins 3achloroplasts 3adefense mechanisms 3aenergy crops 3agenome 3ahosts 3aparasites 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant physiology 3aplant viruses 3aproteomics 3aviruses1 aGarcia-Ruiz, Hernan1 aCarvalho, Fabricio E.

The method was based upon the highly sensitive color reaction of mercury(II) ions with 2,4-bis(4-phenylazophenylaminodiazo)benzenesulfonic acid (BPPABSA). We found that in the presence of 2.0% Triton X-100, the reagent reacts with mercury to form a stable red complex in a borax buffer solution at pH 10.22. The formed complex shows an absorption maximum at 530 nm. The apparent molar absorptivity is 2.18 × 10⁵ L/mol cm. The content of mercury in the sample was low and some foreign ions might interfere with the determination of mercury(II), so we used sulfhydryl dextran gel (SDG) to separate and enrich trace mercury(II), which lead to a satisfactory result. Under the optimal conditions, Beer’s law is obeyed in the range of 0–15 μg/25 mL Hg²⁺, the detection limit and relative standard deviation are 0.86 ng/mL and 1.4–3.8%, respectively. The method has been applied to the determination of mercury in cereals with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aborax 3acolor 3adetection limit 3adextran 3afood contamination 3agels 3agrains 3amercury 3aoctoxynol 3apH 3aspectroscopy1 aWang, Junli1 aFan, Yueqin1 aZhao, Qiang1 aGuo, Yong0 tJournal of analytical chemistry.g2013 June, v. 68, no. 6 p.488-494dSpringer-Verlagx1061-93487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1061934813060130  aDNAL 7aarticle04489naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111024002100147040001800168072000900186072000900195100001700204245011800221300001600339500002400355500001500379520197900394650002002373650004302393650002102436650002002457650001402477650002102491650002302512650001302535650001702548650001602565650002102581650001202602650001102614650001402625650001402639650002202653650002302675650002202698650001202720650002702732650004602759650003802805650001102843650003802854650001902892650004502911650005102956650002903007650003803036651001303074651001903087651001303106651001303119653001903132653002003151653002303171653001203194653001303206700001703219700001803236773012403254852000903378856008603387856011203473930003303585945002503618946001303643961001503656655001203671IND4386224920221119054030.0061219e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438622492DNAL7 a128526362pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-96.3.9142doi7 a10113/113602hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF2001 aHorner, T.A.10aDevelopment, survival and fitness performance of Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in MON810 Bt field corn  ap. 914-924.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aHelicoverpa zea (Boddie) development, survival, and feeding injury in MON810 transgenic ears of field corn (Zea mays L.) expressing Bacillus thuringiensis variety kurstaki (Bt) Cry1Ab endotoxins were compared with non-Bt ears at four geographic locations in Maryland (Marlboro and Beltsville), Virginia (Suffolk), and North Carolina (Corapeake), USA, over two growing seasons. Expression of Cry1Ab endotoxin resulted in overall reductions in the percentage of damaged ears by 33% and in the amount of kernels consumed by 60%. Bt-induced effects varied significantly among locations, partly because of the overall level and timing of H. zea infestations, condition of silk tissue at the time of egg hatch, and the possible effects of plant stress. Larvae feeding on Bt ears produced scattered, discontinuous patches of partially consumed kernels, which were arranged more linearly than the compact feeding patterns in non-Bt ears. The feeding patterns suggest that larvae in Bt ears are moving about sampling kernels more frequently than larvae in non-Bt ears. Because not all kernels express the same level of endotoxin, the spatial heterogeneity of toxin distribution within Bt ears may provide an opportunity for development of behavioral responses in H. zea to avoid toxin. MON810 corn suppressed the establishment and development of H. zea to late instars by at least 75%. This level of control is considered a moderate dose, which may increase the risk of resistance development in areas where MON810 corn is widely adopted and H. zea overwinters successfully. Sublethal effects of MON810 corn resulted in prolonged larval and prepupal development, smaller pupae, and reduced fecundity of H. zea. The moderate dose effects and the spatial heterogeneity of toxin distribution among kernels could increase the additive genetic variance for both physiological and behavioral resistance in H. zea populations. Implications of localized population suppression are discussed. 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aBacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki 3acrystal proteins 3apest resistance 3afecundity 3adelta-endotoxins 3ainsect development 3aZea mays 3ainsect pests 3acrop damage 3afeeding behavior 3aprogeny 3alarvae 3amortality 3acorn ears 3atransgenic plants 3alarval development 3asublethal effects 2aAnimals 2aBacillus thuringiensis 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEndotoxinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aInsect Control 2aLarvaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aLepidopteraxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPest Control, Biological 2aZea maysxgeneticsxparasitology. 3aVirginia 3aNorth Carolina 3aMaryland 0aMaryland 0acry1Ab protein 0aprogeny fitness 0alarval recruitment 0aBt corn 0atoxicity1 aDively, G.P.1 aHerbert, D.A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2003 June, v.  96, no.  3 p.914-924dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-96.3.9143Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/113603Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080315b20080404c00000000  aINDdCMMe2007/02/13  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle03134naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002600154245006800180300001600248520214300264592002802407650001402435650001002449650001802459650002202477650001302499650001102512650001302523650001602536650002602552650001202578700002202590773010802612856005502720852000902775655001202784IND50067685720221120024953.0130706e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006768572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-048X.2013.00079.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLerch‐Henning, Sara10aBird pollinators differ in their tolerance of a nectar alkaloid  ap. 408-416.  aAlthough the function of nectar is to attract and reward pollinators, secondary metabolites produced by plants as anti‐herbivore defences are frequently present in floral nectars. Greater understanding is needed of the effects of secondary metabolites in nectar on the foraging behaviour and performance of pollinators, and on plant–pollinator interactions. We investigated how nectar‐feeding birds, both specialist (white‐bellied sunbirds Cinnyris talatala) and generalist (dark‐capped bulbuls Pycnonotus tricolor and Cape white‐eyes Zosterops virens), respond to artificial nectar containing the alkaloid nicotine, present in nectar of Nicotiana species. Preference tests were carried out with a range of nicotine concentrations (0.1–300 μM) in two sucrose concentrations (0.25 and 1 M), and for bulbuls also in two sugars (sucrose and hexose). In addition, we measured short‐term feeding patterns in white‐bellied sunbirds that were offered nicotine (0–50 μM) in 0.63 M sucrose. Both nicotine and sugar concentrations influenced the response of bird pollinators to nicotine. The birds showed dose‐dependent responses to nicotine; and their tolerance of high nicotine concentrations was reduced on the dilute 0.25 M sucrose diet, on which they increased consumption to maintain energy intake. White‐bellied sunbirds decreased both feeding frequency and feeding duration as the nicotine concentration in artificial nectar increased. Of the three species, bulbuls showed the highest tolerance for nicotine, and sugar type (sucrose or hexose) had no effect. The indifference of bulbuls to nicotine may be related to their primarily frugivorous diet. However, the response of white‐eyes to nicotine in the dilute sucrose solution was very similar to that of sunbirds, even though white‐eyes are generalist nectar‐feeders. Additional testing of other avian nectarivores and different secondary metabolites is required to further elucidate whether generalist bird pollinators, which utilise dilute nectars in which secondary metabolites have stronger deterrent effects, are more tolerant of ‘toxic’ nectar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana 3abirds 3aenergy intake 3afeeding frequency 3aforaging 3anectar 3anicotine 3apollinators 3asecondary metabolites 3asucrose1 aNicolson, Sue W.,0 tJournal of avian biology.g2013 July, v. 44, no. 4 p.408-416dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-048X.2013.00079.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01913naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006700150245010700217520058100324592002800905650001500933650001300948650001800961650002500979650001701004650001301021650001101034650001401045653001301059653001801072653002401090653002101114653002801135653004401163700006701207700001901274773012801293856008501421852000901506655001201515IND60753054520221120142754.0220222e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075305452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resmic.2021.1038832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajpurohit, Yogendra S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1140-125110aInvolvement of serine / threonine protein kinases in DNA damage response and cell division in bacteria  aThe roles of Serine/Threonine protein kinases (STPKs) in bacterial physiology, including bacterial responses to nutritional stresses and under pathogenesis have been well documented.

K.10aAir-Persistent Monomeric (Amino)(carboxy) Radicals Derived from Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino) Carbenes  ap. 7519-7525.  aA series of monomeric (amino)(carboxy) radicals featuring carbonyl substituents with increasing electron-withdrawing properties (3a, phenyl; 3b, 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl; 3c, perfluorophenyl; 3d, heptafluoropropyl; 3e, 2H-pyrroliumyl) were synthesized in two or three steps from stable cyclic (alky)(amino)carbenes (CAACs). Although (amino)(carboxy) radicals had been previously considered as highly air-sensitive, some of these compounds feature half-lives of hours (3d), and even days (3c and 3e) in well-aerated solutions. DFT calculations show that (amino)(carboxy) radicals evolve from C-centered radical to ambidentate C,O-radicals when increasing the electron-withdrawing properties of the carbonyl substituent. This is paralleled with a destabilization of the peroxide resulting from the addition of dioxygen to the radical. This latter reaction is even predicted to be endothermic for substituents with Hammett constant σₚ > 0.2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendothermy 3afree radicals 3ahalf life1 aMartin, David1 aThomas, Fabrice1 aMoore, Curtis E.1 aRheingold, Arnold L.1 aBertrand, Guy0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 June 17, v. 137, no. 23 p.7519-7525dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b044143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245011000168300002000278520092800298592002801226650001501254650001501269650001101284650002601295650001701321650002801338650002201366700002101388700001501409700002301424700002101447700001601468700002501484700006401509773013801573856008001711852000901791655001201800IND60614636120221118155150.0181002e20180827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061463612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b068342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakahara, Satoshi10aSuppression of Trion Formation in CsPbBr₃ Perovskite Nanocrystals by Postsynthetic Surface Modification  ap. 22188-22193.  aLead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are one of the most anticipated and promising materials for light-emitting diodes and lasers because of their high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). However, the formation of trions (charged excitons) in the NCs reduces their PLQYs. Here, we clarify the trion formation mechanism in perovskite CsPbBr₃ NCs by analyzing the excitation fluence dependence of transient absorption signals. Under weak photoexcitation, trions are formed by charge carrier trapping at surface states. In contrast, biexciton Auger recombination dominates the trion formation under strong photoexcitation. We found that the postsynthetic surface treatment suppresses the extrinsic surface-related formation of trions. The thorough understanding of the trion formation mechanisms is essential for the PLQY improvement of perovskite NCs and helps to reduce ionization of NCs in solid-state devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aionization 3alasers 3alight emitting diodes 3ananocrystals 3aphotochemical reactions 3aphotoluminescence1 aTahara, Hirokazu1 aYumoto, Go1 aKawawaki, Tokuhisa1 aSaruyama, Masaki1 aSato, Ryota1 aTeranishi, Toshiharu1 aKanemitsu, Yoshihiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0788-131X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Aug. 27, v. 122, no. 38 p.22188-22193dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b068343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02184naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245005000158300001600208520103000224592002801254596002701282650003501309650001201344650002001356650001601376650001501392650001201407650001001419650001001429651001401439700002601453700001901479700002401498700002001522773017101542856007601713852000901789655001201798IND60776612320221119061423.0220509s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077661232DNAL7 a10.13031/jash.147802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchuft, Abby10aBiosecurity Education for the Next Generation  ap. 125-133.  aHighlightsYouth are agents for change in biosecurity practices.47 workshops introduced biosecurity principles to youth.The curriculum was tailored for nine animal species.Biosecurity education requires continued programming. Abstract. Biosecurity education for youth involved in animal agriculture is vital for the continued success of commerce in these industries. Biosecurity workshops were developed and delivered to youth in Minnesota to encourage positive changes, with long-term outcomes of healthier animals. Learning gains were significant for all participants, and the participants retained this knowledge over time. Most participants had good intentions of making changes because of the workshops, and follow-up survey results showed that the participants implemented changes, validating that youth are agents for behavior change. However, other indicators surfaced suggesting that continued programming is needed to encourage adoption of more biosecurity practices.

Grain dust consists of grain particles, insect parts, silica, bacteria, fungi, and mycotoxins. The size of these airborne particulates is a concern because they can become deeply lodged in the respiratory tract. Exposure to grain dust can diminish overall lung function and lead to respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS), chronic bronchitis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (farmer’s lung). Grain storage and handling facilities are primary work locations with high levels of grain dust concentrations. The objective of this study was to understand farmers’ exposure to grain dust while cleaning and unloading their grain bins. During on-farm dust sampling, researchers visited farms to collect dust samples for analysis. Two types of samples were taken. Integrated samples provided average concentrations of total dust and respirable dust while farmers performed their normal tasks in the grain bin. Real-time samples provided instantaneous concentrations of respirable dust (RESP) and total suspended particles (TSP) and how the variations changed during the farmers’ working periods. From the data collected in corn storage bins, RESP concentrations ranged from 4.1 to 6.6 mg m-3, and TSP concentrations ranged from 33 to 70.7 mg m-3. From the data collected in soybean storage bins, RESP concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 82.3 mg m-3, and TSP concentrations ranged from 8.9 to 146.8 mg m-3. Based on the calculated 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) concentration of all samples, 18.2% of the 8-hour TWA RESP concentrations exceeded the ACGIH-recommended respirable dust concentration of 3 mg m-3, and 27.3% of the 8-hour TWA TSP concentrations exceeded the ACGIH-recommended total dust concentration of 610 mg m-3. The results strengthen the need for relevant agricultural safety education programs to help farm workers understand the health hazards associated with grain dust.

Studies typically concentrate on the role of non-coding RNAs in regulating coding RNA. But the majority of transcripts in a cell are likely to be coding. Is it possible that coding RNA might regulate other coding RNA by short perfect sense-antisense binding? Here we compare all well-described human protein coding mRNAs against all others to identify sites 15-25 bp long that could potentially perfectly match sense-antisense. RESULTS: From 24,968 protein coding mRNA RefSeq sequences, none failed to find at least one match in the transcriptome. By randomizations generating artificial transcripts matched for G+C content and length, we found that there are more such trans short sense-antisense pairs than expected. Several further features are consistent with functionality of some of the putative matches. First, transcripts with more potential partners have lower expression levels, and the pair density of tissue specific genes is significantly higher than that of housekeeping genes. Further, the single nucleotide polymorphism density is lower in short pairing regions than it is in flanking regions. We found no evidence that the sense-antisense pairing regions are associated with small RNAs derived from the protein coding genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with the possibility of common short perfect sense-antisense pairing between transcripts of protein coding genes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aessential genes 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3anon-coding RNA 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscriptome1 aYin, Shanye1 aZhang, Zhenguo1 aXin, Dedong1 aHu, Landian1 aKong, Xiangyin1 aHurst, Laurence D0 tGenome biology.g2008 Dec., v. 9, no. 12 p.2031-2031dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2008-9-12-r1693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01459naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001800164245008800182300001400270520038800284592002800672650002400700650001200724650001100736650001400747650002800761650001400789650001600803650002200819650001400841650002200855700001700877773011100894852000901005856008301014655001201097IND8107248720221116232359.0181203e198101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND810724872DNAL7 a72658912pmid7 a10.1258/0023677817809585592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorris, M.

The electrolyte is a cryolitic bath containing mainly NaF and AlF₃ at around 1000 °C. In this liquid, the main anionic species are fluoroaluminates ions such as [AlF₆]³–, [AlF₅]²–, [AlF₄]⁻, and F–. During the Al₂O₃ dissolution, different kinds of oxyfluoroaluminates species are formed. However, due to the difficult experimental conditions and the large number of potential ions, no quantitative speciation could be made up to now. Here, we propose a speciation of alumina–cryolite melts combining in situ NMR experiments, classical molecular dynamics simulations, and electronic structure calculations. This allows us to establish the nature and quantities of each species, depending on the Al₂O₃ concentration, for two different initial cryolitic compositions. In particular, we show that the O atoms are always linked to at least two Al atoms, leading to the formation of polymeric oxyfluorides. From the dynamic point of view, the simulations also show that the lifetime of the O–Al bonds is also much longer than that of the F–Al ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3achemical bonding 3aions 3aliquids 3amelting 3amolecular dynamics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asimulation models 3asodium fluoride1 aZanghi, Didier1 aSalanne, Mathieu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1753-491X1 aStabrowski, Vincent1 aBessada, Catherine0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 18, v. 122, no. 38 p.21807-21816dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b069053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245011700203300001600320520128300336592002801619650001501647650001101662650002501673650002001698650001301718650002601731653001101757653001501768653001801783653001101801653001801812653002001830653000701850653000801857653000901865653001001874653000901884653001201893653000901905653000901914653000901923700005901932700001801991700005502009700002302064700006002087773013802147856008302285852000902368655001202377IND60733286820221121233623.0210428e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073328682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaito, Shun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6163-275210aRequirement for expression of WW domain containing transcription regulator 1 in bovine trophectoderm development  ap. 140-146.  aWW domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1) is one of the primary effectors in the Hippo pathway, which plays essential roles in cell differentiation into trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass cell lineages at the blastocyst stage. However, little is known about the roles of WWTR1 in preimplantation development. The present study aimed to explore the significance of WWTR1 expression in preimplantation development using an mRNA knockdown (KD) system in bovine embryos. We first quantitated WWTR1 expression at protein and mRNA levels from fertilization to blastocyst stage. WWTR1 proteins gradually shifted from extranuclear localization during the 16-cell stage to nuclear localization by morula stage. WWTR1 mRNA expression was also transiently upregulated at the 16-cell stage. WWTR1 KD efficiently repressed WWTR1 expression at protein and mRNA levels. The WWTR1 KD embryos developed to the blastocyst stage at rates equivalent to those of controls, but TE cell numbers were significantly decreased. Representative TE-expressed genes, including CDX2 and IFNT were also significantly decreased in WWTR1 KD blastocysts. These results provide the first demonstration that WWTR1 expression is responsible for normal TE cell development in preimplantation embryos.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablastocyst 3acattle 3acell differentiation 3agene expression 3aresearch 3atranscription factors 0aEmbryo 0aBlastocyst 0aTrophectoderm 0aCattle 0aHippo pathway 0aDifferentiation 0aTE 0aICM 0aYAP1 0aTEAD4 0aCDX2 0aLATS1/2 0aSOX2 0aCCN2 0aOCT41 aYamamura, Shota1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1190-78261 aKohri, Nanami1 aBai, Hanako1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9940-18801 aTakahashi, Masashi1 aKawahara, Manabu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7172-60820 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 May 28, v. 555 p.140-146dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03900naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245017900158500002200337520219200359592002802551650004402579650002202623650001502645650001502660650002502675650001902700650002302719650001602742650002002758650001202778650003102790650002402821650001902845650004302864650003302907650000902940650002702949650003702976650001903013653003103032653002703063653003603090653002803126653002503154700001503179700001803194773006803212856008103280852000903361655001203370IND60558338020221116230810.0161115s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055833802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Na10aMagnetic polyethyleneimine functionalized reduced graphene oxide as a novel magnetic solid-phase extraction adsorbent for the determination of polar acidic herbicides in rice  aPre-press version  aA novel magnetic polyethyleneimine modified reduced graphene oxide (Fe3O4@PEI-RGO) had been fabricated based on a self-assemble approach between positive charged magnetic polyethyleneimine (Fe3O4@PEI) and negative charged GO sheets via electrostatic interaction followed by chemical reduction of GO to RGO. The as-prepared Fe3O4@PEI-RGO was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and zeta potential analysis, and then was successfully applied to determine four phenoxy acid herbicides and dicamba in rice coupled with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). As a surface modifier of RGO, PEI not only effectually affected the surface property of RGO (e.g. zeta potential), but also changed the polarity of RGO and offered anion exchange groups to polar acidic herbicides, which would directly influence the type of adsorbed analytes. Compared with Fe3O4@PEI, Fe3O4/RGO and Fe3O4@PEI-GO, the as-prepared Fe3O4@PEI-RGO, integrating the superiority of PEI and RGO, showed higher extraction efficiency for polar acidic herbicides. Besides, the adsorption mechanism was investigated as well. It turned out that electrostatic interaction and π-π interaction were considered to be two major driving force for the adsorption process. Response surface methodology (RSM), a multivariate experimental design technique, was used to optimize experimental parameters affecting the extraction efficiency in detail. Under the optimal conditions, a satisfactory performance was obtained. The calibration curves were linear over the concentration ranging from 2 to 300 ng g−1 with correlation coefficients (r) between 0.9985 and 0.9994. The limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of 0.67–2 ng g−1. The recoveries ranged from 87.41% to 102.52% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 8.94%. Taken together, the proposed method was an efficient pretreatment and enrichment procedure and could be successfully applied for selective extraction and determination of polar acidic herbicides in complex matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanion exchange 3achemical reduction 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3adicamba 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aexperimental design 3agraphene oxide 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aresponse surface methodology 3arice 3asolid phase extraction 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential 0aMagnetic polyethyleneimine 0aReduced graphene oxide 0aMagnetic solid-phase extraction 0aPolar acidic herbicides 0aAdsorption mechanism1 aChen, Juan1 aShi, Yan-Ping0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012300165300001600288520177700304592002802081650000802109650002402117650002802141650000902169650001802178650002102196650001302217650002002230650001302250650002902263650001402292653002802306653000902334653002302343653002002366653002302386700001802409773013802427856008302565852000902648655001202657IND60733286920221121223555.0210428e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073328692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, So Yeon10aStructural analysis of the activation and DNA interactions of the response regulator VbrR from Vibrio parahaemolyticus  ap. 102-108.  aVbrK and VbrR from the gastroenteritis-causing Vibrio parahaemolyticus are a histidine kinase and response regulator, respectively, that constitute a two-component regulatory system. VbrK responds to β-lactam antibiotics or nitrate and activates VbrR via phosphorylation. Consequently, VbrR transcriptionally regulates the expression of β-lactamase and ExsC and contributes to the survival or virulence of V. parahaemolyticus. Due to the unavailability of the VbrR structure, it remains unclear how VbrR is activated via its N-terminal receiver domain (RD) and recognizes dsDNA via its C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD). To reveal the mechanism underlying VbrR-mediated activation, we generated the phosphomimetic protein (VbrRᴿᴰ⁻ᴰ⁵¹ᴱ) of the VbrR RD by replacing the D51 residue at the phosphorylation site with glutamate. VbrRᴿᴰ⁻ᴰ⁵¹ᴱ exhibits a β₇α₅ structure rather than the typical β₅α₅ structure because it contains a unique two-stranded β-sheet. The VbrRᴿᴰ⁻ᴰ⁵¹ᴱ structure represents an active state in which the D51E residue interacts with the T78 residue. As a result, the Y97 residue adopts an inward conformation, allowing VbrRᴿᴰ⁻ᴰ⁵¹ᴱ to dimerize using the α4-β5-α5 face. These activation events are facilitated by a VbrR-specific residue, R52. Further structural study demonstrated that the VbrR DBD adopts a β-strand-decorated three-helix structure. Based on a comparative structural study, we propose that VbrR recognizes dsDNA by inserting the α8 helix into the major groove of dsDNA and interacting with the minor groove of dsDNA via the β11-β12 region. Our findings will provide a new avenue for development of new antibacterial drugs for treating V. parahaemolyticus infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-binding domains 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aface 3aglutamic acid 3ahistidine kinase 3anitrates 3aphosphorylation 3aresearch 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirulence 0aVibrio parahaemolyticus 0aVbrR 0aResponse regulator 0aReceiver domain 0aDNA-binding domain1 aYoon, Sung-il0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 May 28, v. 555 p.102-108dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005200145245012500197300002000322520151800342592002801860650001801888650002001906650001401926650002501940650002601965650001401991650001002005650001502015650001202030650001502042650001102057650000902068650002102077650001302098653002002111653001002131653001602141653001902157700001802176700002302194700003302217773014202250856008002392852000902472655001202481IND60760421920221121015259.0211221e20211129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076042192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.1c050062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2694-112710aTrophic Transfer and Toxicity of (Mixtures of) Ag and TiO₂ Nanoparticles in the Lettuce–Terrestrial Snail Food Chain  ap. 16563-16572.  aThe increasing application of biosolids and agrochemicals containing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO₂NPs) results in their inevitable accumulation in soil, with unknown implications along terrestrial food chains. Here, the trophic transfer of single NPs and a mixture of AgNPs and TiO₂NPs from lettuce to snails and their associated impacts on snails were investigated. Both AgNPs and TiO₂NPs were transferred from lettuce to snails with trophic transfer factors (defined as the ratio of the Ag/Ti concentration in snail tissues to the Ag/Ti concentration in lettuce leaves) of 0.2–1.1 for Ag and 3.8–47 for Ti. Moreover, the majority of Ag captured by snails in the AgNP-containing treatments was excreted via feces, whereas more than 70% of Ti was distributed in the digestive gland of snails in the TiO₂NP-containing treatments. Additionally, AgNP-containing treatments significantly inhibited the activity of snails, while TiO₂NP-containing treatments significantly reduced feces excretion of snails. Furthermore, the concurrent application of AgNPs and TiO₂NPs did not affect the biomagnification and distribution patterns of Ag and Ti in snails, whereas their co-existence exhibited more severe inhibition of the growth and activity of snails than in the case of applying AgNPs or TiO₂NPs alone. This highlights the possibility of nanoparticle transfer to organisms of higher trophic levels via food chains and the associated risks to ecosystem health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagrochemicals 3abioaccumulation 3abiosolids 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental science 3aexcretion 3afeces 3afood chain 3alettuce 3ananosilver 3asnails 3asoil 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxicity 0abiodistribution 0aplant 0aherbivorous 0abinary mixture1 aBosker, Thijs1 aVijver, Martina G.1 aPeijnenburg, Willie J.

Herein, we construct a model photocatalytic system of shape-controlled Pd/TiO₂ hybrids to investigate the effect of surface atomic structure of Pd cocatalysts in the photocatalytic H₂ evolution reaction. Cubic- and tetrahedral-Pd nanocrystals are respectively in situ deposited on the surface of cubic-anatase-TiO₂, establishing strong interface contact between the two indispensable components in the photocatalytic H₂ evolution reaction: photocatalyst (TiO₂) and cocatalyst (Pd). Experimental results and theoretical calculations based on this Pd/TiO₂ model system demonstrate that the cocatalytic performance of Pd(111) facets is more effective than that of Pd(100) facets in various reaction solutions. This is due to the more efficient capture of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of TiO₂, as well as the more preferable adsorption of H, transformation of H into the H₂ molecule, and desorption of the H₂ molecule in the HER process of the Pd(111) surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3aelectrons 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3atitanium dioxide 0aHydrogen production 0aPhotocatalysis 0aCocatalysts 0aPalladium 0aInterface interaction1 aLi, Han1 aLi, Yao1 aZhu, Bicheng1 aYu, Jiaguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9308-28820 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Mar. 16, v. 6, no. 5 p.6478-6487dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b002593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012700170300001600297520175600313592002802069650003102097650002102128650002102149650002502170650001602195650001602211650002502227650002302252650002002275650001602295650002402311650002902335650001602364650001902380700002202399700001802421700002302439700002602462700002402488700001902512700003702531700002402568700002502592700002702617700002202644700002002666773012302686856008402809852000902893655001202902IND60099604020221120230707.0141105e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009960402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2011.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartino, Sabata10aCoordinated involvement of cathepsins S, D and cystatin C in the commitment of hematopoietic stem cells to dendritic cells  ap. 775-783.  aThe identity of biochemical players which underpin the commitment of CD34⁺ hematopoietic stem cells to immunogenic or tolerogenic dendritic cells is largely unknown. To explore this issue, we employed a previously established cell-based system amenable to shift dendritic cell differentiation from the immunogenic into the tolerogenic pathway upon supplementation with a conventional cytokine cocktail containing thrombopoietin (TPO) and IL-16. We show that stringent regulation of cathepsins S and D, two proteases involved in antigen presentation, is crucial to engage cell commitment to either route. In response to TPO+IL-16-dependent signaling, both cathepsins undergo earlier maturation and down-regulation. Additionally, cystatin C orchestrates cathepsin S expression through a tight but reversible interaction that, based on a screen of adult stem cells from disparate origins, CD14⁺ cells, primary fibroblasts and the MCF7 cell line, appears unique to CD34⁺ stem cells from peripheral and cord blood. As shown by CD4⁺ T cell proliferation in mixed-lymphocyte reactions, cell commitment to either pathway is disrupted upon cathepsin knockdown by RNAi. Surprisingly, similar effects were also observed upon gene overexpression, which prompts atypically accelerated maturation of cathepsins S and D in cells of the immunogenic pathway, similar to the tolerogenic route. Furthermore, RNAi studies revealed that cystatin C is a proteolytic target of cathepsin D and has a direct, causal impact on cell differentiation. Together, these findings uncover a novel biochemical cluster that is subject to time-controlled and rigorously balanced expression to mediate specific stem cell commitment at the crossroads towards tolerance or immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aRNA interference 3aadult stem cells 3aantigen presentation 3acathepsin D 3acathepsin S 3acell differentiation 3acell proliferation 3adendritic cells 3afibroblasts 3agene overexpression 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3aproteolysis 3athrombopoietin1 aTiribuzi, Roberto1 aCiraci, Elisa1 aMakrypidi, Georgia1 aD’Angelo, Francesco1 adi Girolamo, Ilaria1 aGritti, Angela1 ade Angelis, Gabriella M.

Nest thermal properties, particularly nest composition and size, can have a major influence on heat loss. To examine the role of nest size and insulation on clutch cooling rates, we collected tree swallow Tachycineta bicolor nests and measured the cooling rate of eggs in a controlled thermal environment. We also examined the thermal benefits of nest feathers by comparing the cooling rates of nests with and without feathers. Nests with more feather insulation and heavier, deeper cupped nests cooled at slower rates. In addition, nests with feathers cooled at much slower rates than did the same nests without feathers. Our results show that nest insulation and size play important roles in nest cooling rates, which may ultimately affect incubation costs and thus reproductive performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHirundinidae 3abirds 3aeggs 3afeathers 3aheat 3anesting 3anests 3areproductive performance 3athermal properties1 aFegely, Jessica L.1 aArdia, Daniel R.0 tJournal of avian biology.g2013 July, v. 44, no. 4 p.305-310dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-048X.2013.05768.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011200163300001600275520140900291592002801700650002201728650001601750650001301766650001401779650001801793650001601811650001601827650002101843650001401864650001301878650000901891650001901900700002301919700001501942773013101957856007402088852000902162655001202171IND60776613020221119061418.0220904e20090716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077661302DNAL7 a10.17221/1018-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsghari-Zakaria, R.10aEffect of <I>in vitro</i> chitosan application on growth and minituber yield of <I>Solanum tuberosum</I> L.  ap. 252-256.  aIn order to investigate the effects of soluble chitosan on plantlets growth <I>in vitro</I> and increase of minituber yield in potato micropropagation, plantlets of Agria cultivar were treated <I>in vitro</I>with soluble chitosan at different concentrations including 0, 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, 750 and 1000 mg/l added to the MS tissue culture medium.

PKC-ι confers resistance to drug-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. The acquisition of drug resistance is a major obstacle to good prognosis in neuroblastoma. The focus of this research was to identify the efficacy of [4-(5-amino-4-carbamoylimidazol-1-yl)-2,3-dihydroxycyclopentyl] methyl dihydrogen phosphate (ICA-1) as a novel PKC-ι inhibitor in neuroblastoma cell proliferation and apoptosis. ICA-1 specifically inhibits the activity of PKC-ι but not that of PKC-zeta (PKC-ζ), the closely related atypical PKC family member. The IC₅₀ for the kinase activity assay was approximately 0.1μM which is 1000 times less than that of aurothiomalate, a known PKC-ι inhibitor. Cyclin dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7) phosphorylates cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) and promotes cell proliferation. Our data shows that PKC-ι is an in vitro Cdk7 kinase and the phosphorylation of Cdk7 by PKC-ι was potently inhibited by ICA-1. Furthermore, our data shows that neuroblastoma cells proliferate via a PKC-ι/Cdk7/cdk2 cell signaling pathway and ICA-1 mediates its antiproliferative effects by inhibiting this pathway. ICA-1 (0.1μM) inhibited the in vitro proliferation of BE(2)-C neuroblastoma cells by 58% (P=0.01). Additionally, ICA-1 also induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. Interestingly, ICA-1 did not affect the proliferation of normal neuronal cells suggesting its potential as chemotherapeutic with low toxicity. Hence, our results emphasize the potential of ICA-1 as a novel PKC-ι inhibitor and chemotherapeutic agent for neuroblastoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3acyclins 3adrug resistance 3adrug therapy 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aneoplasm cells 3aneurons 3aoncogenes 3aphosphates 3aphosphorylation 3aprognosis 3aprotein kinase C 3asignal transduction 3atoxicity1 aDesai, Shraddha1 aPatel, Rekha1 aSajan, Mini1 aFarese, Robert1 aOstrov, David1 aAcevedo-Duncan, Mildred0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2011 May, v. 43, no. 5 p.784-794dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2011.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245010200207300002000309520121300329592002801542650002101570650002201591650001101613650001601624650001101640650002101651650001501672700005801687700002401745700006001769773013801829856008001967852000902047655001202056IND60614636920181121000000.0181002e20180823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061463692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b069472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsman, Hussien H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1411-829910aChemical Bond Formation and Rupture Processes: An Application of DFT–Chemical Pressure Approach  ap. 21216-21225.  aVery recently, we have analyzed the nature of chemical interactions in a wide variety of molecules and materials using the chemical pressure (CP) approach. We have shown how this newly developed formalism can be used to identify and visualize different types of chemical bonds based on the attractive and repulsive forces between the constitutive atoms of molecules and materials. In this article, we illustrate the capability of the CP approach to clearly track the bond formation and rupture processes in crystalline solids. Using the indium phosphide crystal as a model system, the evolution of its chemical bonding network is investigated in two different phenomena: (i) along a pressure-induced phase transition mechanism and (ii) after electron beam irradiation of the unit cell. The CP maps show distinctive features related to the local atomic interactions in the crystal structure, providing insights into the chemical nature of any distorted/defective structure throughout these transformation processes. This is accomplished by searching for the appearance/disappearance of absolute minima of negative CP along bonding interatomic paths and of zero CP contour lines surrounding the metallic atoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3acrystal structure 3aindium 3airradiation 3amodels 3aphase transition 3aphosphides1 aAndrés, Juan,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0232-39571 aSalvadó, Miguel A.1 aRecio, J.

The recovery of phenolic compounds by MA-ATPS was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). A comparative study was performed by conventional ATPS (C-ATPS) and classical mono-phase extraction (C). The DPPH scavenging activity, ABTS antioxidant activity, and metal chelating activity of the extracts were determined. The highest extraction yield (6.68, 2.10, and 1.69 mg GAE/ g sample for green lentil, chickpea and dry bean, respectively) and antioxidant properties (70.98, 7.60, and 9.68 μmol TE/g for DPPH scavenging activity for green lentil, chickpea, and dry bean respectively) were observed from the extracts obtained by MA-ATPS. Furthermore, the phenolic extracts were encapsulated by freeze-drying and the structural characterization of microcapsules has been performed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The releasing profiles of the encapsulated phenolic compounds were investigated. Additionally, the effects of extracts on oxidative stability on sunflower oil under accelerated storage conditions were assessed. The results of the present study proved that the MA-ATPS might be considered as an efficient environment-friendly method for extraction phenolic compounds from pulses as evidenced by the antioxidant activity of extracts. Moreover, the encapsulated phenolic extracts may serve as an alternative ingredient for the food industry to be used in various functional formulations potentially leading to an increase in the value of green lentil, chickpea, and dry bean and possibly their by-products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3achickpeas 3acomparative study 3adry beans 3aencapsulation 3afood industry 3afreeze drying 3aingredients 3alentils 3amicrowave treatment 3aoxidative stability 3aresponse surface methodology 3asunflower oil 0aAqueous two-phase system (ATPS) 0aMicrowave-assisted (MA) extraction 0aPulse1 aHayta, Mehmet0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 173 p.114144-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1141443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245012500162300002000287520136700307592002801674650001401702650002501716650001101741650001301752650000901765650001501774650001801789650002701807650001201834650002301846650002201869650000901891650002201900650001601922700005601938700005501994700001402049700001402063700005902077773013902136856008002275852000902355655001202364IND60614637020221118155207.0181002e20180905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061463702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b069742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Cheng10aLower Limit of Interfacial Thermal Resistance across the Interface between an Imidazolium Ionic Liquid and Solid Surface  ap. 22194-22200.  aUnderstanding of energy transport across the solid–liquid interface is essential for the rational design of efficient heat dissipation capabilities. In this work, we show that the molecular orientation of liquid near the solid surface dominates the thermal transport across the imidazolium ionic liquids (IL)/graphene interface via molecular dynamics simulations. The molecular orientation is defined as the parallelism between the imidazole ring in IL and graphene and is controlled by wettability of graphene. Interfacial thermal resistance (ITR) will decrease linearly with the parallelism, which is suitable for IL with different tail chain length (2, 4, 6, and 8). From the linear relationship, a lower limit of ITR for the IL–graphene interface can be predicted, which is on the order of ∼6 m² K/GW and stands for the lower bound of ITR across the solid–liquid interface. Furthermore, it is indicated that the parallel imidazole ring in IL facilitates the thermal transport via shifting the dominating vibrational modes to a higher frequency (∼15 THz). These findings show that the molecular orientation can be an effective factor to control the interfacial thermal transport, which can shed light on the future rational designs of some key chemical engineering processes, such as IL-based coolants, batteries, nanoelectrical devices, and so on.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3achemical engineering 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aheat 3aimidazoles 3aionic liquids 3aliquid-solid interface 3aliquids 3amolecular dynamics 3asimulation models 3atail 3athermal stability 3awettability1 aWang, Yanlei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2214-87811 aHe, Hongyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1291-27711 aHuo, Feng1 aWei, Ning1 aZhang, Suojiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9397-954X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 05, v. 122, no. 38 p.22194-22200dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b069743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245016100168300001600329520123500345592002801580650003201608650001401640650001501654650001001669650002001679650001501699650001001714650001301724653000801737653001501745653004201760653002401802653003801826653000901864653000801873653000701881653000701888653001001895653001101905653000801916700005801924700001901982700002502001700001902026700002002045700005902065773013802124856008302262852000902345655001202354IND60733287520221120232132.0210428e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073328752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoida, Atsuhide10aThymic stromal lymphopoietin contributes to protection of mice from Strongyloides venezuelensis infection by CD4+ T cell-dependent and -independent pathways  ap. 168-174.  aWhen animals are infected with helminthic parasites, resistant hosts mount type II helper T (Th2) immune responses to expel worms. Recent studies have clearly shown that epithelial cell-derived cytokines contribute to the induction of Th2 immune responses. Here we demonstrate the role of endogenous thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) for protection against Strongyloides venezuelensis (S. venezuelensis) infection, utilizing TSLP receptor-deficient Crlf2⁻/⁻ mice. The number of eggs per gram of feces (EPG) and worm burden were significantly higher in Crlf2⁻/⁻ mice than in wild type (WT) mice. S. venezuelensis infection induced Tslp mRNA expression in the skin, lung, and intestine and also facilitated the accumulation of mast cells in the intestine in a TSLP-dependent manner. Furthermore, CD4⁺ T cells from S. venezuelensis-infected Crlf2⁻/⁻ mice showed diminished capacity to produce Th2 cytokines in the early stage of infection. Finally, CD4⁺ cell-depleted Crlf2⁻/⁻ mice still showed higher EPG counts and worm burden than CD4⁺ cell-depleted WT mice, indicating that TSLP contributes to protecting mice against S. venezuelensis infection in both CD4⁺ T cell-dependent and -independent manners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStrongyloides venezuelensis 3acytokines 3aepithelium 3afeces 3agene expression 3aintestines 3alungs 3aresearch 0aTh2 0aMast cells 0aThymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor 0aIntestinal nematode 0aEpithelial cell-derived cytokines 0aTSLP 0aEPG 0aES 0aDC 0aILC2s 0aMcpt-1 0amLN1 aYasuda, Koubun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3533-17021 aAdachi, Takumi1 aMatsushita, Kazufumi1 aYasuda, Makoto1 aHirano, Shigeru1 aKuroda, Etsushi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7198-21900 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 May 28, v. 555 p.168-174dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.1283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245014800161300002000309520118800329592002801517650004401545650002201589650001401611650002301625650002401648650001401672650001801686650002101704650003301725650003301758650002101791700001901812773012401831856007401955852000902029655001202038IND60641262120221123014135.0190505e20161010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064126212DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra21048a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabrizian, Elham12aA new type of SO₃H-functionalized magnetic-titania as a robust magnetically-recoverable solid acid nanocatalyst for multi-component reactions  ap. 96606-96615.  aSO₃H-functionalized magnetic-titania nanoparticles (Fe₃O₄@TDI@TiO₂–SO₃H) have been synthesized by a two-step procedure, involving the covalent grafting of n-TiO₂ to n-Fe₃O₄via 2,4-toluene diisocyanate as a regioselective linker (n-Fe₃O₄@TDI@TiO₂) and subsequent sulfonation using chlorosulfonic acid. The as-prepared nanocatalyst was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). The catalytic activity of the nanocatalyst was assessed for the synthesis of benzimidazoquinazolinones and polyhydroquinolines, in which the reaction conditions were optimized by applying central composite design (CCD) through response surface methodology. The nanocatalyst could be separated from the reaction mixture easily by magnetic decantation and reused at least six times without a noticeable degradation in catalytic activity. To the best of our knowledge, there are no literature reports on applying experimental design to optimize the reaction conditions for benzimidazoquinazolinones synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aexperimental design 3amagnetism 3ananoparticles 3aregioselectivity 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry1 aAmoozadeh, Ali0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 10, v. 6, no. 99 p.96606-96615dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21048a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245012700164300002000291520095100311592002801262650001301290650001401303650001101317650001001328650001101338650000901349650001101358650002201369650002301391650003101414650001701445650001601462700002101478700002401499700002001523700002001543700002201563700005701585773013801642856008001780852000901860655001201869IND60614637120181121000000.0181002e20180829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061463712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b069922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiba, Alaa E.10aFrom Blue to White Luminescence in Cerium-Doped Aluminum Oxynitride: Electronic Structure and Local Chemistry Perspectives  ap. 21623-21631.  aThe excellent physical and chemical properties of aluminum oxynitride, Al(O)N, along with the tunable luminescence features of cerium ions (Ce) hold a promising future in white light sources based on chip technology. Manipulation of the emission color from blue to green, to yellow, and finally to white is demonstrated for the first time in Ce-doped Al(O)N thin films by tuning of the local structure, electronic structure, and film thickness. Analysis of the electronic structure by electron energy loss spectroscopy at the Ce-M₄,₅, Al-L₂,₃, O-K, and N-K edges and photoluminescence spectroscopies highlights the essential role of oxygen and postdeposition annealing in changing the valence state of Ce ions from Ce⁴⁺ (optically inactive) to Ce³⁺ (optically active) as well as the local field around Ce³⁺ and, finally, in activating excitation pathways through generation of specific defect complexes in the oxynitride matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aannealing 3acerium 3acolor 3aenergy 3aions 3aoxygen 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysical chemistry 3aphysicochemical properties 3aspectroscopy 3awhite light1 aPigeat, Philippe1 aBruyere, Stéphanie1 aRinnert, Hervé1 aSoldera, Flavio1 aMücklich, Frank,1 aHorwat, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7938-76470 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Aug. 29, v. 122, no. 37 p.21623-21631dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b069923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245017900173500001900352520148400371592002801855650002701883650001801910650002001928650001401948650001401962650001401976650001701990650001402007650002402021650001302045650000902058650002002067650001802087651001102105653002002116653001102136653001702147653001902164653002102183700006502204700001902269700002702288773011702315856008602432852000902518655001202527IND60723874020221119182303.0210423e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072387402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1058782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaimovici, Manuel10aLong-term changes in population dynamics and life history contribute to explain the resilience of a stock of Micropogonias furnieri (Sciaenidae, Teleostei) in the SW Atlantic  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe analysed the long-term changes in the population dynamics and life history of whitemouth croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) off Southern Brazil, to understand how four decades of heavy fishing (1976–2017) has affected its population dynamics. In the first three decades, size and age structure were eroded with the loss of the larger (> 60 cm total length) and older (>20 yrs. old) individuals. Individual growth increased sharply until the early 2000s and stabilized thereafter. The age at first maturity decreased by one year for females, the total mortality (Z) increased three-fold, and the stock size decreased approximately 90 %. Despite changes in the population structure due to intense fishing and high exploitation rates, the landings remained high until the late 2000s and in the last decade decreased less than expected by a former stock assessment. The resilience of the stock can be explained by its life history traits: (i) high fecundity, (ii) multiple spawning events during a protracted reproductive season in coastal waters, (iii) large estuarine nursery grounds unaffected by industrial fishing and (iv) faster growth and earlier sexual maturation due to the reduction in food competition and possibly evolution via gear selectivity. However, the stabilization of individual growth rates, the high rate of exploitation and the low spawning potential warn of the risk of further population decline and fishery collapse if intense fishing pressure continues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicropogonias furnieri 3aage structure 3abreeding season 3aestuaries 3aevolution 3afecundity 3alife history 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 3aresearch 3arisk 3asexual maturity 3astocking rate 3aBrazil 0aSouthern Brazil 0aGrowth 0aReproduction 0aAge truncation 0aStock assessment1 aCavole, Leticia Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0800-80881 aCope, Jason M.1 aCardoso, Luís Gustavo0 tFisheries research.g2021 May, v. 237 p.105878-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1058783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010200160300002000262520207300282592002802355650001302383650000802396650002102404650001602425650001802441650001102459650001402470650001102484650001302495650001902508650001502527650002302542650001302565650001602578650002702594650001602621650001802637700001702655700001602672700001902688700001302707773012502720856007502845852000902920655001202929IND60641262220221123001028.0210813e20160929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064126222DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra21050c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuanyuan13aAn economic and environmentally benign approach for the preparation of monolithic silica aerogels  ap. 93374-93383.  aTroublesome drying has always limited the scale-up production and wide-spread application of monolithic aerogels because of the high energy consumption and/or organic solvent utilization. In this report, a gel-emulsion-based one step method was developed for the facile, economic and environmentally friendly preparation of various monolithic silica aerogels. The wet porous silica formed in these systems could be dried at ambient-pressure without the need for solvent exchange. It was demonstrated that the stabilities of the gel-emulsions and the resultant wet porous silica gels originate from the utilization of a specially designed stabilizer, which is a derivative of cholesterol (Chol-OH). With the aid of Chol-OH, the chemical functionalities and the densities of the monolithic silica aerogels could be largely tuned via simple variation of the structures of the precursors, organosilanes, and water content in the gel emulsions. As examples, monolithic silica aerogels from super-hydrophobic (water contact angle larger than 150°) to hydrophilic (water contact angle lower than 25°) and those with a density as low as 0.026 g cm⁻³ were obtained. Moreover, the internal structures of the aerogels can also be tuned by adjusting the reaction rate of the sol–gel process. Morphology studies revealed that the as prepared monolithic silica aerogels possessed inter-connected highly porous structures, and the pore walls are composed of highly ordered meso-pore structures with an average size of ∼25 nm. Their thermal conductivities at ambient pressure, humidity, and temperature (30 °C) were as low as 20.6 mW m⁻¹ K⁻¹, which is 18% lower than that of the reference air (24.4 mW m⁻¹ K⁻¹). Considering the ease of the stabilizer preparation, the gel emulsions, and the characteristics of the aerogel preparation process, we believe that the strategy developed in the present work represents substantial progress in the field of aerogel preparation, and the monolithic silica aerogels created have great potential for real-life applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3aair 3aambient pressure 3acholesterol 3acontact angle 3adrying 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3ahumidity 3ahydrophilicity 3asilica gel 3asol-gel processing 3asolvents 3astabilizers 3asustainable technology 3atemperature 3awater content1 aPeng, Junxia1 aDu, Guanqun1 aZhang, Hongxia1 aFang, Yu0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 29, v. 6, no. 96 p.93374-93383dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21050c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245011300158300001500271520168600286592002801972650001302000650001602013650001602029650003002045650001502075650001502090650002102105650001902126650001002145650001502155650001402170650001402184650001802198700001302216700001102229700001302240700001202253700001002265700001402275700001102289700001102300700001302311700001202324700001302336773012602349856008102475852000902556655001202565IND60776613420221119061347.0220509e20200328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077661342DNAL7 a10.17221/110/2019-vetmed2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, SB10aHaemato-chemical and immune variations in Holstein cows at different stages of lactation, parity, and age  ap. 95-103.  aPhysiological components are influenced by various factors. However, little is comprehensively understood about lactation, parity, and age-related blood profile changes in dairy cows. Thus, we investigated significant variables associated with haemato-chemical and immune changes in healthy dairy cows. Blood was collected from 246 Holstein cows to analyse the physiological changes at different stages of lactation, parity, and age. The white blood cells (WBCs) and monocytes were influenced by the parity or age. Cows over three years of age showed a decreased WBC and monocyte count when compared to cows under three years of age. The lactation stage affected the red blood cell (RBC) profiles and metabolism, liver function-related components, and immunoglobulin A (IgA). A decrease in the haemoglobin (Hb) and haematocrit (HCT) were associated with peak lactation. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and total cholesterol (T-CHOL) concentrations, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activities increased in peak or mid lactation and remained high up to late lactation. An increased serum IgA concentration was observed in early and mid-lactation compared to that in late gestation. Many components of the haemato-chemical and immunological profiles changed (Hb, HCT, BUN, T-CHOL, ALT, GGT, and IgA) at a specific lactation stage under the physiological conditions. These data revealed that the lactation stage was a major variable contributing to the physiological variations in the dairy cows. Therefore, the lactation stage should be considered when determining haemato-chemical and immunological abnormalities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3aimmunoglobulin A 3alate lactation 3aliver 3ametabolism 3amonocytes 3apregnancy 3aurea nitrogen1 aJung, SH1 aDo, YJ1 aJung, YH1 aChoe, C1 aHa, S1 aJeong, HY1 aCho, A1 aOh, SI1 aKim, E.,1 aYoo, JG1 aKim, S.,0 tVeterinární medicína.g, v. 65, no. 3 p.95-103dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21422x0375-84277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/110/2019-vetmed3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245010500207300001600312520094600328592002801274650002301302650002601325650001701351650001801368653002101386653001701407653002001424653004001444653003201484653005401516653006001570653001201630653003401642653004001676700001501716700001401731700001801745773011101763856008201874852000901956655001201965IND60602648920221119215314.0180711e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060264892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2014.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Ping-Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9608-770X10aApplications of shell-isolated nanoparticles in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and fluorescence  ap. 103-117.  aShell-isolated nanoparticle (NP)-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) has expanded the versatility of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and can be applied to virtually any substrate type and morphology. Surface-plasmon resonance (SPR) can enhance fluorescence through an electromagnetic field in a similar way to SERS, which is called surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF) or metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF). The SERS-SEF dual-mode method can greatly improve the accuracy and the sensitivity of detection in applications.In this review, we introduce extension of SHINERS to shell-isolated NP-enhanced fluorescence (SHINEF) and application of the SERS-fluorescence dual-mode technique, taking advantage of SERS and fluorescence. We first introduce SHINERS and its applications, and then move on to the applications of SHINERS in SEF. Finally, we introduce application of the SERS-fluorescence dual mode to biodetection and bioimaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aelectromagnetic field 3afluorescence 3ananoparticles 0aBiocompatibility 0aBiodetection 0aIn-vivo imaging 0aLocalized surface-plasmon resonance 0aShell-isolated nanoparticle 0aShell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced fluorescence 0aShell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy 0aSHINERS 0aSurface-enhanced fluorescence 0aSurface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy1 aLu, Xihong1 aLiu, Hong1 aTong, Yexiang0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2015 Mar., v. 66 p.103-117dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2014.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245016800173300001400341500001900355520153700374592002801911650001801939650001601957650002101973650001701994650000902011650001402020650002302034650001202057650001702069650002002086650002902106650002302135650001302158653001302171653002002184653001602204653001902220653001902239700002202258700002102280700002402301700001502325700002102340700001702361700001702378700001702395773013902412856008602551852000902637655001202646IND60721213020221117191707.0201224e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072121302DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8180.2018.00016.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Faneshwar10aOptimizing of time duration of flaxseed meal feeding for optimum growth performance, carcass characteristics, and cost economics of broiler chicken meat production  ap. 44-48.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn experiment was conducted for six weeks (n=240) to investigate the optimum time duration of flaxseed meal (FM) feeding in broiler chicken. Two types of diets were formulated, one with 10% flaxseed replacing soybean and other without flaxseed. The flaxseed based diet was fed for different durations giving rise to six dietary treatment used in the experiment viz-viz. T₁ (control without FM), T₂ (10% FM; 0-5th week), T₃ (10% FM; 1-5th week), T₄ (10% FM; 2-5th week), T₅ (10% FM; 3-5th week), and T₆ (10% FM; 4-5th week). The results revealed that addition of 10% flaxseed have revealed the negative effects on the overall growth performance of the birds. However, the negative effects were overcome by reducing the duration of flaxseed feeding from five weeks to three weeks. The growth performance of birds fed flaxseed from 2–5 weeks of age was similar to that of control diet (no flaxseed) fed birds. No significant effect of feeding flaxseed meal for different durations was found on the carcass traits studied. However, increasing the duration of flaxseed feeding from zero to three weeks resulted in progressive decline of abdominal fat percentage. The cost per kilogram live weight or meat yield increased progressively with increasing duration of flaxseed feeding. The study concluded that feeding of 10% flaxseed meal to broiler chicken for three weeks duration (2–5 weeks of age) has no adverse effects of the growth performance, carcass characteristics and cost economics of broiler chicken production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal fat 3abody weight 3abroiler chickens 3achicken meat 3adiet 3aeconomics 3agrowth performance 3alinseed 3alinseed meal 3ameat production 3anutritional intervention 3apoultry production 3asoybeans 0aFlaxseed 0aBroiler chicken 0aPerformance 0aCarcass traits 0aCost economics1 aTyagi, Praveen K.1 aMir, Nasir Akbar1 aBiswas, Ashim Kumar1 aDev, Kapil1 aTyagi, Pramod K.1 aMandal, A.B.1 aBhanja, S.K.1 aSahu, Bharti0 tIndian journal of poultry science.g2018 Apr., v. 53, no. 1 p.44-48dIndian Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:1944x0974-81807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-8180.2018.00016.83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245008000157300001600237520066800253592002800921650004100949650002500990650001301015650001301028650002201041700001501063700001601078773015201094856007701246852000901323655001201332IND60765067320221119025209.0220419e20141230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076506732DNAL7 a10.17221/36/2013-rae2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolák, P.10aMonitoring of conditions of agricultural machines&rsquo; parts in operation  ap.

The case of Mexico  aIn the last 25 years, unplanned and dispersed urban development has become the norm rather than the exception mostly in medium and small cities of the global south, a region with high poverty rates and weak institutions in charge of land use changes. This paper is based on environmental discourses and governance policy integration to address the limitations in preventing the conversion of open land, which provides ecosystem services, into settlement land. It analyzes the case of the Metropolitan Zone of Queretaro in central Mexico, which has experienced particularly high rates of urban expansion in recent years. This paper focuses on the private sector's significant contribution to urban sprawl, a situation linked to the following deficits: policy domain integration deficit, which is related to competing goals among multi-level, multi-scale and multi-sector actors; the interdisciplinary deficit, which requires various procedures and instruments to promote stakeholder collaboration; and the democracy deficit, which involves micro-level actions rather than substantive policy design to encourage citizens to become agents of change and develop awareness of the value of nature in cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aecosystem services 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3aplanning 3apoverty 3aprivate sector 3astakeholders 3aurbanization 3aMexico 0aUrban sprawl 0aSustainable urban land planning 0aPolicy integration 0aAdaptive governance 0aEnvironmental regulatory frameworks1 aRibeiro Palacios, Mónica,1 aMorales Gomez, Claudia Abigail0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 259 p.109575-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1095753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03697naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014100175500001900316520208700335592002802422650001402450650001002464650001202474650002302486650002702509650001602536650001302552650002202565651003102587653001502618653002502633653001402658653002202672653001102694653004402705700006402749700002302813700001702836700001902853700006202872700001902934700006502953773010203018856008603120852000903206655001203215IND60723874120221119182347.0210423e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072387412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1058792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKendall, Matthew S.10aWinds, waves, warm waters, weekdays, and which ways boats are counted influence predicted visitor use at an offshore fishing destination  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aQuantifying the number of recreational fishers is important for many aspects of managing coastal resources. Unfortunately, quantifying recreational boaters in offshore settings has proven difficult due to their distance from shore and a lack of cost-effective methods to monitor small boats (<10 m length). We investigated visitor-use at an offshore marine protected area (MPA) in the southeastern USA. We used multiple methods of counting boats (satellites, buoy camera, passive acoustics, and boat-based observations) and a generalized linear modeling approach to identify environmental and calendar-based predictor variables that influenced visitation. Based on the model, predicted visitor-encounter rates were estimated for various weather and calendar-based scenarios, and the probability of detecting a hypothetical change in visitation with each counting method was examined through a power analysis. The most important predictors were day of the week, special day (e.g., tournament), water temperature, and wave height. Boat counts were 2–5 times higher on weekend days than on weekdays. More boats were predicted on weekdays with good weather (defined as water temperature 24 °C, wave height 0.5 m), than weekends with decent weather (17 °C and 1 m). Considering weekends alone, those with good weather were predicted to have 5 times higher visitation than weekends with decent weather. Predicted visitation was highest on calm days, dropped by ∼75 % when wave height reached 1 m, and was essentially zero when wave height exceeded 1.5 m. Highest counts were predicted when water temperature was warmest and gradually declined as temperatures cooled. For the buoy camera and passive acoustic boat-count methods, power analysis suggested that 3–6 years of typical samples before and after a hypothetical 25 % increase in visitation would be needed to have an 80 % chance of detecting the change. Other techniques would take 14 or more years of typical samples. The process used here for investigating visitation can be adapted to other offshore or remote locations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aboats 3acameras 3acost effectiveness 3amarine protected areas 3aprobability 3aresearch 3awater temperature 3aSoutheastern United States 0aVisitation 0aRecreational fishing 0aSatellite 0aPassive acoustics 0aCamera 0aGray’s Reef National Marine sanctuary1 aWilliams, Bethany L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5722-83861 aWinship, Arliss J.1 aCarson, Mark1 aGrissom, Karen1 aRowell, Timothy J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5756-62541 aStanley, Jenni1 aRoberson, Kimberly W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0726-209X0 tFisheries research.g2021 May, v. 237 p.105879-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1058793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01923naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245013900169300001400308520069200322592002801014650001301042650001301055650001301068650001001081650001201091653001701103653002001120653002201140653001801162653002801180653002501208700001501233700001601248700002101264700001501285700001501300773010201315856008701417852000901504655001201513IND60552602720221120081607.0161021e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055260272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPircher, R.10aSkin blister formation together with patterned intradermal hematoma: A special type of tire mark injury in victims run over by a wheel  ap. 42-46.  aA traffic accident victim run over by a vehicle may show a patterned skin hematoma reflecting the grooves of the tire's profile.

The macro- and micromorphological findings as well as the protein composition of the blister fluid were investigated on the basis of a relevant autopsy case.

Currently, research on water hammer-caused collapse is mostly based on single-point collapse cases, but water hammer research, which involves multipoint collapse, is insufficient. Here, we establish an experimental platform to realize water hammers with multipoint collapse. With different schemes, i.e., various initial flow rates and valve closing speeds, we observed the hydraulic transient process with a high-speed camera, analyzed its characteristics and explained experimental phenomena with theoretical knowledge. Using experimental data analysis, we summarized the influencing factors and laws of the cavity length and water hammer pressure. Flow and pressure data for the different schemes were recorded to provide basic simulation data. Water column separation experimental phenomena were observed: completely atomized, completely cavitated and partially cavitated, and both cavitated and atomized. At the pump outlet, three hydraulic transition states occurred simultaneously in the horizontal pipe section: completely atomized, completely cavitated, and both cavitated and atomized. Two hydraulic transition states occurred in the knee region: completely and partially cavitated, and without atomization. The experimental results reveal that the initial flow rate and valve closing speed greatly affect the water hammer pressure rise and cavity length. The higher the initial flow rate and valve closing speed are, the larger the water hammer pressure rise and cavity length are.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomization 3acameras 3awater1 aYang, Yusi 1 aWang, Tong 1 aHan, Wensheng 1 aWu, Rongchu 1 aWang, Pengli 1 aWang, Qiaoning 1 aZhou, Liang 0 tWater.g2020 Sept. 14, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120925663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002200176245015000198300001500348520122200363592002801585650000901613650002201622650002301644650001001667650002301677650001701700650002101717650001201738650001401750650001101764700002001775773015201795856006901947856010502016990002302121852000902144655001202153IND60643852120221118024911.0190514e20151210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064385212DNAL7 a10.3791/534162doi7 aPMC46927902pmcid7 a267095942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeshka, Nicole E.10aMeasurement of h2s in crude oil and crude oil headspace using multidimensional gas chromatography, deans switching and sulfur-selective detection  ap. e53416.  aA method for the analysis of dissolved hydrogen sulfide in crude oil samples is demonstrated using gas chromatography. In order to effectively eliminate interferences, a two dimensional column configuration is used, with a Deans switch employed to transfer hydrogen sulfide from the first to the second column (heart-cutting). Liquid crude samples are first separated on a dimethylpolysiloxane column, and light gases are heart-cut and further separated on a bonded porous layer open tubular (PLOT) column that is able to separate hydrogen sulfide from other light sulfur species. Hydrogen sulfide is then detected with a sulfur chemiluminescence detector, adding an additional layer of selectivity. Following separation and detection of hydrogen sulfide, the system is backflushed to remove the high-boiling hydrocarbons present in the crude samples and to preserve chromatographic integrity. Dissolved hydrogen sulfide has been quantified in liquid samples from 1.1 to 500 ppm, demonstrating wide applicability to a range of samples. The method has also been successfully applied for the analysis of gas samples from crude oil headspace and process gas bags, with measurement from 0.7 to 9,700 ppm hydrogen sulfide.  aPublisher supplied data 3abags 3achemiluminescence 3agas chromatography 3agases 3aheadspace analysis 3ahydrocarbons 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aliquids 3apetroleum 3asulfur1 aHager, Darcy B.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2015 Dec. 10, , no. 106 p.e53416-e53416dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/534163Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53416/measurement-h2s-crude-oil-crude-oil-headspace-using-multidimensional  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245016200163520192900325592002802254650002902282650002102311650001502332650002002347650001802367650001402385650001402399650001602413650001602429650001302445650001102458650001402469700002202483700002102505700002002526700002002546700002602566700002102592700002202613700002202635773012102657856007302778852000902851655001202860IND60748767820221122215615.0210827e20210722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074876782DNAL7 a10.3390/v130814222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhutta, Maimoona S.10aPeptide Inhibitor of Complement C1, RLS-0071, Reduces Zosteriform Spread of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Skin Infection and Promotes Survival in Infected Mice  aHerpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a prevalent human pathogen primarily transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, especially on and around mucosal surfaces where there is contact with contaminated saliva during periods of viral shedding. It is estimated that 90% of adults worldwide have HSV-1 antibodies. Cutaneous HSV-1 infections are characterized by a sensation of tingling or numbness at the initial infection site followed by an eruption of vesicles and then painful ulcers with crusting. These symptoms can take ten days to several weeks to heal, leading to significant morbidity. Histologically, infections cause ballooning degeneration of keratinocytes and formation of multinucleated giant cells, ultimately resulting in a localized immune response. Commonly prescribed treatments against HSV-1 infections are nucleoside analogs, such as acyclovir (ACV). However, the emergence of ACV-resistant HSV (ACVᴿ-HSV) clinical isolates has created an urgent need for the development of compounds to control symptoms of cutaneous infections. RLS-0071, also known as peptide inhibitor of complement C1 (PIC1), is a 15-amino-acid anti-inflammatory peptide that inhibits classical complement pathway activation and modulates neutrophil activation. It has been previously shown to aid in the healing of chronic diabetic wounds by inhibiting the excessive activation of complement component C1 and infiltration of leukocytes. Here, we report that treatment of cutaneous infections of HSV-1 and ACVᴿ-HSV-1 in BALB/cJ mice with RLS-0071 significantly reduced the rate of mortality, decreased zosteriform spread, and enhanced the healing of the infection-associated lesions compared to control-treated animals. Therefore, RLS-0071 may work synergistically with other antiviral drugs to aid in wound healing of HSV-1 cutaneous infection and may potentially aid in rapid wound healing of other pathology not limited to HSV-1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 1 3aanimal pathogens 3acomplement 3aimmune response 3akeratinocytes 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aneutrophils 3anucleosides 3apeptides 3asaliva 3asensation1 aSausen, Daniel G.1 aReed, Kirstin M.1 aGallo, Elisa S.1 aHair, Pamela S.1 aLassiter, Brittany P.1 aKrishna, Neel K.1 aCunnion, Kenji M.1 aBorenstein, Ronen0 tViruses.g2021 July 22, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130814223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03534naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245018300212300001800395520147100413592002801884650001301912650001901925650001801944650001801962650001601980650001301996650001802009650002002027650001002047650003102057650001902088650001702107650000702124650001702131650001002148650001902158653001602177653001402193653002502207653001302232700006302245700006702308700006502375700006702440700006102507700006602568700006702634700006802701773012002769856008202889852000902971655001202980IND60755467120221117222914.0211102e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075546712DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820210012202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndré, Weibson P.

Thus, the current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of carvacryl acetate nanoencapsulated with biopolymers (nCVA) in the control of sheep gastrointestinal nematodes. CVA was nanoencapsulated with chitosan/chichá gum and characterized in terms of its efficacy of encapsulation (EE), yield and zeta potential. The acute toxicity of nCVA was evaluated in mice. For the fecal egg count reduction test, 40 animals were divided into four groups (n = 10) and orally administered the following treatments: G1, 250 mg kg⁻¹ CVA; G2, 250 mg kg⁻¹ nCVA; G3, chitosan/chichá gum (negative control) and G4, 2.5 mg kg⁻¹ monepantel (positive control). Feces were collected on days 0 and 16 posttreatment to determine the eggs per gram of feces (epg). The EE and yield of nCVA were 72.8 and 57.5%, respectively. The nanoparticles showed a size of 764.5 ± 302.5 nm, and the zeta potential at pH 3.2 was +22.0 mV. nCVA presented a 50% lethal dose (LD₅₀) of 2609 mg kg⁻¹. By 16 days posttreatment, CVA, nCVA and monepantel reduced the epg by 52.9.7, 71.5 and 98.7%, respectively, and the epg of sheep treated with nCVA differed from that of the negative control (P > 0.05) but did not differ from that of sheep treated with CVA. In conclusion, the nanoencapsulation of CVA reduced its toxicity, and nCVA showed anthelmintic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacute toxicity 3aanthelmintics 3abiocomposites 3abiopolymers 3achitosan 3aencapsulation 3afecal egg count 3afeces 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3alethal dose 50 3ananocapsules 3apH 3aparasitology 3asheep 3azeta potential 0aAcetylation 0acarvacrol 0aHaemonchus contortus 0atoxicity1 aJunior, José R.

This phenomenon, found so far only in laboratory studies, may have ecological importance in nature. We present the first evidence that litter sex ratio has consequences for lifetime reproductive success in mammals. Female Alpine marmots born in a maleâbiased litter, i.e. more likely to be located in utero next to male foetuses, are more likely to be dominant later in life â a prerequisite for reproduction in this species. We found no evidence for lower reproductive output of these females, a common cost of prenatal masculinization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarmota 3aadults 3afemales 3amammals 3amasculinization 3aphenotype 3areproductive performance 3asex ratio1 aArnold, Walter,0 tMammal review.g2012 Oct., v. 42, no. 4 p.310-313dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-18387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2907.2011.00199.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245010600208300002000314506007600334520133200410592002801742506003701770650001001807650001601817650001601833650001901849650002201868650001901890650001501909650001401924650001801938653001401956653001901970700002501989700002202014700001902036700001902055700002402074700002302098700003102121700002102152700002002173700002002193700001902213773017502232856007902407852000902486655001202495IND60173623520221207125512.0150603e20130409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017362352DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12184461102doi7 aPMC36253392pmcid7 a235200482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUbelmann, Florent10aEnterocyte loss of polarity and gut wound healing rely upon the F-actin–severing function of villin  ap. E1380-E1389.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEfficient wound healing is required to maintain the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier because of its constant exposure to a large variety of environmental stresses. This process implies a partial cell depolarization and the acquisition of a motile phenotype that involves rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton. Here we address how polarized enterocytes harboring actin-rich apical microvilli undergo extensive cell remodeling to drive injury repair. Using live imaging technologies, we demonstrate that enterocytes in vitro and in vivo rapidly depolarize their microvilli at the wound edge. Through its F-actin–severing activity, the microvillar actin-binding protein villin drives both apical microvilli disassembly in vitro and in vivo and promotes lamellipodial extension. Photoactivation experiments indicate that microvillar actin is mobilized at the lamellipodium, allowing optimal migration. Finally, efficient repair of colonic mechanical injuries requires villin severing of F-actin, emphasizing the importance of villin function in intestinal homeostasis. Thus, villin severs F-actin to ensure microvillus depolarization and enterocyte remodeling upon injury. This work highlights the importance of specialized apical pole disassembly for the repolarization of epithelial cells initiating migration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactin 3aenterocytes 3ahomeostasis 3aimage analysis 3amechanical damage 3amicrofilaments 3amicrovilli 3aphenotype 3atissue repair 0aintestine 0aactin dynamics1 aChamaillard, Mathias1 aEl-Marjou, Fatima1 aSimon, Anthony1 aNetter, Jeanne1 aVignjevic, Danijela1 aNichols, Buford L.1 aQuezada Calvillo, Roberto,1 aGrandjean, Teddy1 aLouvard, Daniel1 aRevenu, Céline1 aRobine, Sylvie0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Apr. 9, v. 110, no. 15 p.E1380-E1389dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12184461103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245008200163300001400245506002800259520118300287592002801470506003701498650001701535650002501552650001301577650001101590650001401601650001001615650002101625651001301646653001701659653002101676653003201697653002101729700001601750773013301766856007601899852000901975655001201984IND60784749520221207113208.0090701e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078474952DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha3412952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBOROVINOVA, Maria10aComparison of integrated and conventional plant protection of cherry orchards  ap. 93-99.  aResource is Open Access  aThe investigations were carried out in four fruit bearing sweet cherry orchards (60 ha) of the Institute of Agriculture in Kyustendil during 1990-2006 (with intermission). Two plant protection technologies for control of cherry leaf spot and cherry fruit fly were applied: T1 - conventional with protective application for controlling of cherry leaf spot and pest control by treatments independently of its density. T2 - integrated protection with post infection (curative) treatments against cherry leaf spot according to the method of Eisensmith and Jones (1981a, 1981b) and control of cherry fruit fly and other pests according to the threshold. During the period of investigation seven fungi, one bacteria and nine pests were permanent species which caused damage of cherry in Kyustendil region (South - western Bulgaria). The key disease and pest were cherry leaf spot (B. jaapii) and cherry fruit fly (R. cerasi). The number of treatments in the integrated plant protection treatment of cherry was reduced by application of post infection (curative) treatments against cherry leaf spot and threshold for R. cerasi established in the Institute of agriculture in Kyustendil.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPrunus avium 3aRhagoletis cingulata 3acherries 3afruits 3aleaf spot 3apests 3aplant protection 3aBulgaria 0aconventional 0acherry leaf spot 0aintegrated plant protection 0acherry fruit fly1 aSREDKOV, I.0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2006 Aug., v. 34, no. 1 p.93-99dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha3412953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01374naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245006100170300001400231506002800245520032200273592002800595506003700623650001300660650001000673650001000683653002500693653001000718653000800728653002500736653005100761773013600812856007900948852000901027655001201036IND60784749620221207113220.0200719e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078474962DNAL7 a10.21608/mb.2020.999512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Azeem, Mohamed Abd10aJean Mouchacca: The mycologist and Ramesses II’s mummy  ap. 58-60.  aResource is Open Access  aFinding the cause of the deterioration and arresting it were imperatives in the study.

Over 19 species of predators and parasitoids have been found to prey on M. sorghi. Natural enemies may reside in vegetation such as sorghum in cultivation (in-season) and persist after harvest (off-season), in Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense) (L.) and riparian areas consisting of shrubs and grasses, including Johnson grass. The objective was to assess the ability of these vegetation types to harbor M. sorghi natural enemies during and between annual grain sorghum production. Predator diversity was greatest in riparian vegetation in-season, with twelve species detected across seven families, and four orders of insects. Six lady beetle (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) species were abundant in-season, and Cycloneda sanguinea (L.) persisted at relatively high abundance off-season. Parasitoid diversity was more limited (two primary parasitoids and one hyperparasitoid detected) with the primary parasitoids commonly detected. Aphelinus nigritus (Howard) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), accounted for 85% and 57% of parasitoids in- and off-season, respectively. Aphelinus nigritus abundance was steady across the annual sorghum season in all vegetation types. Results from this study will inform land-management strategies on how diverse vegetations can play a role in the biological control of M. sorghi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphelinus 3aCycloneda 3aMelanaphis 3aSorghum bicolor 3aSorghum halepense 3aagroecosystems 3abiological control 3agrain sorghum 3agrasses 3ahyperparasitoids 3aland management 3ariparian vegetation 3aNorth America1 aBrewer, Michael J.1 aElliott, Norman C.0 tInsects.g2022 July 06, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects130706063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01227naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015100160300001400311520021900325592002800544650002500572650001300597650002900610650001500639700002100654700002100675700002200696773012400718856007400842852000900916655001200925IND60637005420221118060046.0190413e20190412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063700542DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra90026h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaqbool, Qaisar10aRETRACTION: Organometallic Ag nanostructures prepared using Hypericum perforatum extract are highly effective against multidrug-resistant bacteria  ap. 11459.  aRetraction of ‘Organometallic Ag nanostructures prepared using Hypericum perforatum extract are highly effective against multidrug-resistant bacteria’ by Qaisar Maqbool et al., RSC Adv., 2018, 8, 30562–30572.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypericum perforatum 3abacteria 3amultiple drug resistance 3ananosilver1 aKruszka, Dariusz1 aKachlicki, Piotr1 aFranklin, Gregory0 tRSC advances.g2019 Apr. 12, v. 9, no. 20 p.11459-11459dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra90026h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245010100212300001600313506007600329520133400405592002801739506003701767650001101804650001601815650002401831650001101855650001001866650001001876650002301886650001001909650001601919650001801935650002201953650001101975650003101986650001302017650002002030650002102050650002402071650001002095653001602105653001402121653001702135653000902152653001402161653001102175700003102186700001702217700001802234700001602252700002302268700006002291700003102351700005902382773010102441856008602542852000902628655001202637IND60582837820221207135824.0190319e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058283782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.08.0202doi7 aPMC56465242pmcid7 a293987622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalt, Louise J.10aIntrinsic wheat lipid composition effects the interfacial and foaming properties of dough liquor  ap. 211-222.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDoughs were prepared from a single variety breadmaking flour (cv. Hereward), from three successive harvests (years; 2011, 2012 and 2013). A preparation of the aqueous phase from dough, known as dough liquor (DL), was prepared by ultracentrifugation and its physico-chemical properties were investigated. Surface tension and interfacial rheology, showed that the interface of DL was lipid-dominated and that 2013 DL had a different type of interface to 2011 and 2012 DL. This data was consistent with the improved foam stability observed for 2013 DL and with the types of lipids identified. All foams collapsed quickly, but the most stable foam was from 2013 DL with 89.2% loss in foam, followed by 2011 DL with 91.7% loss and 2012 had the least stable foam with a loss of 92.5% of the foam structure. Glycolipids (DGDG and MGDG) were enriched in 2013 DL, and were also present in DL foam, contributing towards improved stability. Neutral lipids, such as FFAs, were enriched in DL foams contributing towards instability and rapid foam collapse. Baking trials using 2012 and 2013 flour, showed increased loaf volumes and gas bubble diameter in 2013 bread compared to 2012 bread, highlighting the potential impact that surface active polar lipids, enriched in the aqueous phase of dough, could have on improving breadmaking quality.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abaking 3abreadmaking 3abreadmaking quality 3abreads 3adough 3aflour 3afoaming properties 3afoams 3aglycolipids 3ahydrocolloids 3alipid composition 3aloaves 3aphysicochemical properties 3arheology 3asurface tension 3atriacylglycerols 3aultracentrifugation 3awheat 0aBreadmaking 0aGas cells 0aDough liquor 0aFoam 0aStability 0aLipids1 aGonzález-Thuillier, Irene1 aChope, Gemma1 aPenson, Simon1 aTosi, Paola1 aHaslam, Richard P.1 aSkeggs, Peter K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2250-32611 aShewry, P.

It is characterized by unilateral motor impairments that are frequently dominated in the upper limb. In addition to a reduced movement capacity of the affected upper limb, several children with unilateral CP show a reduced awareness of the remaining movement capacity of that limb. This phenomenon of disregarding the preserved capacity of the affected upper limb is regularly referred to as Developmental Disregard (DD). Different theories have been postulated to explain DD, each suggesting slightly different guidelines for therapy. Still, cognitive processes that might additionally contribute to DD in children with unilateral CP have never been directly studied. The current protocol was developed to study cognitive aspects involved in upper limb control in children with unilateral CP with and without DD. This was done by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) extracted from the ongoing EEG during target-response tasks asking for a hand-movement response. ERPs consist of several components, each of them associated with a well-defined cognitive process (e.g., the N1 with early attention processes, the N2 with cognitive control and the P3 with cognitive load and mental effort). Due to its excellent temporal resolution, the ERP technique enables to study several covert cognitive processes preceding overt motor responses and thus allows insight into the cognitive processes that might contribute to the phenomenon of DD. Using this protocol adds a new level of explanation to existing behavioral studies and opens new avenues to the broader implementation of research on cognitive aspects of developmental movement restrictions in children.  aPublisher supplied data 3acerebral palsy 3achildhood 3achildren 3acognition 3aelectroencephalography 3aguidelines 3atherapeutics1 aSteenbergen, Bert1 aBaas, C.

This article focuses on one aspect of that supply chain – woodchip storage. To encourage the establishment of a bioenergy market and to help ensure a safe and stable fuel source, Suzanne Wetzel and Christopher Helmeste from the Canadian Forest Service, Canadian Wood Fibre Centre (CFS/CWFC) and collaborators contributed their scientific expertise to the development of a solid biofuels guide based on existing national standards from the Canadian Standard Association’s (CSA). This paper explores the potential economic impacts for bioenergy producers of implementing the CSA guidelines. These impacts include reducing material and energy loss during transportation and storage. Potential benefits were determined by cost-benefit analysis. The results of this economic impact study have significant potential implications for bioenergy producers, including the integration of economic considerations in the development of policies for biomass feedstock optimization for the Canadian bioenergy industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy industry 3abiofuels 3acost benefit analysis 3aeconomic impact 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3aforests 3amarkets 3asupply chain 3atransportation 3awood chips 3awood fibers 3awoody biomass 0asolid biofuels guide 0aeconomic impacts0 tForestry chronicle.g2021 Sept., v. 97, no. 3 p.263-265dNRC Research PresswJournal:12176x0015-75467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc2021-0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01615naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100003700180245009900217300001300316506007600329520030400405592002800709506003700737650002600774650002900800650001000829650001600839650002500855650002600880651001300906700003000919700002300949700001700972700001900989773012101008856007901129852000901208655001201217IND4501631420221207144142.0150427e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450163142DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.06580-112doi7 aPMC32948192pmcid7 a223287442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhd Sakaff, Muhd Khairul Luqman10aComplete Genome Sequence of the Thermophilic Bacterium Geobacillus thermoleovorans CCB_US3_UF5  ap. 1239.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGeobacillus thermoleovorans CCB_US3_UF5 is a thermophilic bacterium isolated from a hot spring in Malaysia.

The major chemical components in PM₂.₅, including the metal elements, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and inorganic water-soluble ions, were monitored. A positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was used to apportion the potential sources of PM₂.₅ at the two sites in the daytime and nighttime. The results indicated that the PM₂.₅ concentration was higher in the suburban area than in the urban area during the daytime in winter. The daytime and nighttime PAHs concentrations at both sites were both generally higher in winter than in summer. The concentrations of some of the metal elements were higher in summer than in winter. Regional differences and day and night differences in the metals and water-soluble ions commonly existed. The PMF analysis indicated that coal combustion and transportation-related sources were the predominant sources in the urban and suburban areas in the daytime in winter, and secondary aerosols were the most important source for the suburban area in the nighttime in winter. There were more pollution sources of PM₂.₅ during the daytime in summer, especially in the suburban area. In the nighttime in summer, the pollution sources of PM₂.₅ in the urban and suburbs areas were basically the same, but the source apportionment was quite different.  aPublisher supplied data  aDQGG0401& DQGG0405cNational Research Program for Key Issues in Air Pollution Control Funds  aCDCKY1404cTianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Technology Funds 3aaerosols 3acoal 3acombustion 3aions 3ametals 3amodels 3aparticulates 3apollution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asuburban areas 3asummer 3aurban areas 3awater solubility 3awinter 3aChina1 aFeng, Lihong1 aShang, Bodong1 aLi, Jianping1 aLv, Guang1 aWu, Yinghong0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2019 May, v. 76, no. 4 p.591-604dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3984x0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-019-00614-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245011300162506002800275520157300303592002801876506003701904650001101941650001401952650001501966650001901981650000902000650002402009650002402033650002002057650001902077650001402096650003702110650001302147651001402160700002102174773012002195856007902315852000902394655001202403IND60784750120221207104506.0220722s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078475012DNAL7 a10.18343/jipi.27.3.4442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatheus, Rupa10aPerbaikan Kualitas Kimia Vertisol Melalui Pemberian Bahan Organik Mucuna, Crotolaria, dan Dosis Pupuk Hayati  aResource is Open Access  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the treatment of organic material sources Mucuna and Crotolaria and the dose of vesicle arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) on the chemical quality of vertisol, nutrient uptake and maize yield in dry land. The research was carried out in the experimental field of the Kupang State Agricultural Polytechnic, in the village of Oesao, East Kupang District, Kupang Regency, East Nusa Tenggara. The study took place from May to September 2021. The study design used a factorial randomized block design. The first factortreatment was source of organic matter (B) of ground cover plant biomass, namely: B0 = no ground cover plant biomass; BM = Mucuna and its biomass are immersed; BC = Crotolaria and its biomass immersed. The second treatment was dose of VAM biofertilizer (D), namely: M0 = 0 g plant-1 (without VAM); M1 = 10 g plant-1; M2 = 20 g plant-1. The results showed that the application of organic material sources and the dose of VAM, respectively, could significantly improve the chemical properties of vertisol. The results showed that the use of organic matter and dose of VAM independently was proven to be the most effective in improving the chemical quality of vertisol. Application of organic matter Mucuna and Crotolaria at a dose of VAM 20 g plant-1 significantly increased N uptake in maize by 53.26‒54.45%, maize P uptake by 27.83% and 28.85%, and the yield of dry shelled corn by 146.92% and 146.92% compared to other treatments.

On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence, the strain SFA13 was a species in genera Microbacterium. The isolate showed unusual ability of autotrophic nitrification with the ratio of 0.11mg NH4+-N/L/h at 5°C. Ammonium was consumed by the strain SFA13 with the biodegradation of organic carbon and without nitrite or nitrate accumulation. NO3−-N or NO2−-N was reduced by the strain SFA13. The denitrification ratio was 0.24mgNO3−-N/L/h. Hydroxylamine oxidase, nitrite reductase and nitrate reductase were detectable. The putative nitrogen removal process by the strain SFA13 was as follows: NH4+→NH2OH→NO2−→NO3−, then NO3−→NO2−→N2. Biological activated carbon attached with the strain SFA13 could effectively remove ammonium in surface water with the rate of 2.68±0.27–3.16±0.25mgNH4+-N/L/h at C/N 2–10, temperature 10°C, and DO>5.2mg/L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrobacterium 3aactivated carbon 3aaerobic conditions 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiodegradation 3adenitrification 3anitrate reductase 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrite reductase 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal RNA 3arivers 3asurface water 3awater temperature 2aActinomycetalesxclassificationxenzymologyxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aNitratesxmetabolism 2aNitrification 2aNitritesxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxmetabolism 2aWater Purificationxmethods 0aHeterotrophic nitrification 0aAmmonium 0aDrinking water 0aLow temperature 0aMicrobacterium sp.1 aLi, Weiguang1 aHuang, Xiaofei1 aQin, Wen1 aLiu, Miao0 tBioresource technology.g2013 June, v. 137 p.147-152dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.03.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100005800189245014500247300001600392506007600408520166000484592002802144596005902172506003702231650001102268650001602279650001102295650001902306650002002325650001302345650002002358650001402378650002302392650003102415650001502446650001302461650001402474650000902488650001402497650001502511650002702526650001102553650001802564651001702582700001602599700001602615773014102631856008202772852000902854655001202863IND60637005820221207140529.0190413e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063700582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00244-019-00617-w2doi7 aPMC64698212pmcid7 a308791202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdeniji, A.

A total of 60 surface water and 19 sediment samples were collected from 5 sites of the estuary over a period of 6 months (December 2015 to May 2016). Extraction of PAHs from the water and sediment samples was achieved by using liquid–liquid and soxhlet extraction methods respectively, followed by column clean up with silica gel and quantification by gas chromatography–flame ionization detection. Individual PAH levels in the water and sediment samples ranged from not detected (ND) to 24.91 μg/L and ND to 7792 μg/kg, respectively. Total concentrations of the PAHs in the water and sediment samples varied as 14.91–206 μg/L and 1107–22,310 μg/kg in that order. Total levels of the contaminants were above the target values in the two matrices and were higher in summer than autumn. Although the noncarcinogenic risk of PAHs estimated in the water column through dermal absorption was very low compared with the target value, the carcinogenic risk determined was high for both adults and children. Similarly, benzo(a)pyrene and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene were found to be of higher carcinogenic and mutagenic risks in the sediments collected from the study area. Diagnostic ratios suggest that the target hydrocarbons are predominantly from pyrolytic sources. It therefore could be inferred that the water body is conspicuously polluted; hence, efforts should be made to control all the activities contributing to such magnitude of pollution at the sites.  aPublisher supplied data  aUFH/SAMRC/P790cSouth African Medical Research Council0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aanthracenes 3aautumn 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3acarcinogenicity 3achildren 3adermal exposure 3aestuaries 3agas chromatography 3ahealth effects assessments 3aionization 3amutagens 3apollution 3arisk 3asediments 3asilica gel 3asolid phase extraction 3asummer 3asurface water 3aSouth Africa1 aOkoh, O.

Health authorities of European countries having traditional spa culture strictly control hygienic conditions of bathing in thermal/mineral waters. These regulations are based on the assumption that chemical treatment (disinfection) of such waters impacts their healing effects. However, a slow change of paradigm has been observed in studying the mode of action of spa waters that could help overcome recent attitudes. Organic content or the role of microbiome has also been emphasized by some authors recently. The article deals with possible interactions among aquatic microorganisms and the disinfection and health effects of spa waters and tries to explain the new findings in this field.  aPublisher supplied data  a34039cÁltalános Orvostudományi Kar, Pécsi Tudományegyetem 3aattitudes and opinions 3abioclimatology 3achemical treatment 3adisinfection 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahygiene 3amechanism of action 3amicrobiome 3amicroorganisms 3aEurope0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2019 Aug., v. 63, no. 8 p.1135-1138dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46344x0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-019-01722-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245008100171300001600252520161400268592002801882650001901910650001801929650001601947650001101963650002201974650001601996650001102012650001502023650001702038650002202055650002202077650001002099650001102109650001602120650001202136650001502148650001102163700006802174773014102242856008202383852000902465655001202474IND60637005920221118060101.0190413e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063700592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00244-019-00616-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Sunil Kumar10aDependence of urban air pollutants on morning/evening peak hours and seasons  ap. 572-590.  aTraffic emission is a major source of air pollution in urban cities of developing world. This paper shows dependence of traffic-related air pollutants in urban cities on morning/evening peak hours and winter/summer seasons. This research also shows the meteorological impact, such as temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and wind speed (WS), on traffic-related air pollutants in urban cites. Based on the research output, the elevated level of PM concentration was observed between 1.8 and 6.7 times at all nearby roadway locations compared with background (IIT [ISM] campus). We have found 2.3, 2.4, 2.6 (morning) and 2.0, 2.1, and 2.1 (evening) times higher average PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, and PM₁ concentrations, respectively, in the winter than summer monitoring periods across all locations, due to the stable boundary layer, lower mixing height, and lower friction velocity. It is indicated that urban meteorology plays a crucial role in increasing or decreasing exposed pollutant concentrations in various microenvironments. The analysis of PM₂.₅/PM₁₀ ratios was lower during whole campaign due to higher contribution of coarser particles generated by vehicles. During winter and summer seasons, 0.57 and 0.33 was observed, respectively. It is indicated that 57% and 33% of PM₁₀ makes up PM₂.₅ particle, respectively. PM concentrations have showed a negative linear relationship with T and WS and positive relationship with RH in winter/summer seasons. Therefore, traffic and meteorology play a big role to increase or decrease in traffic-related air pollutants in urban air quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acities 3afriction velocity 3ameteorology 3amixing 3amonitoring 3aparticulates 3apollution control 3arelative humidity 3aroads 3asummer 3atemperature 3atraffic 3awind speed 3awinter1 aElumalai, Suresh Pandian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4104-17760 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2019 May, v. 76, no. 4 p.572-590dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3984x0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-019-00616-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245009900184300001600283520138200299592002801681650001701709650002101726650001601747650001701763650002501780650001601805650001701821650002201838650001201860650002001872650001001892650001101902650002101913650002401934650001401958650001501972650005201987650001002039650001302049650002602062650001302088650002402101650001802125650002302143650003102166650007902197650003702276650002202313650002802335650001402363650004102377650005302418650004002471650005902511700001702570700002002587700001802607700001902625773009802644856004802742852000902790655001202799IND50066136820221118085024.0130502e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006613682DNAL7 a233389822pmid7 a10.1007/s12033-012-9645-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalra, Shikha10aCharacterization of Squalene synthase Gene from Chlorophytum borivilianum (Sant. and Fernand.)  ap. 944-953.  aSaponins are important group of secondary metabolites known for their pharmacological properties. Chlorophytum borivilianum contains high amount of saponins and is thus, recognized as an important medicinal plant with aphrodisiac properties. Though the plant is well known for its pharmaceutical properties, there is meager information available about the genes and enzymes responsible for biosynthesis of saponins from this plant. Squalene synthase (SqS) is the key enzyme of saponin biosynthesis pathway and here, we report cloning and characterization of SqS gene from C. borivilianum. A full-length CbSqS cDNA consisting of 1,760 bp was cloned which contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,233 bp, encoding a protein of 411 amino acids. Analysis of deduced amino acid sequence of CbSqS predicted the presence of conserved isoprenoid family domain and catalytic sites. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CbSqS is closer to Glycine max and monocotyledonous plants. 3D structure prediction using various programs showed CbSqS structure to be similar to SqS from other species. C-terminus truncated recombinant squalene synthase (TruncCbSqS) was expressed in E. coli M15 cells with optimum expression induced with 1 mM IPTG at 37 °C. The gene expression level was analyzed through semi-quantitative RT-PCR and was found to be higher in leaves as compared to the roots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorophytum 3aEscherichia coli 3aGlycine max 3aactive sites 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3asaponins 3asecondary metabolites 3asqualene 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aFarnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferasexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLiliaceaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aKumar, Sunil1 aLakhanpal, Neha1 aKaur, Jagdeep1 aKashmir Singh,0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2013 July, v. 54, no. 3 p.944-953dSpringer-Verlagx1073-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-012-9645-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002100176245011100197300001500308520157600323592002801899650002501927650000801952650001501960650001801975650001401993650001402007650002002021650002902041650001002070650001302080650001302093650001102106650003002117650002102147650002902168650002602197650003102223700002002254700002202274700002902296773015202325856006902477856010302546990002302649852000902672655001202681IND60643852620221118024638.0190514e20160114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064385262DNAL7 a10.3791/534222doi7 aPMC47813872pmcid7 a268632632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomar, Dorota N.10aChromatin immunoprecipitation assay for the identification of arabidopsis protein-dna interactions In Vivo  ap. e53422.  aIntricate gene regulatory networks orchestrate biological processes and developmental transitions in plants. Selective transcriptional activation and silencing of genes mediate the response of plants to environmental signals and developmental cues. Therefore, insights into the mechanisms that control plant gene expression are essential to gain a deep understanding of how biological processes are regulated in plants. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technique described here is a procedure to identify the DNA-binding sites of proteins in genes or genomic regions of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. The interactions with DNA of proteins of interest such as transcription factors, chromatin proteins or posttranslationally modified versions of histones can be efficiently analyzed with the ChIP protocol. This method is based on the fixation of protein-DNA interactions in vivo, random fragmentation of chromatin, immunoprecipitation of protein-DNA complexes with specific antibodies, and quantification of the DNA associated with the protein of interest by PCR techniques. The use of this methodology in Arabidopsis has contributed significantly to unveil transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that control a variety of plant biological processes. This approach allowed the identification of the binding sites of the Arabidopsis chromatin protein EBS to regulatory regions of the master gene of flowering FT. The impact of this protein in the accumulation of particular histone marks in the genomic region of FT was also revealed through ChIP analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA 3aantibodies 3abinding sites 3achromatin 3aflowering 3agene expression 3agene regulatory networks 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahistones 3amodels 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprecipitin tests 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation1 aMouriz, Alfonso1 aJarillo, José A.1 aPiñeiro Losada, Manuel,0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Jan. 14, , no. 107 p.e53422-e53422dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/534223Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53422/chromatin-immunoprecipitation-assay-for-identification-arabidopsis  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245007600164520142200240592002801662650002801690650001701718650001901735650001701754650001701771650001301788650001401801650001601815650002801831650002701859650001201886650004301898650001001941700002601951700002301977700002002000700002302020700002002043700002102063773012002084856008002204852000902284655001202293IND60784089820221122124932.0220726e20220707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078408982DNAL7 a10.3390/insects130706122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonis, Elodie 10aExpression Patterns of Drosophila Melanogaster Glutathione Transferases  aGlutathione transferases (GSTs) are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to various molecules. Among the 42 GSTs identified in Drosophila melanogaster, Delta and Epsilon are the largest classes, with 25 members. The Delta and Epsilon classes are involved in different functions, such as insecticide resistance and ecdysone biosynthesis. The insect GST number variability is due mainly to these classes. Thus, they are generally considered supports during the evolution for the adaptability of the insect species. To explore the link between Delta and Epsilon GST and their evolution, we analyzed the sequences using bioinformatic tools. Subgroups appear within the Delta and Epsilon GSTs with different levels of diversification. The diversification also appears in the sequences showing differences in the active site. Additionally, amino acids essential for structural stability or dimerization appear conserved in all GSTs. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the transcripts corresponding to these two classes are heterogeneously expressed within D. melanogaster. Some GSTs, such as GSTD1, are highly expressed in all tissues, suggesting their general function in detoxification. Conversely, some others, such as GSTD11 or GSTE4, are specifically expressed at a high level specifically in antennae, suggesting a potential role in olfaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aactive sites 3abioinformatics 3abiosynthesis 3adimerization 3aecdysone 3aevolution 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsects 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asmell1 aFraichard, Stéphane 1 aChertemps, Thomas 1 aHecker, Arnaud 1 aSchwartz, Mathieu 1 aCanon, Francis 1 aNeiers, Fabrice 0 tInsects.g2022 July 07, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects130706123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02155naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245011800169300002000287520077800307592002801085650000801113650001101121650002301132650002301155650001101178653001801189653001901207653002401226653003601250653003001286653003101316653002701347700001901374700002201393700001801415700001401433700001501447700001601462700001601478773012601494856008001620852000901700655001201709IND60534668620221122013310.0160803e20160803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053466862DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b053482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHinckley, Allison
C.10aInvestigation of a Solution-Processable, Nonspecific Surface Modifier for Low Cost, High Work Function Electrodes  ap. 19658-19664.  aWe demonstrate the ability of the highly fluorinated, chemically inert copolymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) to significantly increase the work function of a variety of common electrode materials. The work function change is hypothesized to occur via physisorption of the polymer layer and formation of a surface dipole at the polymer/conductor interface. When incorporated into organic solar cells, an interlayer of PVDF-HFP at an Ag anode increases the open circuit voltage by 0.4 eV and improves device power conversion efficiency by approximately an order of magnitude relative to Ag alone. Solution-processable in air, PVDF-HFP thin films provide one possible route toward achieving low cost, nonreactive, high work function electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aanodes 3acomposite polymers 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asilver 0awork function 0asurface dipole 0aorganic solar cells 0asolution-processable electrodes 0acharge-neutral interlayer 0aphotoelectron spectroscopy 0aenergy-level alignment1 aWang, Congcong1 aPfattner, Raphael1 aKong, Desheng1 aZhou, Yan1 aEcker, Ben1 aGao, Yongli1 aBao, Zhenan0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Aug. 03, v. 8, no. 30 p.19658-19664dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b053483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01924naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008400167300001400251500001100265520081300276592002801089650001401117650001601131650001101147650002001158650001401178650001401192650001201206650001801218650001901236650001401255650001401269650001201283650001701295650001601312773010801328856008101436852000901517655001201526IND60633788620221119002105.0190321e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063378862DNAL7 a10.1007/s13668-019-0259-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoo, Jessica G.10aInfant Growth and Long-term Cardiometabolic Health: a Review of Recent Findings  ap. 29-41.  aReview  aPURPOSE OF REVIEW: Infant weight gain is recognized to increase obesity risk across the lifespan. This review evaluates recent evidence relating growth in infancy to childhood, adolescent and adult body composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors. RECENT FINDINGS: Greater weight or BMI gains in infancy increase both fat mass and fat-free mass in later life, but may preferentially contribute to central adiposity. Impacts of infant growth on cardiometabolic health are mixed, and most findings are attenuated after adjusting for current body size. Infant weight gain, length gain, and BMI changes are important in establishing risk for cardiometabolic health across the lifespan. Infant growth effects on cardiometabolic health may be indirect, acting through changes in obesity risk or body composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3aadolescents 3aadults 3abody mass index 3abody size 3achildhood 3ainfancy 3ainfant growth 3alean body mass 3alongevity 3anutrition 3aobesity 3arisk factors 3aweight gain0 tCurrent nutrition reports.g2019 Mar., v. 8, no. 1 p.29-41dSpringer USwJournal:21580x2161-33117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13668-019-0259-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245008900213300001600302520148800318592002801806650001001834650001501844650002201859650001601881650001101897650002501908650001501933650001201948650001001960650001301970651001401983653003301997653001302030653001002043653001002053653001502063653001502078700002102093700002702114700001402141700001902155773010402174856008702278852000902365655001202374IND60552604120221120203425.0161021e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055260412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOdell, Morris S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9964-613X10aResidual cannabis levels in blood, urine and oral fluid following heavy cannabis use  ap. 173-180.  aAn understanding of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) kinetics and residual levels after cannabis use is essential in interpreting toxicology tests in body fluids from live subjects, particularly when used in forensic settings for drug abuse, traffic and interpersonal violence cases. However the current literature is largely based on laboratory studies using controlled cannabis dosages in experienced users, with limited research investigating the kinetics of residual THC concentrations in regular high dose cannabis users. Twenty-one dependent cannabis users were recruited at admission to two residential detoxification units in Melbourne, Australia. After being provided with information about, and consenting to, the study, subjects volunteered to provide once-daily blood, urine and oral fluid (saliva) samples for seven consecutive days following admission, involving cessation and abstinence from all cannabis use. Blood and oral fluid specimens were analysed for THC and urine specimens for the metabolite THC-COOH. In some subjects THC was detectable in blood for at least 7 days and oral fluid specimens were positive for THC up to 78h after admission to the unit. Urinary THC-COOH concentrations exceeded 1000ng/mL for some subjects 129h after last use. The presented blood THC levels are higher and persist longer in some individuals than previously described, our understanding and interpretation of THC levels in long term heavy cannabis users may need to be reconsidered.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3adrug abuse 3aforensic sciences 3ametabolites 3asaliva 3atetrahydrocannabinol 3atoxicology 3atraffic 3aurine 3aviolence 3aAustralia 0aDelta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 0aCannabis 0aBlood 0aUrine 0aOral fluid 0aToxicology1 aFrei, Matthew Y.1 aGerostamoulos, Dimitri1 aChu, Mark1 aLubman, Dan I.0 tForensic science international.g2015 Apr., v. 249 p.173-180dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03514naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245005800165520161300223592002801836650001401864650003001878650002301908650001601931650001501947650001001962650001301972650001101985650001501996650001802011650002202029650001302051650002302064650001702087651001102104651001102115651001202126651001802138700003302156700001902189700002602208700001902234700002002253700002502273700001902298700002102317700001802338700002002356700002102376700002702397700002102424700001602445700001702461700002302478700001702501700002202518700002302540700002102563700002202584700001902606773012102625856007302746852000902819655001202828IND60748769020221120131421.0210827e20210728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074876902DNAL7 a10.3390/v130814752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiagne, Moussa Moïse10aYellow Fever Outbreak in Eastern Senegal, 2020–2021  aYellow fever virus remains a major threat in low resource countries in South America and Africa despite the existence of an effective vaccine. In Senegal and particularly in the eastern part of the country, periodic sylvatic circulation has been demonstrated with varying degrees of impact on populations in perpetual renewal. We report an outbreak that occurred from October 2020 to February 2021 in eastern Senegal, notified and managed through the synergistic effort yellow fever national surveillance implemented by the Senegalese Ministry of Health in collaboration with the World Health Organization, the countrywide 4S network set up by the Ministry of Health, the Institut Pasteur de Dakar, and the surveillance of arboviruses and hemorrhagic fever viruses in human and vector populations implemented since mid 2020 in eastern Senegal. Virological analyses highlighted the implication of sylvatic mosquito species in virus transmission. Genomic analysis showed a close relationship between the circulating strain in eastern Senegal, 2020, and another one from the West African lineage previously detected and sequenced two years ago from an unvaccinated Dutch traveler who visited the Gambia and Senegal before developing signs after returning to Europe. Moreover, genome analysis identified a 6-nucleotide deletion in the variable domain of the 3′UTR with potential impact on the biology of the viral strain that merits further investigations. Integrated surveillance of yellow fever virus but also of other arboviruses of public health interest is crucial in an ecosystem such as eastern Senegal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aWorld Health Organization 3aYellow fever virus 3aarboviruses 3aecosystems 3afever 3agenomics 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3asequence analysis 3avaccines 3avirus transmission 3ayellow fever 3aEurope 3aGambia 3aSenegal 3aSouth America1 aNdione, Marie Henriette Dior1 aGaye, Alioune 1 aAliou Barry, Mamadou,1 aDiallo, Diawo 1 aDiallo, Amadou 1 aMwakibete, Lusajo L.1 aDiop, Mamadou 1 aNdiaye, El Hadji1 aAhyong, Vida 1 aDiouf, Babacar 1 aMhamadi, Moufid 1 aDiagne, Cheikh Tidiane1 aDanfakha, Fodé 1 aDiop, Boly 1 aFaye, Oumar 1 aLoucoubar, Cheikh 1 aFall, Gamou 1 aTato, Cristina M.1 aSall, Amadou Alpha1 aWeaver, Scott C.1 aDiallo, Mawlouth 1 aFaye, Ousmane 0 tViruses.g2021 July 28, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130814753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245012800168520130300296592002801599650001601627650002501643650000801668650002301676650001301699650001401712650001001726650002001736650001601756650001901772650001101791700002701802700002801829700002901857700002601886773012001912856008002032852000902112655001202121IND60784089920221122093504.0220726e20220707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078408992DNAL7 a10.3390/insects130706132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReznik, Sergey Ya.10aStorage Potential of the Predatory Ladybird Cheilomenes propinqua in Relation to Temperature, Humidity, and Factitious Food  aThe ability of the females of the predatory ladybird Cheilomenes propinqua to survive and to retain reproductive potential in the absence of natural food (aphids) was estimated under various hydrothermal (temperatures of 7, 12, 17, 22, and 27 °C; air humidities of 50% and 80–90%) and trophic (starved vs. fed on the frozen eggs of the grain moth Sitotroga cerealella) conditions. The post-storage reproductive potential was estimated using the mean number of eggs laid over 20 days. The experiments showed that fed females can be stored at temperatures of 15–17 °C for 20 days with a rather low (about 20%) and for up to 80 days with an acceptable (not more than 50%) loss of the reproductive potential. The successful short-term (up to 3 days) storage or transportation of fed and starved females can occur at temperatures from 12 to 27 °C. However, storage for more than 10 days at temperatures of 7 °C and lower results in the 100% mortality of both the starved and fed beetles. These data suggest that (1) in greenhouses, C. propinqua can be used for the biological control of aphids by preventing colonization, although this would require the regular supplementation of factitious food, and (2) escaped individuals would not survive the winter even in the south of the temperate zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCheilomenes 3aSitotroga cerealella 3aair 3abiological control 3ahumidity 3amortality 3amoths 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3atransportation 3awinter1 aOvchinnikov, Andrey N.1 aBezman-Moseyko, Olga S.1 aSamartsev, Konstantin G.1 aBelyakova, Natalia A.0 tInsects.g2022 July 07, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects130706133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03569naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007200139245009400211300001600305500002000321520223200341592002802573650001202601650001102613650001002624650002502634650001502659650001902674650002102693650001102714650001402725650001402739650001402753650001102767650002102778650001802799700006102817700006202878773012502940856007303065852000903138655001203147IND60746929220221122125856.0210807e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074692922DNAL7 a10.1111/evj.133842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEaston‐Jones, Charlotte A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4663-698210aImmune‐mediated haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia in 25 adult equids: 1997‐2016  ap. 964-971.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Information concerning clinical presentation, conditions associated with immune‐mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) and thrombocytopenia (IMTP) and outcome in equids is lacking. Previous case reports suggest that immune‐mediated disease and neoplasia are associated. OBJECTIVES: Characterise the clinical presentation, clinicopathologic data, underlying conditions, treatment and outcome of IMHA and IMTP cases in equids. We hypothesise that IMHA with concurrent thrombocytopenia occurs more often than IMHA or IMTP alone, and that neoplasia is commonly associated with these immune diseases and cases frequently have a poor prognosis. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case‐control study. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed from 1997 to 2016. Twenty‐five equids were diagnosed with IMHA, IMTP or IMHA with thrombocytopenia by Coombs test or flow cytometry. Controls were equids presented for nonimmune‐mediated disease immediately prior to and after study animals. Fisher's exact test was used to compare between groups for categorical variables (P < .05). Results reported as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Unpaired t test and Mann‐Whitney test were used to compare between groups for continuous variables (P < .05). RESULTS: Neoplasia incidence was significantly higher in the study population (28%) versus controls (8%) (P = .04). Equids with primary disease were more likely to survive to discharge than equids with secondary disease (8/9 vs 7/16; P = .03; OR = 13.3; 95% CI: 1.3‐134.7). Survivors had a significantly lower blood urea nitrogen (BUN) than those that died or were subjected to euthanasia (survivors, 6.1 ± 2.5 mmol/L vs nonsurvivors, 9.9 ± 3.1 mmol/L P = .003). The odds of short‐term mortality were higher in horses presenting with increased BUN (OR = 19.5; 95% CI, 1.8‐214.1; P = .009). MAIN LIMITATIONS: Retrospective nature of the study, small case numbers and limited long‐term follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS: Primary IMHA/IMTP cases have a reasonable prognosis and warrant treatment.

E1407-E1415.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTheiler's disease is an acute hepatitis in horses that is associated with the administration of equine blood products; its etiologic agent has remained unknown for nearly a century. Here, we used massively parallel sequencing to explore samples from a recent Theiler's disease outbreak. Metatranscriptomic analysis of the short sequence reads identified a 10.5-kb sequence from a previously undescribed virus of the Flaviviridae family, which we designate “Theiler's disease-associated virus” (TDAV). Phylogenetic analysis clusters TDAV with GB viruses of the recently proposed Pegivirus genus, although it shares only 35.3% amino acid identity with its closest relative, GB virus D. An epidemiological survey of additional horses from three separate locations supports an association between TDAV infection and acute serum hepatitis. Experimental inoculation of horses with TDAV-positive plasma provides evidence that several weeks of viremia preceded liver injury and that liver disease may not be directly related to the level of viremia. Like hepatitis C virus, the best characterized Flaviviridae species known to cause hepatitis, we find TDAV is capable of efficient parenteral transmission, engendering acute and chronic infections associated with a diversity of clinical presentations ranging from subclinical infection to clinical hepatitis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHepatitis C virus 3aamino acids 3ablood serum 3adisease outbreaks 3aepidemiological studies 3ahepatitis 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahorses 3aliver 3aphylogeny 3aviremia 3aviruses 0aepidemiology 0aveterinary virology 0ametagenomics 0adeep sequencing 0apathogen discovery1 aSkewes-Cox, Peter1 aZhong, Weidong1 aGanem, Donald E.1 aDivers, Thomas J.1 aVan Blaricum, Anita J.1 aTennant, Bud C.1 aKistler, Amy L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Apr. 9, v. 110, no. 15 p.E1407-E1415dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12192171103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006600147245012000213300001800333520144700351592002801798596001001826650002301836650001801859650001401877650001101891650001201902650001101914650001201925650001001937650002101947650002001968650001701988650001402005650001302019650001302032650001602045653001802061653001602079653002402095653001802119653002602137700002202163700006002185773012002245856008202365852000902447655001202456IND60755468220221117222747.0211102e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075546822DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820210013962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbuixech-Martí, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7835-131610aCo-occurrence of pathogen assemblages in a keystone species the common cockle Cerastoderma edule on the Irish coast  ap. 1665-1679.  aDespite coinfections being recognized as the rule in animal populations, most studies focus on single pathogen systems. Pathogen interaction networks and the drivers of such associations are lacking in disease ecology studies. Common cockle Cerastoderma edule populations are exposed to a great diversity of pathogens, thus making them a good model system to investigate. This study examined the diversity and prevalence of pathogens from different taxonomic levels in wild and fished C. edule on the Irish coast. Potential interactions were tested focussing on abiotic (seawater temperature and salinity) and biotic (cockle size and age, and epiflora on shells) factors. No Microsporidia nor OsHV-1μVar were detected. Single infections with Haplosporidia (37.7%) or Vibrio (25.3%) were more common than two-pathogen coinfected individuals (9.5%), which may more easily succumb to infection. Fished C. edule populations with high cockle densities were more exposed to infections. Higher temperature and presence of epiflora on cockle shells promoted coinfection in warmer months. Low seawater salinity, host condition and proximity to other infected host species influenced coinfection distribution. A positive association between two Minchinia spp. was observed, most likely due to their different pathogenic effect. Findings highlight the major influence that ecological factors have on pathogen interactions and host–pathogen interplay.  aPublisher supplied data  a80991 3aCerastoderma edule 3aMicrosporidia 3aMinchinia 3aVibrio 3aanimals 3acoasts 3aecology 3ahosts 3akeystone species 3amixed infection 3aparasitology 3apathogens 3asalinity 3aseawater 3atemperature 0aCockle health 0acoinfection 0aconfounding factors 0aHaplosporidia 0apathogen interactions1 aCulloty, Sarah C.1 aLynch, Sharon A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4542-71500 tParasitology.g2021 Nov., v. 148, no. 13 p.1665-1679dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820210013963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245009800209300001400307500001100321506007600332520131300408592002801721506003701749650001301786650001901799650001801818650001201836650001201848650002201860700002101882773010801903856008102011852000902092655001202101IND60633788820221207110520.0190321e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063378882DNAL7 a10.1007/s13668-019-0258-12doi7 aPMC64268232pmcid7 a307622042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolley, Clare E.12aA Systematic Review of the Evaluation of Interventions to Tackle Children’s Food Insecurity  ap. 11-27.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPURPOSE OF REVIEW: To synthesise the research which has sought to evaluate interventions aiming to tackle children’s food insecurity and the contribution of this research to evidencing the effectiveness of such interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: The majority of studies in this review were quantitative, non-randomised studies, including cohort studies. Issues with non-complete outcome data, measurement of duration of participation in interventions, and accounting for confounds are common in these evaluation studies. Despite the limitations of the current evidence base, the papers that were reviewed provide evidence for multiple positive outcomes for children participating in attended and subsidy interventions, inter alia, reductions in food insecurity, poor health and obesity. However, current evaluations may overlook key areas of impact of these interventions on the lives and outcomes of participating children. This review suggests that the current evidence base which evaluates food insecurity interventions for children is both mixed and limited in scope and quality. In particular, the outcomes measured are narrow, and many papers have methodological limitations. With this in mind, a systems-based approach to both implementation and evaluation of food poverty interventions is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achildren 3acohort studies 3afood security 3aobesity 3apoverty 3asystematic review1 aMason, Carolynne0 tCurrent nutrition reports.g2019 Mar., v. 8, no. 1 p.11-27dSpringer USwJournal:21580x2161-33117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13668-019-0258-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245015900167520076900326592002801095650001801123650001801141650001001159650001201169650000901181650001601190651002301206700001701229700002001246773012001266856008001386852000901466655001201475IND60784090020221120065737.0220726e20220708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078409002DNAL7 a10.3390/insects130706142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZilberman, Bruno 14aThe Earliest Corotocini (Insecta: Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) from Dominican Amber, with Remarks on Post-Imaginal Growth Influence on Termitophile Taxonomy  aPareburniola dominicana Zilberman, Yin & Cai gen. et. sp. nov. is the very first fossil record of the tribe Corotocini, reported from Miocene Dominican Republic amber.

While previous studies have reported the diagnoses of laboratory submissions, none have quantified the incidence and causes of abortions, stillbirths and perinatal mortality at a population level. OBJECTIVES: To report the incidence and causes of pregnancy loss after Day 70 of gestation in a cohort of Thoroughbreds. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Outcomes of Day 70 pregnancies were collected from eight Thoroughbred farms over the 2013‐2017 breeding seasons. Stud, veterinary and laboratory records were supplemented with publicly available data. Cause of loss was categorised using custom criteria. RESULTS: Data were collected on 3,586 pregnancies from 1,802 mares. The incidence risk of a pregnancy failing to produce a live foal at 24 hours post parturition was 7.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.5‐8.2, equating to 7.3 cases per 100 Day‐70 pregnancies). The incidence of pregnancy loss between Day 70 and 300 of gestation, Day 301‐315 and stillbirth/perinatal death was 4.0% (95% CI 3.4‐4.7), 0.3% (95% CI 0.2‐0.6) and 1.4% (95% CI 1.1‐1.9) respectively. Of the pregnancy losses where tissue was available, 61.1% were submitted for post‐mortem examination. The incidence risk of loss due to umbilical cord‐related pathologies was 1.5% (95% CI 1.1‐1.9), 0.4% (95% CI 0.2‐0.6) for noninfectious placental disease and 0.3% (95% CI 0.2‐0.6) for both infectious placentitis and Equine Herpesvirus infection. No primary diagnosis was made in 11.2% of the cases which underwent full post‐mortem examination. MAIN LIMITATIONS: It was not possible to differentiate between intra‐partum stillbirth and early post‐partum death. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy loss after Day 70 of gestation is a significant source of loss in the Thoroughbred with umbilical cord‐related pathologies being the most commonly diagnosed cause. Reporting the incidence of pregnancy loss at a population level with clear case definitions will allow for accurate global comparisons.  aPublisher supplied data  cAlborada Trust 3aHerpesviridae infections 3aThoroughbred 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3adeath 3afetal death 3afoals 3amortality 3anecropsy 3aparturition 3apregnancy 3arisk1 aFoote, Alastair K.1 aSmith, Ken C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4861-70481 aVerheyen, Kristien L.1 ade Mestre, Amanda M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9422-23700 tEquine veterinary journal.g2021 Sept., v. 53, no. 5 p.996-1003dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1170x0425-16447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/evj.133863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245010300164300001600267520129200283592002801575650002401603650001701627650001201644650002001656650003201676650001501708650002101723651001201744653003001756653001701786653002201803653001701825653002001842653001301862700001801875700002201893700001401915773011201929856007602041852000902117655001202126IND60761977420221120070240.0220105e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076197742DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc2021-0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeighton, Holly D.10aTwenty-six years of aspen regeneration under varying light conditions in a boreal mixedwood forest  ap. 326-342.  aDensity, height, and diameter at breast height of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) sucker regeneration were assessed over a 26-year period in openings created by harvesting in a 40-year-old aspen stand in northeastern Ontario (Canada). The opening types were 9- and 18-m diameter circles, 9- and 18- _ 150-m east-west strips, and a 100- _ 150-m clearcut, representing a range of light conditions. Density, height, and diameter at breast height of aspen regeneration were significantly affected by opening type, location relative to opening, and time since harvest. By year 26, aspen densities in circular openings declined to 0, despite high initial recruitment, and trembling aspen heights were significantly lower in the 9-m strips than in the 18-m strips or the clearcut. Year 26 aspen density, volume, and basal area increased with increasing initial light intensity, with the highest rate of increase between 80 and 100% light levels. Understory vegetation cover was largely unaffected by opening size; however, substantial understory aspen regeneration occurred in the smaller openings. Results support the traditional view that aspen is best managed under the clearcut silvicultural system, and >80% full light is recommended for adequate long-term aspen regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aclearcutting 3aforests 3alight intensity 3atree and stand measurements 3aunderstory 3avegetation cover 3aOntario 0aPopulus tremuloides Michx 0asilviculture 0aboreal mixedwoods 0aregeneration 0aforest openings 0aclearcut1 aGroot, Arthur1 aThiffault, Nelson1 aRice, Mya0 tForestry chronicle.g2021 Sept., v. 97, no. 3 p.326-342dNRC Research PresswJournal:12176x0015-75467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc2021-0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015100157500001900308520129400327592002801621650001401649650001301663650001201676650001001688650001401698650001101712650001301723650001001736650001601746651001501762700002201777700002301799700002401822700002301846773012001869856007301989852000902062655001202071IND60711911020221116142257.0200928e20200916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071191102DNAL7 a10.3390/w120925802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrupa, Elena 10aZooplankton as Indicator of the Ecological State of Protected Aquatic Ecosystems (Lake Borovoe, Burabay National Nature Park, Northern Kazakhstan)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe enrichment of the protected Borovoe Lake with nutrients has taken place within the last 100 years, from the moment the first resort was formed on its shores.

Twenty-seven species were found in zooplankton. The average abundance of zooplankton was 988.8 thousand ind./m³ with a biomass of 1.52 g/m³. Rotifera dominated. Cladocera sub-dominated. The Shannon index values were 2.31 bit/ind. and 2.57 bit/mg; the values of Clarke’s W-statistics and Δ-Shannon were negative. The abundance of zooplankton increased more than nine times, but the average individual mass of an organism decreased from 0.0112 to 0.0016 mg over the past decade. Despite the relatively low content of nutrients, the structure of zooplankton demonstrated that the nutritional load on Lake Borovoe is currently close to critical. Statistical mapping of the data and redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the primary source of lake pollution is the village of Borovoe and sanatoriums located on the southeast and northwest coasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladocera 3aRotifera 3abiomass 3alakes 3apollution 3asummer 3avillages 3awater 3azooplankton 3aKazakhstan1 aRomanova, Sophia 1 aBerkinbaev, Galym 1 aYakovleva, Natalya 1 aSadvakasov, Erlan 0 tWater.g2020 Sept. 16, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120925803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03658naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245013500175300001600310520206200326592002802388650001102416650002102427650001702448650001402465650002402479650001002503650001202513650002202525650001002547650001002557650002502567650001202592653002602604653002102630653001102651653001702662653001302679653001002692700002302702700001902725700002302744700002202767700002002789700001702809700002002826700002002846700001802866700002002884773010402904856008703008852000903095655001203104IND60552604520221120224346.0161021e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055260452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.01.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorimitsu, Suguru10aStatistical analysis of biomechanical properties of the adult sagittal suture using a bending method in a Japanese forensic sample  ap. 101-106.  aThis study examined the mechanical properties of the adult sagittal suture compared with surrounding parietal bones using bending tests and investigated the association between the mechanical properties of the suture and age. We used the heads of 116 Japanese cadavers (76 male cadavers and 40 female cadavers) of known age and sex. A total of 1160 cranial samples, 10 from each skull, were collected. The samples were imaged using multidetector computed tomography, and the sample thickness at the center of each sample (ST) was measured. The failure stress of each sample (FS) was measured by a bending test, and the ratio of failure stress to the square of sample thickness (FS/ST2) was calculated. Statistical analyses revealed that the FS and FS/ST2 values were significantly lower at all suture sites than at all bone sites regardless of sex. There were not significant but slight positive correlations between age and FS and FS/ST2 values at any suture site in male samples. In female samples, age had significant positive correlations with FS and FS/ST2 values at the middle suture sites, whereas there were not significant but slight positive correlations between age and FS and FS/ST2 values at the edges of the suture. Statistical analyses also demonstrated that FS and FS/ST2 values were significantly greater in male samples than in female samples at the middle suture sites. These findings suggest that the bending strength of the adult sagittal suture is significantly lower than that of surrounding parietal bones. Therefore, avoiding direct impact on cranial sutures may be important for preventing skull fractures and severe complications that can cause death. The results of this study also revealed that the bending strength of the middle sagittal suture significantly increases with age in only female samples, whereas the bending strength is significantly higher in male samples than in female samples at the middle suture sites, indicating the possibility of sex difference in the bony interdigitation of the sutures during childhood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abending strength 3abiomechanics 3achildhood 3acomputed tomography 3adeath 3afemales 3aforensic sciences 3amales 3askull 3astatistical analysis 3asutures 0aMechanical properties 0aBending strength 0aSuture 0aCranial bone 0aFracture 0aAdult1 aNishida, Yoshifumi1 aTakano, Tachio1 aKoizumi, Yoshinori1 aHayakawa, Mutsumi1 aYajima, Daisuke1 aInokuchi, Go1 aMakino, Yohsuke1 aMotomura, Ayumi1 aChiba, Fumiko1 aIwase, Hirotaro0 tForensic science international.g2015 Apr., v. 249 p.101-106dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.01.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245013400162506002800296506003200324520141600356592002801772596008301800596006001883506003701943650002401980650003002004650001402034650002102048650001202069650001602081650002102097650001002118650001402128700002302142700002302165700002002188773012102208856007302329903002202402852000902424655001202433IND60748769320221207133921.0210827e20210728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074876932DNAL7 a10.3390/v130814802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaulagain, Sabal 10aAfrican Swine Fever Virus CD2v Protein Induces β-Interferon Expression and Apoptosis in Swine Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells  aResource is Open Access  aMDPI AG License Information  aAfrican swine fever (ASF) is a hemorrhagic disease of swine characterized by massive lymphocyte depletion in lymphoid tissues due to the apoptosis of B and T cells, a process likely triggered by factors released or secreted by infected macrophages. ASFV CD2v (EP402R) has been implicated in viral virulence and immunomodulation in vitro; however, its actual function(s) remains unknown. We found that CD2v expression in swine PK15 cells induces NF-κB-dependent IFN-β and ISGs transcription and an antiviral state. Similar results were observed for CD2v protein treated swine PBMCs and macrophages, the major ASFV target cell. Notably, treatment of swine PBMCs and macrophages with CD2v protein induced apoptosis. Immunoprecipitation and colocalization studies revealed that CD2v interacts with CD58, the natural host CD2 ligand. Additionally, CD58 knockdown in cells or treatment of cells with an NF-κB inhibitor significantly reduced CD2v-mediated NF-κB activation and IFN-β induction. Further, antibodies directed against CD2v inhibited CD2v-induced NF-κB activation and IFN-β transcription in cells. Overall, results indicate that ASFV CD2v activates NF-κB, which induces IFN signaling and apoptosis in swine lymphocytes/macrophages. We propose that CD2v released from infected macrophages may be a significant factor in lymphocyte apoptosis observed in lymphoid tissue during ASFV infection in pigs.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNational Pork Boarddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000083700 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican swine fever 3aAfrican swine fever virus 3aapoptosis 3aimmunomodulation 3aligands 3amacrophages 3aprecipitin tests 3aswine 3avirulence1 aDelhon, Gustavo A.1 aKhatiwada, Sushil 1 aRock, Daniel L.0 tViruses.g2021 July 28, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130814803Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245017100165300002000336520158300356592002801939650002201967650001301989650001302002650001702015650001202032650001802044650001302062650002302075650002402098650001302122700002302135700002602158700001802184700001702202700006102219773013802280856008002418852000902498655001202507IND60614634320221118153904.0181002e20180824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061463432DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b064532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Syamantak10aTunable Physical States and Optical Properties of Bola-Amphiphilic Oligo-(p-phenyleneethynylene)-Based Supramolecular Networks Assisted by Functional Group Modulation  ap. 21598-21606.  aStructural understanding and correlation of physical properties of supramolecular networks can lead to improved design strategies for advanced optoelectronic materials. Herein, we demonstrate via single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis how end groups (ester and acid) of bola-amphiphilic oligo-(p-phenyleneethynylenes) (OPEs) lead to different supramolecular network formations and also generate selective polymorphism and mechanochromic luminescence in OPE-Cgₗy-A and OPE-Cgₗy-E, respectively. OPE-Cgₗy-E and OPE-Cgₗy-A have the same π-conjugated backbones with bistriethyleneglycol side chains, only differing in possessing end-capped ester and acid groups, respectively. OPE-Cgₗy-E has a less densely packed structure than OPE-Cgₗy-A. This leads to exclusive mechanochromic behavior in OPE-Cgₗy-E, whereas OPE-Cgₗy-A generates reversible polymorphic structures which are not present in OPE-Cgₗy-E. Density functional theoretical calculations reveal that breakage of weak supramolecular interactions in OPE-Cgₗy-E leads to the hypsochromic mechanochromic luminescence. Interestingly, both OPE-Cgₗy-E and OPE-Cgₗy-A crystals reversibly melt into an isotropic phase at 90 and 180 °C, respectively, and recrystallize upon cooling. This difference in melting temperature is due to the variance in molecular packing in both compounds. Thus, this work gives a structural perspective toward the control of physical states and optical properties of OPEs for a better design of bola-amphiphilic supramolecular networks for advanced opto-electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystals 3aisotropy 3aluminescence 3amelting 3amelting point 3amoieties 3aoptical properties 3aphysical properties 3avariance1 aSamanta, Debabrata1 aBhattacharyya, Sohini1 aKumar, Pramod1 aHazra, Arpan1 aMaji, Tapas Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7700-11460 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Aug. 24, v. 122, no. 37 p.21598-21606dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b064533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01251naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002700187245012500214300001300339506007600352520017200428592002800600506003700628650002000665650001900685650001400704700002400718773010600742856008000848852000900928655001200937IND60119600420221207131633.0141214e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011960042DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2008-9-11-4052doi7 aPMC26144892pmcid7 a190407752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiazalhosseini, Yasser10aDo we use the appropriate controls for the identification of informative methylation markers for early cancer detection?  ap. 1862.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt is possible to miss potential DNA methylation markers of tumorigenesis because of the initial filtering of profiling results on the basis of inappropriate controls.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA methylation 3acarcinogenesis 3aneoplasms1 aHoheisel, Jörg D.,0 tGenome biology.g2008 Nov., v. 9, no. 11 p.1862-1862dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2008-9-11-4053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245018100167300001600348520159700364592002801961650001401989650001502003650001902018650001602037650001202053650002402065650001202089650001402101650002602115700001302141700001802154700001802172700001702190700001702207700001702224700001902241700001402260700002002274773012402294856008402418852000902502655001202511IND60099601420221122230946.0141105e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009960142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2010.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hongbo10aMoesin–ezrin–radixin-like protein (merlin) mediates protein interacting with the carboxyl terminus-1 (PICT-1)-induced growth inhibition of glioblastoma cells in the nucleus  ap. 545-555.  aMoesin–ezrin–radixin-like protein (merlin) has long been considered a unique tumour suppressor that inhibits mitogenic signalling only at the membrane–cytoskeleton interface. However, the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of merlin in a cell cycle-dependent manner has recently been observed, indicating that merlin may also exert its tumour-suppressive activity by interacting with specific nuclear protein partners. We have identified protein interacting with carboxyl terminus 1 (PICT-1) as a novel merlin-binding partner. Although the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood, several lines of evidence have previously implicated PICT-1 as a candidate tumour suppressor, including its phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)-dependent growth-suppression and cell-killing activities. We show here that PICT-1 is localised to the nucleolus, and Ser518-dephosphorylated merlin (the growth-inhibitory form of merlin) can interact with PICT-1 in the nucleolus. Ectopic expression of PICT-1, both in PTEN-positive HeLa cells and in PTEN-deficient U251 cells, effectively represses cyclin D1 expression, arrests the cell cycle at G0/G1, and promotes cell apoptosis. PICT-1 (1–356), a carboxyl-terminus truncated mutant that has lost the ability to bind merlin, has a markedly reduced inhibitory effect on the cell cycle and proliferation. Knockdown of merlin expression by siRNA attenuates the inhibitory effects induced by PICT-1 over-expression. We propose that merlin mediates PICT-1-induced growth inhibition by translocating to the nucleolus and binding PICT-1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3acell nucleolus 3achromosomes 3acyclins 3agene overexpression 3amutants 3aneoplasms 3asmall interfering RNA1 aMei, Lin1 aZhou, Lanzhen1 aZhang, Xudong1 aGuo, Caiping1 aLi, Junchang1 aWang, Huixia1 aZhu, Yongqiang1 aZheng, Yi1 aHuang, Laiqiang0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2011 Apr., v. 43, no. 4 p.545-555dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2010.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008200169520123900251592002801490650001401518650001401532650001101546650001301557651001801570653002001588653002801608653001401636700002101650700001901671773009801690856008501788852000901873655001201882IND60723871020221120034507.0210311e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072387102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2021.1023862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinsella, Chad10aClosely and deeply divided: Purple counties in the 2016 presidential election  aThe depth and degree of geographic polarization in American politics are key arguments that reside within the larger political polarization debate. Evidence used to argue against the significance of geographic polarization is the prevalence of “purple” counties. It is argued that when the aggregate voting results within counties for candidates from the two major political parties are close enough and competitive enough not to be designated as either “red” or “blue” and are designated as “purple”, the electorate is considered spatially and homogeneously mixed within the county. It is assumed that these purple counties demonstrate that voters whose polarized political ideology are either closely divided or deeply divided live near one another. This paper challenges the assumption that partisans from differing parties live within proximity to one another in competitive counties by examining ten of the most “purple” counties of the 2016 United States Presidential Election. The results of this study provide evidence as to whether “purple” counties are homogeneous places where there is no geographic polarization or whether county aggregation merely masks a micro-scalar geographic political divide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmericans 3ageography 3amixing 3apolitics 3aUnited States 0aVoting behavior 0aGeographic polarization 0aPrecincts1 aMcTague, Colleen1 aRaleigh, Kevin0 tApplied geography.g2021 Feb., v. 127 p.102386-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2021.1023863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02164naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100002300153245011100176300001400287520103100301592002801332650001301360650001401373650002301387650001401410650001601424650000901440650001501449650000901464650001201473650001701485651001301502700001701515700001901532700001601551700001701567773008401584856008901668852000901757655001201766IND4492537720221121140902.0150808e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449253772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2010.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChesnaye, Nicholas10aTreatment coverage survey after a school-based mass distribution of mebendazole: Kampot Province, Cambodia  ap. 21-26.  aIn efforts to reduce the global burden of soil transmitted helminth (STH) infections in school age children (SAC, 6–14 years old), Children Without Worms donates mebendazole to 8 countries with high prevalence of STH infections. Cambodia's national deworming program currently targets SAC through bi-annual school-based distributions of a single dose of mebendazole. A 30-cluster household survey was conducted in the rural province Kampot, to validate mebendazole treatment coverage in SAC and to assess the level of improved water supply and sanitation. Bi-annual primary school-based distributions proved to be an effective strategy in reaching school attending SAC, with treatment coverage rates between 84.1% and 88.8%. However, significantly lower rates (23.3–48.8%) were seen among SAC not enrolled in primary schools. Often members of the most marginalized families of the community, they are particularly at risk of STH infection. Methods to reach these children need to be explored to avoid treatment inequities.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3adeworming 3aelementary schools 3ahelminths 3amebendazole 3arisk 3asanitation 3asoil 3asurveys 3awater supply 3aCambodia1 aSinuon, Muth1 aSocheat, Duong1 aKoporc, Kim1 aMathieu, Els0 tActa tropica.g2011 Apr., v. 118, no. 1 p.21-26dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2010.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013100167300001600298500001500314520147200329592002801801650002901829650001401858650002701872650001301899650001601912650001001928650001301938650003701951650002201988650001702010650001802027653000902045653003702054653000902091653000802100653000802108653002402116653000902140653001502149653000702164653003802171653001702209653000902226653000702235700002002242700002502262700002302287700001902310700001902329700002002348700002102368700002002389700001902409700002002428700001702448700002102465773011502486856008502601852000902686655001202695IND60543909520221118071252.0190412e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054390952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2014.09.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirano, Eiko10aMolecular evolution of human respiratory syncytial virus attachment glycoprotein (G) gene of new genotype ON1 and ancestor NA1  ap. 183-191.  a2019-12-06  aWe conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of the C-terminal 3rd hypervariable region of the attachment glycoprotein (G) gene in human respiratory syncytial virus subgroup A (HRSV-A) genotype ON1 (93 strains) and ancestor NA1 (125 strains). Genotype ON1 contains a unique mutation of a 72 nucleotide tandem repeat insertion (corresponding to 24 amino acids) in the hypervariable region. The Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was used to conduct phylogenetic analysis and a time scale for evolution. We also calculated pairwise distances (p-distances) and estimated the selective pressure. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the analyzed ON1 and NA1 strains formed 4 lineages. A strain belonging to lineage 4 of ON1 showed wide genetic divergence (p-distance, 0.072), which suggests that it might be a candidate new genotype, namely ON2. The emergence of genotype NA1 was estimated to have occurred in 2000 (95% of highest probability density, HPD; 1997–2002) and that of genotype ON1 in 2005 (95% HPD; 2000–2010) based on the time-scaled phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary rate of genotype ON1 was higher than that of ancestral genotype NA1 (6.03×10−3 vs. 4.61×10−3 substitutions/site/year, p<0.05). Some positive and many negative selection sites were found in both ON1 and NA1 strains. The results suggested that the new genotype ON1 is rapidly evolving with antigenic changes, leading to epidemics of HRSV infection in various countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprobability distribution 3aphylogeny 3aHuman orthopneumovirus 3amutation 3aamino acids 3agenes 3agenotype 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3aMarkov chain 3aglycoproteins 0aHRSV 0aAttachment glycoprotein (G) gene 0aMCMC 0aFEL 0aHPD 0aMolecular evolution 0aSLAC 0ap-distance 0aNJ 0aHuman respiratory syncytial virus 0aGenotype ON1 0aIFEL 0aSD1 aKobayashi, Miho1 aTsukagoshi, Hiroyuki1 aYoshida, Lay Myint1 aKuroda, Makoto1 aNoda, Masahiro1 aIshioka, Taisei1 aKozawa, Kunihisa1 aIshii, Haruyuki1 aYoshida, Ayako1 aOishi, Kazunori1 aRyo, Akihide1 aKimura, Hirokazu0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2014 Dec., v. 28 p.183-191dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2014.09.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01223naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245014700164300001800311520031400329592002800643650001800671650002000689650002200709773015200731856007700883852000900960655001200969IND60521889520221116224146.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052188952DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1990-07222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaatsch, Hartmut10aSynthese und Eigenschaften cyclopropanierter 2,2′-Binaphthyldichinone / Synthesis and Properties of Cyclopropanated 2,2′-Binaphthoquinones  ap. 1037-1042.  aCyclopropanated binaphthoquinones are obtained by addition of diazomethane to dimeric naphthoquinones and thermal or acidic degradation. 8,8′-dimethoxy-3′-methyl-2,3-dihydro-2,3-methano-2,2′-binaphthyldiquinone (9b) forms diastereomers by axial chirality and has a rotation barrier of about 20 kcal/mol.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiastereomers 3anaphthoquinones 3aoptical isomerism0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 45, no. 7 p.1037-1042dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1990-07223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245008400173300001600257500001900273520086600292592002801158650002501186650000801211650001501219650003201234650001001266650001301276650002001289650002201309650002101331653001001352653000801362653000801370653000801378653002601386653001201412700001601424700002301440700001801463700002301481700001401504773014101518856008601659852000901745655001201754IND60721209020221116173645.0201224e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072120902DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00031.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Gagandeep10aMolecular detection of avian oncogenic viruses from apparently healthy chickens  ap. 203-205.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNeoplastic infections due to oncogenic viruses are one of the major causes of economic problems faced by the poultry industry worldwide and the present study was undertaken in order to establish the prevalence of single or multiple avian oncogenic and associated virus infections in apparently healthy chicken. Marek's disease virus (MDV), reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) and avian leukosis virus (ALV) could be detected from 9.23%, 95.38% and 93.85% cases, respectively by PCR applied on DNA extracted from blood of apparently healthy chickens. Mixed infection of MDV+REV+ALV and REV+ALV could be detected from 9.23% and 89.23% cases, respectively, indicating that multiple infections of two or more oncoviruses in the same birds was more common than the single virus infection and REV was recorded as the most prevalent oncogenic virus infection in poultry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvian leukosis virus 3aDNA 3aMardivirus 3aReticuloendotheliosis virus 3ablood 3achickens 3amixed infection 3aoncogenic viruses 3apoultry industry 0aMDV-1 0aREV 0aALV 0aPCR 0aAvian oncogenic virus 0aChicken1 aDeka, Dipak1 aAgrawal, Ravi Kant1 aMitra, Namita1 aBatth, Balvinder K1 a, Ramneek0 tIndian journal of poultry science.g2017 Aug., v. 52, no. 2 p.203-205dIndian Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:1944x0974-81807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00031.93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010900160300002000269520144800289592002801737650002201765650001201787650001001799650001101809650002201820650002001842650003001862650002401892650000901916650001201925650001301937650001301950700002101963700002701984700002302011700002902034700001602063700002702079773012502106856007402231852000902305655001202314IND60641258920221120093825.0190505e20160914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064125892DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra20970j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgarwal, Gunjan10aBromine substituted aminonaphthoquinones: synthesis, characterization, DFT and metal ion binding studies  ap. 88010-88029.  aBromine substituted aminonaphthoquinone ligands viz. 2-(2′-aminomethylpyridyl)-3-bromo-naphthalene-1,4-dione; (2MPA), 2-(3′-aminomethylpyridyl)-3-bromo-naphthalene-1,4-dione; (3MPA), 2-(2′-aminoethylpyridyl)-3-bromo-naphthalene-1,4-dione; (2EPA) and 2-(2′-aminomethylthiophenyl)-3-bromo-naphthalene-1,4-dione (2AMT) and 2-(2′-aminoethylthiophenyl)-3-bromo-naphthalene-1,4-dione (2AET) have been synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments in conjunction with long range corrected density functional theory. The heterocyclic amines on the naphthoquinone ring render diverse crystal structures. It has been shown that bromine substitution influences the planarity and mutual orientation of naphthoquinone and heterocycles in aminonaphthoquinone ligands. The 2MPA, 3MPA, 2EPA, 2AET aminonaphthoquinone ligands crystallize in the monoclinic space group whereas 2AMT led to the triclinic space group P1̄. Furthermore, molecular packing of 2MPA and 2EPA revealed dimeric structures while 3MPA and 2AMT are rendered with ‘stair-case’ arrangements of molecules. 2AET, when viewed down c-axis, showed a ‘butterfly like’ arrangement. A broad charge transfer band (400–600 nm) was observed in the UV-visible spectra of these ligands. Besides 2MPA and 2EPA exhibit remarkable selectivity toward Cu²⁺ ions, accompanied by a color change from orange to blue in methanol and methanol–water mixture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abromine 3acolor 3acopper 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adensity functional theory 3aheterocyclic amines 3aions 3aligands 3amethanol 3aquinones1 aLande, Dipali N.1 aChakrovarty, Debamitra1 aGejji, Shridhar P.1 aGosavi-Mirkute, Prajakta1 aPatil, Amit1 aSalunke-Gawali, Sunita0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 14, v. 6, no. 91 p.88010-88029dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra20970j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015200169300001600321520100200337592002801339650002201367650002001389650001001409650001401419650002101433650001401454650001401468650002201482650001301504650000901517650002801526650002401554700001801578700001601596700001601612700001401628700001701642700001801659700001701677700001601694700001901710700001301729700001501742773012401757856008401881852000901965655001201974IND60099601620221122230806.0141105e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009960162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2010.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Wen-Wen10aSingle-walled carbon nanotube induction of rat aortic endothelial cell apoptosis: Reactive oxygen species are involved in the mitochondrial pathway  ap. 564-572.  aThe use of nano-sized materials offers exciting new options in technical and medical applications. Single-walled carbon nanotubes are emerging as technologically important in different industries. However, adverse effects on cells have been reported and this may limit their use. We previously found that 200μg/mL of single-walled carbon nanotubes induce apoptosis in rat aorta endothelial cells. The current study aimed to determine the signaling pathway involved in this process. We found that reactive oxygen species generation was involved in activation of the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. The finding of apoptosis was supported by a number of morphological and biochemical hallmarks, including chromatin condensation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that single-walled carbon nanotubes induce apoptosis in rat aorta endothelial cells and that reactive oxygen species are involved in the mitochondrial pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aadverse effects 3aaorta 3aapoptosis 3acarbon nanotubes 3acaspase-3 3achromatin 3aendothelial cells 3aindustry 3arats 3areactive oxygen species 3asignal transduction1 aLin, Zhi-Qing1 aWei, Bo-Fei1 aZeng, Qiang1 aHan, Bing1 aWei, Chen-Xi1 aFan, Xian-Jun1 aHu, Chuan-Lu1 aLiu, Lihua,1 aHuang, Jie-Hua1 aYang, Xu1 aXi, Zhu-Ge0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2011 Apr., v. 43, no. 4 p.564-572dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2010.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009900174520136600273592002801639650001101667650002001678650001701698650002801715650002501743650001101768650000901779650002201788650001301810650001801823653002001841653002701861653002101888653003101909653002501940700003901965700003502004700003502039700003902074700003602113700003902149700006702188700002702255700002002282700003702302700003502339700003802374700006602412773011202478856008202590852000902672655001202681IND60679654720221121235557.0200128e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067965472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2019.1110492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonteiro, Álefe Brito10aAnxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects of Annona coriacea (Mart.) and caffeic acid in mice  aThis research evaluated the anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects of a hydroethanolic extract from the leaves of Annona coriacea (EHFAC) and caffeic acid (CA). Mice were intraperitoneally treated with saline, EHFAC (1, 10, 20 mg/kg) or CA (0.15 mg/kg) and subject to the elevated plus-maze, open field, rota-rod, forced swimming and reserpine-induced akinesia tests. Pro-convulsant and anticholinergic effects were also evaluated. EHFAC presented anxiolytic-like effect on the elevated plus-maze, which was partially reversed by flumazenil. A similar effect was observed with CA. In the forced swimming test, EHFAC and CA reduced the immobility time of mice; such effect was potentiated when EHFAC or CA were associated with imipramine, bupropion and fluoxetine. The antidepressant-like effect was reinforced as EHFAC partially reversed the reserpine-induced akinesia. In addition, a pre-treatment with EHFAC and CA did not decrease the latency to 1st seizure of animals that received a sub-convulsive dose of PTZ, nor reduced the intensity of oxotremorine-induced tremors. Taken together, the results indicate that EHFAC and CA have anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects, which involve important neurotransmitter systems, such as GABAergic and monoaminergic ones, being devoid of side effects, commonly associated with classical psychotropic drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnona 3aadverse effects 3acaffeic acid 3aelevated plus-maze test 3aforced swimming test 3aleaves 3amice 3aneurotransmitters 3aswimming 3atranquilizers 0aAnnona coriacea 0aAnxiolytic-like effect 0aGABAergic system 0aAntidepressant-like effect 0aMonoaminergic system1 aKelly de Souza Rodrigues, Cristina1 aPetícia do Nascimento, Emmily1 aSales, Valterlúcio dos Santos1 ade Araújo Delmondes, Gyllyandeson1 aNogueira da Costa, Maria Haiele1 aPereira de Oliveira, Victor Afonso1 aPereira de Morais, Luis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6659-25021 aBoligon, Aline Augusti1 aBarbosa, Roseli1 aMartins da Costa, José Galberto1 aAlencar de Menezes, Irwin Rose1 aBezerra Felipe, Cícero Francisco1 aKerntopf, Marta Regina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7919-47300 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2020 Feb., v. 136 p.111049-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.1110493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01672naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245006500158300002000223520072800243592002800971650002900999650001701028650001101045650002501056650001201081650001401093700002201107700002101129773012501150856007401275852000901349655001201358IND60641259020221121003805.0190505e20161018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064125902DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra20973d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Yogesh10aRecent developments in the synthesis of condensed β-lactams  ap. 99220-99250.  aβ-Lactams are important heterocycles with diverse pharmacological profiles and have emerged as useful organic synthons.

UV-curable polymeric support formulation was prepared by mixing the xylanase bonded PEGMA, aliphatic polyester, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and photoinitiator. After UV irradiation, the enzymatic activity of the polymeric matrix was evaluated and compared with the corresponding free enzyme. By immobilization, the temperature resistance of the enzyme was improved and showed maximum activity at 60°C. pH dependent activities of the free and immobilized enzymes were also investigated, and it was found that the pH of maximum activity for the free enzyme was 6.0, while for the optimal pH of the immobilized enzyme was 6.5. The immobilized enzyme retained 75% of its activity after 33 runs. The morphology of the polymeric support was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) coupled with SEM was used to explore the chemical composition. The results have confirmed the evidence of enzyme in the structure of the polymeric material.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical composition 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aenzyme activity 3aimmobilized enzymes 3amixing 3apH 3apolyesters 3apolyethylene glycol 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 3axylanases1 aDemir, Serap1 aKahraman, M.

On the basis of the data from 7-d weighed dietary record, all eating occasions were divided into meals or snacks based on time (meals: 06.00–10.00, 12.00–15.00 and 18.00–21.00 hours; snacks: others) or contribution to energy intake (EI) (meals: ≥15; snacks: <15%) in 1451 British adults aged 19–64 years. Irrespective of the definition of meals and snacks, both meal ED and snack ED (kJ/g; calculated on the basis of solid food only) were inversely associated with overall diet quality assessed by the healthy diet indicator (regression coefficient (β)=−0·29 to −0·21 and −0·07 to −0·04, respectively) and Mediterranean diet score (β=−0·43 to −0·30 and −0·13 to −0·06, respectively) in both sexes (P≤0·002), although the associations were stronger for meal ED. After adjustment for potential confounders, in both men and women, meal ED based on EI contribution showed positive associations with BMI (β=0·34; 95% CI 0·06, 0·62 and β=0·31; 95% CI 0·01, 0·61, respectively) and WC (β=0·96; 95% CI 0·27, 1·66 and β=0·67; 95% CI 0·04, 1·30, respectively). In addition, meal ED based on time was positively associated with WC in men (β=0·59; 95% CI 0·07, 1·10) and snack ED based on time was positively associated with BMI in women (β=0·15; 95% CI 0·04, 0·27). In analyses in which only acceptable EI reporters were included, similar results were obtained. In conclusion, the findings suggest stronger associations of meal ED with overall diet quality, BMI and WC compared with snack ED.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3aadults 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3adietary surveys 3aenergy density 3aenergy intake 3ahealthy diet 3amen 3anutritional adequacy 3aregression analysis 3asnacks 3awaist circumference 3awomen 0aMeals 0aDiet quality 0aObesity1 aLivingstone, M.

Illuminating of colloidal suspensions built of nanoporous silica microspheres dispersed in aqueous solution containing photosensitive azobenzene cationic surfactant enables manufacturing self-assembled well-ordered 2D colloidal patterns. We conjectured that ordering in this patterns may be quantified with the Voronoi entropy.Depending on the isomerization state the surfactant either tends to absorb (trans-state) into negatively charged pores or diffuse out (cis-isomer) of the particles generating an excess concentration near the colloids outer surface and thus resulting in the initiation of diffusioosmotic flow. The direction of the flow can be controlled by the wavelength and intensity of irradiation. Under irradiations with blue light the colloids separate within a few seconds forming equidistant particle ensemble where long range diffusioosmotic repulsion acts over distances exceeding several times the particle diameter. Hierarchy of ordering in the studied colloidal systems is distinguished, namely: i) ordering of individual separated colloidal particles; ii) ordering of clusters built of colloidal particles; iii) ordering within clusters of individual colloidal particles.The study of the temporal change in the Voronoi entropy for the light illuminated colloidal dispersions allowed quantification of ordering evolution on different lateral scales and under different irradiation conditions. Fourier analysis of the time evolution of the Voronoi entropy is presented. Fourier spectrum of the “small-area” (100 × 100 μm) reveals the pronounced peak at f = 1.125 Hz reflecting the oscillations of individual particles at this frequency. Ordering in hierarchical colloidal system emerging on different lateral scales is addressed. The minimal Voronoi entropy is intrinsic for the close packed 2D clusters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3ablue light 3acationic surfactants 3acis-trans isomers 3aentropy 3aevolution 3airradiation 3aisomerization 3amicroparticles 3ananopores 3aparticle size 3aphotosensitivity 3asilica 3atemporal variation 3awavelengths 0aAzobenzene containing cationic surfactants 0aLight induced diffusioosmotic flow 0a2D colloid ordering 0aVoronoi entropy1 aArya, Pooja1 aBormashenko, Edward1 aSanter, Svetlana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5041-36500 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 586 p.866-875dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.10.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02007naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245008600152300001800238520098200256592002801238650002301266650001701289650002001306650000901326650002801335650001101363650000901374650001501383650001101398700001701409700001601426700001401442773010501456856007501561852000901636655001201645IND60533969120221122183654.0160802e20121220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053396912DNAL7 a10.1021/ef300968k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yi10aPattern Recognition Technology Application in Intelligent Processing of Heavy Oil  ap. 7251-7256.  aReliable and efficient product yield estimation for unknown oils after the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) reaction is one of the key components in heavy oil intelligent processing. This paper describes the use of two chemometric pattern recognition methods, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification and supervised self-organizing maps (SSOMs), for building classification models to determine the most similar oil sample to an unknown sample in a given data set and to use the FCC yields record of the correspondent oil as the product yield prediction for the unknown sample under the same reaction conditions. Two-sided t test, correlation analysis, and hierarchical cluster heat map analysis were performed to assess the quality of the models. The work provides laboratory evidence that k-NN or SSOMs techniques could all be employed for FCC product yield estimation, while the k-NN model would be more suitable for industrial application in terms of stability and efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic cracking 3achemometrics 3adata collection 3aheat 3aindustrial applications 3amodels 3aoils 3aprediction 3at-test1 aXu, Chunming1 aZhao, Suoqi1 aShi, Quan0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2012 Dec. 20, v. 26, no. 12 p.7251-7256dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef300968k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01657naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245014000168300001800308520062200326592002800948650001300976650001000989650001600999650001401015650002101029650001201050651001301062700003301075700003201108773010801140856007401248852000901322655001201331IND60727269520221116161413.0210210e20201110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072726952DNAL7 a10.15560/16.6.14752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Monroy, Juan S.10aNew bird records for the Serranía de Las Quinchas, Colombia: inventory update and comments on distributions in an altitudinal gradient  ap. 1475-1518.  aThe diversity of birds in the Las Quinchas mountain range amounted to 374 taxa in 2007, most of them distributed in the tropical region of the massif.

There was greater species richness in the upper part of the mountains and low turnover between altitude ranges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abirds 3ainventories 3amountains 3aspecies richness 3atropics 3aColombia1 aMorales-González, Óscar E.1 aCarvajal‑Cogollo, Juan E.0 tCheck list.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 16, no. 6 p.1475-1518dPensoft PublisherswJournal:27336x1809-127X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.15560/16.6.14753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245018800170300001600358520100900374536005401383592002801437650001301465650001601478650000901494650002201503650001701525650002001542650001001562700002001572700002701592700002401619773012501643856008001768852000901848655001201857IND60623566620221118232139.0181127e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062356662DNAL7 a10.1177/17531934124545192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanzlicek, Andrew S10aComparison of urine dipstick, sulfosalicylic acid, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio and a feline-specific immunoassay for detection of albuminuria in cats with chronic kidney disease  ap. 882-888.  aThe performance of the urine dipstick, sulfosalicylic acid (SSA), and urine protein-to-creatinine (UPC) tests for the detection of albuminuria was assessed in cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Two hundred and thirty-nine urine samples from 37 cats with CKD were used. Test results were dichotomized as either positive or negative, compared with those for the feline-specific rapid urine albumin immunoassay and test performance variables calculated for each test. A positive urine dipstick (≥trace) and positive SSA (≥5 mg/dl), positive SSA alone or ≥2+ urine dipstick alone were indicative of albuminuria. In these cases, protein quantification would be warranted if proteinuria/albuminuria is persistent. In the case of a negative urine dipstick result the addition of the SSA added little diagnostic value. Of the tests investigated, the single best test for the detection of albuminuria was the UP/C (≥0.2) in which either a negative or positive test result provided useful information.  aFunding This study was funded by Vetoquinol, USA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3aalbuminuria 3acats 3adisease diagnosis 3aimmunoassays 3akidney diseases 3aurine1 aRoof, Clinton J1 aSanderson, Michael W.,1 aGrauer, Gregory F.,0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 14, no. 12 p.882-888dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/17531934124545193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012600166300001600292520129000308592002801598650002901626650001201655650001201667650001301679650001101692650002001703650001701723650000901740650001101749650001401760650000901774650002001783650001101803650001401814650001801828650001501846650000901861651001001870653001901880653001701899653003101916653002401947700001601971700001901987700001302006700001802019773013002037856008502167852000902252655001202261IND60595504320221119051210.0180605e20180217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059550432DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2017.13838502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jun10aDistribution and risk assessment of heavy metals in river surface sediments of middle reach of Xijiang River basin, China  ap. 347-361.  aXijiang River is the main surface water source in Guangxi province, South China. This study was carried out to investigate the distribution and potential ecological risks of seven heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Cd, Ni, and Cr) in surface sediments in Xijiang River basin. The results illustrated that the average concentrations of Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu, As, Ni, and Cr were 483.9, 207.5, 13.35, 23.50, 312.1, 28.75, and 50.62 mg/kg, respectively. Among them, Zn, Pb, Cd, and As were the major heave metals with concentration exceeding Class 3 threshold value of Chinese national standard. The result also showed samples with high ecological risk were mainly located in the upstream of Xijiang River basin as Diaojiang River, Hongshui River, Jincheng River, and Dahuan River. Based on the pollution risk assessment, the area manifested composite pollution of heavy metals in the sediments, signifying As, Pb, and Cd as the dominant heavy metals, and there were high ecological risk in sediments for these metals. According to correlation matrix and factor analysis (FA), the seven heavy metals were divided into three types/classes, Cd, as and Zn attributed by anthropogenic sources, natural sources corresponds for Ni and Cr while both natural and anthropogenic sources were attributed to Cu.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3afactor analysis 3aheavy metals 3alead 3anickel 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asediments 3asurface water 3awatersheds 3azinc 3aChina 0ariver sediment 0aheavy metals 0aecological risk assessment 0aXijiang River basin1 aYan, Qinyin1 aJiang, Jinping1 aSong, Bo1 aChen, Tongbin0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2018 Feb. 17, v. 24, no. 2 p.347-361dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12198x1549-78607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2017.13838503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014000165300001600305500001900321520149300340592002801833650001901861650001301880650001901893650001301912650002201925650001101947650001901958653001801977653001801995653002302013653001602036653001402052700002002066700001902086773012202105856008302227852000902310655001202319IND60715918520221118042043.0201230e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071591852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.10.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOjha, Niwesh10aEnriched oxygen vacancies of Cu2O/SnS2/SnO2 heterostructure for enhanced photocatalytic reduction of CO2 by water and nitrogen fixation  ap. 764-777.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWhen two semiconductors are electronically coupled, their photocatalytic performance can be greatly enhanced. Herein, we formed a heterostructure between Cu₂O and SnS₂/SnO₂ nanocomposite using a solvothermal reactor, which reduced CO₂ by H₂O at ambient conditions to produce CO, H₂, and CH₄. With inclusion of Cu₂O, apparent quantum yield, a measure of photoactivity, has increased from 7.16% to 8.62%. Also, the selectivity of CH₄ over CO was approximately 1.8-times higher than that of SnS₂/SnO₂. Interestingly, the as-synthesized catalysts were able to fix N₂ to NH₃ under light illumination at ambient conditions. Dissecting the mechanism into basic steps, it is shown that oxygen vacancies within the catalysts act as trapping sites for photo-induced charge carriers which strongly influenced the reactivity and selectivity of product. Additionally, oxygen vacancies act as active sites to chemisorb nitrogen molecules, which follow associative steps to generate NH₃. In absence of sacrificial agent, the NH₄⁺ generation rate was66.35μmol.g-1h-1 for Cu₂O/SnS₂/SnO₂, which is 1.9-fold higher than SnS₂/SnO₂. Formation of a p-n heterojunction between Cu₂O and SnS₂/SnO₂ nanocomposite offered favorable photoreductive potentials and high stability, mainly owing to their intimate interfacial contact. The results clearly illustrate a promising strategy to use oxygen vacancies rich heterostructure for wide application in photocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3alighting 3ananocomposites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 0aPhotocatalyst 0aNanocomposite 0aP-n heterojunction 0aSelectivity 0aVacancies1 aBajpai, Abhinav1 aKumar, Sushant0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Mar., v. 585 p.764-777dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.10.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245015500205300001600360520146600376592002801842650001501870650002201885650002001907650000901927650001501936650001301951650002301964650001101987650002401998650001202022650002102034651001102055700002602066700002502092700001802117700001802135700003002153773011202183856008202295852000902377655001202386IND60675817720221119153352.0191108e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067581772DNAL7 a10.1007/s00267-019-01210-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuaro, Renata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2540-333810aUnified Multimetric Index for the Evaluation of the Biological Condition of Streams in Southern Brazil Based on Fish and Macroinvertebrate Assemblages  ap. 661-673.  aWe developed MMI models that combine responses of fish and benthic macroinvertebrates for the evaluation of the biotic integrity of streams. The MMI was developed using a dataset covering stream sampling sites in the South of Brazil. Reference streams were identified based on the physical and chemical conditions and riparian vegetation. Thirty-four metrics were calculated and evaluated for their range, redundancy, and responsiveness to the environmental perturbation. We applied a robust approach to select the most sensitive metrics and MMI models based on the complexity and ability of the index in distinguishing impacted and reference sites. The four best MMI models selected are composed of different combinations of the eight metrics: % fish herbivorous, fish evenness, fish abundance, % macroinvertebrate shredder; % macroinvertebrate predator; % macroinvertebrate tolerant, % macroinvertebrate swimmer, and % macroinvertebrate burrower. All of the MMI models selected presented good performance in distinguishing reference streams from those impacted by different forms of land use. This study is one of the few attempts to use more than one biological assemblage in a single-multimetric index. Accordingly, we believe that the unified MMI we developed could be a useful tool to assist in the conservation and management of water resources in Neotropical regions, specially, in the implementation of ecological integrity tools more cost-effectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3abenthic organisms 3adata collection 3afish 3aherbivores 3aland use 3amacroinvertebrates 3amodels 3ariparian vegetation 3astreams 3awater management 3aBrazil1 aGubiani, Éder André1 aCunico, Almir Manoel1 aHiguti, Janet1 aMoretto, Yara1 aPiana, Pitágoras Augusto0 tEnvironmental management.g2019 Nov., v. 64, no. 5 p.661-673dSpringer USwJournal:jnl8014x0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-019-01210-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01912naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245016500171300001400336520065000350592002801000650002801028650002201056650001101078650002301089650001101112650001901123650001301142650001201155650001801167650001001185650001901195650001001214650002001224650002501244650001001269700002801279773010101307856008501408852000901493655001201502IND60085473020221121071326.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008547302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcatb.2010.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanerjee, Nupur10aUDP-glucose dehydrogenase from Capra hircus liver: Purification, partial characterization and evaluation as a coupling enzyme in UDP-galactose 4-epimerase assay  ap. 37-43.  aUDP-glucose dehydrogenase from Capra hircus has been purified to homogeneity by salt fractionations, heat treatment and chromatographic steps.

We tested the hypothesis that rainbow trout with low lipid% have genetically better FCR, and that lipid% may be genetically related to retention efficiency of macronutrients, making lipid% a useful indicator trait. A quantitative genetic analysis was used to quantify the benefit of replacing feed intake in a selection index with one of three lipid traits: body lipid%, muscle lipid% or viscera% weight of total body weight (reflecting visceral lipid). The index theory calculations showed that simultaneous selection for weight gain and against feed intake (direct selection to improve FCR) increased the expected genetic response in FCR by 1·50-fold compared with the sole selection for growth. Replacing feed intake in the selection index with body lipid%, muscle lipid% or viscera% increased genetic response in FCR by 1·29-, 1·49- and 1·02-fold, respectively, compared with the sole selection for growth. Consequently, indirect selection for weight gain and against muscle lipid% was almost as effective as direct selection for FCR. Fish with genetically low body and muscle lipid% were more efficient in turning ingested protein into protein weight gain. Both physiological and genetic mechanisms promote the hypothesis that low-lipid% fish are more efficient. These results highlight that in breeding programmes of rainbow trout, control of lipid deposition improves not only FCR but also protein-retention efficiency. This improves resource efficiency of aquaculture and reduces nutrient load to the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aaquaculture 3abody weight 3abreeding programs 3afarmed fish 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic improvement 3alipids 3amuscles 3apollution load 3aselection index 3aselective breeding 3aweight gain 0aBreeding programmes 0aIndex selection 0aQuantitative genetics1 aKiessling, A.q(Anders),1 aMartin, Samuel A.

The varying properties of red muds from different sources are presented as they influence the potentially toxic element (PTE) concentration in amended soil. Experiments conducted worldwide from the laboratory to the field scale are screened and the influencing parameters and processes in soils are highlighted. Overall red mud amendment is likely to contribute to lowering the PTE availability in contaminated soil. This is attributed to the high pH, Fe and Al oxide/oxyhydroxide content of red mud, especially hematite, boehmite, gibbsite and cancrinite phases involved in immobilising metals/metalloids. In most cases red mud amendment resulted in a lowering of metal concentrations in plants. Bacterial activity was intensified in red mud-amended contaminated soil, suggesting the toxicity from PTEs was reduced by red mud, as well as indirect effects due to changes in soil properties. Besides positive effects of red mud amendment, negative effects may also appear (e.g. increased mobility of As, Cu) which require site-specific risk assessments. Red mud remediation of metal/metalloid contaminated sites has the potential benefit of reducing red mud storage and associated problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aarsenic 3aboehmite 3acopper 3agibbsite 3ahematite 3amicrobial activity 3apH 3apolluted soils 3aremediation 3arisk assessment 3asoil amendments 3asoil properties 3atoxicity 0aBauxite residue 0aMicrobiological response 0aMobile metal fraction 0aPlant response 0aSoil remediation1 aHeal, Kate V.1 aFriesl-Hanl, Wolfgang0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Mar. 05, v. 325 p.17-30dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.11.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01904naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012400165300001400289520066600303592002800969650001600997650001601013650002101029650002301050650002101073650001601094650001101110650002001121650002701141700001701168700002401185700002001209700001501229700002201244700001701266700001601283773010101299856008501400852000901485655001201494IND60085473120221121071322.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008547312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcatb.2010.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillo, Ly12aA chemoenzymatic synthesis of deoxy sugar esters involving stereoselective acetylation of hemiacetals catalyzed by CALB  ap. 44-51.  aAn extension of the scope of the chemoenzymatic strategy for the synthesis of stereochemically pure pyranose deoxy sugar esters of different carboxylic acids has been achieved.

And OH and HO₂ radicals are the key species indicating atmospheric oxidizing capacity. Using Guangzhou City as a case, this work has conducted field measurements of photochemistry relevant pollutants including O₃, NOₓ, VOCs, H₂O₂, HNO₂ and CO, SO₂. The concentrations of OH radical are measured simultaneously by impregnated filter trapping and HPLC (IFT-HPLC) method. The factors influencing OH levels are assessed. Based on understanding of OH and HO₂ air chemistry, the production and removal rates of these 2 radicals are calculated. The results show that the budget of OH and HO₂ can generally be closed, the radical transformation between OH and HO₂ dominates the sources and sinks of them, and also the photolysis of HNO₂ and HCHO is the significant source of OH and HO₂ respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aozone 3aphotolysis 3apollutants 3asulfur dioxide 3avolatile organic compounds1 aXinrong, Ren1 aHuixiang, Wang1 aLimin, Zeng1 aYuanhang, Zhang1 aXiaoyan, Tang0 tChinese science bulletin.g2004 Nov., v. 49, no. 21 p.2253-2258dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1360/04wb0006  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245017400165300001600339520177200355592002802127650002402155650001202179650001602191650001202207650001002219650001002229650001102239650001802250650001802268651001202286653002402298653001802322653001902340653002202359653001802381700001602399700001502415700001702430700001602447773010402463856008502567852000902652655001202661IND60558290020221120122007.0161113e20160702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055829002DNAL7 a10.1080/11250003.2016.11843322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTóth, B.10aFirst description of spatial and temporal patterns of river crossings by European roe deer Capreolus capreolus (Mammalia: Cervidae): characteristics and possible reasons  ap. 423-433.  aCrossing water bodies (like lakes or rivers) by European roe deer Capreolus capreolus Linnaeus, 1758 is a known phenomenon. However, there is scarce information about the reasons for and patterns of this activity. We analysed 4-year localization data of 13 Global Positioning System-Global System for Mobile Communications (GPS-GSM) collared roe deer living in the floodplain forests of the river Tisza in the Hungarian Great Plain in order to describe such behaviour. Initially, we assumed that this river may represent a barrier for roe deer and we studied the frequency of river crossing occasions, between and within the studied animals. Our questions were: (1) Does the Tisza River act as a barrier to the movements of roe deer? (2) Are there any seasonal or daily variations in the crossing patterns? (3) Is there any difference between males and females regarding the water crossing patterns? (4) Does the water level or the increase in human presence (disturbance by hunting) have any impact on crossings? According to our data, 10 of the 13 individuals crossed the river at least twice, and eight of them did so several times or regularly. The periods spent on the different sides of the river varied from a few hours to several months. During the study period, animals of both sexes crossed the river without difference. There were crossings in all seasons, in daytime and nighttime also. We could not find any difference between the seasons, but there were more crossings in the daytime when we excluded the data of an outlier animal. Water level or human disturbance (live brown hare capture) had no impact on crossings. We conclude that the Tisza River does not represent a real barrier to the movements of roe deer, and our assumption was not supported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapreolus capreolus 3afemales 3afloodplains 3aforests 3alakes 3amales 3arivers 3asport hunting 3asurface water 3aHungary 0aCapreolus capreolus 0aGPS telemetry 0ariver crossing 0aspatial behaviour 0aswimming deer1 aSchally, G.1 aBleier, N.1 aLehoczki, R.1 aCsányi, S.0 tItalian journal of zoology.g2016 July 2, v. 83, no. 3 p.423-433dTaylor & Francisx1748-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11250003.2016.11843323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245024200176520146100418592002801879650002601907650001501933650001101948650001201959650004301971650001902014650001502033650002602048650001302074650001602087653000902103653002902112653000902141653001502150700001802165700002002183700002302203700002702226773011402253856008502367852000902452655001202461IND60761709420221120132222.0220205e20220208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076170942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4627852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalogiouri, Natasa P.10aDevelopment of highly hydrophobic fabric phase sorptive extraction membranes and exploring their applications for the rapid determination of tocopherols in edible oils analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography-diode array detection  aΑ novel, green, and facile fabric phase sorptive extraction (FPSE) prior to high pressure liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) methodology was developed for the efficient extraction and quantitative determination of tocopherols (α-, sum of (β+γ), and δ-) in edible oils. Among several highly hydrophobic FPSE membranes, sol-gel polycaprolactone-polydimethylsiloxane-polycaprolactone (sol-gel PCAP-PDMS-PCAP) coated polyester FPSE membrane was found as the most efficient in extracting tocopherol homologues from edible oil samples. To maximize the extraction efficiency of FPSE membrane, major parameters of FPSE including the membrane size, sample loading time, the choice of the appropriate elution solvent and the elution solvent volume, desorption time, and the influence of stirring were systematically optimized. The developed FPSE-HPLC-DAD methodology was validated and presented adequately low limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) over the ranges 0.05–0.10 μg/g, and 0.17–0.33 μg/g, respectively. The RSD% of the within-day and between-day assays were lower than 1.3, and 11.8, respectively, demonstrating good method precision. The trueness of the method was assessed by means of relative percentage of recovery and ranged between 90.8 and 95.1% for within-day assay, and between 88.7–92.8% for between-day assay. The developed methodology was applied in the analysis of edible oils.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooking fats and oils 3adesorption 3adiodes 3afabrics 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3apolyesters 3aquantitative analysis 3asolvents 3atocopherols 0aFPSE 0aGreen sample preparation 0aHPLC 0aEdible oil1 aKabir, Abuzar1 aOlayanju, Basit1 aFurton, Kenneth G.1 aSamanidou, Victoria F.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 Feb. 08, v. 1664 p.462785-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4627853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015600170300001600326520124900342592002801591650001601619650001101635650001301646650001901659650001301678650002701691650001901718650002101737650001401758650002501772650001401797650001201811653001201823653002001835653002501855653003001880653002501910700001701935700001601952700002001968700002001988700002502008700001902033700002102052773011402073856008502187852000902272655001202281IND60610711220221120160032.0180829e20170305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061071122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.11.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOon, Yoong-Sin10aMicrobial fuel cell operation using monoazo and diazo dyes as terminal electron acceptor for simultaneous decolourisation and bioelectricity generation  ap. 170-177.  aMonoazo and diazo dyes [New coccine (NC), Acid orange 7 (AO7), Reactive red 120 (RR120) and Reactive green 19 (RG19)] were employed as electron acceptors in the abiotic cathode of microbial fuel cell. The electrons and protons generated from microbial organic oxidation at the anode which were utilized for electrochemical azo dye reduction at the cathodic chamber was successfully demonstrated. When NC was employed as the electron acceptor, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and dye decolourisation efficiencies obtained at the anodic and cathodic chamber were 73±3% and 95.1±1.1%, respectively. This study demonstrated that the decolourisation rates of monoazo dyes were ∼50% higher than diazo dyes. The maximum power density in relation to NC decolourisation was 20.64mW/m², corresponding to current density of 120.24mA/m². The decolourisation rate and power output of different azo dyes were in the order of NC>AO7>RR120>RG19. The findings revealed that the structure of dye influenced the decolourisation and power performance of MFC. Azo dye with electron-withdrawing group at para substituent to azo bond would draw electrons from azo bond; hence the azo dye became more electrophilic and more favourable for dye reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aanodes 3aazo dyes 3abioelectricity 3acathodes 3achemical oxygen demand 3adecolorization 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aoxidation 3aprotons 0aAzo dye 0aDecolourisation 0aDouble chambered MFC 0aBioelectricity generation 0aWastewater treatment1 aOng, Soon-An1 aHo, Li-Ngee1 aWong, Yee-Shian1 aOon, Yoong-Ling1 aLehl, Harvinder Kaur1 aThung, Wei-Eng1 aNordin, Noradiba0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Mar. 05, v. 325 p.170-177dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.11.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03753naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245015800209300002000367520217900387592002802566596006002594650002202654650001502676650002002691650001402711650002002725650002502745650002902770650003102799650001702830650001402847650001502861650001502876650001402891650001302905650000902918650001302927651001002940700001802950700001902968700002002987700001703007773015503024856008303179852000903262655001203271IND60754790720221121041805.0211023e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075479072DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-12844-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubinos, David A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0161-774510aGeochemical stability of potentially toxic elements in porphyry copper-mine tailings from Chile as linked to ecological and human health risks assessment  ap. 57499-57529.  aThe geochemical stability, in terms of potential mobility and derived ecological and human health risks of potentially toxic elements (PTEs), of diverse fresh and old porphyry Cu-mine tailings from Chile was assessed through an integrated methodology comprising four interrelated investigation levels: (1) chemical composition and contamination degree of tailings by PTEs, (2) mineralogical characterization by X-ray diffraction and quantitative automated mineralogy analysis by scanning electron microscopy (QEMSCAN®), (3) partitioning and potential mobility of PTEs within the tailings by a sequential extraction procedure (SEP) and leaching tests, and (4) ecological risk assessment (ERA) and human health risk assessment (HHRA). According to pollution indices, Cu, As, Pb, and Mo are most concerning PTEs present in the tailings. SEP shows that major portion of the PTEs are strongly fixed as residual fraction, and thus are poorly mobilizable and bioavailable. Among the PTEs, Cu, As, and Mo were identified as the PTEs most prone to mobilization. Leaching tests show that a low fraction of PTEs is water-leachable. Seawater enhances Mn and As leaching, while process water increases the leaching of Cu, Mn, and Mo. Phosphate particularly promotes leaching of As and Cu, whereas it does not mobilize or even immobilize Pb in the tailings. ERA suggests that mainly old tailings pose a very high potential risk for ecological receptors (PERI = 663–3356), mostly due to Cu and As. HHRA indicates that the old tailings pose higher potential non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks, while the risk decreases in the order ingestion > dermal > inhalation for both children and adults. Non carcinogenic and carcinogenic HHRA points to As as the main PTE of concern via ingestion pathway in the tailings. Overall, the results revealed that particularly old tailings, containing mixed slag-tailings, pose considerable risks to the environment and human health due to potential PTEs mobilization and this aspect requires scrutiny for proper tailings management, including storage, sealing, and eventual tailings reprocessing and/or site rehabilitation after closure.  aPublisher supplied data  a13CEI2-21844cCorporación de Fomento de la Producción 3aX-ray diffraction 3aautomation 3abioavailability 3abreathing 3acarcinogenicity 3achemical composition 3aenvironmental assessment 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3aingestion 3amineralogy 3aphosphates 3apollution 3aresearch 3arisk 3aseawater 3aChile1 aJerez, Óscar1 aForghani, Giti1 aEdraki, Mansour1 aKelm, Ursula0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Nov., v. 28, no. 41 p.57499-57529dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12844-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245019000172300001600362520128700378592002801665650005001693650001101743650003501754650002501789650001201814650001701826650001301843650001301856650001101869650002101880650001101901650001901912650001501931650001701946650000901963650001401972650001101986650000901997650001302006650001802019650001002037650000902047651001202056653001702068653002202085653001802107653002702125653002702152700001702179700002002196700001602216700002602232773013002258856008502388852000902473655001202482IND60595504720221119051234.0180605e20180217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059550472DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2017.13853852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOdey, Micheal O.10aDrinking water quality and risk implications for community health: A case study of shallow water wells and boreholes in three major communities in Northern Cross-River, Southern Nigeria  ap. 427-444.  aThe quality of water sources and its potential health implications to adults and children populations of respective major communities in Northern Cross-River was assessed. Water samples (n = 10/water source/site) were collected from three (Okpoma, Okuku and Ugaga) communities and heavy metal concentrations (Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Manganese (Mn), Nickel (Ni), Copper (Cu), Cobalt (Co), and Zinc (Zn)) were evaluated using Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS). Overall, Pb, Cd, Ni, and Co were higher than drinking water guidelines, while only Cr, Mn, Cu, and Zn were within the permissible limits. The estimated average daily intake (EADI) and target hazard quotient (THQ) were used to determine risk implications for adult and children consumer populations. The EADI for Pb in adults for borehole water, Pb and Cr by child consumer population for borehole and shallow well water exceeded the reference dose (RfD) by USEPA. The THQ for adult population were >1 for Pb in borehole water and >1 for Pb and Cr across all sites for the child consumer population. Overall, our findings indicate toxicity and higher hazard risk for both adult (Pb) and children (Pb and Cr) populations that source drinking water from borehole and shallow well water in these communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aadults 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aaverage daily intake 3acadmium 3acase studies 3achildren 3achromium 3acobalt 3acommunity health 3acopper 3adrinking water 3aguidelines 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3arisk 3atoxicity 3awater quality 3awells 3azinc 3aNigeria 0aheavy metals 0awell and borehole 0awater quality 0atarget hazard quotient 0aestimated daily intake1 aIbor, Oju R.1 aAndem, Andem B.1 aEttah, Ivon1 aChukwuka, Azubuike V.0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2018 Feb. 17, v. 24, no. 2 p.427-444dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12198x1549-78607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2017.13853853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02024naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245012000153300001800273520099800291592002801289650002301317650001901340650001801359650001601377650001801393650001801411650001601429650001501445650001901460650002601479700001701505773010201522856004101624852000901665655001201674IND50068010220221121221245.0130721e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006801022DNAL7 a10.1360/972004-2272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Wu14aThe 5′ untranslated region of fruA mRNA in Myxococcus xanthus positively regulates the expression of its own gene  ap. 2266-2271.  aMyxococcus xanthus provides an excellent model organism for studying the mechanism of multicellular morphogenesis. The mRNA for FruA, a transcription factor essential for the development of M. xanthus, contains a very long 5′-UTR consisting of 235 nucleotides. Using lacZ as a reporter gene, two fruA-lacZ translational fusions retaining or lacking the fruA 5′-UTR were constructed and separately integrated at phage Mx8 attachment site (attB) in M. xanthus chromosome. Deletion in 5′-UTR between nucleotides from +4 to +220 abolished fruA-lacZ expression during development, indicating that the 5′-UTR is essential for the induction of fruA. Prediction of the RNA secondary structure of 5′-UTR shows that this region could form an extremely stable three-helix junction structure, which might be a binding site for a regulatory protein or contain a cis-acting element(s) to control fruA expression. Thus, the 5′-UTR of fruA mRNA positively regulates the expression of its own gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyxococcus xanthus 3abacteriophages 3abinding sites 3achromosomes 3amessenger RNA 3amorphogenesis 3anucleotides 3aprediction 3areporter genes 3atranscription factors1 aXiaohua, Mao0 tChinese science bulletin.g2004 Nov., v. 49, no. 21 p.2266-2271dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1360/972004-227  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008100168300001600249520118100265592002801446650001501474650001101489650001901500650001101519650001001530650001301540650001901553650001601572651002201588651001901610653002101629653002101650653001501671653001701686653002201703700001601725700001901741773010401760856008501864852000901949655001201958IND60558290220221122125806.0161113e20160702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055829022DNAL7 a10.1080/11250003.2016.11862352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonifazi, A.10aNew records of old species: some pelagic polychaetes along the Italian coast  ap. 364-371.  aHoloplanktonic polychaetes constitute an exception within this taxon, which as adults colonize all the whole variety of brackish water and marine habitats. Nevertheless, they form a distinctive group in marine zooplankton and play an important role in the pelagic trophic nets. Pelagic worms are little studied, especially in the Mediterranean Sea, while information regarding the distribution of the families Typhloscolecidae and Iospilidae along Italian coasts is a century out of date. This paper deals with the state of knowledge of these polychaetes; it summarizes the previous records, updating them with the new records here reported from Tyrrhenian Sea, in order to check whether they have a bearing on Italian fauna. The findings reported in this paper confirm the presence of the Typhloscolecidae, with the species Sagitella kowalewskyi and Typhloscolex muelleri , and of the Iospilidae, with the species Phalacrophorus pictus and Iospilus phalacroides , along the Italian coasts, validating, in each case, their current presence in the Italian fauna. The main morphological features of these species and a dichotomous key for their identification are also reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolychaeta 3aadults 3abrackish water 3acoasts 3afauna 3ahabitats 3ataxonomic keys 3azooplankton 3aMediterranean Sea 3aTyrrhenian Sea 0aPlanktonic worms 0aTyphloscolecidae 0aIospilidae 0aholoplankton 0aMediterranean Sea1 aVentura, D.1 aGravina, M.

In order to improve the process efficiency, this work analyzes the effects of ultrasonic power, frequency, and load toward the cleaning of crude oil–contaminated sand, using two different sample positions and sand types. Crude oil–contaminated beach sand and produced sand from offshore oil well were used as samples. They were cleaned in custom-made ultrasonic bath reactor for 10 min with power from 30 to 120 W, frequency covering 25–60 kHz, and sand load of 10–100 g. With experimental design consisting multiple factors and levels, the interactions between factors in all possible combinations were determined using ANOVA (n = 210). From p-value based at 95% confidence interval and extensive F test, the three most significant factors were the sand type, the ultrasonic frequency, and the interaction between sand type and frequency. The best setting for suspended samples involved high frequency of 60 kHz, whereas bottom samples preferred low frequency at 28 kHz. This finding was justified when the acoustic pressure attenuation, standing wave pattern, and surface pitting/cracking were found in correlation with the cleaning results. Overall, the maximum treatment under ultrasonic bath solely gained around 60%, improvable by hybrid cleaning with other techniques such as chemical, biological, mechanical, and thermal.  aPublisher supplied data  aFundamental Research Grant Scheme [600-IRMI/FRGS 5/3 (192/2019)]cMinistry of Higher Education Malaysia 3aacoustics 3aconfidence interval 3aexperimental design 3ahybrids 3aoil fields 3apollution 3aremediation 3aresearch 3asand 3aultrasonics1 aTuan Ya, Tuan Mohammad  Yusoff Shah1 aAbdullah, Mohamad Zaki1 aOthman, Nur Hidayati1 aAlias, Nur Hashimah0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Nov., v. 28, no. 41 p.58081-58091dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14776-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03945naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245006000153300001800213500001500231520252800246592002802774650002602802650002202828650002702850650002202877650001102899650002602910650003102936650002802967650005202995650001703047650002003064650002403084650001103108650001003119650001503129650001403144653001003158700001603168700001603184700001303200700001503213700001803228700001503246700001603261773010203277856003903379852000903418655001203427IND50068010420221121221333.0130721e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006801042DNAL7 a10.1360/04wc02712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Wang10aGene expression profiles of the developing human retina  ap. 2277-2284.  a2019-12-05  aRetina is a multilayer and highly specialized tissue important in converting light into neural signals. In humans, the critical period for the formation of complex multiplayer structure takes place during embryogenesis between 12 and 28 weeks. The morphologic changes during retinal development in humans have been studied but little is known about the molecular events essential for the formation of the retina. To gain further insights into this process, cDNA microarrays containing 16361 human gene probes were used to measure the gene expression levels in retinas. Of the 16361 genes, 68.7%, 71.4% and 69.7% showed positive hybridization with cDNAs made from 12–16 week fetal, 22–26 week fetal and adult retinas. A total of 814 genes showed a minimum of 3-fold changes between the lowest and highest expression levels among three time points and among them, 106 genes had expression levels with the hybridization intensity above 100 at one or more time points. The clustering analysis suggested that the majority of differentially expressed genes were down-regulated during the retinal development. The differentially expressed genes were further classified according to functions of known genes, and were ranked in decreasing order according to frequency: development, differentiation, signal transduction, protein synthesis and translation, metabolism, DNA binding and transcription, DNA synthesis-repair-recombination, immuno-response, ion channeltransport, cell receptor, cytoskeleton, cell cycle, pro-oncogene, stress and apoptosis related genes. Among these 106 differentially expressed genes, 60 are already present in NEI retina cDNA or EST Databank but the remaining 46 genes are absent and thus identified as “function unknown”. To validate gene expression data from the microarray, real-time RT-PCR was performed for 46 “function unknown” genes and 6 known retina specific expression genes, and β-actin was used as internal control. Twenty-seven of these genes showed very similar expression profiles between the microarray and real-time RT-PCR data. In situ hybridization revealed both expression level and cellular distribution of NNAT in retina. Finally, the chromosomal locations of 106 differentially expressed genes were also searched and one of these genes is associated with autosomal dominant cone or cone-rod dystrophy. The data from present study provide insights into understanding genetic programs during human retinal development and help identify additional retinal disease genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ain situ hybridization 3aprotein synthesis 3atranslation (genetics) 3acomplementary DNA 3ahumans 3amicroarray technology 3agene expression regulation 3aexpressed sequence tags 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3acytoskeleton 3agene expression 3asignal transduction 3aretina 3aactin 3acell cycle 3adatabases 0agenes1 aHuiming, Li1 aWenwen, Liu1 aPing, Xu1 aGengxi, Hu1 aYidong, Cheng1 aLibin, Jia1 aQian, Huang0 tChinese science bulletin.g2004 Nov., v. 49, no. 21 p.2277-2284dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1360/04wc0271  aDNAL 7aarticle03780naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024005500111040001800166072000900184072000900193072000900202072000900211100001800220245009400238300001600332500002400348520144200372650001801814650001901832650001701851650002401868650002201892650001101914650001001925650002001935650001501955650001901970650002001989650001602009650002202025650001202047650001302059650003002072650003102102650003102133650003702164650002002201650003002221650002302251650002802274650002102302650001702323650002602340650002102366651001402387651001402401653002402415653002602439653002402465700001602489700002002505700001502525700001502540700001602555700001602571700001802587700001602605700001902621700001502640773012202655852000902777856010502786930003302891945002502924946001302949655001202962IND4395231020151116000000.0070921e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439523102DNAL7 a179155192pmid7 a10.1603/0022-2585(2007)44[851:COAADC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL833 0aL300 0aL0011 aHammond, S.N.10aCharacterization of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culcidae) Production Sites in Urban Nicaragua  ap. 851-860.  aIncludes references  aTo characterize the production patterns of the dengue virus vector Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culcidae), pupal surveys were conducted in selected neighborhoods of two major cities in Nicaragua. In León, 833 houses were visited in July and September 2003, corresponding to the beginning and middle of the dengue season; in Managua, 1,365 homes were visited in July 2003. In total, 7,607 containers were characterized, of which 11% were positive for Ae. aegypti larvae and 4% for pupae. In addition to barrels, potted plants and superficial water on tarps and in puddles were identified as highly productive sites. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed frequency of container use, use of a lid, and rainwater filling as key variables affecting pupal positivity. Importantly, this survey demonstrated the risk associated with the presence of lids, the limited temporal efficacy of temephos, and the lack of association of water availability with risky water storage practices. Finally, we introduce the concept of an efficiency value and an accompanying graphical display system that can facilitate development of targeted pupal control strategies. These data underscore the importance of entomological surveillance of pupal productivity to gather information from which to derive streamlined, efficient, and effective vector control measures to reduce the density of Aedes mosquito larvae and pupae and thus the risk for dengue. 3aAedes aegypti 3ainsect vectors 3aDengue virus 3ainsect reproduction 3aoviposition sites 3alarvae 3apupae 3aaquatic habitat 3acontainers 3ainsect surveys 3arisk assessment 3aurban areas 2aAedesxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aFresh Waterxparasitology 2aInsect Vectorsxphysiology 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aLarvaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aLogistic Models 2aMosquito Controlxmethods 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Surveillance 2aPupaxphysiology 2aRisk Factors 2aTemefosxpharmacology 2aUrban Population 3aNicaragua 0aNicaragua 0avector productivity 0amosquito productivity 0avector surveillance1 aGordon, Al.1 aLugo, E. del C.1 aMoreno, G.1 aKuan, G.M.1 aLopez, M.M.1 aLopez, J.D.1 aDelgado, M.A.1 aValle, S.I.1 aEspinoza, P.M.1 aHarris, E.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2007 Sept., v. 44, no. 5 p.851-860dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-2585(2007)44[851:COAADC]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20071221b20080102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/12/21  aOther US 7aarticle02704naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011700173300001600290520131700306592002801623650002101651650001601672650001701688650001901705650002801724650001201752650001501764650000901779650001801788650001401806650001401820650001101834650001301845650001301858650001901871651001401890653001501904653001701919653002201936653001601958653002101974700001901995773011402014856008502128852000902213655001202222IND60610711520221121033618.0180829e20170305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061071152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.11.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoglaienko, Daria10aWicking of light hydrophobic liquid phase from water by pulverized rubber: Theoretical and experimental analyses  ap. 189-197.  aPulverized rubber (PR) can be utilized for capturing floating oils to prevent spreading and volatilization of hydrocarbons. Experiments were conducted using PR with four different particle sizes (ranging from 0.075 to 0.600mm) and South Louisiana crude oil. The oil capture performance of the PR particles was compared with that of powdered activated carbon (AC). Oil-particle interactions were analyzed using capillary theories for lateral aggregation and wicking processes, as well as sorption capacity in relation to particle size. The sorption capacity (as oil to sorbent ratio) for PR with particle size 0.115mm (4.41g/g) was comparable to that of AC with particle size 0.187mm (5.00g/g). Sorption efficiency (oil:powder ratio, g/g) of the PR increased with decreasing particle size. Sorption of oil by PR occurred rapidly (in less than 10min) which indicated strong capillary action. No additional sorption occurred after 30min. For the PR sample with larger particle size (0.600–0.400mm), lateral aggregation was clearly noticeable. The PR-oil aggregates could be easily removed from the water surface without breaking. The cost, availability and recycling potential of PR make it a feasible alternative material for oil spill response and industrial applications which require removal of floating oils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3acapillarity 3ahydrocarbons 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustrial applications 3aliquids 3aoil spills 3aoils 3aparticle size 3apetroleum 3arecycling 3arubber 3asorbents 3asorption 3avolatilization 3aLouisiana 0aOil spills 0aFloating oil 0aPulverized rubber 0aWaste tires 0aActivated carbon1 aTansel, Berrin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Mar. 05, v. 325 p.189-197dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.11.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012900171300001600300520116400316592002801480650002101508650001301529650001301542650002301555650002501578650003701603650001801640650002301658650001501681650001201696650001101708650001301719650002401732700001901756700002101775700002001796700003001816700003101846700002201877773010501899856008502004852000902089655001202098IND60083259020221121132818.0141101e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008325902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2011.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWajima, Takeaki10aEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli CS6 gene products and their roles in CS6 structural protein assembly and cellular adherence  ap. 243-249.  aEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) produces a variety of colonization factors necessary for attachment to the host cell, among which CS6 is one of the most prevalent in ETEC isolates from developing countries. The CS6 operon is composed of 4 genes, cssA, cssB, cssC, and cssD. The molecular mechanism of CS6 assembly and cell surface presentation, and the contribution of each protein to the attachment of the bacterium to intestinal cells remain unclear. In the present study, a series of css gene-deletion mutants of the CS6 operon were constructed in the ETEC genetic background, and their effect on adhesion to host cells and CS6 assembly was studied. Each subunit deletion resulted in a reduction in the adhesion to intestinal cells to the same level of laboratory E. coli strains, and this effect was restored by complementary plasmids, suggesting that the 4 proteins are necessary for CS6 expression. Bacterial cell fractionation and western blotting of the mutant strains suggested that the formation of a CssA–CssB–CssC complex is necessary for recognition by CssD and transport of CssA–CssB to the outer membrane as a colonization factor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadhesion 3abacteria 3acell fractionation 3adeveloping countries 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3agene deletion 3agenetic background 3aintestines 3amutants 3aoperon 3aplasmids 3astructural proteins1 aSabui, Subrata1 aFukumoto, Megumi1 aKano, Shigeyuki1 aRamamurthy, Thandavarayan1 aChatterjee, Nabendu Sekhar1 aHamabata, Takashi0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2011 Oct., v. 51, no. 4 p.243-249dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2011.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014300173300001600316520164400332592002801976650001602004650003202020650002102052650001702073650002302090650002702113650001102140650002002151650002302171650001402194650001402208650001202222650001502234650002102249650000702270650003902277650001402316650001602330650001502346650003002361700001802391700002102409773010302430856008502533852000902618655001202627IND60085473620221121045618.0141101e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008547362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcatb.2010.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerfali, Mohamed10aCatalytic properties of Talaromyces thermophilus α-l-arabinofuranosidase and its synergistic action with immobilized endo-β-1,4-xylanase  ap. 192-199.  aWhen grown on wheat bran, Talaromyces thermophilus produces a wide spectrum of hemicellulases, mainly endo-β-1,4-xylanase, α-l-arabinofuranosidase and β-xylosidase. The extracellular α-l-arabinofuranosidase was purified to homogeneity by sequential operation of ammonium sulfate precipitation, Q-sepharose column chromatography, gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 and MonoQ column. The pure α-l-arabinofuranosidase had a specific activity of 49U/mg of protein and was purified 26.7-fold. The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be 35kDa, determined by SDS-PAGE and by gel filtration. The α-l-arabinofuranosidase exhibited maximal activity at pH 6.0–7.0 and an optimal temperature at 55°C. The half-life of the α-l-arabinofuranosidase at 60°C was approximately 2h and it was very stable over a wide pH range for 24h at 4°C. The apparent Michaelis constant Kₘ value of the α-l-arabinofuranosidase was 0.77mM for p-nitropenyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside. The turnover number (Kcₐₜ) and catalytic efficiency (Kcₐₜ/Kₘ) were found to be 14.3s⁻¹ and 1.8 104M⁻¹s⁻¹, respectively. Metal ions such as Hg²⁺ and Cu²⁺ inhibited enzyme activity, whereas it was strongly activated by Mn²⁺. The α-l-arabinofuranosidase was specific for the α-linked arabinoside in the furanoside configuration and can also retain 52% of its activity in the presence of p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside as substrate. α-l-arabinofuranosidase acted synergistically with the immobilized endo-β-1,4-xylanase for the breakdown of alkali-extracted arabinoxylan and in the improvement of xylobiose and monosaccharide production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTalaromyces 3aalpha-N-arabinofuranosidase 3aammonium sulfate 3aarabinoxylan 3acatalytic activity 3achemical precipitation 3acopper 3aenzyme activity 3agel chromatography 3ahalf life 3amanganese 3amercury 3ametal ions 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asynergism 3atemperature 3awheat bran 3axylan 1,4-beta-xylosidase1 aGargouri, Ali1 aBelghith, Hafedh0 tJournal of molecular catalysis.g2011 Feb., v. 68, no. 2 p.192-199dElsevier B.V.x1381-11777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcatb.2010.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010600163300002000269520144600289592002801735596005901763650001701822650000801839650001801847650001201865650002001877650001801897650002101915650001001936650001701946650001301963650001801976650001401994700001602008700001702024700001802041700002002059700001902079700002002098700005702118773015502175856008302330852000902413655001202422IND60754791420221123033500.0211023e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075479142DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14577-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Chao10aAssociation between ambient air pollution and multiple sclerosis: a systemic review and meta-analysis  ap. 58142-58153.  aRecently, increasing attention has been paid to the effects of air pollutants on autoimmune diseases. The results of relationship between ambient air pollution and multiple sclerosis (MS) showed a variety of differences. Thus, the purpose of this study is to further clarify and quantify the relationship between ambient air pollutants and MS through meta-analysis. Through electronic literature search, literature related to our research topic was collected in Cochrane Library, Embase, and PubMed till August 18, 2020, according to certain criteria. Pooled risk estimate and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated by random-effect model analysis. After removing copies, browsing titles and abstracts, and reading full text, 6 studies were finally included. The results showed that only particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 (PM₁₀) was related to MS (pooled HR = 1.058, 95% CI = 1.050–1.066), and no correlation was found between PM with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 (PM₂.₅), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O₃), benzene (C₆H₆), major road < 50 m, and MS. There was no publication bias, and the heterogeneity analysis results were stable. PM₁₀ is correlated with the disease MS, while other pollution is not connected with MS. Therefore, it is important for MS patients to take personal protection against particulate pollution and avoid exposure to higher levels of PM.  aPublisher supplied data  a81872693cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aaerodynamics 3aair 3aair pollution 3abenzene 3acarbon monoxide 3ameta-analysis 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aparticulates 3aresearch 3arisk estimate 3asclerosis1 aLi, Qing-Ru1 aMao, Yan-Mei1 aXia, Yuan-Rui1 aGuo, Heng-Sheng1 aWang, Jun-Ping1 aShuai, Zong-Wen1 aYe, Dong-Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6604-96140 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Nov., v. 28, no. 41 p.58142-58153dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14577-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01542naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245008300153300001800236520062600254592002800880650001500908650001400923650001000937650001900947650001300966650001400979700001800993700001301011773012101024856007401145852000901219655001201228IND60664054820221120154223.0190910e20120131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066405482DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra01209j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zifu10aOne-pot synthesis of monodisperse latex particles with single-cavity structure  ap. 1322-1325.  aThis paper describes a simple and flexible method for fabricating polymeric particles with single-cavity structure by a modified soap-free emulsion polymerization (SFEP). The key is to introduce a functional comonomer (methyl methacrylate, MMA) and a crosslinker (divinylbenzene, DVB) to a conventional three-component SFEP system, followed by polymerization. Anisotropic latex particles with good monodispersity in both size and shape are directly produced in one-pot synthesis with a high yield.

The GOx bearing nanomaterial was fixed on a glassy carbon electrode to construct a novel biosensor for glucose determination. The direct electrochemistry of immobilized GOx and its electron transfer parameters at the modified glassy carbon electrode were reported. The apparent heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant (kₛ) of GOx was estimated to be 3.5s⁻¹, which is higher than those reported previously. Amperometric detection of glucose resulted in a rapid (3s) and stable response in the linear concentration range from 1.8 to 266μM. The apparent Michaelis–Menten constant was measured to be 8.59mM, indicating that the immobilized GOx on NH₂–TiO₂–CNT matrix retained its native activity. The anti-interference ability and long-term stability of the biosensor were also assessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiosensors 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalytic activity 3achemical concentration 3acoatings 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aenzyme kinetics 3aglassy carbon electrode 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3ananocomposites 3atitanium dioxide1 aRafiee-Pour, Hossain-Ali1 aGhourchian, Hedayatollah1 aGholami, Mohammad R.0 tJournal of molecular catalysis.g2011 Feb., v. 68, no. 2 p.206-210dElsevier B.V.x1381-11777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcatb.2010.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011200170300001600282520135700298592002801655650001501683650000801698650002401706650002501730650001101755650001101766650001201777650002101789650001301810650001101823650001601834650002101850650001901871653002501890653001601915653002601931653001401957700001501971773011401986856008502100852000902185655001202194IND60610711820221121033725.0180829e20170305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061071182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuthuraman, G.10aInnovative reductive remediation of carbon tetrafluoride at room temperature by using electrogenerated Co1+  ap. 157-162.  aAmong the non-CO2 greenhouse gases, carbon tetrafluoride (CF4) is the most recalcitrant and should be eliminated from the atmosphere. In the present study, a non-combustion electroscrubbing method was used in an attempt to degrade CF4 with an electrogenerated Co¹⁺ mediator in a highly alkaline medium. The initial absorption experiments revealed 165mgL⁻¹ CF4 gas dissolved in 10M NaOH. Different mediator precursors, [Co(II)(CN)5]³⁻, [Ni(II)(CN)4]²⁻, [Cu(II)(OH)4]²⁻, and [Co(II)(OH)4]²⁻, were used and the electroscrubbing results showed that the electrogenerated Co¹⁺ or [Co(II)(OH)4]²⁻ precursor effectively degraded up to 99.25% of the CF4 gas. The variations in [Co(II)(OH)4]²⁻ reduction efficiency and cyclic voltammetry revealed CF4 degradation followed by electrogenerated Co¹⁺ mediated reduction. The increased zeta potential (+6mV) of the electrogenerated Co¹⁺ showed that the degradation reaction occurs preferably at the solution interface. Electroscrubbing for CF4 removal and the resulting products were controlled by the carrier gas. Air and H2 carrier gases lead to the formation of CHF3 and COF2. N2 as the carrier gas caused 99.25% degradation with ethanol as a product. An 80% CF4 degradation efficiency with CHF3 as the product was observed when a mixture of N2 and air was used as the carrier gas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aair 3aambient temperature 3acarbon tetrafluoride 3acobalt 3acopper 3aethanol 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrogen 3anickel 3aremediation 3asodium hydroxide 3azeta potential 0aCarbon tetrafluoride 0aRemediation 0aElectrogenerated Co1+ 0aReduction1 aMoon, I.S.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Mar. 05, v. 325 p.157-162dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001200138245006100150300001800211520117700229592002801406650002301434650002401457650002501481650000901506651001701515700001701532700001901549773010201568856003901670852000901709655001201718IND50068010820221121235615.0130721e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006801082DNAL7 a10.1360/04wd00452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Li10aIndonesian Throughflow in an eddy-permitting oceanic GCM  ap. 2305-2310.  aAn eddy-permitting quasi-global oceanic GCM was driven by wind stresses from reanalysis data for the period of 1958–2001 to get the time series of the upper circulation in the Indonesian Sea. The model represents a reasonable pathway of Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) with Makassar Strait making the major passage transfer the North Pacific water southward. The simulated annual mean ITF transport is 14.5 Sv, with 13.2 Sv in the upper 700 m. Annual cycle is the dominant signal for the seasonal climatology of the upper layer transport. Both the annual mean and seasonal cycle agree well with the observation. The overall correlation between the interannual anomaly of the ITF transport and Niño 3.4 index reaches -0.65 in the simulation, which indicates that ENSO-related interannual variability in the Pacific is dominant in controlling the ITF transport. The relationship between the interannual anomalies of ITF and sea surface temperature in the Pacific, the Indian Ocean is not fixed in the simulation. In 1994, for instance, the intensive Indian Ocean sea surface temperature anomaly plays a dominant role in the formation of an impressive large transport of ITF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseasonal variation 3asurface temperature 3atime series analysis 3awind 3aIndian Ocean1 aHailong, Liu1 aXuehong, Zhang0 tChinese science bulletin.g2004 Nov., v. 49, no. 21 p.2305-2310dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1360/04wd0045  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011900169300001600288520100700304592002801311650004401339650001501383650001501398650002201413650002201435650001201457650001401469650001701483650002601500650001101526650000701537650002301544653002301567653002001590653001601610653001501626653001701641700002401658700001401682700002001696700001401716700001701730700002001747773011401767856008501881852000901966655001201975IND60610711920221121033548.0180829e20170305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061071192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Chang-Gu10aArsenic(V) removal using an amine-doped acrylic ion exchange fiber: Kinetic, equilibrium, and regeneration studies  ap. 223-229.  aThis study investigates As(V) removal from aqueous solutions using a novel amine-doped acrylic ion exchange fiber. The amine doping reaction was confirmed using FT-IR, and the surface of the fiber was characterized using FEG-SEM.

As(V) adsorption on the fiber was rapid in the first 20min and reached equilibrium in 60min. As(V) removal followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the Redlich-Peterson adsorption isotherm model provided the best fit of the equilibrium data. The fiber has an As(V) adsorption capacity (qe) of 205.32±3.57mg/g, which is considerably higher than literature values and commercial adsorbents.

A half-space cooling (HSC) model can reproduce seafloor topography and heat flux data for younger seafloor, but for older seafloor the observations show reduced variations with the age in comparison with the HSC model predictions. The deviation was attributed to the sub-lithospheric small-scale (SSC) convection first by Parsons and McKenzie (1978). While there is little doubt that the SSC can enhance heat flux at relatively old seafloor, questions were raised as to whether or not the SSC can actually lead to a reduced topography. In this study, the effects of SSC on seafloor topography and heat flux are investigated by formulating a 2-D thermal convection model that is parallel to plate motion. Instead of using closed boundary conditions, which will bring large pressure effects because of return flow, a flow through boundary condition is adopted. The results show that although the SSC enhances the surface heat flux, it has little effects on topography for the fluids with a more realistic rheology. The reason for this is that the SSC transports the heat from the bottom to the top and cools down the whole fluids, and with the existence of a stagnant lid, the whole effects on topography are negligible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3arheology 3atopography1 aShijie, Zhong0 tChinese science bulletin.g2004 Nov., v. 49, no. 21 p.2311-2317dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1360/04wd0141  aDNAL 7aarticle02155naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010300157300001800260520110200278592002801380650001301408650001201421650001601433650001701449650001101466650001501477650000901492650001101501650002401512650002501536700002301561700002001584773010501604856007501709852000901784655001201793IND60533970120221119105850.0160802e20121220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053397012DNAL7 a10.1021/ef301283c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, Rex T.
L.10aSimultaneous Process Synthesis, Heat and Power Integration in a Sustainable Integrated Biorefinery  ap. 7316-7330.  aAn integrated biorefinery is a processing facility that converts biomass feedstocks into a wide range of value added products (e.g., biofuels, specialty chemicals) via multiple technologies. To synthesize a sustainable integrated biorefinery, consumption of energy within such biorefinery should be self-sustained. The performances of integrated biorefinery can be improved via simultaneous process synthesis, heat and power integration. Due to the complexity of the process synthesis and integration problem, there is a need for a systematic approach to address the problem. In this work, the modular optimization approach, which breaks a large optimization problem into small models, is adapted to solve the complex problem. This allows engineers to ‘zoom in’ on specific key process units in a smaller model. Based on the proposed approach, selection of the optimum process alternatives/technologies and products, as well as integration of heat and power between process units, can be performed simultaneously. To illustrate the capability of proposed approach, two case studies are solved.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acase studies 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3aheat 3amodels 3asystem optimization 3avalue-added products1 aTay, Douglas H.

Avian populations are indicators of wetland health, and understanding their responses to extreme events can aid in targeting restoration efforts following disturbance. Here, we assessed the habitat selection of six coastal wetland bird species (American Bittern, Black-crowned Night Heron, Great Egret, Glossy Ibis, Snowy Egret, Yellow-crowned Night Heron) related to an extreme weather event, Hurricane Sandy. We used Discrete Choice Resource Selection Functions to estimate habitat selection. Results showed species probability of use increased with lower elevation and slope, and closer proximity to marsh, salt marsh, Phragmites, and protected areas. Estimates of marsh dieback from Hurricane Sandy occurred disproportionately in areas with higher probability of species use. Species were observed farther from the coast and at higher elevations in the four breeding seasons after (2013–2016) compared to before (2000–2012) Hurricane Sandy. Our results indicate that although high suitability areas were affected by the storm, these six wetland bird species may have responded by moving inland and to higher elevation. Understanding how coastal wetland birds respond to storm events is important for conservation planning, particularly as storm frequency is projected to increase in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArdea alba 3aBotaurus lentiginosus 3aEgretta thula 3aNyctanassa violacea 3aNycticorax nycticorax 3aPhragmites 3aPlegadis falcinellus 3abirds 3acoasts 3adieback 3aecosystems 3ahabitat preferences 3ahurricanes 3aprobability 3asalt marshes 3awater purification 3awildlife habitats1 aBeerens, James M.1 aRomañach, Stephanie S.,0 tWetlands.g2020 Aug., v. 40, no. 4 p.799-810dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl57834x0277-52127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-019-01230-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002800166245014400194300001800338520149700356592002801853650001401881650001201895650001801907650001201925650002901937650003101966650001801997653001202015653001902027653003102046653001102077700001402088700001802102700002002120700002102140700002002161700001802181700002002199773013802219856008102357852000902438655001202447IND60654887920221119001203.0190726e20161114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065488792DNAL7 a277886962pmid7 a10.1017/S000711451600369X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcHugh Power, Joanna E.10aRelAte: pilot study of the effects of a mealtime intervention on social cognitive factors and energy intake among older adults living alone  ap. 1573-1581.  aMealtime interventions typically focus on institutionalised older adults, but we wanted to investigate whether they may also be effective among those living independently.

Treatment group participants received a weekly visit from a trained volunteer who prepared and shared a meal with them. Participants in the treatment group showed improvements relative to those in the control group at borderline significance (P=0·054) for self-efficacy and at significance for food enjoyment. Significant improvements were observed in female participants in the treatment but not in the control group in energy intake (although following corrections for multiple comparisons, only the effect on food enjoyment remained significant). These findings will inform the design of future complex interventions. For this type of intervention to be successful, more focus has to be placed on making interventions more personalised, potentially according to sex. Findings are important for nutritional sciences as they indicate that, in order to improve energy intake and food enjoyment among older adults, multimodal nutritional interventions including social components may be successful.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3aelderly 3aenergy intake 3afemales 3anutritional intervention 3arandomized clinical trials 3aself-efficacy 0aDietary 0aSocial support 0aActivities of daily living 0aAgeing1 aLee, Olga1 aAspell, Niamh1 aMcCormack, Emma1 aLoftus, Michelle1 aConnolly, Leona1 aLawlor, Brian1 aBrennan, Sabina0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2016 Nov. 14, v. 116, no. 9 p.1573-1581dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000711451600369X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245014700155300001800302520135200320592002801672650001101700650003001711650001501741650001301756650001401769651001001783700001701793700001801810700001901828700001401847773010201861856003901963852000902002655001202011IND50068011020221121235720.0130721e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006801102DNAL7 a10.1360/04wd02012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiming, Fan10aAr-Ar and U-Pb geochronology of Late Paleozoic basalts in western Guangxi and its constraints on the eruption age of Emeishan basalt magmatism  ap. 2318-2327.  aThe Late Paleozoic layered or stratoid-layered basalts in western Guangxi have similar elemental and isotopic compositions to Emeishan high-Ti basalts. Whole-rock ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar and SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dating were carried out for the representative basalt samples in three typical profiles in the area. Three basalts from the upper segment of Yangxu profile and lower segment of Yufeng and Min’an profiles yield the ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar plateau ages of 253.6/+-0.4 Ma (20BS-71), 255.4±0.4 Ma (20BS-99) and 256.2±0.8 Ma (20BS-119), respectively. Twenty-three analyses on 23 zircons of the basalt from the upper segment of Yangxu profile give a weighted mean ²⁰⁶Pb/²³⁸U age of 253.7 ±6.1 Ma with an MSWD = 2.8. These new and published geochronological data for Emeishan large igneous province (LIP) indicate that the Emeishan LIP was initiated at ∼260 Ma, voluminously erupted between 253 and 256 Ma, and possibly ended at ∼251–253 Ma: The age (251–260 Ma) is generally consistent with that of the associated environmental deterioration and mass extinction events at the end-Guadalupian and Permo-Triassic boundary. These precise geochronological data provide important constraints on the dominantly eruptive time of the Emeisban LIP and understanding of the distribution of Emeishan high-Ti basalts and its mantle plume dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3aenvironmental degradation 3aextinction 3aplateaus 3azirconium 3aChina1 aYuejun, Wang1 aTouping, Peng1 aLaicheng, Miao1 aFeng, Guo0 tChinese science bulletin.g2004 Nov., v. 49, no. 21 p.2318-2327dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1360/04wd0201  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015300164300001400317500001900331520125400350592002801604650001501632650002301647650001701670650002001687650002801707650002101735650002801756650001201784650002001796650002201816650001501838650001401853650001701867650001101884650001301895653002101908653002601929653002101955653002201976700001601998700001902014700001502033700001902048700001402067700001902081700001302100700001602113773013802129856008302267852000902350655001202359IND60715919420221118042158.0210108e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071591942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.10.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Minying10aPolylysine-modified MXene nanosheets with highly loaded glucose oxidase as cascade nanoreactor for glucose decomposition and electrochemical sensing  ap. 20-29.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTwo-dimensional (2D) nanoreactors with cascade catalytic activity for glucose oxidation and hydrogen peroxide decomposition are prepared via immobilizing glucose oxidase (GOx) on Ti₃C₂ MXene nanosheets. Amino-rich polypeptide, poly-l-lysine (PLL), is applied to modify the ultra-thin Ti₃C₂ MXene nanosheets with a compatible surface for GOx immobilization. The PLL-modified Ti₃C₂ nanosheets possess a positively charged surface and show an excellent GOx loading capacity as high as 50 wt% of the Ti₃C₂ nanosheets. The physically adsorbed enzymes are then cross-linked with the amine groups in the PLL chains to form a robust GOx-PLL network covered on the MXene nanosheets. The GOx-conjugated Ti₃C₂-PLL (Ti₃C₂-PLL-GOx) nanosheets showed superior enzymatic activities than the activities of GOx immobilized on an inert porous silica substrate, largely because that the Ti₃C₂ nanosheets can catalyze the decomposition of the toxic intermediate H₂O₂ generated from the glucose oxidation. Given the excellent electrical conductivity of Ti₃C₂ MXene, the Ti₃C₂-PLL-GOx nanosheets are further deposited on glassy carbon electrode to construct a high-performance biosensor with a glucose detection limit of 2.6 μM.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acatalytic activity 3acrosslinking 3adetection limit 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3apolypeptides 3asilica 3atoxicity 0aTi3C2 nanosheets 0aEnzyme immobilization 0aCascade reaction 0aGlucose biosensor1 aZhang, Qian1 aFang, Yuanyuan1 aDeng, Chao1 aZhou, Fangzhou1 aZhang, Yi1 aWang, Xingdong1 aTang, Yi1 aWang, Yajun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 586 p.20-29dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.10.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245007000169300001400239506002800253520132200281592002801603506003701631650001801668650001501686650001101701650001601712650001601728650001201744650001201756650001401768650002001782650001001802653001901812653002001831700001801851700002201869700001801891700001401909773020501923856008902128852000902217655001202226IND60774155720221207140901.0180524e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077415572DNAL7 a10.17721/1728_2748.2015.70.38-412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlyska, A.14aThe relationship of obesity and inflammatory intestinal reactions  ap. 38-41.  aResource is Open Access  aResearched biopsy of the small intestine in control person (derived from the injuries of the small intestine) and in the conditions Islands surgical treatment of morbid obesity.

Eight aliphatic glucosinolates, four indole glucosinolates, and one aromatic glucosinolate were identified and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results showed that glucoraphanin, glucobrassicin, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin were present in all samples. However, the predominant type of glucosinolate was different among pure lines. The anti-cancer glucoraphanin concentration ranged from 0.06 to 24.17μmol/g in pure lines and from 1.57 to 5.95μmol/g in commercial cultivars. The progoitrin concentration in commercial cultivars varied from 1.77 to 6.07μmol/g with a mean value of 3.20μmol/g. Significant variations were observed in the concentration of individual glucosinolates and in each class of glucosinolates among broccoli populations. Dozens of specific lines with altered glucosinolate profiles, as well as ten good candidates for breeding high-chemoprotective glucosinolate cultivars, were obtained according to the putative glucosinolate pathway in broccoli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea 3abroccoli 3acultivars 3aflorets 3aglucobrassicin 3aglucoraphanin 3agreenhouses 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aprogoitrin 3aChina1 aGu, Honghui1 aYu, Huifang1 aZhao, Zhenqing1 aSheng, Xiaoguang1 aZhang, Xiaohui0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 133, no. 3 p.735-741dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.01.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024002200120024001900142040001800161100002000179245006000199300001800259506007600277520108200353592002801435506003701463650002501500650002401525651001101549651001001560651001401570700001601584700001801600700001601618700001401634700001401648773010201662856003901764852000901803655001201812IND50068011220221207103317.0130721e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006801122DNAL7 a10.1360/04we00732doi7 aPMC70894782pmcid7 a322147152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuanghong, Ding10aSARS epidemical forecast research in mathematical model  ap. 2332-2338.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe SIJR model, simplified from the SEIJR model, is adopted to analyze the important parameters of the model of SARS epidemic such as the transmission rate, basic reproductive number. And some important parameters are obtained such as the transmission rate by applying this model to analyzing the situation in Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada at the outbreak of SARS. Then forecast of the transmission of SARS is drawn out here by the adjustment of parameters (such as quarantined rate) in the model. It is obvious that inflexion lies on the crunode of the graph, which indicates the big difference in transmission characteristics between the epidemic under control and not under control. This model can also be used in the comparison of the control effectiveness among different regions. The results from this model match well with the actual data in Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada and as a by-product, the index of the effectiveness of control in the later period can be acquired. It offers some quantitative indexes, which may help the further research in epidemic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adisease transmission 3amathematical models 3aCanada 3aChina 3aSingapore1 aZhang, Liu,1 aJianqiu, Gong1 aWang, Ling,1 aKe, Cheng1 aDi, Zhang0 tChinese science bulletin.g2004 Nov., v. 49, no. 21 p.2332-2338dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1360/04we0073  aDNAL 7aarticle01267naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245007300160300001800233520028100251592002800532650002300560650004400583650001700627650001500644650001900659700001700678700002600695700002300721773012800744856007200872852000900944655001200953IND60657385920221116233741.0190816e20030530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065738592DNAL7 a10.1039/b302071a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnstone, Ken D.12aA self-assembling polymer-bound rotaxane under thermodynamic control  ap. 1396-1397.  aThe thermodynamically controlled self-assembly of a neutral donor–acceptor rotaxane, stoppered via porphyrin coordination and bound to polystyrene beads is described, and the dynamic equilibrium between solid and solution phases has been examined by HR MAS nmr spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolystyrenes 3aporphyrins 3athermodynamics1 aBampos, Nick1 aSanders, Jeremy K.

Specimens of P. hippeastri from bromeliads contained males which were not detected in the type population from amaryllis and are described herein for the first time. The rDNA sequences of these males matched those of P. hippeastri female type material. Pratylenchus hippeastri and root-lesion nematodes from several hosts in Florida were characterised at the morphological and molecular level, whereas other samples from Russia and South Africa were characterised at the molecular level only. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis using the ITS rRNA gene of these root-lesion nematodes revealed the presence of eight putative new species (spH1-H8) closely related to P. hippeastri. Here we describe two Florida representatives of the amphimictic root-lesion nematodes from Bahia grass (N1) and maidencane (N2), previously characterised by Inserra et al. in 1996 and Duncan et al. in 1999, as two new species phylogenetically related to P. hippeastri and named P. floridensis n. sp. and P. parafloridensis n. sp., respectively. The small round or oval (rarely rectangular and occasionally oblong) and enlarged spermatheca and the bluntly pointed or subacute tail with smooth and occasionally indented terminus separate P. floridensis n. sp. from P. parafloridensis n. sp., which has a quadrangular spermatheca and a subhemispherical or bluntly pointed tail with generally smooth and rarely indented terminus. However, these characters may overlap in some specimens making a morphological separation problematic without the use of molecular analysis. The close phylogenetic relationships shared by the species characterised in this study indicate that they are representatives of a P. hippeastri species complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGuzmania 3aNeoregelia 3aPaspalum notatum 3aPratylenchus 3aRussia 3aVriesea 3afemales 3agenes 3anematology 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aroot lesion nematodes 3aspermatheca 3atail 3aFlorida 3aSouth Africa 0aPANICUM HEMITOMON 0aMAIDENCANE 0aMORPHOMETRICS 0aBAHIA GRASS 0aMOLECULAR 0aSPECIES COMPLEX 0aFRAXINUS CAROLINIANA 0aPOP ASH 0aMORPHOLOGY 0aCALLISTEMON RIGIDUS 0aBOTTLEBRUSH 0aST AUGUSTINE GRASS 0aTAXONOMY1 aTroccoli, Alberto1 aDuncan, Larry W.1 aSubbotin, Sergei A.1 aWaeyenberge, Lieven1 aMoens, Maurice1 aInserra, Renato N.0 tNematology.g, v. 12, no. 6 p.847-868dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/138855410X4958093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001500151245016000166300001600326520161900342592002801961650001501989650001102004650001502015650001402030650001502044650001102059650001102070650001602081650001602097650001502113650001102128651001202139700001502151700001702166700002002183700001602203773011202219856008702331852000902418655001202427IND4447605020221117205053.0150810e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444760502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2010.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPisek, Jan10aComparison of methods for measuring gap size distribution and canopy nonrandomness at Järvselja RAMI (RAdiation transfer Model Intercomparison) test sites  ap. 365-377.  aMethods for analyzing foliage nonrandomness by means of the TRAC instrument, digital hemispheric photography, and a gap fraction model are assessed at two RAMI (RAdiation transfer Model Intercomparison) mature stands in Järvselja, Estonia. The six different methods involve calculation of the canopy element clumping index, at scales coarser than that of a shoot. The major aim was to define the merits and limitations of the various methods. We conclude the gap size distribution and beyond-shoot clumping is very stable across the stands for the solar zenith angle range from 30° to 60°. Estimates based on the gap size distribution and the combination of gap size and logarithm methods performed the best while compared with an independent gap fraction model. We clarify the effect of the assumed leaf inclination angle distribution on gap size distribution and differences between estimates of beyond-shoot clumping. We show that the modified, gap-size distribution based method of Chen and Cihlar can provide reliable beyond-shoot clumping estimates without any a priori assumptions about the total gap fraction, segment length or the leaf inclination angle distribution. We also illustrate the changes in element clumping with measurement height. The compiled data extend the original parameter dataset to be used in the next phase of RAMI for different benchmark tests and reflectance modeling experiments, and contribute toward systematic validation efforts of radiative transfer models, operational algorithms, and field instruments, as promoted by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acanopy 3acommittees 3aequipment 3aleaf angle 3aleaves 3amodels 3aphotography 3areflectance 3asatellites 3ashoots 3aEstonia1 aLang, Mait1 aNilson, Tiit1 aKorhonen, Lauri1 aKaru, Helen0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 151, no. 3 p.365-377dElsevier B.V.x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2010.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245014100161300001600302520151300318592002801831650002101859650001401880650001901894650002201913650002301935650001401958650001901972650001901991650001302010650002402023650002102047650002602068653001702094653002302111653002802134653001202162653002002174653001402194700001702208700001802225700001702243700001602260700001702276700001602293700005402309700001702363700001202380773012502392856008302517852000902600655001202609IND60674098620221121073400.0200228e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067409862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Qi10aPhotocatalytic reduction for graphene oxide by PbTiO3 with high polarizability and its electrocatalytic application in pyrrole detection  ap. 502-509.  aQuick recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in photocatalytic process remains a huge challenge. And the routine efforts are concentrated on heterojunction, metal decoration and surface defect strategies. PbTiO₃ as a typical perovskite ferroelectrics is with a strong built-inelectric field as self-junction caused by internal spontaneous polarization, facilitating the charge separation in the photocatalytic process. Here, under UV irradiation, L-shaped PbTiO₃ with active (1 1 0) facet as a photocatalyst was applied to photo-reduce graphene oxide (GO), where a specific reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/PbTiO₃ composite was synthesized in presence of isopropanol, a hole-trapping agent. According to the linear optical properties, the polarizability of PbTiO₃ is calculated to 1.01 × 10⁻²³ cm³ (2.68 times that of P25 (TiO₂)), inducing the photo-excited charge separation by PbTiO₃. Based on XPS characterization, a TiOC chemical bond is identified on the interface between rGO and PbTiO₃. The response peak current for an electrochemical sensor based on rGO/PbTiO₃ was proportional to the concentration of pyrrole (6.6 × 10⁻⁹–3.1 × 10⁻⁷ M, R² = 0.999), and an extremely low limit reaches to 2.38 × 10⁻⁹ M. In addition, polypyrrole during the pyrrole detection was realized by the multi-cycle oxidation process. And also, the electrochemical detection has been successfully applied for the pyrrole quantification in real samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3agraphene oxide 3aisopropyl alcohol 3aoptical properties 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apyrroles 3asensors (equipment) 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 0aLeadtitanate 0aHighpolarizability 0aPhotocatalyticreduction 0aPyrrole 0aElectrochemical 0aDetection1 aWeng, Xuehua1 aXie, Wenqiang1 aYing, Meihui1 aLin, Xucong1 aDai, Yongwei1 aYu, Qunying1 aPan, Haibo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1273-04331 aLiu, Junshao1 aDu, Min0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 560 p.502-509dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245012000178300001600298520142200314592002801736650002001764650001601784650001301800650002301813650000901836650001901845650001801864650001101882650002701893650002701920653002501947653003301972653001302005653002402018653002002042700003502062700002602097773010102123856008602224852000902310655001202319IND60541789020221122082613.0190319e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054178902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2014.09.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez-Sabatel, Saioa10aImpact of high pressure homogenisation (HPH) on inulin gelling properties, stability and development during storage  ap. 333-344.  aThe impact of different high pressure homogenisation (HPH) treatments on long-chain inulin gelling properties was investigated. Magnetic stirred inulin-water dispersions (6, 9 and 12 wt% inulin) were subjected to rotor-stator homogenisation at 5000 rpm during 5 min and high pressure homogenised at 103, 207 or 296 MPa with two different homogeniser configurations and for a single cycle. The results obtained from backscattering, water holding capacity and rheological measurements demonstrated HPH reduced the critical minimum concentration needed to obtain homogeneous gel structures to 9 wt% inulin. The ability of HPH processing to disperse inulin particles and reduce agglomerates sizes with increasing pressures improved the inulin crystallisation behaviour, inducing the development of stronger interactions and consequently improving the development of the particulate gel. However, the application of very high homogenisation pressures at 296 MPa, negatively affected the gel structure and yielded weaker gels with poorer water retention capacities. The after-valve homogenising cell (HC) configuration had also an impact on the inulin-water dispersions gelling properties. The HC lengthening produced, in general, stronger and more water retaining gels. The combination of processing parameters (pressure level and HC configurations) could be used to obtain gels with specific rheological properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3adispersions 3agelation 3agelling properties 3agels 3ahomogenization 3ahydrocolloids 3ainulin 3arheological properties 3awater holding capacity 0aInulin concentration 0aHigh pressure homogenisation 0aGelation 0aInulin crystal size 0aWater retention1 aMarañón, Iñigo Martínez de1 aArboleya, Juan-Carlos0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2015 Feb., v. 44 p.333-344dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2014.09.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245012900213300001600342520159700358592002801955596004501983596004502028650001002073650001202083650002002095650001502115650001002130650001502140650001502155650001602170650001702186650001502203700005602218700006402274700006402338700003002402700003202432700006902464700006402533700006902597700005702666700006002723773012802783856008202911852000902993655001203002IND60750062420221118113320.0210910e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075006242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11829-021-09856-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabelo, Raiane Serejo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8579-964810aTritrophic interaction diversity in gallery forests: A biologically rich and understudied component of the Brazilian cerrado  ap. 773-785.  aCreating robust datasets of plant–insect interactions is important for understanding ecosystem dynamics, and data on species interactions can be used to evaluate conservation interventions. In the present work, we collected plant–herbivore–parasitoid data on an understudied but critical ecosystem—gallery forests in the Brazilian cerrado. We collected caterpillars on shrubs of Piper (Piperaceae) over the course of a year in seven gallery forests of varying sizes in order to compare seasonal changes in α- and β- diversity and tritrophic interaction networks as well as the role of fragment size in determining species and interaction diversity. Caterpillars were more abundant and diverse in the wet season and also increased with resource availability—the more Piper individuals present, the greater the abundance and richness of herbivores. The number of unique interactions between (i) plants and herbivores and (ii) herbivores and parasitoids did not change across seasons, but there was a high degree of turnover in the herbivore fauna between sites and seasons. Specialization was greatest in the dry-rainy season transition, when new leaves typically flush. Consistent with records of parasitism rates in the cerrado sensu stricto, parasitism in the gallery forests was greatest in the dry-rainy seasons. Forest size was not related to caterpillar richness. Overall, this work demonstrates the conservation value of gallery forests in supporting plant species that span the Amazon and the Atlantic Rainforest as well as diverse and highly seasonal trophic interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB-1442103cNational Science Foundation  aDEB-1442075cNational Science Foundation 3aPiper 3acerrado 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3afauna 3aherbivores 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3arain forests 3awet season1 aDyer, Lee A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0867-88741 aLepesqueur, Cíntia,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8085-06831 aSalcido, Danielle M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6970-73871 ada Silva, Thayane Pereira1 aRodrigues, Hanna Pâmela A.1 aTrindade, Tácito Barbosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5392-40881 aDiniz, Ivone Rezende1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4252-88101 aNascimento, André Rangel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2284-58241 aTepe, Eric J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8493-07361 aMassad, Tara Joy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7669-33120 tArthropod-plant interactions.g2021 Oct., v. 15, no. 5 p.773-785dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl4130426x1872-88557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11829-021-09856-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245017300168300001600341520131900357592002801676650001701704650001701721650001301738650001101751650000901762650001501771650001501786650001101801650002101812650002101833650001501854651001101869700001701880700001901897700002301916700001801939700002201957700002001979700002201999700001902021700005902040773012802099856008202227961001202309852000902321655001202330IND60750062520221118113414.0210910e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075006252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11829-021-09847-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordeiro, J.

Eichler (Combretaceae) in a Brazilian seasonally dry tropical forest  ap. 737-745.  aThiloa glaucocarpa is a toxic plant as a food item for bovine cattle. However, dry leaves are frequently collected to cultivate the symbiotic fungi of several colonies of Atta sexdens throughout the Caatinga Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest biome in Brazil and such behavior is not clear. In this study, we analyzed the removal of T. glaucocarpa leaves for A. sexdens and tested the hypothesis that the preference for removal of dry leaf material over fresh leaves may be related to the decay of chemical defenses. Dried leaf discs of T. glaucocarpa were offered to laboratory-raised colonies of A. sexdens. Overall, there was a lower consumption of T. glaucocarpa than the previous report, but it is possible to observe a preference for mature and fresh leaves removal, contradicting initial predictions. Probably, the removal of dried leaves is a specific solution learned by natural colonies to reduce the number of secondary compounds and guarantee diet availability in a highly seasonal and food-poor environment. The preference for mature leaves is not usual and is probably the result of a higher production of secondary compounds in young leaves, which could guarantee protection for leaves against herbivory in early rains and improve the productivity of T. glaucocarpa at the beginning of the rainy season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtta sexdens 3aCombretaceae 3acaatinga 3acattle 3adiet 3aecosystems 3aherbivores 3aleaves 3apoisonous plants 3atropical forests 3awet season 3aBrazil1 aCosta, I.

Comprehensive gene analyses have, however, made little progress. This is because of the diploid and asexual characteristics of the fungus that hamper gene disruptions. In this study, we found that ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, as well as mutagen treatment, strongly stimulated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in strains harboring artificially constructed heterozygosity. UV-induced LOH occurred more frequently in cells within the logarithmic phase of growth compared to those within the stationary phase of growth. This was observed at all loci tested on chromosome 7, except for a locus neighboring the centromere. C. albicans RAD52, whose orthologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was reported to be involved in DNA repair by homologous recombination, was shown to be required for UV-induced LOH. These results suggest that high efficiency LOH caused by UV irradiation could be a prominent tool for gene analyses in C. albicans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aDNA repair 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3acentromeres 3adiploidy 3agenes 3aheterozygosity 3airradiation 3aloci 3amutagenicity 3aultraviolet radiation 2aCandida albicansxdrug effectsxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aLoss of Heterozygosity 2aMutagensxpharmacology 2aRad52 DNA Repair and Recombination Proteinxgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aUltraviolet Rays1 aAkada, Rinji1 aKumagai, Hidehiko1 aYamamoto, Kenji1 aTamaki, Hisanori0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2008 Jan., v. 77, no. 5 p.1073-1082dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-007-1252-x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02862naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013200174300001600306520127500322592002801597650001501625650001601640650000901656650001201665650001401677650000901691650001101700650001801711650000901729650001901738650001301757650002001770650002001790650001001810650001801820650001401838653002401852653003501876653004401911653003001955700002301985700002702008700001802035700003302053700006202086773010102148856008602249852000902335655001202344IND60541789220221122082628.0190319e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054178922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2014.09.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShelat, Kinnari J.10aRheology and microstructure characterisation of small intestinal digesta from pigs fed a red meat-containing Western-style diet  ap. 300-308.  aA method to characterise rheological and microstructure features of whole digesta collected from pigs fed meat-containing western style diets is described. Digesta are shown to contain suspensions of meat fibre particles up to 300 μm in size which exhibit weak gel behaviour, have a dynamic viscosity higher than steady shear viscosity indicative of structural breakdown at the initiation of flow, and shear thinning behaviour under steady shear. The power law index approach is useful for capturing the overall features of rheological behaviour under both small (n*<0.3) and large deformation (typically 0.2 < n < 0.5) conditions. Values obtained for rheological parameters represent a balance between the digestion of structural components (meat particles and starch granules in this case) with the absorption of water along the small intestine, and result in the absence of any systematic pattern as a function of small intestinal site. Both primary rheological data (G′, G″, η, η*) and power law index parameters show a high level of variability between animals fed identical diets. This study provides a baseline from which to investigate the in vivo effects of hydrocolloids on the rheology of porcine digesta from diets representative of human meals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adeformation 3adiet 3adigesta 3adigestion 3agels 3ahumans 3ahydrocolloids 3ameat 3amicrostructure 3arheology 3asmall intestine 3astarch granules 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3aviscosity 0aRheology of digesta 0aPhysical properties of digesta 0aViscoelastic characteristics of digesta 0aMicrostructure of digesta1 aNicholson, Timothy1 aFlanagan, Bernadine M.1 aZhang, Dagong1 aWilliams, Barbara A.

To test the efficacy of this approach to isolate promoters for directing high levels of gene expression in sugarcane, 11 genomic clones were isolated after screening a sugarcane genomic library with radioactively labeled first strand cDNA probes synthesized from sugarcane leaf mRNA. Hybridization analysis with pooled first strand cDNA indicated that eight of the clones probably contain genes with expression levels similar to or higher than ubiquitin (which was also isolated in this screen). The coding regions of these 11 genomic clones were isolated from a cDNA library, sequenced, and found to represent parts of five different genes including elongation factor 1α, α-tubulin, an aquaporin, a proline-rich protein, and one novel gene. Southern and Northern results showed that the sugarcane proline-rich protein-encoding gene (SPRP1) was the best candidate to isolate a promoter that would direct high levels of expression, although the other four are also good candidates. Two genomic clones of the sugarcane proline-rich gene and a sugarcane elongation factor 1α (SEF1α) gene, which contain both the promoter and coding regions, were subcloned, sequenced, and promoter regions defined by comparison of cDNA and genomic DNA sequences. Both the SEF1α and SPRP1 promoter/β-glucuronidase (GUS) fusions resulted in high levels of GUS expression when reintroduced into embryogenic sugarcane callus, and also resulted in high levels of transient GUS expression in wheat embryos. This approach has value as an efficient technique to find promoters that confer high-level gene expression in monocots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLiliopsida 3aaquaporins 3acDNA libraries 3acallus 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenomic libraries 3ahybridization 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3apromoter regions 3ascreening 3asugarcane 3atubulin 3aubiquitin 3awheat1 aBower, Robert1 aBurow, Mark D.1 aPaterson, Andrew H.1 aMirkov, T.

The main purpose of this study was to assess the effect of phytoaugmentation with the rhizobacteria Agromyces sp., Streptomyces sp., and the combination of each of them with the fungus Cadophora finlandica on biomass production and the accumulation of selected trace elements (Zn, Cd, Fe) and macronutrients (Ca, K, P and Mg) in Salix caprea grown on a moderately polluted soil. Dry matter production was significantly enhanced only upon inoculation with Agromyces sp. Regarding the phytoextraction of Cd and Zn, shoot concentrations were mostly increased after inoculation with Streptomyces sp. and Agromyces sp. + C. finlandica. These two treatments also showed higher translocation factors from roots to the leaves for both Cd and Zn. The accumulation of Cd and Zn in shoots was related to increased concentrations of K. This suggests that microorganisms that contribute to enhanced phytoextraction of Cd and Zn affect also the solubility and thus phytoavailability of K. This study suggests that the phytoextraction of Zn and Cd can be improved by inoculation with selected microbial strains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgromyces 3aSalix caprea 3aStreptomyces 3abiomass production 3adry matter accumulation 3afungi 3aleaves 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3arhizosphere 3arhizosphere bacteria 3aroots 3ashoots 3asolubility 3atrace elements 2aActinomycetalesxphysiology 2aAscomycotaxphysiology 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiomass 2aCadmiumxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aPlant Shootsxmetabolism 2aRhizosphere 2aSalixxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aSoil Pollutantsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aStreptomycesxphysiology 2aTrace Elementsxmetabolism 2aZincxisolation & purificationxmetabolism.1 aRivelli, Anna R.1 aKuffner, Melanie1 aSessitsch, Angela1 aWenzel, Walter W.1 aGorfer, Markus1 aStrauss, Joseph1 aPuschenreiter, Markus0 tChemosphere.g2011 Aug., v. 84, no. 9 p.1256-1261dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006300155245012100218520177400339592002802113650001502141650001502156650001202171650002502183650002102208650002002229650000902249650003102258650002002289650002102309650001102330650001902341650001502360650001702375650001502392650002302407650000802430650002202438650001302460650001602473650001502489653001902504653002102523653001802544700002002562700006502582700002202647700002802669700006502697773009102762856009002853852000902943655001202952IND60755798820221116202726.0220124e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075579882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1327882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaikh, Wasim Akram1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0931-345210aBiochar-based nanocomposite from waste tea leaf for toxic dye removal: From facile fabrication to functional fitness  aThe present study utilized discarded tea leaf waste to produce ‘Tea leaf biochar’ (TLB) as the functional matrix for the fabrication of hybrid nanocomposite (nAg-TC), with colloidal deposition of silver nanoparticles (nAg) via modified chemical co-precipitation, for treatment of dye-laden wastewater. The chemical composition, physicochemical properties, and morphology of nAg-TC, and active surface functional groups involved in adsorption were identified using BET, FESEM-EDX, FTIR, TGA, XPS, and XRD. The nAg-TC matrix was found to be heterogeneous, mesoporous, thermostable, with rich in active surface functional groups (-OH, =NH, =CH, CC, CO, CN, and CC), and nAg as a dopant material. The dye adsorption results indicated the maximum removal efficiency (RhB = 95.89%, CR = 94.10%) at 300 K for rhodamine B (RhB) and Congo red (CR) concentrations of 25 mg L⁻¹ and 22.5 mg L⁻¹, respectively. The present investigation agreed with Freundlich isotherm (R²CR:0.991; R²RₕB:0.993) and pseudo-second order kinetic (R²CR:0.999; R²RₕB:0.999) model, indicating overall adsorption of RhB and CR through spontaneous and exothermic chemisorption on the heterogeneous surface of nAg-TC. The mechanism of RhB and CR adsorption was complex where nAg-TC, possessing the synergistic effects of TLB and nAg, showed surface complexation, electrostatic attraction, and H-bonding, leading to chemisorption. Study showed excellent reusability of spent nAg-TC, and commendable treatment efficiency for dye-laden real industrial effluents. The study exhibits substantial techno-economic feasibility of adsorbent and translates the principles of circular economy into synthesis of value-added products through sustainable management of biowaste and bioresource.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3achemical composition 3acircular economy 3acoprecipitation 3adyes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aheat production 3ahydrogen bonding 3aleaves 3ananocomposites 3ananosilver 3aporous media 3arhodamines 3asorption isotherms 3atea 3athermal stability 3atoxicity 3avalue added 3awastewater 0aWaste tea leaf 0aModified biochar 0aNanocomposite1 aKumar, Abhishek1 aChakraborty, Sukalyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6702-72381 aIslam, Rafique Ul1 aBhattacharya, Tanushree1 aBiswas, Jayanta Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4003-87540 tChemosphere.g2022 Mar., v. 291 p.132788-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1327883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005700137245015300194300001600347500002000363520181100383592002802194596005902222596002302281650002102304650000802325650001802333650001202351650001402363650001102377650001002388650001002398650001302408650002002421650001802441650004102459700005602500700005702556773012402613856007202737852000902809655001202818IND60762621520221121202607.0220110e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076262152DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.66972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shuning1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4628-370X10aRapid visual detection of benzimidazole resistance in Botrytis cinerea by recombinase polymerase amplification combined with a lateral flow dipstick  ap. 821-830.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Benzimidazole resistance in Botrytis cinerea is related to point mutations in the target β‐tubulin gene (TUB2). Three mutations (E198A, E198K, E198V) at codon 198 account for most of the resistant strains. A rapid on‐site diagnostic assay would be useful to detect the presence and monitor further spread of this resistance mechanism. RESULTS: A recombinase polymerase amplification combined with lateral flow detection (RPA–LFD) method was established for the rapid detection of methyl benzimidazole carbamate (MBC) resistance in B. cinerea. Based on the three mutations at TUB2 codon 198, three sets of RPA–LFD primers were designed, and each of these primer sets was able to specifically amplify the DNA containing its corresponding mutation; no amplification was detected with other mutated or wild‐type DNA. The assay was optimized for specificity and sensitivity and was shown to detect the presence of 2 × 10² copies μl⁻¹ of target DNA per reaction within 10 min. DNA from eight other common fungal species of small fruit did not yield a signal. The system worked well over a wide range of temperatures from 25 to 45°C. Crude DNA obtained from boiled mycelium and conidia of symptomatic fruit could be used as templates, which simplified the assay process. CONCLUSION: This study developed a novel assay based on RPA–LFD for the rapid and equipment‐free detection of MBC‐resistant isolates. In combination with a simple DNA extraction method, the assay could detect B. cinerea MBC‐resistant isolates even without specialized equipment within 30 min. Considering its specificity, stability and simplicity, the RPA–LFD assay could be a promising tool for rapid on‐site diagnosis of fungicide‐resistant isolates. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  cNo. 2019YFD1002000 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aDNA 3abenzimidazole 3aconidia 3aequipment 3afruits 3afungi 3agenes 3amycelium 3apest management 3arapid methods 3arecombinase polymerase amplification1 aYuan, Huizhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5576-32221 aYan, Xiaojing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9946-38270 tPest management science.g2022 Feb., v. 78, no. 2 p.821-830dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.66973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245007300173300001600246520114200262592002801404650001301432650001301445650002401458650001301482650002701495650001501522650001401537653004201551653001401593653001801607653003901625700002001664700001301684700006101697773014001758856008301898852000901981655001201990IND60674098920221121055845.0200228e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067409892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArenas-Gómez, Brisa10aAlignment of worm-like micelles at intermediate and high shear rates  ap. 618-625.  aRheology combined with Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (Rheo-SANS) can determine the local structural order in Worm-Like Micelle (WLM) solutions when the shear rate increases beyond the ending of the gradient shear banding. There, micelles are supposedly aligned, but viscosity reveals a transition regime as the shear rate increases.The mixture of 3-[dimethyl(tetradecyl)azaniumyl]propane-1-sulfonate (TDPS), sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) (R = [SDS]/[TDPS] = 0.55), and a water solution of NaCl (0.2 mol/L), was studied with mechanical rheology and Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) in the quiescent fluid and under flow.The system self-assembles in WLMs and presents gradient shear banding. SANS patterns of the bands formed during the shear banding were obtained in a Couette geometry along the 1–2 plane, as well as the orientation parameter along the gap. At very high shear rates, in the paranematic phase, we found an apparent transition on the flow curves with its corresponding change in the orientation parameter. The origin of this transition is unclear, but we present possible explanations of why we observe it.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3amicelles 3aneutron diffraction 3arheology 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asulfonates 3aviscosity 0aSmall-angle neutron scattering (SANS) 0aRheo-SANS 0aShear banding 0aWormlike micelle orientation order1 aGarza, Cristina1 aLiu, Yun1 aCastillo, Rolando1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1734-93350 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 560 p.618-625dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010200166300001800268520171000286592002801996650000802024650001602032650001302048650001202061650002102073650001802094650001702112650002302129650002402152650002502176650002302201650002002224650001902244650001402263700002102277773012202298856008202420852000902502655001202511IND60616916720221121121250.0181021e200111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061691672DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517501071011112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Seungsin12aA Statistical Model to Predict Pesticide Penetration Through Nonwoven Chemical Protective Fabrics  ap. 1000-1009.  aThe effects of the liquid/fabric surface tension difference, solid volume fraction of fabrics, fabric thickness, and viscosity of pesticide mixture on pesticide penetration of nonwoven fabrics are studied. A predictive statistical model to provide recommendations for selecting chemical protective clothing for pesticide applicators is developed to estimate pesticide penetration through and thermal comfort of nonwoven fabrics. The study involves fourteen commercial nonwovens and eleven pesticide mixtures of atrazine and pendimethalin at different concentrations. Using three mixtures that represent a range of viscosity and surface tension, percentages of pesticide penetration are measured, along with fabric thickness, weight, and air permeability. Statistical analyses help reveal the relationship between liquid/fabric parameters and pesticide penetration. Repellent finished fabrics exhibit extremely low penetration regardless of pesticide mixture or other fabric characteristics, whereas fabric type and pesticide mixture affect the barrier performance of untreated fabrics. For untreated nonwovens, statistical analyses show that pesticide penetration has the highest correlation with the surface tension difference between fabric and pesticide mixture, followed by solid volume fraction and thickness. Protection performance shows a significant negative correlation with air permeability for untreated nonwovens, indicating thermal comfort decreases with increased protection performance. The combination of fabric air permeability and thickness and solid volume fraction can be used when selecting appropriate clothing that offers needed chemical protection while maximizing thermal comfort.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aapplicators 3aatrazine 3aliquids 3anonwoven fabrics 3apendimethalin 3apermeability 3apesticide mixtures 3aprotective clothing 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models 3asurface tension 3atextile fibers 3aviscosity1 aObendorf, S.

Therefore, the study of ingredients interactions that occur during food formulation is necessary to understand the final behavior of food during digestion. This study examined the effects of sodium alginate mixed with a starch solution (3.0 g/100 g) on glucose release during in vitro digestion. To evaluate the effect of alginate, three concentrations were used (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 g/100 g), and the in vitro digestion was carried out in two stages: gastric and intestinal digestion. The glucose release was evaluated by colorimetric. In order to understand the behavior of this mixture, complex index (CI), viscosity analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were performed to study the alginate–starch interaction. The results showed that starch hydrolysis began during intestinal digestion, reaching a hydrolysis percentage of 72% during the first 15 min. A significant reduction in starch hydrolysis was observed when 1.0 and 2.0 g/100 g of sodium alginate was incorporated, with hydrolysis percentages around 55% during the first 15 min. The CI varied from 34.34% to 57.11% when alginate was increased from 0.5 to 2.0 g/100 g. Also, the sodium alginate affected the viscosity which can be attributed to a protector role of alginate on the starch granules that diminishes the swelling and amylose leaching. Through this study it was possible to show the importance of molecular interaction between different ingredients used in food formulation and how these interactions can be relevant in the regulation of the glycemic response in carbohydrate based food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3acolorimetry 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3afoods 3aglucose 3aglycemic control 3aglycemic effect 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrolysis 3ain vitro digestion 3aingredients 3aleaching 3anutritive value 3apotato starch 3asodium alginate 3astarch granules 3aviscosity 0aStarch 0aSodium alginate 0aIn vitro digestion 0aDigestibility1 aMillon, Camila1 aNuñez, Helena1 aPinto, Marlene1 aValencia, Pedro1 aAcevedo, Cristian1 aSimpson, Ricardo0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2015 Feb., v. 44 p.328-332dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2014.08.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245016100206300001600367520137100383592002801754650002301782650001501805650002101820650001501841650000901856650001101865650001801876650001301894653002101907653001501928653002801943653001801971653002301989653002602012653001002038653001002048700002202058700001802080700001802098773012502116856008302241852000902324655001202333IND60674099020221121050100.0200228e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067409902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMella, Massimo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7227-971510aMonte Carlo study of the effects of macroion charge distribution on the ionization and adsorption of weak polyelectrolytes and concurrent counterion release  ap. 667-680.  aAdsorption of weak polyelectrolytes onto charged nanoparticles, and concurrent effects such as spatial partitioning of ions may be influenced by details of the polyelectrolyte structure (linear or star–like) and size, by the mobility of the nanoparticle surface charge, or the valence of the nanoparticle counterions.Ionization and complexation of weak polyelectrolytes on spherical macroions with monovalent and divalent countrions has been studied with constant–pH Monte Carlo titrations and primitive electrolyte models for linear and star–like polymers capable, also, of forming charged hydrogen bonds. Nanoparticles surface charge has been represented either as a single colloid–centered total charge (CCTC) or as surface–tethered mobile monovalent spherical charges (SMMSC).Differences in the average number of adsorbed polyelectrolyte arms and their average charge, and in the relative amount of macroion counterions (m–CI’s) released upon polymer adsorption are found between CCTC and SMMSC nanoparticles. The amount of the counterions released also depends on the polymer structure. As CCTC adsorbs a lower number of star–like species arms, the degree of condensation of polymer counterions (p–CI’s) onto the polyelectrolyte is also substantially higher for the CCTC colloid, with a concurrent decrease of the osmotic coefficient values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aadsorption 3ahydrogen bonding 3aionization 3aions 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apolymers 0aPolyelectrolytes 0aTitrations 0aMonte Carlo simulations 0aNanoparticles 0aPolymer adsorption 0aCounterion desorption 0a00-01 0a99-001 aTagliabue, Andrea1 aMollica, Luca1 aIzzo, Lorella0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 560 p.667-680dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006200155245013400217520161800351592002801969650002301997650002002020650001502040650001602055650003102071650001302102650001402115650001802129650003402147650000902181650002202190650001602212650002002228651001302248651000902261651001102270653001402281653001902295653002002314700002702334700005902361700002102420700002102441773009102462856009002553852000902643655001202652IND60755798920221116202910.0220124e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075579892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1327892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasseghian, Yasser1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6225-627X12aA global systematic review of the concentrations of Malathion in water matrices: Meta-analysis, and probabilistic risk assessment  aPesticide applications and the proximity of land use to water matrices have resulted in discharges of pollutants including Malathion —one of the most widely used organophosphorus pesticides— to water resources such as marine, freshwater, and under groundwater. Exposure to malathion through consumption of contaminated water may cause deleterious health effects on consumers. Determining the amount of pesticides used on farms can play an important role in preventing potential toxicity and pollution of nearby aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis is focused on evaluating the concentrations of Malathion in water resources while considering probabilistic health risk assessment. The international databases of Scopus, Embase, and PubMed were investigated to evaluate the related articles from January 01, 1968 to March 25, 2021. Thirty-four articles containing 206 samples from 15 countries were included. A meta-analysis of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk assessments for Malathion was also performed. To determine uncertainty intervals, a Monte-Carlo simulation was conducted. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the rankings of Malathion pollution (from the most to the least) were: drinking water > surface waters > groundwaters. Moreover, the results of the risk assessments confirm that there is no non-carcinogenic risk for any of the study areas. The carcinogenic risk assessment was within the limit for the countries under this study, except for Ethiopia that was slightly over the limit as well as Iran, and Mexico had high carcinogenic risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3acarcinogenicity 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3ahealth effects assessments 3aland use 3amalathion 3ameta-analysis 3aprobabilistic risk assessment 3arisk 3asystematic review 3auncertainty 3awater pollution 3aEthiopia 3aIran 3aMexico 0aPesticide 0aWater matrices 0aRisk assessment1 aDragoi, Elena-Niculina1 aAlmomani, Fares1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4785-45671 aGolzadeh, Nasrin1 aN.

Next, we apply a recently designed, comprehensive risk evaluation method consisting of a stepwise procedure to evaluate the environmental risks of Harmonia axyridis in Northwest Europe. This resulted in the very clear conclusion that H. axyridis is a potentially risky species for Northwest Europe, because it is able to establish, it has a very wide host range including species from other insect orders and even beyond the class of Insecta, it may feed on plant materials, it can cover large distances (>50 km per year), it does move into non-target areas, it may attack many non-target species including beneficial insects and insects of conservation concern, its activities have resulted in the reduction of populations of native predators in North America, it is known as a nuisance in North America and recently also in Northwest Europe, and it may develop as a pest of fruit in North America. Considering the H. axyridis case, current knowledge would lead to the conclusion that, although the predator is capable to effectively control several pest species, its risks are manifold and it should, thus, not have been released in Northwest Europe. At the time of the first releases in Nortwest Europe in 1995, the available scientific literature made clear that H. axyridis is a large sized polyphagous predator and has a great reproductive capacity in comparison with other ladybird beetles, and that there was a need to study non-target effects because of its polyphagous behaviour. In retrospect, this information should have been sufficient to reject import and release of this species, but it was apparently ignored by those who considered release of this predator in Northwest Europe. The case of Harmonia releases in Northwest Europe underlines that there is an urgent need for harmonized, world-wide regulation of biological control agents, including an information system on risky natural enemy species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHarmonia axyridis 3abeneficial insects 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aenvironmental assessment 3ahost range 3aimports 3ainformation systems 3anatural enemies 3anontarget organisms 3apests 3apredators 3areproductive performance 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aLoomans, Antoon J.

Despite their simplicity, these small pathogens are responsible for significant economic and humanitarian losses that have had dramatic consequences in the course of human history. Since their discovery, scientists have developed different strategies to efficiently detect viruses, using all possible viral features. Viruses shape, proteins, and nucleic acid are used in viral detection. In this review, the development of these techniques, especially for plant and mammalian viruses, their strengths and weaknesses as well as the latest cutting‐edge technologies that may be playing important roles in the years to come are described.  aPublisher supplied data  aEdcGreek state Scholarship (IKY)  aMIS5001552‐Human Resources Development ProgramcGreek state Scholarship (IKY)  aInfrastructures support program[MIS5002803]PlantUPcGeneral Secretary for Research and Technology of Greece 3aDNA 3aRNA 3ahistory 3apathogens 3aproteins 3atechnology 3aviruses1 aBardani, Eirini1 aKallemi, Paraskevi1 aKalantidis, Kriton0 tBioEssays.g2019 Oct., v. 41, no. 10 p.e1900049-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2019000493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245009000158300001800248500001100266520125100277592002801528596008101556650003401637650001501671650001101686650001201697650000901709650001201718650002001730650001601750650001701766650001201783650002701795650001301822650002101835650001701856650001301873700002001886700001501906700005301921773012401974856007302098852000902171655001202180IND60780313920221123001556.0220618e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078031392DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.74702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chun‐xiao14aThe pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of esculin: A comprehensive review  ap. 2434-2448.  aREVIEW  aCortex fraxini is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine. Esculin is one of the main active ingredients of Cortex fraxini and has attracted more and more attention from scholars. The purpose of the review is to systematically review relevant studies on the pharmacological effects and pharmacokinetic characteristics of esculin to support its further application as therapeutic agents. Pharmacological studies have shown that the anti‐inflammatory and anti‐oxidative stress effects of esculin are outstanding. This indicates that esculin is promising to be used to treat a variety of diseases closely related to inflammation and oxidative damage. Esculin has anti‐diabetic effect, which is closely related to improving pancreas damage, promoting insulin release, and enhancing glucose homeostasis. In addition, esculin has anti‐cancer, antibiosis, anti‐virus, neuroprotection, anti‐thrombosis and treating eye diseases properties. Pharmacokinetic studies show that esculin can be quickly and evenly distributed in the body. However, the first pass effect of esculin is serious. In short, esculin is promising to treat many diseases, but further high quality studies are needed to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of esculin.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018QN019cSichuan Provincial Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aantibiosis 3acortex 3aesculin 3aeyes 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3aneuroprotective effect 3apancreas 3apharmacokinetics 3aphytotherapy 3aresearch1 aLi, Jing‐chun1 aLai, Jiang1 aLiu, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0128-34200 tPhytotherapy research.g2022 June, v. 36, no. 6 p.2434-2448dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.74703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008200164300001600246520105000262592002801312650001201340650001301352650001301365650001701378653001901395653002101414653000801435653001701443653000901460653003001469700005901499773012501558856008301683852000901766655001201775IND60674099220221121073242.0200228e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067409922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurera, Dev10aDesigning bioinspired conical surfaces for water collection from condensation  ap. 138-148.  aIn arid deserts, water supply is supplemented by water from fog and condensation. Once the droplets are collected, they are transported to a location where they are consumed or stored before they evaporate. Conical geometries or triangular patterns are known to create Laplace pressure gradient inside droplets which facilitates droplet transport. Water collection by fog on conical and triangular patterns have been studied. The research on the water collection by condensation exist only on flat triangular patterns. These flat surfaces have limitations for practical purposes, such as the Laplace pressure gradient does not act of droplets unless they touch the border. That is not the case in cones, which makes them superior for practical water collection. In this study, for the first time, water collection from condensation on cones have been studied. Cones of different tip angle, cone length, and surface area were used. Effect of inclination angle and array was also characterized. The results are compared to water collection by fog.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeserts 3adroplets 3ageometry 3awater supply 0aBioinspiration 0aWater collection 0aFog 0aCondensation 0aCone 0aLaplace pressure gradient1 aBhushan, Bharat1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7161-66010 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 560 p.138-148dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002400185245017000209500001100379506007600390520088300466592002801349596011801377596010101495596010101596596008801697596005301785596005301838506003701891650001201928650001301940650003201953650001101985650001401996700002102010700002802031773011402059856007802173852000902251655001202260IND60670427420221207063201.0191002e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067042742DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2018002562doi7 aPMC67569832pmcid7 a310994112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBosch, Thomas C.

Studying only a few organisms limits science to the answers that those organisms can provide. Nature has given us an overwhelming diversity of animals to study, and recent technological advances have greatly accelerated the ability to generate genetic and genomic tools to develop model organisms for research on host–microbe interactions. With the help of such models the authors therefore hope to construct a more complete picture of the mechanisms that underlie crucial interactions in a given metaorganism (entity consisting of a eukaryotic host with all its associated microbial partners). As reviewed here, new knowledge of the diversity of host–microbe interactions found across the animal kingdom will provide new insights into how animals develop, evolve, and succumb to the disease.  aPublisher supplied data  aP50GM098911 and P01GM125576.cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health  aP01GM125576cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health  aP50GM098911cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health  aCollaborative Research Centre (CRC) 1182 “OrigincDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  cCanadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)  a5R37AI050661‐16cNational Institutes of Health0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimals 3agenomics 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3amodels 3asymbiosis1 aGuillemin, Karen1 aMcFall‐Ngai, Margaret0 tBioEssays.g2019 Oct., v. 41, no. 10 p.e1800256-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2018002563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013800170300001600308520147900324592002801803650001901831650001501850650002501865650001901890650001101909650001201920650001801932650001001950650002301960650002101983650001502004650001602019650001602035651001702051700002802068700002202096700002102118700006302139773012802202856008202330852000902412655001202421IND60750063120221118113323.0210910e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075006312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11829-021-09851-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChikowore, Gerald10aIntegration of invasive tree, black locust, into agro-ecological flower visitor networks induces competition for pollination services  ap. 787-796.  aInvasion of ecosystems by alien species is a global concern. Robinia pseudoacacia L. (Fabaceae) is one such species which impacts on native diversity and ecosystem functioning. We assessed how R. pseudoacacia affects flower visitation by arthropods in commercial apple orchards in eastern Free State, South Africa. We used paired observations to compare the abundance and diversity of flower visitors and their interactions with the two plant species. Our results showed that R. pseudoacacia flowers attract African honey bees (Apis mellifera) more than apple flowers. However, flower visitation by Diptera, particularly March flies (Bibionidae) was higher in apple flowers. Arthropods of other orders appeared to be minor visitors for both plants as they were recorded in small numbers. Flower visitation rates by A. mellifera did not vary significantly between the two plant species, though it was marginally higher in R. pseudoacacia. The interaction network for the two plant species and their flower visitors showed high nestedness indicating that they are drawing from the same pool of pollinators. Therefore, there is competition for flower visitors between R. pseudoacacia and apples based on the number of shared partners, an interaction which may potentially affect apple pollination and ultimately compromise fruit quality and yields. These findings further support the need to sustainably manage R. pseudoacacia in all invaded habitats including agro-ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aBibionidae 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3aagroecosystems 3aapples 3aflowers 3afruit quality 3ahoney 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3anestedness 3apollination 3apollinators 3aSouth Africa1 aSteenhuisen, Sandy-Lynn1 aMutamiswa, Reyard1 aMartin, Grant D.1 aChidawanyika, Frank1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4601-768X0 tArthropod-plant interactions.g2021 Oct., v. 15, no. 5 p.787-796dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl4130426x1872-88557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11829-021-09851-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245011700163520104100280592002801321650002401349650002001373650001101393650002601404650001301430650001701443700003701460700002801497700002001525700002601545773016001571856007701731852000901808655001201817IND60768377220221121002629.0220225e20220126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076837722DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi110200872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLacasta, Javier 10aApproaches for the Clustering of Geographic Metadata and the Automatic Detection of Quasi-Spatial Dataset Series  aThe discrete representation of resources in geospatial catalogues affects their information retrieval performance. The performance could be improved by using automatically generated clusters of related resources, which we name quasi-spatial dataset series. This work evaluates whether a clustering process can create quasi-spatial dataset series using only textual information from metadata elements. We assess the combination of different kinds of text cleaning approaches, word and sentence-embeddings representations (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, ELMo, Sentence BERT, and Universal Sentence Encoder), and clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN, OPTICS, and agglomerative clustering) for the task. The results demonstrate that combining word-embeddings representations with an agglomerative-based clustering creates better quasi-spatial dataset series than the other approaches. In addition, we have found that the ELMo representation with agglomerative clustering produces good results without any preprocessing step for text cleaning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomatic detection 3adata collection 3agloves 3ainformation retrieval 3ametadata 3aspatial data1 aLopez-Pellicer, Francisco Javier1 aZarazaga-Soria, Javier 1 aBéjar, Rubén 1 aNogueras-Iso, Javier 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2022 Jan. 26, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi110200873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001900186245007600205300001600281506007600297520141100373592002801784506003701812650001601849650002401865650002501889650002301914650001701937650001701954650001001971650002401981650002202005650003802027650002902065650001302094650002702107650000902134650001002143651001902153651001902172700002302191700001602214700002302230773007902253856004802332852000902380655001202389IND4480905520221207090959.0120517e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448090552DNAL7 a225354272pmid7 aPMC33578542pmcid7 a10.1007/s13280-011-0161-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, G.

Based on destructive sampling of root systems of harvested loblolly pine trees, we estimated that root systems contained about 32% (17.2 Mg ha−1) at the time of harvest, and about 13% (6.1 Mg ha−1) of the soil organic carbon 10 years later. Based on the published roundwood output data, we estimated belowground biomass at the time of harvest for loblolly-shortleaf pine forests harvested between 1995 and 2005 in South Carolina. We then calculated C that remained in the decomposing root systems in 2005 using the decay function developed for loblolly pine. Our calculations indicate that the amount of C stored in decaying roots of loblolly-shortleaf pine forests harvested between 1995 and 2005 in South Carolina was 7.1 Tg. Using a simple extrapolation method, we estimated 331.8 Tg C stored in the decomposing roots due to timber harvest from 1995 to 2005 in the conterminous USA. To fully account for the C stored in the decomposing roots of the US forests, future studies need (1) to quantify decay rates of coarse roots for major tree species in different regions, and (2) to develop a methodology that can determine C stock in decomposing roots resulting from natural mortality.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus taeda 3abelowground biomass 3acarbon sequestration 3aconiferous forests 3aharvest date 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asoil organic carbon 2aCarbonxchemistry 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aForestry 2aPlant Rootsxchemistry 2aTime 2aTrees 3aSouth Carolina 0aSouth Carolina1 aVan Lear, David H.1 aHu, Huifeng1 aKapeluck, Peter R.0 tAmbio.g2012 May, v. 41, no. 3 p.284-291dSpringer-Verlagx0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-011-0161-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245010200174520164500276592002801921650001701949650001701966650001301983650000701996653002502003653001602028653001302044653001902057700005602076700001502132773009102147856009002238852000902328655001202337IND60755799120221116202923.0220124e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075579912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1327912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Guangzhao10aFate of metal-EDTA complexes during ferrihydrite aging: Interaction of metal-EDTA and iron oxides  aThe widespread presence of ferrihydrite in the environment makes many contaminants including metal-EDTA complexes being adsorbed on it. However, the fate of metal-EDTA complexes during the transformation of ferrihydrite was poorly understood. Understanding the migration and speciation changes of metal-EDTA adsorbed on ferrihydrite during the transformation was helpful to predict its fate in some natural and engineering environments. In this work, the interaction of the two metal-EDTA complexes (Ni(II)-EDTA and Ca(II)-EDTA) and ferrihydrite during the 9-day transformation of ferrihydrite at different pH values was studied. The results showed that part of EDTA complexing metals changed to non-complexed metals during the ferrihydrite transformation, which was due to the fact that metal in the metal-EDTA exchanged with Fe(III) on ferrihydrite. Besides, different speciation of metal ions migrated during the transformation of ferrihydrite. Meanwhile, Fe(III)-EDTA formed in this process, and the exchange of metal in Ca(II)-EDTA with Fe(III) in ferrihydrite was faster than that of Ni(II)-EDTA. Besides, the presence of metal-EDTA affected the transformation rate of ferrihydrite under neutral and alkaline condition, and metal-EDTA accelerated the dissolution of ferrihydrite to form goethite. Therefore, ferrihydrite and metal-EDTA influenced each other during the transformation of ferrihydrite. The results of this work revealed that the process of metal-EDTA dissolving ferrihydrite not only included the dissociation of metal-EDTA, but also involved the migration of metal ions and affected the transformation of ferrihydrite.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissociation 3aferrihydrite 3agoethite 3apH 0aMetal-EDTA complexes 0aInteraction 0aExchange 0aTransformation1 aFu, Fenglian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7495-54031 aTang, Bing0 tChemosphere.g2022 Mar., v. 291 p.132791-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1327913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245014100203300001600344520103000360592002801390650001601418650002801434650001801462650002401480650002101504650000901525650001801534653002001552653003401572653003501606653002901641653002601670773009701696856008501793852000901878655001201887IND60770163720221116141040.0220502e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077016372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.03.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8528-317110aFull-coupled analysis of offshore floating wind turbine supported by very large floating structure with consideration of hydroelasticity  ap. 790-799.  aA multi-bodies hydroelastic model is developed and coupled to the full aero-hydro-servo-elastic analysis of a VLFS (very large floating structure) floating wind turbine. The proposed hydroelastic model discretizes the VLFS into a set of interconnected submodules. The hydrodynamic load acting on the entire VFLS is lumped to the mass center of submodules whilst the structural flexibility is represented by the finite element model used to connect submodules. The multi-bodies character makes the developed hydroelastic model robust to the floating structure and convenient to be embedded into coupled dynamic modelling of offshore floating wind turbines. The established model is validated against model test first and subsequently coupled to the numerical model of a moored VFLS floating wind turbine. The wind turbine power production, VFLS flexible deformation and structural loads are investigated. The analysis results reveal the significance of hydroelasticity on wind turbine power production and structural dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3afinite element analysis 3ahydrodynamics 3amathematical models 3apower generation 3awind 3awind turbines 0aHydroelasticity 0aVery large floating structure 0aOffshore floating wind turbine 0aAero-hydro-servo-elastic 0aMulti-bodies dynamics0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Apr., v. 189 p.790-799dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.03.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245013600172520189800308592002802206650002002234650001402254650001402268650002302282650001602305650000902321650000902330650002002339653001702359653002802376653001302404653003302417653001502450700001302465700001502478773009102493856009002584852000902674655001202683IND60755799220221116202814.0220124e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075579922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1327922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Rongguo10aLeaching of heavy metals from lead-zinc mine tailings and the subsequent migration and transformation characteristics in paddy soil  aThe leaching of heavy metals (HMs) from lead-zinc mine tailings caused by natural precipitation and the subsequent migration and transformation characteristics in paddy soil were investigated using simulative experiments. The contents of HMs in the leachate from lead-zinc mine tailings increased with the increasing of liquid-to-solid ratio. Significant differences of contents under the same rainfall were found among different HMs (P < 0.01). The increasing rates of the concentrations for Mn and Zn in leachate were much higher than the other selected HMs. The leaching results of all HMs were well fitted by the DoseResp equation, indicating that the leaching processes are controlled by multiple factors. When the paddy soil was exposed to lead-zinc mine tailings, the HMs could accumulate significantly in the paddy soil, and their contents increased with the simulated time. The average vertical migration rates (mg kg⁻¹ cm⁻¹ d⁻¹) of HMs in the paddy soil during the four months was ranked in the order of Zn (9.0✕10⁻²) > Mn (8.1✕10⁻²) > Cu (1.8✕10⁻²) > Pb (1.6✕10⁻²) > Cd (2.7✕10⁻⁴) > As (2.4✕10⁻⁴). Compared with the other HMs, Mn and Zn can be more easily leached from lead-zinc mine tailings, then migrate into deeper layers in paddy soil. The proportions in five chemical fractions of HMs varied significantly with the impact of lead-zinc mine tailings. The Zn, Cu, and As were mainly presented in residual fraction, while Pb, Mn, and Cd were mainly presented in carbonate-bound, Fe/Mn oxides-bound, and exchangeable fractions, respectively. The risk assessment code results showed that Zn, Mn, Cu, and As posed medium risk, while Pb and Cd posed an extremely high risk to the paddy soil environment. It's found that lead-zinc mine tailings could significantly enhance the ecological risk associated with HMs in the paddy soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aedaphic factors 3aequations 3aleachates 3amigratory behavior 3apaddy soils 3arain 3arisk 3arisk assessment 0aHeavy metals 0aLead-zinc mine tailings 0aLeaching 0aMigration and transformation 0aPaddy soil1 aGao, Yue1 aYang, Yang0 tChemosphere.g2022 Mar., v. 291 p.132792-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1327923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01770naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100002300164245004700187300001400234500001500248520035400263592002800617650001800645650002700663650001900690650001400709650001800723650001200741650001100753650004600764650003400810650001100844650001400855650007800869650006000947653002701007700002601034700002301060700002101083773012901104852000901233856008201242655001201324IND9000065520221116172541.0181016e198901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900006552DNAL7 a24886462pmid7 a10.1177/1040638789001001082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorter, Raymond L.10aSystemic Salmonellosis in Mature Beef Cows  ap. 22-24.  a2019-12-05  aSystemic infection of mature beef cows with Salmonella typhimurium resulted in death of cows, abortions, and premature births.

However, it suffers from large volume expansion and poor conductivity. To overcome these limitations, in this study, we have designed and prepared Mo-doped SnO₂ nanoflake arrays anchored on carbon foam (Mo-SnO₂@C-foam with 38.41 wt% SnO₂ and 3.7 wt% Mo content) by a facile hydrothermal method. The carbon foam serves as a three-dimensional conductive network and a buffer skeleton, contributing to improved rate performance and cycling stability. In addition, Mo doping enhances the kinetics of sodium-ion transfer, and the interlaced SnO₂ nanoflake arrays is beneficial to promote the conversion reactions during the charge/discharge process. The as-prepared composite with a unique structure demonstrate a high initial capacity of 1017.1 mAh g⁻¹ at 0.1 A g⁻¹, with a capacity retention over three times higher than that of the control sample (SnO₂@C-foam) at 1 A g⁻¹, indicating a remarkable rate performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbon 3afoams 3ahot water treatment 3amolybdenum 3atin dioxide 0aTin oxide 0aCarbon foam 0aDoping 0aAnode 0aSodium-ion battery1 aWang, X.L.1 aYao, Z.J.1 aXie, D.1 aXia, X.H.1 aGu, C.D.1 aTu, J.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8286-263X0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 560 p.169-176dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012400165300001800289520139600307592002801703650001201731650002501743650002301768650001701791650001601808650001301824650002601837650001901863650001901882650002701901650001401928650001001942650002901952650002101981650001202002650001102014653002502025653001602050653001902066653001302085653003402098653002802132653000802160653000802168653000802176700002302184700001902207700005902226700005702285773009902342856008502441852000902526655001202535IND60770163820221116140838.0220502e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077016382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.03.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosen, Yan10aShort ozonation for effective removal and detoxification of fermentation inhibitors resulting from thermal pretreatment  ap. 1407-1418.  aCommon pretreatment methods for bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass are carried out under acidic conditions at high temperatures and result in formation of by-products, such as formic acid, levulinic acid, furfural and HMF (5-hydroxymethylfurfural). These by-products have an inhibitory effect on yeasts, reducing yeast growth and fermentation, and thus ethanol production. In this study, the inhibitory dose of these by-products was investigated along with the use of short ozonation as a means of their detoxification. When the effect of ozone was tested directly on yeasts (without inhibitors), they exhibited tolerance to ozone, suggesting the utilization of ozonation in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. Fifteen minutes of ozonation removed over 90% of the inhibitory effect originating from 50 mM furfural, 50 mM formic acid, 25 mM HMF, and 100 mM levulinic acid. Thermal pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of pine sawdust resulted in inhibition of microaerobic yeast growth. This inhibition was relieved after short ozonation; however, continuous ozonation has motivated further inhibition, suggesting the formation of additional inhibitory compounds. The results demonstrate the applicability of short ozonation as a practical approach for removing by-products’ inhibitory effects originating from thermal pretreatment of lignocellulosic waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3aformic acid 3afurfural 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3alevulinic acid 3alignocellulose 3alignocellulosic wastes 3aozonation 3aozone 3arenewable energy sources 3asaccharification 3asawdust 3ayeasts 0aThermal pretreatment 0aFormic acid 0aLevulinic acid 0aFurfural 0aHMF (5-hydroxymethylfurfural) 0aFermentation inhibitors 0aHMF 0aYPD 0aTOD1 aMaslennikov, Alona1 aTrabelcy, Beny1 aGerchman, Yoram1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8637-95891 aMamane, Hadas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5321-43420 tRenewable energy.g2022 Apr., v. 189 p.1407-1418dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.03.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001600180245012100196300002000317506007600337520140500413592002801818506003701846650002101883650002801904650001501932650001701947650002401964650002001988650001902008650001202027650001002039700002002049700002102069700002002090700001902110773013602129856007302265852000902338655001202347IND60650010320221207103137.0190709e20151209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065001032DNAL7 a10.3390/nu71255322doi7 aPMC46900842pmcid7 a266902152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Sihan10aAdherence to Guidelines for Cancer Survivors and Health-Related Quality of Life among Korean Breast Cancer Survivors  ap. 10307-10319.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is limited evidence on the association between adherence to guidelines for cancer survivors and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In a cross-sectional study of Korean breast cancer survivors, we examined whether adherence to the guidelines of the American Cancer Society (ACS) and World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) for cancer survivors was related to levels of HRQoL, assessed by the Korean version of Core 30 (C30) and Breast cancer module 23 (BR23) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ). We included a total of 160 women aged 21 to 79 years who had been diagnosed with breast cancer according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stages I to III and had breast cancer surgery at least six months before the interview. Increasing adherence to ACS guidelines was associated with higher scores of social functioning (p for trend = 0.05), whereas increasing adherence to WCRF/AICR recommendations was associated with higher scores of arm symptoms (p for trend = 0.01). These associations were limited to those with stage II or III cancer. Diet may be an important factor in relation to quality of life among Korean breast cancer survivors, however our findings warrant further prospective studies to evaluate whether healthy diet improves survivors’ quality of life.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast neoplasms 3across-sectional studies 3aguidelines 3ahealthy diet 3aprospective studies 3aquality of life 3aquestionnaires 3asurgery 3awomen1 aHwang, Eunkyung1 aMoon, Hyeong-Gon1 aNoh, Dong-Young1 aLee, Jung-Eun,0 tNutrients.g2015 Dec. 09, v. 7, no. 12 p.10307-10319dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu71255323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245006200202300002000264506007600284520125100360592002801611506003701639650001701676650001701693650001701710650000901727650002001736650002001756650002601776650001201802650001101814650000901825650002701834650001101861650001001872650001001882650001101892650001501903650001001918650001201928650000901940700001801949700003101967700002801998700002802026700002002054773013602074856007302210852000902283655001202292IND60650010420221207103133.0190709e20151210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065001042DNAL7 a10.3390/nu71255352doi7 aPMC46900872pmcid7 a266904702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAncuceanu, Robert12aA Survey of Plant Iron Content—A Semi-Systematic Review  ap. 10320-10351.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIron is an essential mineral nutrient for all living organisms, involved in a plurality of biological processes. Its deficit is the cause of the most common form of anemia in the world: iron deficiency anemia (IDA). This paper reviews iron content in various parts of 1228 plant species and its absorption from herbal products, based on data collected from the literature in a semi-systematic manner. Five hundred genera randomly selected from the Angiosperms group, 215 genera from the Pteridophytes groups and all 95 Gymnosperm genera as listed in the Plant List version 1.1 were used as keywords together with the word “iron” in computerized searches. Iron data about additional genera returned by those searches were extracted and included in the analysis. In total, iron content values for a number of 1228 species, 5 subspecies, and 5 varieties were collected. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to compare iron contents in various plant parts (whole plant, roots, stems, shoots, leaves, aerial parts, flowers, fruits, seeds, wood, bark, other parts) and exploratory analyses by taxonomic groups and life-forms were carried out. The absorption and potential relevance of herbal iron for iron supplementation are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAngiospermae 3aGymnospermae 3aaerial parts 3abark 3abioavailability 3adata collection 3aferns and fern allies 3aflowers 3afruits 3airon 3airon deficiency anemia 3aleaves 3aroots 3aseeds 3ashoots 3astatistics 3astems 3asurveys 3awood1 aDinu, Mihaela1 aHovaneţ, Marilena Viorica1 aAnghel, Adriana Iuliana1 aPopescu, Carmen Violeta1 aNegreş, Simona0 tNutrients.g2015 Dec. 10, v. 7, no. 12 p.10320-10351dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu71255353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005600138245019300194300001800387500002000405520140000425592002801825596004301853650001801896650004101914650001901955650001701974650001201991650002302003650001802026650002202044650004002066650001202106650001702118650001302135650003002148650001302178650003202191700001902223700007502242773012402317856007302441852000902514655001202523IND60780314420221121094839.0220618e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078031442DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.74742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahimi, Giti1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7303-836610aEffects of crocin supplementation on inflammatory markers, lipid profiles, insulin and cardioprotective indices in women with PCOS: A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial  ap. 2605-2615.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multifactorial reproductive condition common in women of reproductive age. Hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, obesity, and chronic low‐grade inflammation are associated with PCOS. In a clinical trial study, women with PCOS were divided into two groups (n = 25 each): the intervention group receiving crocin (15 mg, twice daily) and the control group receiving a placebo. The duration of intervention in both groups was 12 weeks. Pre‐ and postintervention, demographic information, lipid profile, fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin, and inflammatory markers (interleukin‐6 [IL‐6] and tumor necrosis factor‐alpha [TNF‐α]) were measured. Intervention with crocin significantly increased the mean high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol postintervention compared to the placebo group, while exerting a suppressive effect on the increase in mean low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels. Intervention with crocin also exerted inhibitory effects on changes in FBG and insulin, so that crocin improved insulin and cardioprotective indices. Finally, despite the increased inflammatory markers (IL‐6 and TNF‐α) in the placebo group, crocin treatment had protective effects on their increased changes. Thus, crocin supplementation could be considered in the therapeutic targets of women with PCOS.  aPublisher supplied data  cArdabil University of Medical Sciences 3ablood glucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterleukin-6 3alipid composition 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3aobesity 3aphytotherapy 3aplacebos 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3aresearch 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aShams, Saeideh1 aAṣlānī, Muḥammad Riz̤ā,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1519-76110 tPhytotherapy research.g2022 June, v. 36, no. 6 p.2605-2615dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.74743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01933naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245014700166300001800313520096400331592002801295650001301323650001401336650003901350700001901389700001901408700001801427773010501445856008401550852000901634655001201643IND4458103320221119063604.0141111e20110603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445810332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2011.03.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamman, Chris12aA high throughput approach to purifying chiral molecules using 3μm analytical chiral stationary phases via supercritical fluid chromatography  ap. 3529-3536.  aIn this study we describe a fast 2.5min gradient chiral screening method that utilizes 3μm particles CSPs. An empirical approach to scale-up from the 2.5min gradient method to an isocratic preparative method is described. We also evaluate the use of 5μm preparative columns that are 150mm in length versus the industry standard of 250mm. Finally, we evaluate eleven different CSPs against 46 compounds, 23 commercially available and 23 internal compounds from a variety of projects. All 46 compounds were separated using the 2.5min gradient method. Assuming an Rₛ of 1.0 or greater, the Chiralpak AD column from Chiral Technologies proved most useful, followed by the Cellulose-1 from Phenomenex. The Cellulose-4, a novel stationary phase from Phenomenex, provided the third most separations of the eleven columns tested. For the 46 compounds tested, the Chiralcel OJ column from Chiral Technologies outperformed Phenomenex's version, the Lux Cellulose-3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aindustry 3ascreening 3asupercritical fluid chromatography1 aWong, Mengling1 aHayes, Michael1 aGibbons, Paul0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 June 3, v. 1218, no. 22 p.3529-3536dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.03.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245015300164520139600317592002801713650001101741650002201752650001301774650001301787650001101800650001701811700001901828700002201847773016001869856007702029852000902106655001202115IND60768377720221121002656.0220225e20220127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076837772DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi110200912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchorcht, Martin 10aComparative Study on Matching Methods for the Distinction of Building Modifications and Replacements Based on Multi-Temporal Building Footprint Data  aWe compare different matching methods for distinguishing building modifications from replacements based on multi-temporal building footprint geometries from 3D city models. Manually referenced footprints of building changes were used to determine which thresholds are suitable for distinction. In addition, since the underlying LoD1 (Level of Detail 1) data is highly accurate, randomly generated position deviations were added to allow for transferability to less well-matched data. In order to generate a defined position deviation, a novel method was developed. This allows determination of the effects of position deviations on accuracy. Determination of these methods’ suitability for manipulation of data from sources of different levels of generalization (cross-scale matching) is therefore not the focus of this work. In detail, the methods of ‘Common Area Ratio’, ‘Common Boundary Ratio’, ‘Hausdorff Distance’ and ‘PoLiS’ (Polygon and Line Segment based metric) were compared. In addition, we developed an extended line-based procedure, which we called ‘Intersection Boundary Ratio’. This method was shown to be more robust than the previous matching methods for small position deviations. Furthermore, we addressed the question of whether a minimum function at PoLiS and Hausdorff distance is more suitable to distinguish between modification and replacement.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3acomparative study 3ageometry 3ajournals 3amodels 3aspatial data1 aHecht, Robert 1 aMeinel, Gotthard 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2022 Jan. 27, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi110200913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245012600161500001400287520131100301592002801612650001901640650001101659650001001670650001701680650001401697651001201711700001901723700001901742773012001761856007501881852000901956655001201965IND60731977320221116215431.0210326e20210305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073197732DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110306962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnneberg, Inger10aFor the Sake of Production—And the Animal, and Me. How Students at Danish Agricultural Colleges Perceive Animal Welfare  aNAL-light  aFarmers’ perceptions of animal welfare have been found to affect the way they treat their animals, and there is growing awareness of the range of ethical views today’s farmers take on animal welfare. The purpose of this study was to examine how perceptions of animal welfare develop among prospective farmers and farm workers in Denmark during their studies at agricultural colleges. We also examined the experiences of college teachers and their views on the inclusion of animal welfare in livestock courses. Drawing on individual interviews and focus group interviews at four Danish agricultural colleges, we used systematic text condensation to identify three major themes among the students: 1. The importance of balancing welfare and productivity, 2. Concerns about the animal itself, 3. Concerns relating to the students themselves. Our interviews with teachers revealed a growing awareness of the inclusion of animal welfare in Danish agricultural colleges, but also disagreements over the way animal welfare should be understood. We conclude that the education of future farmers in Danish agricultural colleges today embraces animal welfare but should leave more room in the future to introduce students to the issue of market-driven welfare and consumer interest in animal-friendly production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aethics 3afarms 3afocus groups 3alivestock 3aDenmark1 aLassen, Jesper1 aSandøe, Peter0 tAnimals.g2021 Mar. 05, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110306963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245009800191300001600289520127600305592002801581650001301609650002501622650001701647650001901664650002601683650001701709650002001726650002201746650001301768650001201781650002401793650004701817650001901864650001101883651001101894653002101905653001401926653001701940653002201957653001301979653000901992700002902001700002402030700002102054700001802075773010102093856011702194852000902311655001202320IND50065052020221119093529.0151127e200210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006505202DNAL7 a10.1658/1100-9233(2002)013[0627:EAGSOE]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzmidt, Alfred E.10aEstablishment and genetic structure of Empetrum hermaphroditum populations in northern Sweden  ap. 627-634.  aIn late successions of the boreal forest of northern Sweden the evergreen dwarf shrub Empetrum hermaphroditum forms an extensive cover and is believed to spread mainly vegetatively through layering. To analyse the process of population establishment and the relative importance of sexual vs asexual reproduction and the spatial clonal distribution of this species we selected one mainland and two island sites of different post-fire successional ages (145, 375 and 1720 yr since last fire, respectively). Using 61 polymorphic RAPD markers, we found 96 genotypes in a total of 133 samples. All three populations showed high levels of genetic variation. AMOVA analysis revealed that 33%% of the total variation resided among sites, 26%% resided among plots within sites and 41%% was due to variation within plots. The youngest population had only 14%% clonal fraction. In contrast, the oldest population had > 30%% clonal fraction and many genets had dimensions of 10––40 m and were intermingled. It appears that E. hermaphroditum establishes by seeds to a larger extent than previously thought and that the clonal spread by layering is rather slow.Nomenclature:Haapasaari (1988).Abbreviation: PCR == Polymerase Chain Reaction; RAPD == Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEmpetrum 3aasexual reproduction 3abiogeography 3aboreal forests 3aecological succession 3afire ecology 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aislands 3aplant establishment 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aseed dispersal 3ashrubs 3aSweden 0aClonal structure 0aCrowberry 0aFire history 0aGenetic variation 0aLayering 0aRAPD1 aNilsson, Marie-Charlotte1 aBriceño, Eléémer1 aZackrisson, Olle1 aWang, Xiao-Ru0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2002 Oct., v. 13, no. 5 p.627-634dOpulus Pressx1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1658%2F1100-9233%282002%29013%5B0627%3AEAGSOE%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015500167300001600322520157700338592002801915650001301943650001801956650000901974650002001983650002002003650002402023650002102047650001502068650001802083653002602101653002302127653001902150700001502169700001502184700001502199700001802214700001502232700001402247700001702261700001602278700001502294700001702309773011002326856008502436852000902521655001202530IND50063019720221119093529.0190415e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006301972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2012.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamazaki, T.10aGenetic correlations between milk production traits and somatic cell scores on test day within and across first and second lactations in Holstein cows  ap. 120-126.  aThe genetic correlations between milk production traits (daily milk yield, 305-day milk yield, and lactation persistency as the difference between milk yields at days 240 and 60) and daily somatic cell score (SCS) within and across first and second lactations in Holstein cows were estimated by using a multiple trait test day (TD) animal model. The data set consisted of 200,095 TD milk and SCS records from 21,238 cows in their first lactations and 143,051 records from 15,281 cows in their second. Data were analyzed by using a two-trait, two-lactation random regression animal model. Genetic correlations between daily SCS and milk production traits were estimated from additive genetic variance component estimates of random regression coefficients. Genetic correlations between daily milk yield in first lactation and daily SCS in both lactations were positive and peaked in early lactation stage. In contrast, the genetic correlations between persistency and daily SCS in both lactations were negative, except in very early lactation stage. These correlations suggested that focusing selection on increasing milk yield early in the first lactation would likely increase SCS, whereas selecting for increased persistency would decrease SCS during both lactations. The genetic correlations between 305-day milk yield and persistency were positive within and across the first and second lactations. These results suggested that selection for lactation persistency could help to increase lactation yield overall in the first and second lactations without increasing SCS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aanimal models 3acows 3adata collection 3aearly lactation 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic variance 3amilk yield 3asomatic cells 0aLactation persistency 0aSomatic cell score 0aTest day model1 aHagiya, K.1 aTakeda, H.1 aSasaki, O.1 aYamaguchi, S.1 aSogabe, M.1 aSaito, Y.1 aNakagawa, S.1 aTogashi, K.1 aSuzuki, K.1 aNagamine, Y.0 tLivestock science.g2013 Apr., v. 152, no. 2-3 p.120-126dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2012.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010800165300001300273520112700286592002801413650002201441650002401463650001401487650002201501650001301523650001201536650004401548650001201592650000901604700001801613700002101631700001701652700001801669773009101687856008101778852000901859655001201868IND4472768320221121123429.0171110e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447276832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-011-9578-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujisawa, Shuji10aFormation of N-acylureas on the surface of TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibril with carbodiimide in DMF  ap. 1191.  aA method for conversion of carboxyl groups present on the surface of TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibrils to N-acylureas using carbodiimide was developed. A TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibril with free carboxyl groups (TOCN–COOH) dispersed in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) is prepared from a bleached kraft pulp, and then the TOCN–COOH is reacted with either N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) or N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) under apparently homogeneous conditions. FT-IR and solid-state ¹³C NMR analyses showed that the reaction products contained N-acylurea groups, and yields were >80%. Conversion ratios of carboxyl groups to N-acylureas are approximately 80 and 60%, when DIC and DCC, respectively, of 5 mol per mole of carboxyl groups are used as the reagents. X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that neither crystallinity nor crystal width of the original wood cellulose I structure was changed by the N-acylurea formation. The isolated and never-dried TOCN-N-acylureas are nano-dispersed in DMF but not in i-PrOH or dioxane. Pellets of the TOCN-N-acylureas had water-contact angles of >70°.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3ableached kraft pulp 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3adioxane 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apellets 3awood1 aOkita, Yusuke1 aSaito, Tsuguyuki1 aTogawa, Eiji1 aIsogai, Akira0 tCellulose.g2011 Oct., v. 18, no. 5 p.1191-1191dSpringer Netherlandsx0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-011-9578-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002300150245012700173300001600300520168800316592002802004650002502032650001102057650002302068650001802091650002002109650001202129650001102141650001402152650001802166650002102184650001202205650002602217650002502243650001702268650001202285651001002297700001802307700002302325700002302348700001902371773008402390856008602474852000902560655001202569IND4461541520221121123510.0141111e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446154152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2010.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoudhury, Manisha10aSocio-economic profile and food safety knowledge and practice of street food vendors in the city of Guwahati, Assam, India  ap. 196-203.  aStreet food is an integral part of society in all countries – underdeveloped, developing or developed. As such the standard of hygiene maintained is a very vital matter. Every region has its sets of factors affecting the hygiene maintain. In the present study a survey was carried out in Guwahati city to determine the existing socio-economic status and food safety knowledge of street food vendors. Data on socio-economic and business profile of 80 vendors were collected using three standardized proformas. A study was also conducted on the existing knowledge of vendors on food safety and hygiene practices and methods of procurement of raw materials. The knowledge and procurement practices of the vendors were assessed for association with some relevant socio-economic factors. From the study it was observed that majority of street food vendors were mobile food vendors (54%) with the remaining being owners of small restaurants and food handlers. Majority of the food vendors were local to Guwahati city (93%). The average daily income of the mobile food vendors were between Rs. 200 to Rs. 600. It also was noted that only 30%–37% vendors were aware of hygienic practices of food handling and a mere 8%–11% of food vendors had knowledge on biological sources of food contamination. It was concluded that there is a high degree of association between procurement practices with the type of vendors, ownership status and average income. But no outstanding association exists with any socio-economic factor with the knowledge of the vendors on food hygiene. The street food scenario in the city was found to be quite dismal and requires stringent steps to improve matters.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acities 3afood contamination 3afood handling 3afood sanitation 3ahygiene 3aincome 3aownership 3araw materials 3arestaurant foods 3asociety 3asocioeconomic factors 3asocioeconomic status 3astreet foods 3asurveys 3aIndia1 aMahanta, Lipi1 aGoswami, Jayashree1 aMazumder, Minakshi1 aPegoo, Barnali0 tFood control.g2011 Feb., v. 22, no. 2 p.196-203dElsevier Ltdx0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2010.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012800167300001600295520115100311592002801462650002801490650002801518650002401546650001801570650001701588650001801605650001901623650001601642650001001658650001201668650001401680650000701694700002001701773017501721856008201896852000901978655001201987IND60750064220221118113525.0210917e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075006422DNAL7 a10.1007/s12257-020-0376-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPham, Diep Ngoc12aA Novel Two-stage pH Control Strategy for the Production of 5-Aminolevulinic Acid Using Recombinant Streptomyces coelicolor  ap. 669-676.  a5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has extensive use in photodynamic cancer therapy, tumor diagnosis, and agriculture. In the microbial production of ALA, most efforts have focused on engineering enzymes and the metabolic pathways involved in ALA biosynthesis. The aim of this study was to enhance ALA production using recombinant Streptomyces coelicolor expressing the ALA synthase gene (hem A) of Rhodobacter sphaeroides with a novel two-stage pH control strategy. Batch cultures were performed in production medium at different pH values. Although cells grew well at neutral pH (6.8–7.2), the highest amount of ALA was produced with a long culture time (140 h) at a weakly acidic pH (5.5–6.0). In response, a two-stage pH control strategy was developed in which pH was maintained at 6.8–7.2 for cell growth and then shifted to 5.5–6.0 to promote ALA synthesis, resulting in a significant enhancement in ALA production compared to a one-stage pH control strategy. The titer of ALA was further improved up to 482 mg/L in the two-stage pH culture by supplying more glucose in the medium and shifting the pH during the early phase of cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodobacter sphaeroides 3aStreptomyces coelicolor 3aaminolevulinic acid 3abioprocessing 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acancer therapy 3acell growth 3agenes 3aglucose 3aneoplasms 3apH1 aKim, Chang-Joon0 tBiotechnology and bioprocess engineering.g2021 Aug., v. 26, no. 4 p.669-676dThe Korean Society for Biotechnology and BioengineeringwJournal:J000001239x1226-83727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12257-020-0376-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008000169300001600249520138500265592002801650650002401678650001201702650001501714650001201729650002201741650001401763650001001777650001101787650002201798650001101820650002101831650002401852650001501876651001201891653002201903653002401925653001401949653001101963653002401974773013901998856008502137852000902222655001202231IND60595502720221119051257.0180605e20171002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059550272DNAL7 a10.2989/10220119.2017.14064042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, Craig10aVegetation gradients around cattleposts in the eastern mountains of Lesotho  ap. 219-225.  aThe grasslands of the mountains in eastern Lesotho support large numbers of sheep, angora goats and other livestock during the summer, during which they are corralled nightly by herders at cattleposts. Few studies, however, have quantified the impact of grazing on the composition and structure of the mountain grasslands. Gradients of grazing and trampling intensity related to distance from 23 cattleposts in the subalpine and alpine belts (2 650–3 175 m above sea level) were examined to describe the long-term effects of livestock on unpalatable dwarf shrubs, bare area and plant species composition. The potential for shrub invasion and bare areas (low herbaceous cover) to develop was highest near cattleposts. Species composition also changed significantly along the grazing gradient, accompanied by a shift in dominants from grazing-sensitive to grazing-resistant grasses and shrubs. Species either decreased or increased monotonically along the grazing gradient or had an intermediate, unimodal response. The relative positions of species’ centroids along the grazing gradient were used to quantify their grazing sensitivity on a scale from 10 (most sensitive) to 0 (most resistant), which confirmed and contradicted previous classifications of their grazing responses. Basic ecological research on this important mountain grazing and catchment system is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngora (goat breed) 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3along term effects 3amountains 3asheep 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3atrampling damage 3avegetation gradient 3awatersheds 3aLesotho 0agrazing intensity 0agrazing sensitivity 0apiosphere 0ashrubs 0aspecies composition0 tAfrican journal of range & forage science.g2017 Oct. 2, v. 34, no. 4 p.219-225dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000042x1727-93807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2017.14064043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010500163300001200268500001900280520171200299592002802011596012302039650001802162650000902180650001102189650002602200650001502226651001002241700002402251700002402275773015202299856008302451852000902534655001202543IND60711096320221117223856.0201124e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071109632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-020-08490-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwathi, V.10aAddition of overland runoff and flow routing methods to SWMM—model application to Hyderabad, India  ap. 643.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHydrological models apply different methods to estimate runoff and route flows. Suitability of these methods is not unique, but varies with catchment conditions. This study aims to find the suitable overland runoff and flow routing methods for a catchment in Hyderabad, India, using customised Storm Water Management Model (SWMM-C). Currently, SWMM adapts only non-linear reservoir (NLR) method to estimate overland runoff. Linear reservoir (LR) and kinematic wave overland flow (KWO) have been incorporated as additional overland runoff methods. For flow routing, SWMM currently has kinematic wave (KW) and dynamic wave (DW) methods. Muskingum, Muskingum Cunge (MC) and lag methods have been included as additional methods in this customised version. SWMM-C was calibrated with four event rainfalls and tested with six event rainfalls using all possible combinations of overland runoff and flow routing methods. Efficiency of SWMM-C in simulating runoff was evaluated using performance indices. Results showed that for low magnitude event rainfalls, NLR, LR and KWO simulated runoff with a maximum deviation of 50%, 60% and 40% from observed runoff, respectively. In high magnitude event rainfalls, NLR, LR and KWO simulated runoff with maximum deviations of 20%, 40% and 20%, respectively, from the observed runoff. It was inferred from model outputs that NLR method could simulate runoff reasonably well for rainfalls that have duration greater than the time of concentration of catchment. LR method could simulate peak runoff better. KWO method was found to be suitable for chosen catchment for all rainfall durations. Flow routing methods KW, DW and MC are found to have minor influences on the runoff.  aPublisher supplied data  aITRA/15(68)/water/IUFM/01cInformation Technology Research Academy (ITRA), Government of India under, ITRA-water grant 3aoverland flow 3arain 3arunoff 3astormwater management 3awatersheds 3aIndia1 aSrinivasa Raju, K.,1 aVarma, Murari R.

Collections were made from October 2015 to April 2016. Herbarium specimens were also analyzed. A total of 81 species of ferns and one lycophyte were found, belonging to 14 families and 42 genera. The most representative families were Polypodiaceae (21 spp.) and Pteridaceae (12 spp.). Among the species, 44% were terrestrial, 31% epiphytes, 29% rupicolous, and 2% hemi-epiphytes. Macrothelypteris torresiana (Gaudich.) Ching, an exotic invasive species, was recorded. The number of species found here is lower than reported for similar areas, likely due to anthropogenic activities around and within the park. The constant urbanization occurring around the LPMP emphasizes the importance of the park for conservation of the Atlantic Forest and for maintaining the diversity of ferns and lycophytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrothelypteris torresiana 3aPolypodiaceae 3aPteridaceae 3aepiphytes 3aforests 3aherbaria 3ainvasive species 3aurbanization 3aBrazil1 aDechoum, Michele de Sá1 aLima, Duane Fernandes1 aGasper, André Luís de,1 aB.

During 2019, there were two known separate incidents of white-rumped vulture mortality involving four white-rumped vultures in Gujarat. After post-mortem examinations, tissues of all four vultures were received for toxicological investigation at the National Centre for Avian Ecotoxicology, SACON. Tissues were screened for a set of toxic pesticides, and none of them was at detectable level. Subsequently, the tissues were analysed for thirteen NSAIDs and paracetamol. Of all the drugs tested, only nimesulide was detected in all the tissues (17–1395 ng/g) indicative of exposure. Visceral gout was also observed in all the four vultures during post-mortem. Residues of nimesulide in tissues with symptoms of gout indicated that the vultures died due to nimesulide poisoning. Although, other than diclofenac, many NSAIDs are suspected to be toxic to white-rumped vultures, only nimesulide is reported in the recent past with clear symptom of gout in wild dead white-rumped vultures similar to diclofenac. Since, nimesulide appears to act similar to diclofenac in exerting toxic effects, if veterinary use of nimesulide continues, white-rumped vulture are bound to suffer. Hence, it is recommended that nimesulide should be banned by the government to conserve white-rumped vulture in the Indian subcontinent. Further, an effective system is recommended to be put in place to collect the tissues of dead vultures for toxicological investigations and eventual conservation of the critically endangered species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGyps bengalensis 3aacetaminophen 3adiclofenac 3aecotoxicology 3aendangered species 3agout 3amortality 3apollution 3aresearch 3atoxicity 3aIndia1 aMuralidharan, Subramanian1 aAshimkumar, Aditya Roy1 aJadhav, Shashikant0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Nov., v. 28, no. 41 p.57818-57824dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14702-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01565naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245017900167300001800346520052900364592002800893650001500921650001300936650001200949650003000961650001100991651001101002700002501013700002201038773010801060856007401168852000901242655001201251IND60727267820221116161340.0210210e20201008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072726782DNAL7 a10.15560/16.5.13232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbosa, Diogo B. e S.10aFirst record of Thamnodynastes almae Franco & Ferreira, 2002 (Serpentes, Dipsadidae, Xenodontinae) in the state of Piauí, northeastern Brazil, and updated distribution map  ap. 1323-1328.  aWe report for the first time the snake Thamnodynastes almae Franco & Ferreira, 2002 in Piauí, northeastern Brazil.

In the 1970s, new concerns arose about the potentially deleterious consequences of the modern global food system. Social movement groups, often referred to as the Alternative Agrifood Movement, successfully championed these concerns into policy discussions, expanding the federal food policy frame to include the agrifood system agenda, while also creating new roles for local and state governments in food system governance. A body of agrifood system policy research emerged to address both the concerns and policies addressing modern global food system issues. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: first, to summarize the underpinnings of the agrifood system policy agenda, trace the emergence of initiatives in federal policy, and describe expressions in local policy; and, second, to describe the corresponding research domain, focusing on seminal works that inform or directly speak to policy development. Findings indicate that, as a whole, agrifood system policy research is interdisciplinary and draws from a core of knowledge. The most highly cited publications come from the fields of geography, sociology and rural sociology, environmental science and nutrition education, and follow a consistent trajectory of conceptualizing alternatives, providing friendly critique and proposing research agendas attentive to hybridity between conventional and alternative food systems. Research mostly informs framing and agenda-setting in the policy process and is aimed at all scales of governance, with a slight emphasis on local governance. Finally, we offer suggestions for further research, including evaluative research and comparative analysis with other domains of food policy research.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollective action 3aenvironmental science 3afood aid 3afood labeling 3afood policy 3afood safety 3ageography 3agovernance 3ainterdisciplinary research 3ainternational trade 3anutrition education 3anutrition science 3arural sociology 3aUnited States 0aPolicy 0aFood system 0aAlternative agrifood movement 0aResearch domain analysis1 aSharp, Jeff S.1 aDugan, Kristine L.0 tJournal of rural studies.g2015 Dec., v. 42 p.112-122dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245015400202300001100356520135200367592002801719596005901747650001201806650001201818650001701830650001101847650001501858650001401873650002301887650002201910650001801932650001001950650002401960650001401984650001101998650001702009650001902026650001102045650001202056650002102068650000902089650001002098700001502108700001802123700001702141700001402158773012702172856008302299852000902382655001202391IND60711096820221117223710.0210812e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071109682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-020-01464-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9899-944310aOverexpression of the bamboo sucrose synthase gene (BeSUS5) improves cellulose production, cell wall thickness and fiber quality in transgenic poplar  ap. 75.  aIn plants, sucrose synthase (SUS, EC 2.4.1.13) is widely considered a multifunctional protein involved in modulating sink strength, cellulose biosynthesis, and carbon partitioning. However, supporting genetic evidence regarding the role of SUS from bamboo in fiber development is lacking. Here, we obtained transgenic poplar lines overexpressing the bamboo BeSUS5 gene and conducted functional analysis. We found that overexpression of BeSUS5 enhanced the activity of SUS and significantly promoted the growth of the plants, especially xylem growth. In BeSUS5 overexpressed poplar plants, the total soluble sugar (TSS) and starch contents were decreased in leaves, while the cellulose content was increased in stems, indicating that overexpression of BeSUS5 might enhance the partitioning of carbon to cellulose in poplar. Consistent with these results, the expression of cellulose biosynthesis and phloem loading–related genes, such as cellulose synthase (CesA7), KORRIGAN (KOR), and sucrose transporter (SUT1), was upregulated in transgenic plants. As a result, transgenic poplars displayed not only an increase in cell wall thickness and cell wall crystallinity but also an altered stem fiber phenotype. Taken together, our results imply the vast potential of BeSUS5 for the genetic improvement of wood cellulose production and fiber quality.  aPublisher supplied data  a31400257cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aPopulus 3abamboos 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3acell walls 3acellulose 3acellulose synthase 3acrystal structure 3afiber quality 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3aphenotype 3aphloem 3aplant fibers 3aplant genetics 3astarch 3asucrose 3asucrose synthase 3awood 3axylem1 aWang, Lili1 aHu, Shanglian1 aLuo, Xuegang1 aCao, Ying0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2020 Oct., v. 16, no. 5 p.75-75dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949857x1614-29427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-020-01464-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007600172300001600248520140900264592002801673650002501701650001201726650001001738650001501748650002201763650001901785650001601804650001201820650002101832650001801853651001101871653002901882653002101911653001601932653001201948653001101960653001801971700001601989700006002005773010702065856008702172852000902259655001202268IND60532848520221120062329.0190405e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053284852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Loë, Rob C.10aFarmer perspectives on collaborative approaches to governance for water  ap. 191-205.  aCollective approaches are being used in rural areas in the western world to deal with a host of environmental problems. Agri-environmental measures designed to reduce environmental impacts at the farm scale are one common example. Also increasingly important are collaborative approaches to governance that engage diverse mixes of state and non-state actors, including farmers. Outcomes from these processes can place new costs and restrictions on farmers. At the same time, because of the extensive nature of agriculture, the success or failure of these processes can depend strongly on the extent to which farmers are willing participants. This paper explores the perspectives of farmers on collaborative processes for addressing water quality and quantity problems in Canada. Using a policy Delphi survey of 25 Canadian farmers who had experience with various kinds of collaborative processes, we reveal benefits and challenges for individual farmers, and for the agriculture sector as a whole. Study participants explicitly viewed the collaborative processes in which they had participated as a way to reduce the risk of government intervention and regulation. They also saw collaboration as an important way to educate other, non-farming participants about agriculture. Actor-specific insights such as the ones revealed through this work are needed to ensure the success of collaborative governance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3afarmers 3afarms 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3arisk reduction 3arural areas 3asurveys 3awater management 3awater quality 3aCanada 0aCollaborative governance 0aWater governance 0aAgriculture 0aFarmers 0aCanada 0aPolicy Delphi1 aMurray, Dan1 aSimpson, Hugh C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8308-25790 tJournal of rural studies.g2015 Dec., v. 42 p.191-205dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007500171300001600246520129900262592002801561650001301589650001401602650001001616650001801626650001801644650001701662650001001679653001401689653002001703653002301723653001201746653001601758700001701774700002001791700002401811700002201835700001901857700001601876700001501892773012201907856008502029852000902114655001202123IND60558288520221118010414.0161113e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055828852DNAL7 a10.1080/14942119.2016.12239262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNuutinen, Yrjö10aQuality and productivity in comminution of small-diameter tree bundles  ap. 179-187.  aBundling small-diameter trees from thinnings has become a viable technology with the development of the Fixteri harvester-bundler. Several studies have measured the productivity of the machine, however, bundling also influences the whole supply chain. A study was conducted to investigate the quality of chips and productivity of five different conventional chippers and one grinder when comminuting bundles produced of small-diameter trees. The productivity based on dry mass was on average 44.8 tonne per effective working hour (E ₀ H ⁻¹), and varied considerably between the machines; 1:2.3 being the observed relation between lowest and highest performance of machines. Productivity when comminuting bundles was 1.5–3.2 times higher than normally found in the literature for unbundled (loose) material. The quality of the produced fuel chips varied between machines in dry weight share of particle sizes <3.15 mm from around 5 to 35%. The average size of the chips varied between 5 and 20 mm. The study indicated that productivity and quality of fuel chips are dependent on machine type and the raw material processed. Further investigations should examine different machine systems in designed experiments where e.g. several assortments and operational environments are included.  aPublisher supplied data 3abundling 3aequipment 3afuels 3aparticle size 3araw materials 3asupply chain 3atrees 0aFuel wood 0aearly thinnings 0awhole-tree bundles 0aFixteri 0acomminution1 aPetty, Aaron1 aBergström, Dan1 aRytkönen, Matleena1 aDi Fulvio, Fulvio1 aTiihonen, Ismo1 aLauren, Ari1 aDahlin, Bo0 tInternational journal of forest engineering.g2016 Sept. 1, v. 27, no. 3 p.179-187dTaylor & Francisx1913-22207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14942119.2016.12239263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009600167300001800263520118500281592002801466650003201494650001701526650002201543650001801565650001501583650002401598700001701622700001301639773010201652856004801754852000901802655001201811IND50068002920221122051451.0130720e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006800292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-012-5584-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xiaoming,10aSensitive monitoring of RNA transcription levels using a graphene oxide fluorescence switch  ap. 2634-2639.  aCatalytic transfer of genetic information from DNA to RNA is very important in life activities. The unconventional RNA transcription level may be related to the source of genetic diseases. At present, conventional methods for detection of RNA transcripts usually involve cumbersome preparative steps, or require sophisticated laboratory equipments. In this study, we presented a rapid, sensitive nano-detection platform for monitoring of RNA transcript levels. T7 RNA polymerase transcription reaction is employed as the example to test the feasibility of this method. In this design, in vitro synthesized RNA products can be hybridized to the FAM labeled single strand DNA (ssDNA) probes which can be adsorbed onto the graphene oxide (GO) surface. Using GO as the fluorescence switch, excellent capacity of the signal-on fluorescence platform for detection of RNA transcripts level is demonstrated. Transcription levels sensing with this nano-platform achieved a sensitivity of 5 pmol/L transcription template. It is anticipated that current developed RNA transcript nano-detection mode has the potential to be an alternative to the conventional RNA transcript detection methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3afluorescence 3agenetic disorders 3amessenger RNA 3amonitoring 3asingle-stranded DNA1 aLiao, Yuhui,1 aXing, Da0 tChinese science bulletin.g2013 July, v. 58, no. 21 p.2634-2639dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5584-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100006200166245014700228300001800375520160200393592002801995650002302023650001302046650002002059650001802079650000802097650001402105650003602119650001402155650003002169650002202199650001902221650001002240651001102250653001602261700002102277700002502298700002202323700002202345700002502367700002202392773013802414856008102552852000902633655001202642IND60654886020221119000928.0190726e20161114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065488602DNAL7 a277669892pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145160034822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShvetsov, Yurii B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5131-961814aThe influence of energy standardisation on the alternate Mediterranean diet score and its association with mortality in the Multiethnic Cohort  ap. 1592-1601.  aThe alternate Mediterranean diet (aMED) score is an adaptation of the original Mediterranean diet score. Raw (aMED) and energy-standardised (aMED-e) versions have been used. How the diet scores and their association with health outcomes differ between the two versions is unclear. We examined differences in participants’ total and component scores and compared the association of aMED and aMED-e with all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality. As part of the Multiethnic Cohort, 193 527 men and women aged 45–75 years from Hawaii and Los Angeles completed a baseline FFQ and were followed up for 13–18 years. The association of aMED and aMED-e with mortality was examined using Cox’s regression, with adjustment for total energy intake. The correlation between aMED and aMED-e total scores was lower among people with higher BMI. Participants who were older, leaner, more educated and consumed less energy scored higher on aMED-e components compared with aMED, except for the red and processed meat and alcohol components. Men reporting more physical activity scored lower on most aMED-e components compared with aMED, whereas the opposite was observed for the meat component. Higher scores of both aMED and aMED-e were associated with lower risk of all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality. Although individuals may score differently with aMED and aMED-e, both scores show similar reductions in mortality risk for persons scoring high on the index scale. Either version can be used in studies of diet and mortality. Comparisons can be performed across studies using different versions of the score.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3aalcohols 3abody mass index 3aenergy intake 3amen 3amortality 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aneoplasms 3anutrition risk assessment 3aphysical activity 3aprocessed meat 3awomen 3aHawaii 0aDiet scores1 aHarmon, Brook E.1 aEttienne, Reynolette1 aWilkens, Lynne R.1 aLe Marchand, Loic1 aKolonel, Laurence N.1 aBoushey, Carol J.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2016 Nov. 14, v. 116, no. 9 p.1592-1601dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145160034823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009700171520147700268592002801745650001601773650002101789650000901810650001301819650001301832650001601845653002301861653001601884653001501900653001201915653001501927700001601942700002001958700001601978700001801994700006602012700006602078773010602144856008502250852000902335655001202344IND60761707920221120101207.0220307e20220515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076170792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2021.1126442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNajeeb, Jawayria10aSurfactant stabilized gold nanomaterials for environmental sensing applications – A review  aSurfactant stabilized Gold (Au) nanomaterials (NMs) have been documented extensively in recent years for numerous sensing applications in the academic literature. Despite the crucial role these surfactants play in the sensing applications, the comprehensive reviews that highlights the fundamentals associated with these assemblies and impact of these surfactants on the properties and sensing mechanisms are still quite scare. This review is an attempt in organizing the vast literature associated with this domain by providing critical insights into the fundamentals, preparation methodologies and sensing mechanisms of these surfactant stabilized Au NMs. For the simplification, the surfactants are divided into the typical and advanced surfactants and the Au NMs are classified into Au nanoparticles (NPs) and Au nanoclusters (NCs) depending upon the complexity in structure and size of the NMs respectively. The preparative methodologies are also elaborated for enhancing the understanding of the readers regarding such assemblies. The case studies regarding surfactant stabilized Au NMs were further divided into colorimetric sensors, surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) based sensors, luminescence-based sensors, and electrochemical/electrical sensors depending upon the property utilized by the sensor for the sensing of an analyte. Future perspectives are also discussed in detail for the researchers looking for further progress in that particular research domain.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolorimetry 3aelectrochemistry 3agold 3ananogold 3aresearch 3asurfactants 0aGold nanomaterials 0aSurfactants 0aPesticides 0aSensors 0aPollutants1 aFarwa, Umme1 aIshaque, Fatima1 aMunir, Hira1 aRahdar, Abbas1 aNazar, Muhammad Faizan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4168-40451 aZafar, Muhammad Nadeem1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2109-76010 tEnvironmental research.g2022 May 15, v. 208 p.112644-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1126443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014500168300001600313520161600329592002801945650001701973650002001990650001702010650001202027650001302039650001302052650001702065650002302082650001002105650001202115650001302127650001202140653001402152653001502166653001302181653001402194653002102208700001802229700002102247700002302268700002002291773012202311856008502433852000902518655001202527IND60558288620221118010700.0161113e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055828862DNAL7 a10.1080/14942119.2016.12266732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolgi, Ahmad10aEffect of varying machine ground pressure and traffic frequency on the physical properties of clay loam soils located in mountainous forests  ap. 161-168.  aThe aim of this study was to (a) assess the impact of two tractors (light and heavy) with different tire sizes and axle loads on forest soil physical properties and rut formation when subjected to different traffic frequencies, and (b) determine the relationships between the exerted ground pressure and soil bulk density. Treatments included five different traffic frequencies of the two tractors operated on two machine-operating trails with almost identical soil moisture content (20% in skidder trail and 21% in agricultural tractor trail). The light (Massey Ferguson 285) and heavy (Timberjack 450C) tractors were equipped with 750–18 and 24.5–32 single tires at the front and 18.4–30 and 24.5–32 single tires on the rear axle, respectively. The nominal ground pressures for the light and heavy tractors were 143.9 and 251.1 kPa at the front and 46.9 and 209.2 kPa at the rear axle, respectively. Bulk density in undisturbed areas ranged between 0.68 and 0.71 g cm ⁻³. In topsoil, one, three, five, and 10 passes of a light tractor caused mean bulk density values of 0.83, 0.98, 1.14, and 1.29 g cm ⁻³ respectively, while values for the heavy tractor inducing the same number of passes were 0.92, 1.15, 1.34, and 1.48 g cm ⁻³, respectively. Total porosity and macroporosity decreased considerably as both the number of passes and ground pressure increased. Ruts created by heavy tractor were, in all cases, deeper than the ones generated with the light tractor. Results indicated that traffic frequency and ground pressure had strong effects on the tested soil physical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3aclay loam soils 3aforest soils 3aforests 3aporosity 3askidders 3asoil density 3asoil water content 3atires 3atopsoil 3atractors 3atraffic 0aAxle load 0acompaction 0aporosity 0arut depth 0asoil disturbance1 aNaghdi, Ramin1 aLabelle, Eric R.1 aTsioras, Petros A.1 aNikooy, Mehrdad0 tInternational journal of forest engineering.g2016 Sept. 1, v. 27, no. 3 p.161-168dTaylor & Francisx1913-22207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14942119.2016.12266733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010700169300001600276520134900292592002801641650001301669650002501682650001101707650001101718650000901729650001101738650001401749650001001763650001101773651001201784700002101796700002001817700002701837773009101864856008501955990002302040852000902063655001202072IND60096256920221117015233.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009625692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cretres.2011.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHetzel, Almut10aGeochemical environment of Cenomanian - Turonian black shale deposition at Wunstorf (northern Germany)  ap. 480-494.  aMajor- and minor- element determinations were carried out on a high-resolution sample set obtained from a sediment drill core at Wunstorf (N. Germany). This study interval includes the black shale-bearing Hesseltal Formation associated with the Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE 2), also referred to as Cenomanian–Turonian Boundary Event (CTBE). Seven black shale packages, each containing several black shale layers, were defined by elevated TOC values, with black shale packages 1–4 deposited during OAE 2. Packages 5–7 extend above the level of the positive carbon-isotope excursion defining OAE 2, indicating that conditions favouring organic carbon burial must have prevailed longer in the Wunstorf Basin than elsewhere. Geochemical analyses revealed no significant differences between black shale packages deposited during and after OAE 2. Enrichment patterns of sulphur, iron and redox-sensitive and sulphide-forming trace metals point to suboxic to anoxic conditions existing at the sediment–water interface during black shale deposition, whereas sulphidic conditions prevailed deeper in the sediment. Variations in element/Al ratios follow cyclic patterns which are interpreted to represent climatically-induced changes in sediment supply. Reduced vertical mixing led to water-column stratification and caused black shale deposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aanaerobic conditions 3abasins 3acarbon 3airon 3amixing 3asediments 3ashale 3asulfur 3aGermany1 aMärz, Christian1 aVogt, Christoph1 aBrumsack, Hans-Jürgen0 tCretaceous research.g2011 Aug., v. 32, no. 4 p.480-494dElsevier Ltdx0195-66717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2011.03.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245007000211300002000281520125100301592002801552650001501580650002301595650001401618650002601632650000901658650002201667650001901689650001301708650001801721650001401739650003401753650003301787650002401820650001201844650001801856650001601874700002301890700001701913700005801930700002401988700002502012700002002037700002202057700006202079773011602141856008402257852000902341655001202350IND60675345020221121010539.0191105e20191009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067534502DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b020742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnesto, Valentina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2308-412610aKinetic Rate Constants of Gold Nanoparticle Deposition on Silicon  ap. 14258-14265.  aWe fabricated gold nanoparticles on nanoporous silicon microparticles using electroless deposition in a hydrofluoric acid solution containing gold chloride. The reaction was followed by UV spectrometer analysis of the absorbance of the solution (proportional to the nanoparticle concentration) for two temperatures (20 and 50 °C). The results indicate that the process is autocatalytic, described by a pseudo-first-order reaction, the apparent rate constant kₒbₛ of which was determined by utilizing UV spectrometer data. We found that the reaction rate constant at 20 °C is 7 × 10–³ s–¹ and that at 50 °C is 2.9 × 10–² s–¹. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of samples and diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) simulations were used to validate the results. This study aims to resolve the kinetics of the electroless deposition of gold on silicon at the nanoscale, in the present state of art missing a quantitative characterization, for certain conditions of growth and given values of temperature and concentration of the reagents. Results may have applications to the synthesis of gold nanoparticles and their use as nanosensors, drug delivery systems, or metal nanometamaterials with advanced optical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3acatalytic activity 3achlorides 3adrug delivery systems 3agold 3ahydrofluoric acid 3amicroparticles 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananopores 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensors (equipment) 3asilicon 3aspectrometers 3atemperature1 aGentile, Francesco1 aRusso, Mario1 aVillani, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9229-34901 aCandeloro, Patrizio1 aPerozziello, Gerardo1 aMalara, Natalia1 aFabrizio, Enzo Di1 aColuccio, M.

The higher increase in surface activity with coincidental increase in surface hydrophobicity was observed in gelatin modified with fatty acid ester having a longer chain, especially at the higher molar ratio. The increase in foam expansion was related with the improved surface activity mediated by the modification by N-hydroxysuccinimide esters of fatty acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSepiidae 3adecanoic acid 3adodecanoic acid 3afatty acid esters 3afoaming properties 3agelatin 3along chain fatty acids 3amyristic acid1 aBenjakul, Soottawat1 aVisessanguan, Wonnop1 aWierenga, Peter A.1 aGruppen, Harry0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2011 July, v. 25, no. 5 p.1277-1284dElsevier Ltdx0268-005X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2010.11.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100002000190245015100210300001600361500002400377500001500401520167300416650002202089650002702111650001002138650001402148650001402162650002202176650001402198650002402212650002002236650001402256650002002270650002402290650002502314650002202339650002502361650001202386650001802398650003302416650001502449650002602464650002302490650002202513650001402535651001202549651001202561653001802573653002802591653002302619653002302642700002602665700002502691773012102716852000902837856007502846930003302921945002502954946001302979655001202992IND4439564920221121122730.0100706e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443956492DNAL7 a206952712pmid7 a10.1603/ME100062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL700 0aL200 0aL001 0aL8211 aLeo, Sarah S.T.10aDeep Mitochondrial DNA Lineage Divergences Within Alberta Populations of Dermacentor albipictus (Acari: Ixodidae) Do Not Indicate Distinct Species  ap. 565-574.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe winter tick Dermacentor albipictus (Packard) has a single-host life cycle that allows it to reach severe infestation levels on ungulates, particularly moose, Genotypic variation within these and related ticks has been a source of taxonomic confusion, although the continuity in their morphology and life history has generally been interpreted as indicating the existence of a single species, To further investigate this variation, we sequenced regions of two mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes (COI and 16S rDNA), two nuclear genes (lysozyme and ITS-2), and two bacterial markers from Francisella-like endosymbionts found in these ticks (eubacterial mtDNA 16S rRNA and a homolog of Francisella tularensis [Dorofe'ev] 17-kDa lipoprotein). We sampled 42 D. albipictus individuals from whitetail and mule deer culled from three populations in east-central Alberta, as well as four D. albipictus and two Dermacentor variabilis (Say) from other locations, We then compared DNA sequence variation between the genes and related this to variation in the morphology of spiracle plates, Both mtDNA regions indicated two deeply diverged lineages (mean difference of 7.1% for COI and 4.5% for 16S) that would normally be considered diagnostic of distinct species in DNA barcoding studies. However, very little divergence was revealed by nuclear gene sequences, bacterial endosymbionts, and morphometric analyses, and any variation that did occur in these markers was not congruent with mtDNA divergences. We conclude that the sampled populations in Alberta represent a single species, D. albipictus, and reiterate the importance of integrative approaches in species delimitation. 3asequence analysis 3aDermacentor albipictus 3aticks 3aspiracles 3aungulates 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeny 3adivergent evolution 3arisk assessment 3abioassays 3agenetic markers 3apopulation genetics 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 3apopulation structure 2aAnimals 2aDNAxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aDemography 2aDermacentorxgenetics 2aGenetic Speciation 2aGenetic Variation 2aPhylogeny 3aAlberta 0aAlberta 0aectoparasites 0amolecular sequence data 0amolecular genetics 0apopulation ecology1 aPybus, Margaret Jean.1 aSperling, Felix A.H.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2010 July, v. 47, no. 4 p.565-574dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/ME100063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100913b20101001c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/08/12  aOther US 7aarticle01712naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245005500170300001600225520088500241592002801126653001701154653001601171653002301187773015401210856008501364852000901449655001201458IND60130994720221120233642.0151127e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013099472DNAL7 a10.4289/0013-8797.112.4.4832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEtnier, David A.10aNew Trichoptera Records from Arkansas and Missouri  ap. 483-489.  aAnalysis of about 69,000 Trichoptera from Arkansas and Missouri resulted in identification of six species previously unknown from Arkansas (i.e., Agraylea costello, Neotrichia collata, Orthotrichia curta, Oxyethira glasa, O. pescadori, Neureclipsis piersoni) and three species previously unknown from Missouri (i.e., Cheumatopsyche mollala, Hydroptila broweri, H. poirrieri).

The discovery of this animal, here named Zhuchengtyrannus magnus gen. et sp. nov., adds to the known diversity of tyrannosaurids in Asia. Z. magnus can be identified by a horizontal shelf on the lateral surface of the base of the ascending process, and a rounded notch in the anterior margin of the maxillary fenestra. Several additional features contribute to a unique combination of character states that serves to further distinguish Z. magnus from other taxa. Comparisons with other tyrannosaurids suggest that Zhuchengtyrannus was a very large theropod, comparable in size to both Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal taxonomy 3aanimals 3afossils 3anew geographic records 3apaleozoology 3aChina1 aWang, Kebai1 aSullivan, Corwin1 aZhao, Xijin1 aChen, Shuqing1 aLi, Dunjin1 aJi, Shuan1 aJi, Qiang1 aXu, Xing0 tCretaceous research.g2011 Aug., v. 32, no. 4 p.495-503dElsevier Ltdx0195-66717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2011.03.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245008100167300001600248520148700264592002801751650001701779650001501796650003801811650002001849650001101869650001901880650001101899650001601910650003001926650000901956650001501965650001401980650001501994650002202009650001902031651001802050700002202068700002002090773009502110856007902205852000902284655001202293IND60439575020221119223032.0151024e199708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043957502DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10030615014772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHokanson, Stan C.10aDirect comparison of pollen-mediated movement of native and engineered genes  ap. 397-403.  aDespite the commercial approval of twenty-five transgenic crops in the U.S. as of mid-1996, concern is still being expressed regarding the potential risks associated with genetically engineered crops. One recurring issue is the possibility of pollen-mediated escape of engineered genes into populations of crop wild relatives. To address this concern, the scientific community has depended on literature on pollen dispersal generated from non-transgenic organisms. Utilization of this information requires the assumption that the pollen mediated movement of native and transgenes is the same. To test the validity of this assumption, we directly compared the pollen-mediated gene movement of native and engineered marker genes using melon plants (Cucumis melo L.) expressing dominant morphological and transgenic traits. Movement into both contiguous border plots and non-contiguous satellite plots were monitored. Dispersal of the native gene and transgene into the satellite plots was identical. Dispersal of the two traits into the plot borders was nearly identical. Of the nearly 4600 seedlings screened for both morphological (presence of green vs. virescent cotyledons) and transgene movement (presence of NPT II protein by ELISA), in no case was the NPT II gene observed in the absence of green cotyledons. However, 39 seedlings were green but did not express NPT II as measured by ELISA. PCR analysis revealed transgene inactivation as a cause of the NPT II ELISA-seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis melo 3acotyledons 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenetic markers 3amelons 3aplant breeding 3apollen 3apollen flow 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3asatellites 3aseedlings 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3awild relatives 3aUnited States1 aHancock, James F.1 aGrumet, Rebecca0 tEuphytica.g1997 Aug., v. 96, no. 3 p.397-403dKluwer Academic Publishersx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10030615014773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007100170300002000241520184500261592002802106650001602134650001402150650001702164650001802181650002702199650001602226650001902242700005802261773011602319856008402435852000902519655001202528IND60675345220221121010840.0191105e20191016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067534522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b021562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShmyrov, Andrey10aSurface Diffusion in Gaseous Monolayers of an Insoluble Surfactant  ap. 14180-14187.  aSurface diffusion is an important mass transfer mechanism of surfactant molecules within adsorbed layers, which has to be taken into account in many fluid dynamics problems. Although considerable research has been devoted to studying the thermodynamic and rheological properties of surface films, rather less attention has been paid to surface diffusivity measurements. Current measurement methods, which are based on marking part of surfactant molecules in uniform motionless layers with the radiotracer or fluorescence technique, are well suited for use in quite condensed layers, but they do not work in rarefied layers due to increasing contribution of density fluctuations at an interface. In this study, we propose a method for measuring the surface diffusion coefficient in gaseous monolayers of an insoluble surfactant under dynamic conditions, i.e., in the presence of a flow at an interface. Our approach is based on measuring the velocity of thermocapillary flow on the water surface, which contains molecules of an insoluble surfactant. We show that under conditions of the balance between thermo- and solutocapillary tangential stresses the convective motion exists at an interface, which is caused by a blurring of the surface concentration gradient of surfactant molecules due to the surface diffusion mechanism. For calculations of the surface diffusion coefficient, we use the equation proposed earlier in the theoretical study [Homsy, G. M.; et al.J. Fluid Mech.1984139,443−459]. The surface diffusion coefficient measured by us in gaseous layers is 2–3 orders of magnitude larger than the results for liquid-expanded and liquid-condensed layers obtained by other researchers. Finally, we compare the obtained results with the known measurements of surface diffusion and discuss the limitations of the proposed method.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiffusivity 3aequations 3afluorescence 3amass transfer 3arheological properties 3asurfactants 3athermodynamics1 aMizev, Aleksey1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5233-82710 tLangmuir.g2019 Oct. 16, v. 35, no. 44 p.14180-14187dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b021563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245010900196300001600305500002000321520120600341592002801547596009201575596006201667596007001729596005401799596005901853596005901912650001501971650001301986650001401999650002602013650001602039650000902055650001402064650001302078650001202091700002002103700002002123700001302143700001802156700001902174700005402193773013002247856007502377852000902452655001202461IND60788202120221121065004.0220811e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078820212DNAL7 a10.1002/jeq2.200182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Weizhao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4411-182110aEffects of seepage velocity and concentration on chromium(VI) removal in abiotic and biotic iron columns  ap. 654-662.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aContinuous‐flow iron and bio‐iron columns were used to evaluate the effects of seepage velocity and concentration on Cr(VI) removal from groundwater. Solid‐phase analysis showed that microorganisms accelerated iron corrosion by excreting extracellular polymeric substances and generated highly reactive minerals containing Fe(II), which gave the bio‐iron column a longer life span and enhanced capacity for Cr(VI) removal via enhanced adsorption and reduction by reactive minerals. The bio‐iron column showed much higher Cr(VI) removal capacity than the iron column with increasing Cr(VI) loading, which was obtained by increasing the seepage velocity or influent Cr(VI) concentration from 95 to 1138 m yr⁻¹ and from 5 to 40 mg L⁻¹, respectively. When the Cr(VI) loading varied in a range of 0 to 10 mg L⁻¹ h⁻¹, the bio‐iron column had a 60% longer longevity and one‐ to sixfold higher Cr(VI) elimination capacity than the iron column. This result indicated that, under fluctuating hydraulic conditions [e.g., seepage velocity and Cr(VI) concentration], the presence of microorganisms can significantly boost Cr(VI) removal using Fe⁰–based permeable reactive barriers.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016-26cWater Resource Science and Technology Innovation Program of Guangdong Province  a201803030036cScience and Technology Project of Guangzhou  a21618343cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a2018YFC1802802cNational Key R&D Program of China  a41571302cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41807338cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aadsorption 3achromium 3acorrosion 3aenvironmental quality 3agroundwater 3airon 3alongevity 3apolymers 3aseepage1 aFang, Zhanqiang1 aHuang, Jingling1 aLi, Ping1 aZhong, Jiawei1 aChiang, Penchi1 aWu, Jinhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8139-22340 tJournal of environmental quality.g2020 May, v. 49, no. 3 p.654-662dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.200183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011500172300001600287520162900303592002801932650001101960650001201971650002501983650001402008650002102022650001102043650002502054650001902079650001202098650001902110650001202129650002402141651001002165653001902175653001902194653002202213653001002235653002302245700002402268700002002292700001902312773010002331856008502431852000902516655001202525IND60524295320221120140954.0160706e20160807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052429532DNAL7 a10.1080/17565529.2015.10671812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDutta, Venkatesh10aEvaluating expert opinion on India's climate policy: opportunities and barriers to low-carbon inclusive growth  ap. 336-350.  aIn 2009, India set a voluntary target of reducing the emission intensity of GDP by 20–25% below 2005 levels by 2020, a commitment to be met while ensuring that poverty alleviation and economic growth are not compromised. This paper presents findings from an analysis of expert opinions on India's domestic climate policy, the opportunities and bottlenecks in transitioning to a low-carbon inclusive growth paradigm, with special emphasis on two key energy intensive sectors, transport and power. The findings reveal a consensus among experts that, while India has successfully initiated several programmes for ensuring development of its economy along low-carbon pathways, achieving a desirable level of emission reduction constitutes a challenge. Ensuring that a broader development agenda remains viable while constructively addressing emissions calls for changes in a number of complementary policy factors. Inadequacy of the current institutional structure, inadequate financial resources, inefficient subsidy systems, limited opportunities for global partnership and over-reliance on regulatory approaches for reducing carbon emissions limit the success of announced climate policy measures. India can overcome its huge backlog of infrastructure requirements by adopting a low-carbon growth path in transport and power sectors in particular. Declarations of energy and climate priorities, when accompanied by adequate technology transfer and diffusion, and investments in institutional capacity and complementary policy factors, are key elements of success for a low-carbon inclusive growth agenda in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aeconomic development 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3aenergy 3aenvironmental policy 3aexpert opinion 3aexperts 3ainfrastructure 3apoverty 3atechnology transfer 3aIndia 0aclimate change 0aclimate policy 0alow-carbon growth 0aIndia 0aemission reduction1 aDasgupta, Purnamita1 aHultman, Nathan1 aGadag, Gayatri0 tClimate and Development.g2016 Aug. 7, v. 8, no. 4 p.336-350dTaylor & Francisx1756-55377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2015.10671813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01831naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245010900166300001600275520077000291592002801061650002501089650001001114650001401124650000901138650001101147650001201158650001501170650001101185650001901196650001301215650001101228650001201239700002301251773009501274856007901369852000901448655001201457IND60439575120221119222912.0151024e199708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043957512DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10030656183152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKopsell, Dean a.10aShort-day onion cultivars differ in bulb selenium and sulfur accumulation which can affect bulb pungency  ap. 385-390.  aThe close chemical similarity of S and Se allow for antagonistic behavior between the two elements. To determine variation for Se accumulation within onions, sixteen short-day cultivars were grown under high level (2.0 mg Na₂SeO₄ per litre) and no Se treatments. Selenium accumulation in bulb tissues was cultivar dependent, ranging from 60 to 113 µg Se per g dry wt. High Se fertility enhanced bulb S accumulation. Pungency was reduced in some cultivars grown under Se fertility when compared to the no Se treatment indicating that although S uptake was enhanced, S metabolism in the flavour precursor biosynthetic pathway was affected. The existing variability in onion Se uptake and accumulation have important implications for Se intake in mammalian diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical pathways 3abulbs 3acultivars 3adiet 3aflavor 3amammals 3ametabolism 3aonions 3aplant breeding 3aselenium 3asulfur 3atissues1 aRandle, William M.0 tEuphytica.g1997 Aug., v. 96, no. 3 p.385-390dKluwer Academic Publishersx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10030656183153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011200165300001800277520108900295592002801384650001501412650002501427650001101452650001501463650001901478650001701497650001101514650002301525650001001548700001901558700001801577700001901595700001301614773010201627856008101729852000901810655001201819IND60519202520221117225357.0160421e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051920252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-016-9924-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Huating10aPd-doped organosilica membrane with enhanced gas permeability and hydrothermal stability for gas separation  ap. 6275-6286.  aA Pd-doped organosilica membrane based on bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane is successfully developed by the polymeric sol–gel method. Its microstructure, chemical composition, and separation performance are compared with those of the undoped organosilica membrane. Gas adsorption analysis indicates that the Pd-doped organosilica membrane has larger micropores compared with the undoped organosilica membrane. The gas permeation results show that the Pd-doped organosilica membrane has much higher gas permeances than the undoped organosilica membrane due to the enlarged micropores after Pd-doping. The Pd-doped organosilica membrane also exhibits a significantly improved hydrothermal stability. The enhanced hydrothermal stability can be explained by the mechanism that Pd particles act as inhibitors and prevent the formation of mobile silica groups (e.g., Si–OH) under steam condition. Metal-doping (e.g., Pd-doping in this work) may offer a new approach to develop high performance membranes with enhanced gas permeances and hydrothermal stabilities in gas separation applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemical composition 3aethane 3amicropores 3amicrostructure 3apermeability 3asilica 3asol-gel processing 3asteam1 aZhao, Shuaifei1 aLei, Jiaojiao1 aWang, Chenying1 aQi, Hong0 tJournal of materials science.g2016 July, v. 51, no. 13 p.6275-6286dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-016-9924-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245015300185300001600338520169300354592002802047650002402075650001302099650001802112650002102130650002002151650001002171650001702181650001502198650001002213650001002223650001602233650001402249650001402263650002202277650002702299650001202326651001002338651001002348651001802358700001902376700002602395700001802421700002502439773011702464856008102581852000902662655001202671IND60120004520221122014806.0151126e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012000452DNAL7 a255107282pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-014-0351-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Mingliang10aTaxonomy and phylogeny of the Leptographium procerum complex, including Leptographium sinense sp. nov. and Leptographium longiconidiophorum sp. nov.  ap. 547-563.  aLeptographium procerum (Ophiostomatales, Ascomycota) is a well-known fungal associate of pine root-infesting bark beetles and weevils, occurring in several countries of the world. The fungus is not a primary pathogen but has been associated with white pine root decline in the USA and with serious damage caused by the introduced red turpentine beetle (RTB) Dendroctonus valens in China. Several species closely related to L. procerum have been described during the past decade. The aim of this study was to reevaluate species boundaries in the L. procerum complex using multigene phylogenetic analyses and morphological comparisons. Phylogenetic analyses of seven gene regions (ITS2-LSU, actin, β-tubulin, calmodulin, translation elongation factor 1-α, and the mating type genes MAT1-1-3 and MAT1-2-1) distinguished between nine species in the complex. These included L. procerum, L. bhutanense, L. gracile, L. profanum, L. pini-densiflorae, L. sibiricum, L. sinoprocerum, as well as two new species described here as Leptographium sinense sp. nov. from Hylobitelus xiaoi on Pinus elliottii in China, and Leptographium longiconidiophorum sp. nov. from Pinus densiflora in Japan. Leptographium latens is reduced to synonymy with L. gracile, and an epitype is designated for L. procerum, because a living culture associated with the holotype of L. procerum did not exist. Amplification patterns of the mating type genes suggest that all known species in the L. procerum complex are heterothallic, although sexual states have not been observed for any of the species. The results also suggest that Eastern Asia is most probably the centre of species diversity for the L. procerum complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendroctonus valens 3aHylobius 3aLeptographium 3aPinus densiflora 3aPinus elliottii 3aactin 3abark beetles 3acalmodulin 3afungi 3agenes 3anew species 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 3atranslation (genetics) 3atubulin 3aChina 3aJapan 3aUnited States1 aDuong, Tuan A.1 aWingfield, Michael J.1 aZhou, Xudong,1 aBeer, Z.

It is essential to establish a method of determining PIs residues in food. A new method for simultaneously determining 10 kinds of PIs in milk has been established by using solid‐phase microextraction (SPME) combined with a simple method of protein precipitation as the pretreatment approach and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry as the detecting technique. The limits of detection for 10 PIs in different milks were between 0.05 and 1.4 μg/L (skimmed milk), between 0.07 and 2.2 μg/L (semi‐skimmed milk), between 0.11 and 4.4 μg/L (whole milk), respectively. The recoveries were from 71.5% to 133.5%, and the relative standard deviations were less than 15%. Twelve kinds of packed milk with different brands and fat contents were determined using this method.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3afood contamination 3afood packaging 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apackaging materials 3askim milk 3asolid phase microextraction 3astatistical analysis 3awhole milk1 aZhao, Chunxia1 aZhang, Yajing1 aChen, Yanjie0 tJournal of food science.g2016 May, v. 81, no. 5 p.T1336-T1341dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.132683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01802naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245005700165300001600222520088900238592002801127650002001155650001101175650001401186650001101200650002101211650001501232650001501247700001801262700001301280700002001293773009401313856004801407852000901455655001201464IND4530056820221119044146.0160229e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453005682DNAL7 a10.1007/s12223-010-0042-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrmanovÃ¡, M.10aSurvival of bifidobacteria in adult intestinal tract  ap. 281-285.  aThe âcocktailâ of human origin rifampicin-resistant bifidobacteria (RRBs) and RRBs from commercial products was administrated to 9 volunteers aged from 22 to 46 years and the survival ability in gastrointestinal tract of these strains was determined.

This is due to rapid defloration of inflorescences of mutant plants. Thus, the use of the mutant form determinate floret cluster in breeding allows creating early maturing buckwheat cultivars with increased productivity potential. A further increase in productivity of the mutant form is related to selection for increasing the number of inflorescences per stem.

The monitoring of its residues was important for evaluating the potential risk to human beings. Immunoassays with good accuracy and simplicity are great analytical tools for small molecule contaminants. However, it is typically confined in a competitive mode for small molecules with drawback of the sensitivity curbing. In this work, three different phages displayed peptides with capability of identifying the xanthyl ethyl carbamate immunocomplex were isolated from phage library. The binding mechanism of peptides and immunocomplex was studied by computer-assisted simulation. Results indicated that the xanthydrol group of xanthyl ethyl carbamate and the Asn-32 and Asn-92 residues of the antibody light chain were mainly responsible for binding. Simultaneously, a sensitive non-competitive immunoassay for detecting ethyl carbamate in wine samples was developed. The established method exhibited a limit of detection of 5.4 ng/mL and a linear range from 8.7 ng/mL to 32 ng/mL for wine samples. In comparison with the conventional competitive immunoassay, the sensitivity of the proposed non-competitive immunoassay was improved by 17-fold. The results of the immunoassay were validated by a standard ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry, which illustrated good reliability of the proposed assay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA libraries 3aantibodies 3acarcinogens 3adetection limit 3aethyl carbamate 3afermentation 3ahumans 3aimmunoassays 3amass spectrometry 3apeptides 3arisk 3awines 0aNon-competitive ELISA 0aImmune complex 0aComputer simulation 0aPeptide displayed phage 0aEthyl carbamate1 aChen, Zi-Jian1 aWang, Hong1 aLuo, Lin1 aWang, Yu1 aHuang, Ri-Ming1 aXu, Zhen-Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1197-46151 aHammock, Bruce0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 406 p.124288-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1242883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005400146245009000200300002000290520101100310592002801321650002301349650001101372650001101383650001701394650002301411700005701434773013801491856008001629852000901709655001201718IND60662771320221122004445.0190906e20190813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066277132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b042112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yukun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6799-123810aBond Nature of Raman Shift in CdSeₓS₁–ₓ Nanocrystals: A Bond-by-Bond Approach  ap. 21751-21756.  aOwing to the alloying effect, the bond composition of CdSeₓS₁–ₓ nanocrystals is complex. To reveal the bond nature of the Raman red shift in complex-alloyed nanocrystals, we propose the concept of a basic bond unit for nanocrystalline alloy systems. An alloyed nanocrystal can be decomposed into basic bond units according to a bond-by-bond approach. A local-mode model of alloyed nanocrystals is developed, which is applied to determine the Raman red shift of the destination bonds in a basic bond unit. Using this theory, the Raman spectra of CdSeₓS₁–ₓ nanocrystals are obtained. The calculated Raman curves are in good agreement with the experimental ones, indicating that the concept of basic bond unit can well demonstrate the chemical bond nature of the Raman spectra of the alloyed nanocrystals. Based on the strategy of breaking up the whole alloyed nanocrystal into basic bond units, the nanosize effect of Raman shifts may be accurately predicted even just by a pocket calculator.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aalloys 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3aphysical chemistry1 aYin, Penggang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6796-59210 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Aug. 13, v. 123, no. 35 p.21751-21756dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b042113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03439naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245012800188300001600316520186600332592002802198650001802226650001902244650002102263650001902284650002502303650002602328650002402354650001002378650004202388650001502430650001502445650002202460650004302482650001602525650001802541650001402559651001402573700001602587700002202603700002202625700001502647700001602662700001602678700002002694773011702714856008102831852000902912655001202921IND60120004720221122001912.0151126e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012000472DNAL7 a255273912pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-014-0353-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVega-Avila, A.

However, the differential structuring of rhizosphere microbial communities due to plant cultivation under differential agricultural practices remains to be described for most plant species. Here we describe the rhizosphere microbiome of grapevine cultivated under conventional and organic practices, using a combination of cultivation-independent approaches. The quantification of bacterial 16S rRNA and nifH genes, by quantitative PCR (qPCR), revealed similar amounts of these genes in the rhizosphere in both vineyards. PCR-DGGE was used to detect differences in the structure of bacterial communities, including both the complete whole communities and specific fractions, such as Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and those harboring the nitrogen-fixing related gene nifH. When analyzed by a multivariate approach (redundancy analysis), the shifts observed in the bacterial communities were poorly explained by variations in the physical and chemical characteristics of the rhizosphere. These approaches were complemented by high-throughput sequencing (67,830 sequences) based on the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene, identifying the major bacterial groups present in the rhizosphere of grapevines: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes, Acidobacteria, Cloroflexi, Verrucomicrobia and Planctomycetes, which occur in distinct proportions in the rhizosphere from each vineyard. The differences might be related to the selection of plant metabolism upon distinct reservoirs of microbial cells found in each vineyard. The results fill a gap in the knowledge of the rhizosphere of grapevines and also show distinctions in these bacterial communities due to agricultural practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aVerrucomicrobium 3aVitis vinifera 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3abacterial communities 3abeta-Proteobacteria 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ametabolism 3amicrobiome 3aplant development 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal RNA 3avineyards 3aArgentina1 aGumiere, T.1 aAndrade, P.

But in researching how the term is interpreted by consumers, new dimensions are opening, which can be used as a guide in preparation of educational material for consumers. In the paper the authors analyse statements made by consumers when answering the question, “How do you interpret the term food safety?” The results are part of an extensive research titled “Consumers and Food Safety”, which took place from January to March in 2006 involving 1030 respondents from different places in Slovenia. Findings of quota sample show considerable terminological diversity among statements made by respondents regarding a description of the term “safe food”. Based upon the code assignment, five single-meaning thematic categories were identified: A: Harmless for health, B: Healthy food, C: Production method, D: Technological procedure, E: Surveillance. The answers with extensive content included more onetheme categories and were classified in category F. This category indicates the complex comprehension of the term food safety and the need to understand the relations between the answers. The results show a connection between 38.4% of consumers’ statements in category A (harmless for health), and a definition of food safety which mentions the term “without hazards”.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood safety 3ahealthy diet 3amonitoring 3aSlovenia 0aconsumer 0afood safety 0aqualitative content analysis1 aHlebec, V.1 aRaspor, P.0 tActa alimentaria.g2008 Dec. 1, v. 37, no. 4 p.437-448dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.2008.00183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245011700207300001600324520175300340592002802093650002102121650001702142650003102159650001502190650001602205650001702221650001702238650001902255650001602274650001202290650002402302650003302326650001002359650001902369650001102388650002002399650001302419650001402432650001302446653001802459653001802477653001702495653001902512653002202531700001902553700001302572700005402585700002302639700002202662700002402684700001802708700001802726773010702744856008402851852000902935655001202944IND60629752120221118093059.0190202e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062975212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2018.01.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDexter, Jason1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3195-881210aHeterologous expression of mlrA in a photoautotrophic host – Engineering cyanobacteria to degrade microcystins  ap. 926-935.  aIn this report, we establish proof-of-principle demonstrating for the first time genetic engineering of a photoautotrophic microorganism for bioremediation of naturally occurring cyanotoxins. In model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 we have heterologously expressed Sphingopyxis sp. USTB-05 microcystinase (MlrA) bearing a 23 amino acid N-terminus secretion peptide from native Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 PilA (sll1694). The resultant whole cell biocatalyst displayed about 3 times higher activity against microcystin-LR compared to a native MlrA host (Sphingomonas sp. ACM 3962), normalized for optical density. In addition, MlrA activity was found to be almost entirely located in the cyanobacterial cytosolic fraction, despite the presence of the secretion tag, with crude cellular extracts showing MlrA activity comparable to extracts from MlrA expressing E. coli. Furthermore, despite approximately 9.4-fold higher initial MlrA activity of a whole cell E. coli biocatalyst, utilization of a photoautotrophic chassis resulted in prolonged stability of MlrA activity when cultured under semi-natural conditions (using lake water), with the heterologous MlrA biocatalytic activity of the E. coli culture disappearing after 4 days, while the cyanobacterial host displayed activity (3% of initial activity) after 9 days. In addition, the cyanobacterial cell density was maintained over the duration of this experiment while the cell density of the E. coli culture rapidly declined. Lastly, failure to establish a stable cyanobacterial isolate expressing native MlrA (without the N-terminus tag) via the strong cpcB560 promoter draws attention to the use of peptide tags to positively modulate expression of potentially toxic proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSphingomonas 3aSynechocystis sp.

Detection of various diseases, deficiencies, and factors impacting crops’ productivity is one of the major ongoing research in this field. This paper considers various machine learning and deep learning techniques (transfer learning) for rice disease detection. In this study three different rice diseases viz. bacterial blight, rice blast, and brown spot are considered. A detailed comparative analysis of the results indicates the superiority of transfer learning techniques over conventional machine learning techniques. It is observed that InceptionResNetV2 achieves the best result followed by XceptionNet. This work can be incorporated in assisting the farmers for early diagnosis of rice disease so that future course of action may be taken on time. For future studies, efforts should be directed to work with bigger datasets so as to generalize the findings of the experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural research 3ablast disease 3ablight 3adata collection 3adisease detection 3aearly diagnosis 3arice 0aDeep learning 0amachine learning 0arice disease diagnosis 0atransfer learning1 aKumar, Chandan Jyoti1 aDeka, Aniruddha0 tArchiv für Phytopathologie und Pflanzenschutz.g2022 Feb. 3, v. 55, no. 3 p.259-283dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl49030x1477-29067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2021.20158663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009100168300001600259520164700275592002801922650001601950650002101966650002201987650001302009650002002022650003202042650002002074650001002094650002902104650002202133650001302155650001802168650001802186650001602204650002902220653002702249653002002276653002802296653002502324653002702349653002202376700001702398700001802415700001202433700001902445700001802464773014502482856008402627852000902711655001202720IND60543657620221119152555.0161024e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054365762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2013.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaojun10aLong-term effect of temperature on N2O emission from the denitrifying activated sludge  ap. 298-304.  aThe long-term effect of various temperature (4°C, 12°C, 20°C, 25°C and 34°C) on nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from lab-scale denitrifying activated sludge was studied in terms of activation energy, abundance of functional gene nosZ and its transcription. Results showed that temperature had a positive effect on N2O emissions as well as the maximum biomass-specific reduction rates of N2O and NO3−, ranging from 0.006% to 0.681% of (N2O + N2), 17.3–116.2 and 5.2–66.2 mg N g−1 VSS h−1, respectively. The activation energies (Ea) for N2O and NO3− reduction of 44.1 kJ mol−1 and 54.9 kJ mol−1, shed light on differences in denitrifying rate variation. The maximum NO3− reduction rates were more sensitive to temperature variation than the corresponding N2O reduction rates under long-term acclimation. As a result, the ratio between N2O and NO3− reduction rates declined to 1.87 at 34°C from 3.31 at 4°C, suggesting great potential capacity for N2O losses at high temperature. The copy numbers of denitrifiers as nosZ gene (×108 copies mL−1) and total bacteria as 16S rRNA gene (×1010 copies mL−1) did not show obvious relationship with temperature, having relative abundance of 0.42% on average. The transcriptional regulation of nosZ gene, in the range of 108–105 copies mL−1, was affected by reductase activity, substrate concentration as well as its duration.

Here, we showed the differential regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase in silkworm (Bombyx mori) pupae. B. mori tyrosine hydroxylase (BmTH) was expressed in the epidermis during development or in the fat body during infection, which indicates that the differential expression of BmTH is responsible for cuticular melanization or innate immunity. The melanin of the silkworm pupal cuticle formed a melanization complex with Beauveria bassiana and this effect showed an antifungal activity, indicating that melanin in silkworm pupal cuticle plays a role in the defense against fungal pathogens. Finally, we found that the differential expression of BmTH is involved in pupal cuticular melanization and adult pigmentation as well as the innate immunity of silkworms, demonstrating a differential regulation of BmTH in a tissue-specific manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aBombyx mori 3aadults 3aantifungal properties 3afat body 3afungi 3agene expression regulation 3ainnate immunity 3amelanin 3amelanization 3apathogens 3aprophenoloxidase 3apupae 3asilkworms 3atyrosine 3-monooxygenase 0aBombyx mori 0aCuticular melanization 0aDevelopment 0aInnate immunity 0aTyrosine hydroxylase1 aKim, Bo Yeon1 aJin, Byung Rae0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2015 Dec., v. 18, no. 4 p.765-770dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society.wJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2015.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245013000166300001600296520134400312592002801656650001601684650001201700650001701712650002701729650002101756650002101777650001801798650001801816650001301834650001601847650001301863650002501876653001701901653003201918653001201950653002301962653001601985700001402001773009502015856008102110852000902191655001202200IND60479772720221119182111.0160123e20081201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047977272DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.2008.00172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayaloglu, A.

Two of these were <i>Lc. lactis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> UC317 and NCDO763, while four of them were <i>Lc. lactis</i> subsp. <i>cremoris</i> SK11, HP, Wg2 and AM2. To determine their performance in manufacture of Beyaz cheesemaking, the activity of six different strains of <i>Lactococcus</i> were monitored during cheese production by determining the curd acidity. Also, their proteolytic and lipolytic activities were tested by determining nitrogen fractions and free fatty acid contents, respectively, after 3 days of ripening. These cheeses made with each strain of <i>Lactococcus</i> did not differ significantly in pH decline during cheesemaking. The gross compositions of the fresh cheeses were found to be similar; however, the cheeses made with HP and Wg2 had the lowest and highest levels of salt-in-moisture content, respectively. Water-soluble nitrogen, 12% trichloroacetic acid soluble nitrogen, total free amino acid and total free fatty acid contents were significantly influenced by using different strains of lactococci in manufacture of Beyaz peynir.

We find that R&D intensity has a positive effect on firm growth rate while R&D scale a negative effect on the firm growth rate at the upper quantile, whereas the result is opposite at the lower quantile. Firm size has a mixed relationship with sales growth at the upper quantile, thus Gibrat&rsquo;s law is rejected in the Korean pharmaceutical industry. Firm age has a negative relationship with the sales growth rate at the upper quantile, which shows the consistent result with previous research that young firms grow faster. Patent persistence has a negative relationship with sales growth at the upper quantile, while a positive effect at the lower quantile. We show that young firms and firms with high R&D intensity contribute to the high growth rate, while the relationship is not clear at the lower quantile. Therefore, policy implication in this research is that the government should pay attention to encouraging and supporting R&D investment activities and small firms as well as consider ways to enhance patent rights.  aPublisher supplied data 3aissues and policy 3apharmaceutical industry 3aregression analysis 3aresearch and development 3asales 3aKorean Peninsula1 aEum, Soomin 1 aLee, Chulung 0 tSustainability.g2019 May 20, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su111028653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01469naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009700158300001800255520035100273592002800624650001300652650002300665650001900688650001900707650001800726650001000744650001900754650001100773650001800784700001700802700001700819700002300836700001900859773013400878856007401012852000901086655001201095IND60634500520221118065932.0190323e20190321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063450052DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc10102g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujita, Kyoko10aHydrated ionic liquids enable both solubilisation and refolding of aggregated concanavalin A  ap. 3578-3581.  aThe dissolution and refolding of aggregated concanavalin A have been achieved, in hydrated ionic liquids containing a limited number of water molecules.

The factors of biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance and motility contribute great to A. baumannii in persisting in stressed environment, and further leads to nosocomial infections. 70 A. baumannii clinical isolates were investigated for their clinical characteristics of infection. Among the tested strains, 54 (77.1%) isolates were obtained from ICUs, with the frequency of multidrug-resistance (MDR) at 55.7%, and that of extensively drug-resistance (XDR) at 31.4%. 97.1% of the clinical isolates could form biofilms, in which 4.3% possessed weak biofilm formation ability, while 41.4% and 51.4% were moderate and strong biofilm producers, respectively. A strong correlation between antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation ability was found that all the resistant strains could form biofilms, with the majority in moderate and strong levels, but 2.9% sensitive isolates had no such ability. However, the sensitive strains that could produce biofilms showed stronger biofilm formation capacity in the early stage before 24 h compared to the resistant isolates, though they became weaker afterwards. 24 biofilm-related genes and two blaOXA genes were found in both biofilm-forming and non-biofilm-forming strains, but with higher prevalence in the strains that could produce biofilms. No correlation was detected between twitching motility with antibiotic susceptibility or biofilm formation. These results raised a viewpoint that examining timepoint is a key factor for determining the biofilm formation ability, and further highlighted the importance of the appropriate surveillance and control measures in preventing the emergence and transmission of MDR and XDR A. baumannii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter baumannii 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiofilm 3across infection 3amonitoring 3amultiple drug resistance 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aphenotype 0aBiofilm formation 0aMotility 0aBiofilm-related genes1 aZhang, Sirui1 aMi, Peng1 aLiu, Yuqing1 aXun, Meng1 aYang, E1 aAi, Li1 aHan, Lei1 aChen, Yanjiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0900-17340 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2021 June, v. 155 p.104922-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2021.1049223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245017900202300002000381520147900401592002801880650001501908650001101923650003001934650003401964650001301998650001502011650002002026650002202046650002602068650001502094650002902109700005502138700001702193700001902210700005702229773013802286856008002424852000902504655001202513IND60662771620221122004320.0190906e20190812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066277162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b044492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Siby1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7928-411910aPhographene as a High-Performance Anode Material with High Specific Capacity and Fast Li Diffusion: From Structural, Electronic, and Mechanical Properties to LIB Applications  ap. 21345-21352.  aThe progress of ecofriendly, clean, and sustainable energy resources always demands suitable anode materials for batteries with high structural stability and superior storage capacity. Herein, we use density functional theory predictions to examine the potential features of newly proposed planar membranes consist of 5-, 6- and 8- membered carbon rings, named as α- and β-phographene (PhoG). Our calculations disclose that both α- and β-PhoG structures possess high structural, thermal, and mechanical stability with intrinsic metallic characteristics. We have further extended our calculations of PhoG as a suitable anode material for use in Lithium-ion batteries. Our results reveal the Li adsorption in PhoG is exothermic and the α-PhoG show a higher theoretical specific capacity of Li₂.₄C₆ for Li atoms (892 mAh g–¹) compared to the LiC₆ of graphite. We also found that both the α- and β-PhoG structures show fast Li mobility with a low diffusion barrier for Li atoms (<0.30 eV) as well as low average open circuit voltage (∼0.26 V). Our findings show that both the PhoG structures, especially α-PhoG, are suitable anode candidates for use in future Li-ion batteries owing to the metallic characteristic combined with the low open circuit voltage, low diffusion barrier, high Li storage capacity, and high thermo-mechanical stability. Our results would supply guidelines to develop better high-capacity anode materials for future Li-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanodes 3adensity functional theory 3aelectric potential difference 3agraphene 3aguidelines 3aheat production 3alithium batteries 3amechanical properties 3aprediction 3arenewable energy sources1 aLee, Chi Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0127-00591 aJana, Saibal1 aJun, Byeongsun1 aLee, Sang Uck1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9596-23490 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Aug. 12, v. 123, no. 35 p.21345-21352dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b044493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245009500175300001600270520155900286592002801845650002101873650002101894650002101915650002601936650001701962650002501979650003002004650002802034650001702062650001402079650001302093650001502106650001102121651002102132653001702153653001702170653001602187653001802203653001502221700001802236700001902254700001802273700002002291700001902311700001802330700001802348700001902366773023502385856008402620852000902704655001202713IND60543657920221119152511.0190411e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054365792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2015.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Kyungjae Andrew10aComparative bioactivities of mastoparans from social hornets Vespa crabro and Vespa analis  ap. 825-829.  aVespa crabro and V. analis are social hornet species commonly found in Asia, including Korea. Mastoparan is one of the major venom peptides of these two hornets but its amino acid sequence defers substantially. To examine the differences in the potential toxicity and bioactivity of mastoparans between these two social hornets, differential toxicological and pharmacological activities of synthesized mastoparan were investigated. V. analis mastoparan showed a 7-fold higher hemolytic activity, suggesting its higher cytotoxic potential compared with V. crabro mastoparan. Mastoparans from both hornet species exhibited similar levels of antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Botrytis cinerea, whereas the mastoparan from V. analis showed more potent antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. Nevertheless, the antimicrobial activities of mastoparans of V. crabro and V. analis were relatively lower compared with those of other wasps. Both mastoparans also exhibited some levels of antitumor activity but the activity was significantly higher in V. analis mastoparan. In summary, the hemolytic, antimicrobial, and antitumor activities of synthesized V. analis mastoparan were higher than those of V. crabro mastoparan. These differential bioactivities are likely due to the amino acid sequence differences in the mature peptides. In particular, the additional Lys residue present in V. analis mastoparan may contribute to the higher levels of bioactivity as proposed by secondary structure prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aCandida albicans 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aVespa crabro 3aamino acid sequences 3aanti-infective properties 3aantineoplastic activity 3acytotoxicity 3ahemolysis 3apeptides 3aprediction 3avenoms 3aKorean Peninsula 0aVespa crabro 0aVespa analis 0aVenom gland 0aVenom peptide 0aMastoparan1 aKim, Kyungmun1 aNguyen, Phuong1 aSeo, Jong Bok1 aPark, Young Han1 aKim, Ki-Gyoung1 aSeo, Hong-yul1 aKoh, Young Ho1 aLee, Si Hyeock0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2015 Dec., v. 18, no. 4 p.825-829dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society.wJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2015.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01617naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245007500202300001800277520038800295592002800683650001200711650001000723650002300733650002300756650001700779650000900796650003300805700001500838700001600853700001500869700002100884700001200905700001500917700002100932700001800953700001900971773013400990856007401124852000901198655001201207IND60634500620221118070024.0190323e20190321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063450062DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc10166c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYangThese authors contributed equally to this work., Jian10aHalf-curcumin analogues as PET imaging probes for amyloid beta species  ap. 3630-3633.  aIn this report, we demonstrate that half-curcuminoid could be a better scaffold for PET tracer development.

Infectivity assays for adenovirus incorporated cell culture and reverse transcription real-time PCR, where viral mRNA detection was used to monitor the progress of adenovirus infection (CC/mRNA qPCR). The cell line used was G293. This specific infectivity assay was calibrated against different initial concentrations of human adenovirus 41. In addition, the expression of the host's housekeeping (HK) gene, GAPDH, served as internal control for the mRNA assays for quality assurance of the mRNA extraction and reverse transcription steps. The concentrations of infectious human adenoviruses in different sewage samples were estimated semi-quantitatively using the CC/mRNA qPCR assay and calibration obtained for adenovirus 41. A linear relationship between concentrations of viral mRNA (hexon gene) and infectious units was observed between 107 to 101 infectious units per assay (R2 = 0.97) in samples analyzed 3–5 days post infection. The expressions of host cell GAPDH gene were not significantly affected by infections with different concentrations of human adenovirus 41, and between virus positive and negative cell cultures (p > 0.1). The estimated concentrations of human adenoviruses in sewage samples ranged between 102 to 103 mRNA-IU/L. Most of the viruses detected in sewage samples were from human adenovirus species F. The CC/mRNA qPCR assay can be used for quantifying infectious human adenovirus 41, estimating the levels of human adenoviruses in sewage samples, and applied to other sample settings. The CC/mRNA qPCR protocol described here represents an improvement in the detection of human enteric adenoviruses by reducing incubation time (5 days); whereas the conventional cell culture method requires longer incubation periods (10–20 days). More importantly, this protocol can be used to more rapidly and semi-quantitatively estimate the levels of infectious human adenoviruses in environmental samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3amessenger RNA 3ahumans 3asewage 3acell culture 3aAdenoviridae infections 3aHuman mastadenovirus F 3apathogenicity 3agenes 3areverse transcription 3aviruses 3aquality control 2aAdenoviruses, Humanxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aCalibration 2aCapsid Proteinsxgenetics 2aCell Culture Techniquesxmethods 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGlyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (Phosphorylating)xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aReference Standards 2aSewagexvirology 0aEnteric adenovirus 0aDetection 0aCC/mRNA 0aReal-time PCR 0aHuman adenovirus F1 aPolston, Patsy M.1 aWu, Ming Jing1 aWu, Jianyong1 aSobsey, Mark D.0 tWater research.g2013 June 01, v. 47 p.3183-3191dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2013.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245013200215500001900347520163200366592002801998650002102026650001702047650001602064650000902080650001702089650001102106650001102117650001502128650001202143650001802155650001602173650001902189653001602208653003002224653002402254653002802278653002902306653003402335700002102369700002302390773010102413856008802514852000902602655001202611IND60735735320221121232844.0210519e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073573532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2021.1049592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, Michael T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0653-646612aA multi-tracer and well-bore flow profile approach to determine occurrence, movement, and sources of perchlorate in groundwater  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe purpose of this study is to determine the occurrence, movement, and sources of perchlorate in groundwater using a comprehensive set of environmental tracers coupled with discrete borehole data. Potential sources of perchlorate to groundwater at the study site have been attributed to waste disposal and industrial activities as well as to past agricultural operations. Perchlorate concentrations in samples ranged from <1 to 40 μg/l, with a median of 6.1 μg/l. Concentrations were relativity consistent with depth except at one site where dilution may be occurring due to the infiltration of surface water from Pyrite Creek. Well-bore flow profiles indicated that perchlorate redistribution was occurring via intra-well bore flow at one site where up to 14,000 mg/year of perchlorate could be moving from the shallower to the deeper zones of the alluvial aquifer. Natural attenuation processes of perchlorate do not appear to be widespread in groundwater but do occur in portions of the aquifer adjacent to the Santa Ana River, likely limiting the mobility of perchlorate from the southernmost extent of the mapped plume to areas farther down-gradient. Age dating tracers indicate that the advective transport of perchlorate originating from the waste disposal ponds has largely moved through the zones of the aquifer sampled. Age distributions, noble gas temperature, delta neon values and stable isotopes of water indicate that a substantial fraction of perchlorate in groundwater may have been mobilized from the unsaturated zone and/or is from the infiltration of storm water runoff originating from Pyrite Canyon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvial aquifer 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3aneon 3aperchlorates 3apyrite 3arivers 3astormwater 3astreams 3asurface water 3atemperature 3awaste disposal 0aPerchlorate 0aGroundwater contamination 0aAge and gas tracers 0aStaple isotopic tracers 0aWell-bore flow profiling 0aDepth dependent water qaulity1 aIzbicki, John A.1 aJurgens, Bryant C.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2021 June, v. 129 p.104959-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2021.1049593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002200167245012700189300001600316520148400332592002801816653001401844653001801858653002601876653001601902653001201918653002501930700002501955773014101980856011502121852000902236655001202245IND60128249120221122061741.0151115e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012824912DNAL7 a10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[122:BAPCOB]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeefelt, Nancy E.10aBioenergetics and Prey Consumption of Breeding Double-crested Cormorants in the Beaver Archipelago, Northern Lake Michigan  ap. 122-133.  aColonial waterbirds are an important component of Great Lakes ecosystems. In order to investigate the role these birds play in an aquatic food web, bioenergetics models, using allometric equations, were applied to breeding double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) and their offspring in the Beaver Archipelago, northern Lake Michigan. These models were parameterized using detailed information collected during the 2000 and 2001 breeding seasons, as well as literature values. Each breeding season was divided into stages in the models to reflect changes in cormorant diet and population size documented in the study area. The models estimated the total prey biomass consumed as 1,445 metric tonnes (mt) of prey in 2000, and 1,585 mt of prey in 2001. Each year, the majority of the prey biomass was alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), with these fish comprising a greater percentage of prey biomass consumed in 2001. An increase in cormorant reproductive success in 2001 may be linked to this increase in alewife biomass consumed; the breeding bird population size, however, declined in 2001 as compared to 2000. The other prey items, which are not considered to be species of commercial or sport value, were also important contributors to bird diet and consumption of these species did tend to vary from year-to-year. Overall, the application of bioenergetics models allows for greater understanding of the role of cormorants as predators and as energy links in the system.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCormorant 0abioenergetics 0aPhalacrocorax auritus 0aGreat Lakes 0aalewife 0aallometric equations1 aGillingham, James C.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2008 Mar., v. 34, no. 1 p.122-133dInternational Association for Great Lakes Researchx0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3394%2F0380-1330%282008%2934%5B122%3ABAPCOB%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245013100162300002000293520143400313592002801747650001301775650001401788650001301802650001301815650002301828650002901851650002301880650002401903650001701927650001201944700001401956700001701970773009901987856007902086852000902165655001202174IND60519945020221119012945.0160511e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051994502DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.132702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanach, J.C.10aInstrumental and Sensory Texture Attributes of High‐Protein Nutrition Bars Formulated with Extruded Milk Protein Concentrate  ap. S1254-S1262.  aPrevious instrumental study of high‐protein nutrition (HPN) bars formulated with extruded milk protein concentrate (MPC) indicated slower hardening compared to bars formulated with unmodified MPC. However, hardness, and its change during storage, insufficiently characterizes HPN bar texture. In this study, MPC80 was extruded at 2 different conditions and model HPN bars were prepared. A trained sensory panel and instrumental techniques were used to measure HPN bar firmness, crumbliness, fracturability, hardness, cohesiveness, and other attributes to characterize texture change during storage. Extrusion modification, storage temperature, and storage time significantly affected the instrumental and sensory panel measured texture attributes. The HPN bars became firmer and less cohesive during storage. When evaluated at the same storage conditions, the texture attributes of the HPN bars formulated with the different extrudates did not differ significantly from each other. However, textural differences were noted most of the time between the control and the HPN bars formulated with extruded MPC80. An adapted HPN bar crumbliness measurement technique produced results that were correlated with sensory panel measured crumbliness (r = 0.85) and cohesiveness (r = –0.84). Overall, the HPN bars formulated with extruded MPC80 were significantly softer, less crumbly, and more cohesive than the control during storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohesion 3aextrusion 3afirmness 3ahardness 3ahigh protein foods 3amilk protein concentrate 3asensory evaluation 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3atexture1 aClark, S.1 aLamsal, B.P.0 tJournal of food science.g2016 May, v. 81, no. 5 p.S1254-S1262dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.132703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013000168300001800298520128800316592002801604650001501632650001901647650001701666650001201683650002201695650001901717650001401736650001401750650000901764650001301773650001501786653001701801653002601818653001201844653002501856653002401881700001401905700001801919773008401937856008402021852000902105655001202114IND60088334920221116174231.0160901e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008833492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2013.03.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZong, Wansong10aOxidation by-products formation of microcystin-LR exposed to UV/H2O2: Toward the generative mechanism and biological toxicity  ap. 3211-3219.  aThe presence of microcystins (MCs) in water sources is of concern due to their direct threats to human health and potential to form oxidation by-products (OBPs) in finished water. To control the environmental risk of MCs related OBPs, we evaluated their generative mechanisms and biological toxicity by mass spectrometry technology and molecular toxicity experiment. Exposed to UV/H2O2, model toxin microcystin-LR (MCLR) in clean water was quickly transformed but successively generated seven types of MCLR-OBPs with the chemical formulas of C49H74N10O13, C49H76N10O14, C49H78N10O16, C49H76N10O15, C37H58N10O12, C33H54N10O12, and C34H54N10O12. Probable isomers for each MCLR-OBP type were then separated and identified, indicating the aromatic ring and conjugated diene in Adda and the CC bond in Mdha were the major target sites of oxidation. Though subsequent toxicology data showed the toxicity of MCLR-OBPs on protein phosphatases 1 and 2A decreased with the extending of treatment by and large, they still possessed considerable biological toxicity (especially for product d). Influenced by MCLR-OBP distribution, concentration and residual toxicity, the secondary pollution of MCLR-OBPs in drinking water also deserved further attention even though MCLR was totally destroyed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3adrinking water 3ahuman health 3aisomers 3amass spectrometry 3amicrocystin-LR 3aoxidation 3apollution 3arisk 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 0aMicrocystins 0aOxidation by-products 0aUV/H2O2 0aGenerative mechanism 0aBiological toxicity1 aSun, Feng1 aSun, Xiaojing0 tWater research.g2013 June 01, v. 47 p.3211-3219dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2013.03.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245015100173520168400324592002802008650001002036650001602046650002502062650002702087650001002114650001602124650001502140650001802155650000902173650001802182650002302200650002102223650001602244650001702260650002002277650002302297650001402320650001602334650001702350650001002367700002802377700002802405700001702433700002702450700002002477773012502497856008402622852000902706655001202715IND60763418920221122215805.0220120e20211224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076341892DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation80100032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoontiam, Waewaree 10aGrowth Performance, Nutrient Digestibility, Blood Profiles, and Gut Integrity of Growing Pigs Fed Pickled Fish Residue with Decreased Salt Content  aThis study investigated the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood profiles and gut integrity of growing pigs, in response to an increase in pickled freshwater fish residue (PFR) intake following a decrease in salt content. Ninety-six crossbred growing pigs [(Landrace × Large White) × Duroc] with a body weight of 23.65 ± 0.24 kg were randomly assigned to one of four treatments (6 pens/treatment, 4 pigs/pen) in a randomized complete block design. The treatments included: a corn-soybean meal based diet without PFR inclusion (CON) or with PFR addition at 5 (PFR5), 10 (PFR10), and 15% (PFR15), respectively. Desalting via soaking and stirring caused a positive reduction in the salt present on the surface of PFR. Over the 42-day feeding period, an increased level of PFR quadratically increased gain:feed ratio such that gain:feed ratio for PFR10 was greater than that for CON (p < 0.05). Pigs fed PFR10 had greater crude protein digestibility, and lower aspartate aminotransferase and crypt depth than those fed the CON diet (p < 0.05). The linear improvements in crude protein and ether extract digestibility, duodenal villus height, and villus:crypt ratio were observed as the PFR content increased (p < 0.05). However, there were no significant effects on average daily feed intake, dry matter and ash digestibility, blood metabolites (total Ca, P, creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase). Altogether, up to 10% PFR can be included in corn-soybean meal diet without impairing protein digestibility and hepatic enzyme alteration. In fact, administering PFR with lower salt content to growing pigs ultimately promotes their growth performance and gut integrity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aLarge White 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood 3abody weight 3acreatinine 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestible protein 3adigestive system 3afeed intake 3afermentation 3afreshwater fish 3agrowth performance 3alandraces 3ametabolites 3asalt content 3avilli1 aKitipongpysan, Sumetee 1 aWachirapakorn, Chalong 1 aHong, Jinsu 1 aGawborisut, Somsamorn 1 aSaeeaw, Amporn 0 tFermentation.g2021 Dec. 24, v. 8, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation80100033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245010900200300001400309500001900323500002000342520172700362592002802089650002002117650001602137650000902153650001602162650001102178650002002189650001402209650002402223650001202247700006002259700005902319773011702378856007302495852000902568655001202577IND60722297420221120022339.0210101e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072229742DNAL7 a10.1111/vsu.135232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranklin, Phil H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4513-263510aNebulization of epinephrine to reduce the severity of brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome in dogs  ap. 62-70.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To determine the preoperative and postoperative effect of nebulized epinephrine on brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS) severity in dogs. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Thirty‐one client‐owned pugs, French bulldogs, and English bulldogs with moderate to severe BOAS. METHODS: Whole body barometric plethysmography was used to determine BOAS severity (BOAS index; 0%–100%) prior to and after nebulization with 0.05 mg/kg epinephrine diluted in 0.9% saline preoperatively. The same protocol was repeated postoperatively (within 24 hours of surgery). RESULTS: Five dogs were excluded because they did not tolerate nebulization, and postoperative data were available for 13 dogs. Epinephrine nebulization resulted in a decreased BOAS index across all breeds of dog both before (9.6% [3.1% to −30.2%], n = 26) and after surgery (14.3% [0.9% to −24.3%], n = 13). The preoperative reduction in BOAS index was greater (17.3% [1.8% to −27.4%]) in dogs with a baseline BOAS index >70% (P = .006) and in pugs (16.9% [0.8% to −27.4%]) compared with French bulldogs (5.2% [3.1% to −30.2%], P = .03). Simple linear regression was used to identify a positive relationship between baseline BOAS index and reduction in BOAS index for pugs (n = 10, P = .001). Nausea was noted as a side effect in four dogs. CONCLUSION: Nebulized epinephrine reduced the BOAS index of dogs in this study. This effect was clinically significant in preoperative dogs with a BOAS index >70% and in dogs recovering from surgery. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides evidence to support the use of nebulized epinephrine in the perioperative management of BOAS‐affected dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aatomization 3adogs 3aepinephrine 3anausea 3aplethysmography 3aprotocols 3aregression analysis 3asurgery1 aLiu, Nai‐Chieh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1919-14121 aLadlow, Jane F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8076-40210 tVeterinary surgery.g2021 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.62-70dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10192x0161-34997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vsu.135233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003700166245012700203300001600330520133000346592002801676650000801704650002301712650002801735650001001763650001901773650001001792650001301802650001601815650002501831650000701856650001801863650002201881651001001903700002101913700002101934773011701955856008102072852000902153655001202162IND60120005320221123011353.0151126e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012000532DNAL7 a253913532pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-014-0332-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSultanpuram, Vishnuvardhan Reddy10aStreptomyces alkalithermotolerans sp. nov., a novel alkaliphilic and thermotolerant actinomycete isolated from a soda lake  ap. 337-344.  aAn alkaliphilic actinomycete, strain AC3ᵀ, was isolated from Lonar soda lake, in India. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis it was identified that the strain belongs to the class Actinobacteria and was most closely related to Streptomyces sodiiphilus JCM 13581ᵀ (96.4 % sequence similarity), Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii DSM 42122ᵀ (96.1 %), Streptomyces albus NRRL B-2365ᵀ (96.1 %), Streptomyces panacagri Gsoil 519ᵀ (96.0 %), Streptomyces fimbriatus NBRC 15411ᵀ (95.9 %) and other members of the genus Streptomyces (<95.9 %).The strain formed a well separated clade in the genus Streptomyces based on the 16S rRNA gene analysis of all of the validly named Streptomyces species. Strain AC3ᵀ was observed to produce light-cream substrate and white aerial mycelia on most tested media. The optimum pH for growth was determined to be 9.5–10.0 with no growth at pH 7.0. The DNA G+C content of strain AC3ᵀ was determined to be 71.2 mol %. The results of the polyphasic analysis allowed a clear differentiation of strain AC3ᵀ from all other members of the genus Streptomyces. Strain AC3ᵀ is thus considered to represent a novel member of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces alkalithermotolerans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AC3ᵀ (=KCTC 29497ᵀ = JCM 30167ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aStreptomyces albus 3aStreptomyces fimbriatus 3agenes 3aheat tolerance 3alakes 3amycelium 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3aIndia1 aMothe, Thirumala1 aMohammed, Farooq0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2015 Feb., v. 107, no. 2 p.337-344dSpringer International Publishingx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-014-0332-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100003300156245011500189300001800304520213800322592002802460650001702488650002502505650002702530650002502557650001802582650000902600650003102609650001202640650001802652700001902670773008702689856009002776852000902866655001202875IND60090527020221122050700.0141102e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009052702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKothapalli, Chandrasekhar R.10a3D matrix microenvironment for targeted differentiation of embryonic stem cells into neural and glial lineages  ap. 5995-6007.  aThe onset of neurodegenerative disorders is characterized by the progressive dysfunction and loss of subpopulations of specialized cells within specific regions of the central nervous system (CNS). Since CNS has a limited ability for self-repair and regeneration under such conditions, clinical transplantation of stem cells has been explored as an alternative. Although embryonic stem cells (ESCs) offer a promising therapeutic platform to treat a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, the niche microenvironment, which could regulate their differentiation into specialized lineages on demand, needs to be optimized for successful clinical transplantation. Here, we evaluated the synergistic role of matrix microenvironment (type, architecture, composition, stiffness) and signaling molecules (type, dosage) on murine ESC differentiation into specific neural and glial lineages. ESCs were cultured as embryoid bodies on either 2D substrates or within 3D scaffolds, in the presence or absence of retinoic acid (RA) and sonic hedgehog (Shh). Results showed that ESCs maintained their stemness even after 4 days in the absence of exogenous signaling molecules, as evidenced by Oct-4 staining. RA at 1 μm dosage was deemed optimal for neural differentiation and neurite outgrowth on collagen-1 coated substrates. Significant neural differentiation with robust neurite outgrowth and branching was evident only on collagen-1 coated 2D substrates and within 3D matrigel scaffolds, in the presence of 1 μm RA. Blocking α6 or β1 integrin subunits on differentiating cells inhibited matrigel-induced effects on neural differentiation and neurite outgrowth. Hydrogel concentration strongly regulated formation of neural and astrocyte lineages in 1 μm RA additive cultures. When RA and Shh were provided, either alone or together, 3D collagen-1 scaffolds enhanced significant motor neuron formation, while 3D matrigel stimulated dopaminergic neuron differentiation. These results suggest a synergistic role of microenvironmental cues for ESC differentiation and maturation, with potential applications in cell transplantation therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD29 antigen 3acell transplantation 3acentral nervous system 3aembryonic stem cells 3ahydrocolloids 3amice 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3aretinoic acid1 aKamm, Roger D.0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Aug., v. 34, no. 25 p.5995-6007dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.04.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245019100208300002000399520189800419592002802317650001602345650001802361650002102379650001102400650002102411650001502432650001602447650001102463650001902474650000902493650001502502650001102517650002302528650001702551650001302568650001702581650001402598700001802612773013802630856008002768852000902848655001202857IND60662772020221120213227.0190906e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066277202DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b047182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahrokhian, Saeed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3138-657810aHigh-Performance, Flexible, All-Solid-State Wire-Shaped Asymmetric Micro-Supercapacitors Based on Three Dimensional CoNi₂S₄ Nanosheets Decorated–Nanoporous Ni–Zn–P Film/Cu Wire  ap. 21353-21366.  aDemand increasing for next generation portable and miniaturized electronics has aroused much interest to explore microscale and lightweight energy storage devices. Herein, we demonstrate successful development of flexible wire-shaped micro-supercapacitors (micro-SCs) based on novel CoNi₂S₄/E-NZP film@Cu wire electrode. The etched Ni–Zn–P (E-NZP) film was synthesized by directly deposition of NZP film on Cu wire, followed by a chemical etching process. Alkaline etching treatment provides a micro- and mesoporous structure with high surface area and facilitates the penetration of electrolyte ions into the electrode matrix. Then, CoNi₂S₄ nanosheets as electroactive material are electrochemically grown onto the E-NZP film@CW electrode under a constant potential. The synergistic effects contributed by various components inside the CoNi₂S₄/E-NZP@CW electrode deliver superior performances with a high specific capacitance of 1.12 F cm–¹, 8.9 F cm–², and 889.68 F cm–³ at 4 mA cm–², outstanding rate capability (0.66 F cm–¹, 5.3 F cm–², and 529.02 F cm–³ at 80 mA cm–²) and long-term cycling stability (93.4% capacitance retention after 7000 cycles). Moreover, a flexible solid-state asymmetric micro-SC is fabricated using CoNi₂S₄/E-NZP film @CW as the positive electrode and rGO-coated carbon fiber (rGO/CF) as the negative electrode. The fabricated device exhibits high length, areal and volumetric capacitances of CL: 40 mF cm–¹, CA: 0.241 F cm–² and CV: 18.54 F cm–³, good mechanical stability with a maximum energy (EL, 18 μW h cm–¹; EA, 108.4 μW h cm–²; and EV, 8.34 mW h cm–³), and power densities (PL, 1454 μW cm–¹; PA, 9280 μW cm–²; and PV, 716.9 mW cm–³). This work provides a new and facile approach to develop high-performance wire-shaped electrodes as a new generation in energy storage applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon fibers 3achemical etching 3acopper 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3agraphene oxide 3aions 3ananosheets 3anickel 3aphysical chemistry 3aporous media 3asulfides 3asurface area 3asynergism1 aNaderi, Leila0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 123, no. 35 p.21353-21366dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b047183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245016800183300001600351500001500367520126100382592002801643650001301671650002401684650001101708650001001719650002501729650001001754650001601764650001701780650001601797650000801813650001401821650001001835650003801845650003801883650002401921650001201945650001801957650001601975650002001991650001502011650002802026650004102054650002802095650002402123650004602147650004202193650002602235650001002261650002902271650004102300653001602341653002102357653001402378700002202392700002202414773009602436856008102532852000902613655001202622IND4414834720221118005027.0151024e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441483472DNAL7 a190969042pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-008-0288-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReuter, Gábor10aComplete nucleotide and amino acid sequences and genetic organization of porcine kobuvirus, a member of a new species in the genus Kobuvirus, family Picornaviridae  ap. 101-108.  a2019-12-06  aKobuvirus is a new genus in the family Picornaviridae. Two species are currently known: Aichi virus (human kobuvirus) and Bovine kobuvirus (U-1). In this study, the complete nucleotide and amino acid sequences and genetic organization of porcine kobuvirus (Kobuvirus/swine/S-1-HUN/2007/Hungary, EU787450) were determined. The structure of the S-1-HUN genome, VPg–5′UTR–leader protein–structural proteins (VP0, VP3, VP1)–non-structural proteins (2A–2C, 3A–3D)–3′UTR–poly(A) tail, was found to be typical of picornavirus. The 8210-nucleotide (nt)-long RNA genome contains a large open reading frame (7467 nt) encoding a potential polyprotein precursor of 2488 amino acids (aa) that has 57/56% and 63/64% nt/aa identity with Aichi virus and U-1, respectively. The 5′UTR contains a hepacivirus/pestivirus-like internal ribosomal entry site (IRES type IV group-B-like) with conserved pseudoknot, II and IIIa–f domains. A tandem repeat (a 30-amino-acid-long motif) was detected in 2B. Thirty-nine (65%) of the 60 fecal samples from pigs under the age of 6 months at the tested farm were positive (the incidence was 90% under the age of 3 weeks). Porcine kobuvirus belongs to a potential new species—the third—in the genus Kobuvirus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3aopen reading frames 3agenome 3afarms 3aamino acid sequences 3afeces 3aamino acids 3aAichivirus B 3anew species 3aRNA 3anew genus 3aswine 2a3' Untranslated Regionsxgenetics 2a5' Untranslated Regionsxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aFecesxvirology 2aGene Order 2aGenome, Viralxgenetics 2aKobuvirusxclassificationxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPicornaviridaexclassificationxgenetics. 2aPicornaviridae Infectionsxveterinary 2aRNA, Viralxchemistry 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxvirology 2aViral Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 0aAichi virus 0aBovine kobuvirus 0aKobuvirus1 aBoldizsár, Ákos1 aPankovics, Péter0 tArchives of virology.g2009 Jan., v. 154, no. 1 p.101-108dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-008-0288-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245014600168300001600314500001900330500002000349520192000369592002802289650001002317650001502327650001102342650001102353650001902364650002602383650001702409650002002426650001202446700002002458700002202478773011902500856007302619852000902692655001202701IND60722297520221120024424.0210101e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072229752DNAL7 a10.1111/vsu.135342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez‐Lopez, Javier10aIncisional complications after skin closure with n‐butyl cyanoacrylate or stainless‐steel skin staples in horses undergoing colic surgery  ap. 186-195.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of incisional complications after skin closure with n‐butyl cyanoacrylate (NBC) or stainless‐steel skin staples (SS) after ventral midline celiotomy for colic surgery in the horse. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study (2014‐2018). ANIMALS: Two hundred eighteen horses. METHODS: Medical records of horses that underwent exploratory celiotomy for colic were included when the skin was closed with NBC or SS and the horse survived ≥15 days after surgery. Records and a follow‐up questionnaire were used to determine in‐hospital and posthospital discharge incisional complications. Associations between variables were assessed by using bivariable and multivariable analysis. RESULTS: The cutaneous incision was closed with SS in 113 of 218 (51.8%) horses and with NBC in 105 of 218 (48.2%) horses. Follow‐up information was available in 166 of 218 horses. Five horses with incisional complications prior to discharge but without follow‐up were included in the overall analysis. Incisional complications were recorded in 17.5% (30/171) of horses, including 19.1% (17/89) of closures with SS and 15.9% (12/82) of closures with NBC (P = .54). Complications occurred before discharge in 14 of 218 (6.4%) horses and after discharge in 16 of 166 (9.6%) horses. Four horses with in‐hospital incisional complications (surgical site infection) developed a second complication after discharge (hernia). Packed cell volume was a risk factor for in‐hospital incisional complications (P = .04), and in‐hospital incisional complications were associated with posthospital discharge incisional complications (P = .01). CONCLUSION: Occurrence of incisional complications did not differ between NBC and SS. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: N‐butyl cyanoacrylate is a suitable alternative to SS to close the cutaneous incision for ventral midline celiotomy for colic surgery in the horse.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolic 3ahematocrit 3ahernia 3ahorses 3aquestionnaires 3aretrospective studies 3arisk factors 3astainless steel 3asurgery1 aBrown, James A.1 aWerre, Stephen R.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2021 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.186-195dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10192x0161-34997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vsu.135343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01678naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007600157520079000233592002801023650002401051650001801075650001201093650001801105700001801123700001901141700001801160773012701178856007401305852000901379655001201388IND60652958120221120103639.0190713e20190520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065295812DNAL7 a10.3390/su111028692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoh, Jaimin 10aDo Analysts Fully Reflect Information in Patents about Future Earnings?  aThis study investigates the relationship between a firm&rsquo;s intellectual property (measured by patents) and its future business performance and information environments by focusing on financial analysts&rsquo; forecasting behavior. The results show that patent citations have more influence on future profitability than patent counts and financial analysts pay more attention to firms with patent citations by showing higher followings for those firms. However, the findings also suggest that analyst forecasts do not fully reflect the implications of the effect of patent citations on future earnings and this under-valuation can mislead investors. Thus, we conclude that financial analysts &lsquo;partially&rsquo; improve the information environment in terms of patent citations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic investment 3ahuman capital 3apatents 3aprofitability1 aLee, Jaehong 1 aHur, Wonchang 1 aJu, Yunchang 0 tSustainability.g2019 May 20, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su111028693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245015200197300001600349500001900365500002000384520173800404592002802142596004602170650001002216650001602226650002402242650002602266650001202292700001902304700005602323700002502379700005802404773011902462856007302581852000902654655001202663IND60722297620221117155755.0210101e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072229762DNAL7 a10.1111/vsu.135382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRengert, Roger1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0683-531910aMorphology of the cisterna chyli in nine dogs with idiopathic chylothorax and in six healthy dogs assessed by computed tomographic lymphangiography  ap. 223-229.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To describe the morphology of the lymphatics in the region of the cisterna chyli in healthy dogs and in dogs with idiopathic chylothorax by using computed tomographic lymphangiography. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: Nine dogs with idiopathic chylothorax and six healthy dogs. METHODS: Computed tomographic lymphangiograms were reviewed to evaluate the number of cisterna chyli branches, total cross‐sectional area of the branches normalized to the cross‐sectional area of the aorta, number of branches with cross‐sectional area greater than 25% of the aorta cross‐sectional area, and ratio of the total perimeter to the total cross‐sectional area of the branches. Data (mean ± SD) were compared between unaffected dogs and dogs with idiopathic chylothorax. RESULTS: The cisterna chyli included more branches in dogs with chylothorax (4.30 ± 1.57) than in unaffected dogs (1.67 ± 0.56, P = .02), occupying a relative perimeter approximately double that in unaffected dogs (P < .001). The relative cross‐sectional area of the cisterna chyli was approximately twofold smaller in affected (0.73 ± 0.35) than in unaffected (1.63 ± 0.91, P = .02) dogs. The fraction of dogs with branches greater than 25% of the cross‐sectional area of the aorta tended to be larger in unaffected dogs (P = .07). Most larger branches were located dorsal or to the right of the aorta. CONCLUSION: The cisterna chyli of dogs with idiopathic chylothorax contained smaller and more numerous branches compared with that of unaffected dogs. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Altered cisterna chyli morphology may impact the surgical approach for cisterna chyli ablation in dogs with idiopathic chylothorax.  aPublisher supplied data  cOntario Veterinary College Pet Trust Fund 3aaorta 3achylothorax 3acomputed tomography 3aretrospective studies 3asurgery1 aWilkinson, Tom1 aSingh, Ameet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8095-93391 aBrisson, Brigitte A.1 aFransson, Boel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9515-81820 tVeterinary surgery.g2021 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.223-229dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10192x0161-34997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vsu.135383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245007900166300001400245520156200259592002801821650001501849650001401864650002701878650002801905650002401933650001701957650002301974650001601997650001302013650001402026650002402040650001802064650001902082650002002101650002002121650002302141650001202164650002202176650001502198650001302213650002202226650001002248650002002258653001202278653002302290653001202313653001402325653001902339653004102358773009302399856008202492852000902574655001202583IND60479773420221119182047.0160123e20091101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047977342DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.38.Suppl.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGelencsér, É.10aNovel research strategy for safe use of legume proteins in human nutrition  ap. 61-70.  aEarlier studies on protein antinutrients and allergens naturally present in legume seeds have shown that these compounds are responsible for the impaired performance of experimental animals when exposed for a long term. These reactions were characterized by lowered nutritional performance, reduced growth, pure digestion and absorption, changes in gut motility, structural damage in small intestine and diarrhoea. A lot of efforts were made for gathering data on heat stability and resistance to chemical or enzyme treatments of these compounds to reduce or eliminate these harmful effects.A novel research approach has described that these compounds have a special regulatory role in the gut metabolism and modulate hormone and immune responses which resulted in a novel concept of “nonnutritive biologically active compound”. These studies revealed that the chemical structure of these compounds was responsible for the induction of such physiological reactions as increased endogen N-loss, change in the plasma amino acid concentration or plasma lipid composition with reduction of total cholesterol level or developing of harmful immune responses to luminal antigens resistant to the gut digestion. Resent studies were therefore related to the description of their interaction with the gut metabolism and understanding of the modulation of gut immune responses to luminal antigens.This review was inspired to summarise the research efforts on the above field performed by the Nutritional and Biological Units of the Central Food Research Institute.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aallergens 3aamino acid composition 3aantinutritional factors 3abioactive compounds 3ablood lipids 3achemical structure 3acholesterol 3adiarrhea 3adigestion 3aenzymatic treatment 3afood research 3aheat stability 3ahuman nutrition 3aimmune response 3alaboratory animals 3alegumes 3alipid composition 3ametabolism 3aproteins 3aresearch planning 3aseeds 3asmall intestine 0alegumes 0atrypsin inhibitors 0alectins 0aallergens 0agut resistance 0aimmune responses to luminal antigens0 tActa alimentaria.g2009 Nov. 1, v. 38, no. 0 p.61-70dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.38.Suppl.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245011700207300002000324520180100344592002802145650001302173650001202186650002202198650001302220650002102233650000902254650002002263650001702283650001602300700002302316700002702339700002402366700002302390700002502413700002802438700006402466700002302530700006402553700002702617773013802644856008002782852000902862655001202871IND60662772220200108000000.0190906e20190826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066277222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b047492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollings, Ines E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9851-261510aLocal Structure of Ferroic Iron Formates at Low Temperature and High Pressure Studied by Mössbauer Spectroscopy  ap. 21676-21684.  aMössbauer spectroscopy (MS) measurements were conducted on ammonium iron formate, [NH₄][Fe(HCOO)₃] (AFeF), and dimethylammonium iron formate, [(CH₃)₂NH₂][Fe(HCOO)₃] (DMAFeF), under non-ambient conditions. The electric ordering of the NH₄⁺ and DMA cations is correlated with changes in the local iron environment, which could have implications for the magnetoelectric coupling. In particular, MS was collected upon cooling to 5 K, upon compression up to 10 GPa, and upon both cooling and compression. In the case of AFeF, the ferroelectric ordering upon cooling showed no change in the hyperfine parameters of the iron site, suggesting that no multiferroic coupling would be expected in the magnetic state. Upon compression, two distinct iron sites are observed that could arise from the symmetry-lowering transitions, yielding two symmetry-independent Fe sites. For DMAFeF, the electric ordering of the DMA cation observed upon cooling and upon compression had an impact on the local iron coordination environments. This observation is in agreement with the multiferroic properties observed for this compound. The low-temperature crystal structure of DMAFeF was measured in order to compare with the MS measurements and revealed a static disorder of the DMA cations in the ferroelectric phase, giving rise to at least two distinct iron sites in the Mössbauer spectrum. Upon further cooling below 15 K, the magnetic order of DMAFeF displayed a complex Mössbauer spectrum with at least three iron sites, which could be linked to the number of hydrogen bonds each iron center experiences. The effect of pressure on the magnetic exchanges at low temperature was also studied and revealed an enhancement for DMAFeF at 1.6 GPa, as indicated by the increased internal magnetic fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3acooling 3acrystal structure 3aformates 3ahydrogen bonding 3airon 3amagnetic fields 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature1 aVasiukov, Denis M.1 aMcCammon, Catherine A.1 aDubrovinsky, Leonid1 aCerantola, Valerio1 aPetitgirard, Sylvain1 aHübschle, Christian B.1 aSchönleber, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2516-23321 aChernyshov, Dmitry1 aSmaalen, Sander van,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9645-82401 aDubrovinskaia, Natalia0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Aug. 26, v. 123, no. 35 p.21676-21684dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b047493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01469naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014900166300001600315520034600331592002800677650001400705650001600719650001000735650001900745650001900764650002000783650001300803650002000816700002000836700001800856700002100874700001700895773010500912856008101017852000901098655001201107IND60440347420221122005545.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044034742DNAL7 a10.3103/S10683674150200322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadenko, V.

However, the effectiveness of AC in Hg and MeHg immobilization has varied among studies, suggesting that site biogeochemistry might dictate efficacy. In this study, we examined the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on MeHg and Hg sorption to AC. We evaluated the impact of Suwannee River Humic Acid (SRHA) on sorption to AC directly using an isotherm approach and in a soil/AC mixture using slurry microcosms. Aqueous sorption coefficients to AC (log KAC) for Hg-SRHA and MeHg-SRHA complexes were one to two orders of magnitude lower (Hg-SRHA = 4.53, MeHgSRHA = 4.35) than those for chloride complexes (HgCl₂ = 6.55, MeHgCl = 4.90) and more closely resembled the log KAC of SRHA (3.64). In anoxic, sulfidic soil slurries, the KAC for sulfide species appeared stronger than for chloride or SRHA species for both Hg and MeHg. AC significantly reduced porewater concentrations of both ambient MeHg and a fresh Me¹⁹⁹Hg spike, and the addition of up to 60 mg L⁻¹ SRHA did not reduce sorption to AC. The AC also reduced ambient Hg and ²⁰¹Hg porewater concentrations, but as SRHA concentration increased, the magnitude of solid phase sorption decreased. Speciation modeling revealed that SRHA may have impacted Hg distribution to the solid phase by reducing HgS precipitation. This study highlights the need for site-specific evaluation of AC efficacy and the value in developing biogeochemical models of AC performance for Hg control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3abiogeochemistry 3adissolved organic matter 3ahumic acids 3amercuric chloride 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3amodels 3apolluted soils 3aremediation 3arisk 3arivers 3aslurries 3asorption1 aSanders, James P.1 aMcBurney, Alyssa M.1 aBrown, Steven S.1 aGhosh, Upal1 aGilmour, Cynthia C.0 tEnvironmental science.g2019 Mar. 20, v. 21, no. 3 p.485-496dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8em00469b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012600166520145000292592002801742650001401770650001501784650001901799650001701818650001601835650001501851650000901866650001701875650001001892650001701902650001101919650001101930650001701941650002801958653001701986653002702003653001902030653003002049653002602079700005702105700001802162700001302180700001802193773011402211856008602325852000902411655001202420IND60714962720221117035823.0210715e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071496272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1243062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Yunxia10aMucin corona delays intracellular trafficking and alleviates cytotoxicity of nanoplastic-benzopyrene combined contaminant  aNanoplastics have recently become a worldwide concern as newly emerging airborne pollutants, which can associate with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and form combined contaminant nanoparticles (CCNPs). After being inhaled in the respiratory system, the CCNPs would first encounter the mucous gel layer being rich in mucin. Herein, polystyrene-benzopyrene (PS@Bap) NPs were prepared as CCNPs model and their interaction with mucin and the resultant biological responses were studied. It was observed that mucin corona stably attached to the CCNPs surface, which significantly altered the fate of the CCNPs in lung epithelial cells (A 549 cell line). The mucin corona would 1) stably adsorbed on PS@Bap at the early stages of endocytosis until degraded during the lysosomal transport and maturation process, 2) delay intracellular trafficking of PS@Bap and the progress of Bap detached from PS, 3) enhance uptake of PS@Bap but reduce the cytotoxicity elicited by PS@Bap, as indicated by cell viability, generation of reactive oxygen species, impairment on mitochondrial function, and further cell apoptosis. In addition, in vivo study also verified the enhanced effect of PS on the development of an acute lung inflammatory response induced by Bap. This study highlights the significance of incorporating the effects of mucin for precisely assessing the respiratory system toxicity of nanoplastics based CCNPs in atmospheric environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell lines 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3aendocytosis 3aepithelium 3agels 3ainflammation 3alungs 3amitochondria 3amodels 3amucins 3ananoplastics 3areactive oxygen species 0aNanoplastics 0aCombined contamination 0aProtein corona 0aIntracellular trafficking 0aToxicological effects1 aWang, Yunqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2164-07661 aShen, Dazhong1 aKang, Qi1 aChen, Lingxin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 406 p.124306-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1243063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01630naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245015100166300001200317520066700329592002800996650001201024650002501036650001601061650000901077700002601086700002001112700002201132773011701154856004801271852000901319655001201328IND4487735120221119045905.0120416e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448773512DNAL7 a10.3103/S00963925120100262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelyakova, A.

Instead, a drag-coefficient-type formulation as a function of the bulk Richardson number has been found to be able to reproduce observed stable boundary-layer wind speeds as effectively as a model based on the eddy viscosity approach. The advantage of this simpler approach is that the model can, in theory, be modified more easily for certain applications, such as the effects of large-scale wind parks on mesoscale meteorology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aequations 3ameteorology 3amodels 3aprediction 3aturbulent flow 3aviscosity 3awind speed1 aEmeis, Stefan1 aCanadillas, Beatriz0 tBoundary-layer meteorology.g2015 Feb., v. 154, no. 2 p.207-228dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl9360x0006-83147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-014-9969-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245012400165300002000289520169400309592002802003650002402031650001902055650001402074650002302088650002102111650001502132650001302147650002402160650000902184650001802193650001102211650000702222650001502229650002302244650001302267650001202280650002202292650002402314650001502338650001402353700002202367700006202389773013802451856008002589852000902669655001202678IND60662772620221122064447.0190906e20190813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066277262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b052452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObata, Keisuke10aMaximizing Hydrogen Evolution Performance on Pt in Buffered Solutions: Mass Transfer Constrains of H₂ and Buffer Ions  ap. 21554-21563.  aAlthough the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on a Pt electrode is among the most studied electrocatalytic reactions, its reaction mechanism and exchange current density are still under debate. Particularly on the Pt catalyst, its facile reaction kinetics and lack of effective methods to compensate mass transport make it difficult to isolate kinetic and diffusion contributions. This study focuses on the quantitative description of mass transfer constraints arising from both H₂ and phosphate buffer ions using a Pt electrocatalyst in near-neutral pH regions, which are overlooked in the literature despite the relevance to various (photo-) electrochemical reactions for water splitting and CO₂ reduction. The established HER model that uses H⁺ as a reactant quantitatively breaks down the observed overpotentials with diffusion contributions of both hydrogen and buffer species while the intrinsic kinetics on Pt exhibits negligible contribution. The significance of electrolyte engineering, that is, the optimization of the electrolyte identity and molality, is confirmed to determine the overall HER performance. To maximize the HER performance on Pt at ambient temperature, the phosphate-buffer electrolyte should be adjusted to a pH close to pKₐ of the buffer that effectively minimizes the pH gradient and to the adequate molality of the buffer (typically ∼0.5 M phosphates) that H₂ diffusion is maximized, which is related with H₂ solubility and solution viscosity. At pH far from pKₐ, concentration overpotential of buffer ion dominates the overall performance, which requires highly dense buffer (>1.5 M phosphates) to minimize the pH gradient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aions 3amass transfer 3amodels 3apH 3aphosphates 3aphysical chemistry 3aplatinum 3aprotons 3areaction kinetics 3areaction mechanisms 3asolubility 3aviscosity1 aStegenburga, Liga1 aTakanabe, Kazuhiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5374-94510 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Aug. 13, v. 123, no. 35 p.21554-21563dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b052453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03824naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012100169300001600290520211200306592002802418650001702446650002802463650001402491650001202505650002202517650003302539650002002572650002302592650002402615650001002639650002202649650002102671650001202692650001302704650003002717650002402747650001702771650002102788650001602809650002102825650001902846653002902865653002602894653002102920653001902941700001802960700001902978700001402997700001803011700001703029773010703046856008403153852000903237655001203246IND60629753020221122060148.0190202e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062975302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2018.02.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Mengling10aPrenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl and umbilical cord hormones and birth outcomes in an island population  ap. 581-591.  aPrenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) is suspected to interfere with fetal development including reproductive and thyroid function and birth outcomes, but published evidence are still sparse. We designed a cross-sectional study to analyze the associations between PCB levels in umbilical cord sera and hormones and birth outcomes of mothers and newborns who are residents from an island. Seven indicator-PCB (PCB-28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180), and five reproductive hormones including luteotropic hormones (LH), estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), follicle-stimulating hormones (FSH) and anti-Mullerian hormones (AMH), and three thyroid hormones including tri-iodothyronine (T3), tetra-iodothyronine (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormones (TSH) were measured in 106 cord sera specimens. Birth outcomes include birth weight, length, head circumference, and gestational age. Multiple linear regression and quartile regression were used to analyze the associations between PCB and each of the hormones and birth outcomes, adjusting for selected potential confounders. The median value of total PCB in umbilical cord sera was 2.02 μg L−1 (IQR, 1.13–4.64). Several negative associations between PCB exposure and reproductive hormones were found. Among them, the β value of PCB-101 for FSH reached −0.38 (95%CI, −0.69, −0.07; p = 0.02). Moreover, we also found some sex-specific associations i.e. PCB-28 was negatively correlated with LH and T and PCB-118 was negatively correlated with T in male newborns but not in female newborns. The associations between PCB and birth outcomes seem to differ by molecular weight of the PCB congeners i.e. the low-chlorinated PCB congeners were negatively associated with gestational age and head circumference while high-chlorinated PCB congeners were positively associated birth weight and gestational age. In this study, we found that PCB congeners with different molecular weight has different associations with hormones and birth outcomes, and future studies are recommended to investigate underlying mechanisms of these associations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirth weight 3across-sectional studies 3aestradiol 3afemales 3afetal development 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3agestational age 3ahead circumference 3aluteinizing hormone 3amales 3amaternal exposure 3amolecular weight 3amothers 3aneonates 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aregression analysis 3atestosterone 3athyroid function 3athyrotropin 3atriiodothyronine 3aumbilical cord 0aPolychlorinated biphenyl 0aReproductive hormones 0aThyroid hormones 0aBirth outcomes1 aYin, Shanshan1 aZhang, Jianyun1 aChen, Kun1 aJin, Mingjuan1 aLiu, Weiping0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 June, v. 237 p.581-591dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.02.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245013600205520180800341592002802149650001802177650002902195650001702224650001302241651001002254653002202264653002402286653001002310653001202320653001302332700001802345700001302363700001802376700001802394700001702412700001502429700001502444700001602459700005402475700001702529700001802546773011802564856008202682852000902764655001202773IND60754702320221120030939.0220103e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075470232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1020272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Jianlong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4716-390X10aEstimating elemental constituents of personal PM[formula omitted]: A modeling approach of older individuals of the China BAPE study  aMost previous studies on air pollution have used mass concentrations and elemental constituents of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from monitoring stations as dose metrics when determining health risks associated with PM2.5 exposure, which may result in error in their estimations. Herein we conducted an exploratory panel study in Jinan, China, to investigate potential determinants and estimation of personal PM2.5 elemental constituents using a modeling approach. For 76 old individuals aged 60–69 years, 5 repeated measurements of personal PM2.5 were taken from September 2018 to January 2019. The average concentrations of personal PM2.5 was 57.1 ±46.3μg/m³, which was lower than ambient levels. The concentrations of Zn, Fe, and Ti in personal PM2.5 were lower than those in ambient PM2.5. Personal PM2.5, Zn, Fe, Ti, and Ca were significantly correlated with their corresponding ambient concentrations. Ambient measurements, the demographic characteristics and lifestyles of subjects, and meteorological factors were crucial factors influencing personal exposure. The final predictive models based on ambient measurements and accessible variables explained 70% of the variance of personal PM2.5, and 52%–64% of the variance of personal Zn, Fe, Ti, and Ca. The average ratios of ambient to personal measurements and of modeling predictions to personal measurements of PM2.5, Zn, Fe, Ti, and Ca were 1.23 ± 0.47 and 1.08 ± 0.41, 1.85 ± 0.57 and 1.09 ± 0.30, 1.25 ± 0.42 and 1.04 ± 0.26, 2.20 ± 0.97 and 1.07 ± 0.41, and 1.08 ± 0.39 and 1.09 ± 0.34, respectively. The results suggest that models integrating ambient measurements and related variables can be a reliable candidate for estimating the levels of personal exposure to elemental constituents of PM2.5.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aenvironmental technology 3aparticulates 3avariance 3aChina 0aPersonal exposure 0aAmbient measurement 0aPM2.5 0aElement 0aModeling1 aZhang, Xunbao1 aShen, Yu1 aDeng, Fuchang1 aLiu, Yuanyuan1 aDong, Haoran1 aDu, Yanjun1 aChen, Chen1 aWang, Qiong1 aTang, Song1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3219-14221 aLi, Tiantian1 aShi, Xiaoming0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Nov., v. 24 p.102027-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1020273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245012300175300001800298506011700316506007600433520090300509592002801412506003701440650002601477650001101503650003401514650001301548650001301561650001501574650001801589650002401607650000901631650001701640653002501657653003901682653001501721653001701736653001001753700001801763700001801781700002601799700002001825700002501845700002201870700002401892700001901916700001901935700002001954700002101974700002501995700001902020700001902039773009902058856008402157852000902241655001202250IND60735736220221207122857.0220606e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073573622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Stephanie J.12aA multi-phenotype genome-wide association study of clades causing tuberculosis in a Ghanaian- and South African cohort  ap. 1802-1815.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDespite decades of research and advancements in diagnostics and treatment, tuberculosis remains a major public health concern. New computational methods are needed to interrogate the intersection of host- and bacterial genomes. Paired host genotype datum and infecting bacterial isolate information were analysed for associations using a multinomial logistic regression framework implemented in SNPTest. A cohort of 853 admixed South African participants and a Ghanaian cohort of 1359 participants were included. Two directly genotyped variants, namely rs529920 and rs41472447, were identified in the Ghanaian cohort as being statistically significantly associated with risk for infection with strains of different members of the MTBC. Thus, a multinomial logistic regression using paired host-pathogen data may prove valuable for investigating the complex relationships driving infectious disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiagnostic techniques 3agenome 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3atuberculosis 0aMulti-phenotype GWAS 0aMycobacterium tuberculosis complex 0aImputation 0aSouth Africa 0aGhana1 aSchurz, Haiko1 aTromp, Gerard1 avan der Spuy, Gian D.1 aHoal, Eileen G.1 aVan Helden, Paul D.,1 aOwusu-Dabo, Ellis1 aMeyer, Christian G.1 aMuntau, Birgit1 aThye, Thorsten1 aNiemann, Stefan1 aWarren, Robin M.1 aStreicher, Elizabeth1 aMöller, Marlo1 aKinnear, Craig0 tGenomics.g2021 July, v. 113, no. 4 p.1802-1815dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01358naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245015300165520047000318592002800788650001700816650000900833650001800842650001000860650001200870773012700882856007401009852000901083655001201092IND60652958720221120103750.0190713e20190521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065295872DNAL7 a10.3390/su111028762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurazzo, Alessandra 14aThe Close Linkage between Nutrition and Environment through Biodiversity and Sustainability: Local Foods, Traditional Recipes, and Sustainable Diets  aThis special issue, &ldquo;The Close Linkage between Nutrition and Environment through Biodiversity and Sustainability: Local Foods, Traditional Recipes, and Sustainable Diets&rdquo; is focused on the close correlation between the potential benefits and &ldquo;functional role&rdquo; of a food and the territory, including papers on the characterization of local foods and traditional recipes, on the promotion of traditional dietary patterns and sustainable diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3adiet 3aeating habits 3afoods 3arecipes0 tSustainability.g2019 May 21, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su111028763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014600165300001800311520110400329592002801433650000801461650002201469650001001491650002301501650001801524650001101542650002401553650001801577650006501595650001101660650001401671650001201685651001901697700001701716700001601733700001301749700001901762700001701781700001301798700002001811700001501831700001501846700001401861700001601875700001601891700001801907700001401925700001901939700001501958700001301973700001801986700001702004773009702021856008102118852000902199655001202208IND60519200120221117225441.0160421e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051920012DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-016-2763-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Changping10aVisual detection of Ebola virus using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification combined with nucleic acid strip detection  ap. 1125-1133.  aEbola virus (species Zaire ebolavirus) (EBOV) is highly virulent in humans. The largest recorded outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in West Africa to date was caused by EBOV. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a detection method for this virus that can be easily distributed and implemented. In the current study, we developed a visual assay that can detect EBOV-associated nucleic acids. This assay combines reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification and nucleic acid strip detection (RT-LAMP-NAD). Nucleic acid amplification can be achieved in a one-step process at a constant temperature (58 °C, 35 min), and the amplified products can be visualized within 2-5 min using a nucleic acid strip detection device. The assay is capable of detecting 30 copies of artificial EBOV glycoprotein (GP) RNA and RNA encoding EBOV GP from 10² TCID₅₀ recombinant viral particles per ml with high specificity. Overall, the RT-LAMP-NAD method is simple and has high sensitivity and specificity; therefore, it is especially suitable for the rapid detection of EBOV in African regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aZaire Ebola virus 3afever 3agene amplification 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3amicrobial detection 3arapid methods 3areverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification 3avirion 3avirulence 3aviruses 3aWestern Africa1 aWang, Hualei1 aJin, Hongli1 aFeng, Na1 aZheng, Xuexing1 aCao, Zengguo1 aLi, Ling1 aWang, Jianzhong1 aYan, Feihu1 aWang, Lina1 aChi, Hang1 aGai, Weiwei1 aWang, Chong1 aZhao, Yongkun1 aFeng, Yan1 aWang, Tiecheng1 aGao, Yuwei1 aLu, Yiyu1 aYang, Songtao1 aXia, Xianzhu0 tArchives of virology.g2016 May, v. 161, no. 5 p.1125-1133dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-016-2763-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245010100160520150100261592002801762650002101790650002601811650001501837650001901852650002301871650001601894650002501910650001401935650001001949650001001959650001301969650001501982650001601997650001402013650001502027650001702042653002202059653001202081653001502093653001802108653001702126700001502143700001602158700001702174700001502191700001802206700001402224700001802238773009802256856008202354852000902436655001202445IND60720509220221119013323.0220830e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072050922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1188722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Lei10aC8orf48 inhibits the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway  aColorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death globally. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate chromosome 8 open reading frame 48 (C8orf48) as a biomarker for early detection of CRC. RNA expression and methylation profiles were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays were performed to confirm the function of C8orf48 in CRC cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to identify that C8orf48 was the direct target of miR-556. Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and western blot analysis were performed to explore the mechanism of C8orf48. we found that C8orf48 is down-regulated in clinical samples of CRC tissues. Enrichment analysis showed that C8orf48 is associated with methylation biomarkers in CRC, and TCGA database confirmed that the methylation of C8orf48 is up-regulated in the early stage of CRC. We further revealed that the overexpression of C8orf48 decreased CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Luciferase reporter indicated that C8orf48 was the direct target of the oncogene miR-556. Additionally, we used GDSC database, GSEA database and western blot analysis to demonstrate that C8orf48 plays a suppressor role in CRC by inhibiting MAPK signaling pathway. C8orf48 was identified as a biomarker for early detection of CRC for the first time, and might provide novel information for CRC prediction and therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3abioluminescence assay 3abiomarkers 3acarcinogenesis 3acell proliferation 3achromosomes 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adatabases 3adeath 3adrugs 3agenomics 3aluciferase 3amethylation 3aoncogenes 3aprediction 3atherapeutics 0aColorectal cancer 0aC8orf48 0aMetastasis 0aProliferation 0aMAPK pathway1 aAn, Guoyan1 aZhu, Ziqing1 aLiu, Shuzhen1 aFu, Yutong1 aZeng, Xiaonan1 aCao, Qing1 aYan, Bianbian0 tLife sciences.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 266 p.118872-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1188723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01827naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245007700206300001600283520081300299592002801112650002601140650002001166650001701186650002101203650001301224700001901237700001701256773010301273856008101376990002301457852000901480655001201489IND60094064820221122201216.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009406482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ceb.2011.04.0072doi7 aPMC31483152pmcid7 a216411972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPendin, Diana10aBalancing ER dynamics: shaping, bending, severing, and mending membranes  ap. 435-442.  aThe endoplasmic reticulum is a multifunctional organelle composed of functionally and morphologically distinct domains. These include the relatively planar nuclear envelope and the peripheral ER, a network of sheet-like cisternae interconnected with tubules that spread throughout the cytoplasm. The ER is highly dynamic and the shape of its domains as well as their relative content are in constant flux. The multiple forces driving these morphological changes depend on the interaction between the ER and microtubules, membrane fusion and fission events and the action of proteins capable of actively shaping membranes. The interplay between these forces is ultimately responsible for the dynamic morphology of the ER, which in turn is crucial for properly executing the varied functions of this organelle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3amembrane fusion 3amicrotubules 3anuclear membrane 3aproteins1 aMcNew, James A1 aDaga, Andrea0 tCurrent Opinion in Cell Biology.g2011 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.435-442dElsevier Ltdx0955-06747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceb.2011.04.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245011600162300002000278500001900298520154300317592002801860650001101888650001901899650004601918650001301964650001201977650001401989650002302003650001302026650001802039650001302057650001102070650001402081650001502095650001602110650003102126700001502157700001702172700001802189700005602207700005802263700005702321773014202378856007902520852000902599655001202608IND60675343320221121083608.0191105e20191004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067534332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b047032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuchen10aMonoterpene and Sesquiterpene α-Hydroxy Organosulfates: Synthesis, MS/MS Characteristics, and Ambient Presence  ap. 12278-12290.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOrganosulfates (OSs) derived from biogenic volatile organic compounds are important compounds signifying interactions between anthropogenic sulfur pollution and natural emission. In this work, we substantially expand the OS standard library through the chemical synthesis of 26 α-hydroxy OS standards from eight monoterpenes (i.e., α- and β-pinene, limonene, sabinene, Δ³-carene, terpinolene, and α- and γ-terpinene) and two sesquiterpenes (i.e., α-humulene and β-caryophyllene). The sulfation of unsymmetrically substituted 1,2-diol intermediates produced a regioisomeric mixture of two OSs. The major regioisomeric OSs were isolated and purified for full NMR characterization, while the minor regioisomers could only be determined by liquid chromatograph–mass spectrometer (MS). The tandem mass spectra of the molecular ion formed through electrospray ionization confirmed the formation of abundant bisulfate ion fragments (m/z 97) and certain minor ion fragments characteristic of the carbon backbone. A knowledge of the MS/MS spectra and chromatographic retention times for authentic standards allows us to identify α-hydroxy OSs derived from six monoterpenes and β-caryophyllene in ambient samples. Notably, among two possible regioisomers of α-hydroxy OSs, we only detected the isomers with the sulfate group at the less substituted carbon position derived from α-pinene, limonene, sabinene, Δ³-carene, and terpinolene in the ambient samples. This observation sheds light on the atmospheric OS formation mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achromatography 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3alimonene 3aliquids 3apollution 3apositional isomers 3asabinene 3aspectrometers 3asulfates 3asulfur 3asynthesis 3atechnology 3aterpinolene 3avolatile organic compounds1 aMa, Yingge1 aLi, Xiaojing1 aKuang, Bin Yu1 aHuang, Cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9518-36281 aTong, Rongbiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2740-52221 aYu, Jian Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6165-65000 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Oct. 04, v. 53, no. 21 p.12278-12290dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b047033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245012100174300001600295520168200311592002801993650001802021650001902039650002302058650002002081650001602101650002602117650001502143650001402158650001602172650001802188650001602206650001602222650003802238650001602276653001002292653002202302700002102324773013802345856008302483852000902566655001202575IND60555209020221122022546.0161026e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055520902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apjtb.2015.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZakai, Haytham Ahmed10aEffects of filaricidal drugs on longevity and enzyme activities of the microfilariae of Setaria cervi in white rats  ap. 714-719.  aTo analyse the efficacy of diethylcarbamazine (DEC), tetramisole and chlorpromazine on the longevity and activity of glucose-6-phosphatase and succinate dehydrogenase in the microfilariae recovered from the peripheral circulation of the rats before and after the treatment.Setaria cervi worms were implanted in white rats via laparotomy and microfilaraemic rats were divided into 4 groups. Groups 1, 2 and 3 were treated with DEC, tetramisole and chlorpromazine respectively, while Group 4 served as infected control. Longevity of microfilariae and differential leucocyte counts were recorded till the disappearance of microfilariae from peripheral blood. Glucose-6-phosphatase and succinate dehydrogenase enzymes were localized in the microfilariae recovered from normal and treated rats.The microfilariae survived for 48 days in untreated rats while survival was reduced to 15, 21 and 27 days after treatment with DEC, tetramisole and chlorpromazine, respectively. Eosinophils and neutrophils increased during 2nd and 3rd weeks, whereas the lymphocytes increased during 4–7 weeks. DEC treatment resulted in slight decrease in the localization of succinate dehydrogenase but not in glucose-6-phosphatase. Tetramisole and chlorpromazine treatment did not show any appreciable change in the localization of both the above enzymes.DEC proved the most effective drug which cleared the microfilaraemia within 15 days and reduced the activity of succinate dehydrogenase to some extent followed by tetramisole and chlorpromazine which took more time for the clearance of microfilariae and had no effect on the localization of both glucose-6-phosphatase and succinate dehydrogenase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSetaria cervi 3achlorpromazine 3adiethylcarbamazine 3aenzyme activity 3aeosinophils 3aglucose-6-phosphatase 3alaparotomy 3alongevity 3alymphocytes 3amicrofilariae 3anematicides 3aneutrophils 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3atetramisole 0aDrugs 0aEnzyme activities1 aKhan, Wajihullah0 tAsian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine.g2015 Sept., v. 5 p.714-719dElsevier B.V.aHainan Medical Universityx2221-16917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apjtb.2015.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010100166300001600267520123000283592002801513650002701541650003001568650002001598650001601618650001801634650001401652650001401666650001001680650001801690650002001708650002401728650002301752650002001775650002001795650001301815650001001828650001401838650001101852650001701863653001901880653001901899653002601918700001301944700001801957773015801975856008102133852000902214655001202223IND60706298320221120184550.0200807e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070629832DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.v35i4.66372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aModgil, Raj ni10aEffect of domestic processing on physico chemical and nutritional quality of fenugreek cultivars  ap. 338-340.  aTwo varieties of fenugreek seeds i.e. metha (Trigonella foenum graecum L.) and methi (Trigonella corniculata) were taken for the present study.

The physical parameters studied were density, width, length, and weight. Chemically and nutritionally these were analysed for their proximate constituents, starch, total sugars, reducing and non-reducing sugars, true protein and non protein nitrogen content. The results revealed that varietal changes were there in the physical characters of the metha and methi seeds. Roasting had adverse effect on the physical characteristics as compared to sprouted counter parts. Roasting resulted in a decrease in proximate constituents alongwith reducing sugars and starch content whereas it increased the total carbohydrate and non reducing sugars. Content of methi and metha seeds. Sprouting of fenugreek seeds resulted in a significant (p≤ 0.05) increase in crude protein, true protein, crude fiber, non reducing sugar and total soluble sugars compared to unprocessed seeds but resulted in a decrese in remaining parameters studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrigonella corniculata 3aTrigonella foenum-graecum 3aadverse effects 3acrude fiber 3acrude protein 3acultivars 3afenugreek 3afoods 3amilk industry 3amilk production 3anonprotein nitrogen 3anonreducing sugars 3anutritive value 3areducing sugars 3aroasting 3aseeds 3asprouting 3astarch 3atrue protein 0aFenugreek seed 0aT. corniculata 0aProximate composition1 aJoshi, R1 aTanwar, Beenu0 tJournal of dairying, foods & home sciences.g2016 Dec., v. 35, no. 4 p.338-340dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2084x0976-05637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ajdfr.v35i4.66373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003400145245011200179300001600291500001500307520153400322592002801856650004001884650002801924650004101952650001401993650001402007650001702021650001002038650001602048650001302064650001602077650001902093650001302112650001702125650001602142650002002158650001102178650001802189650001102207650001502218650001202233650002002245653001802265700001802283700001902301700002602320700002202346700002402368700003402392773009302426856004802519852000902567655001202576IND4473426220221118173932.0120907e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447342622DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-012-1173-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcÃ­a-GutiÃ©rrez, Laura10aIsolation and selection of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria as inducers of systemic resistance in melon  ap. 201-212.  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUD AND AIMS: Powdery mildew elicited by Podosphaera fusca is an important threat to cucurbits. In order to find alternatives to the current use of chemicals, we examined the potential use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) for controlling the disease by induction of systemic resistance in the host plant. METHODS: A collection of Bacillus and Pseudomonas strains from different origins was studied, including strains isolated from roots of disease-free melon plants obtained from a greenhouse plagued by powdery mildew. The selection of best candidates was based on the evaluation of different traits commonly associated with PGPR, such as antifungal and siderophore production, swimming and swarming motilities, biofilm formation, auxin production and promotion of root development. RESULTS: Three Bacillus strains, B. subtilis UMAF6614 and UMAF6639 and B. cereus UMAF8564, and two Pseudomonas fluorescens strains, UMAF6031 and UMAF6033, were selected after ranking the strains using a nonparametric statistics test. Applied to melon seedlings, the selected strains were able to promote plant growth, increasing fresh weight up to 30%. Furthermore, these strains provided protection against powdery mildew and also against angular leaf spot caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans, with disease reductions of up to 60%. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the use of ISR-promoting PGPR could be a promising strategy for the integrated control of cucurbit powdery mildew and other cucurbit diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aseedlings 3aleaf spot 3asiderophores 3aroots 3agreenhouses 3aswarming 3aPodosphaera 3apowdery mildew 3aswimming 3aplant growth 3ahost plants 3adisease control 3aauxins 3aCucurbitaceae 3amelons 3astatistics 3abiofilm 3aBacillus cereus 0aleaf spotting1 aRomero, Diego1 aZeriouh, Houda1 aCazorla, Francisco M.1 aTorÃ©s, Juan A.1 ade Vicente, Antonio1 aPÃ©rez-GarcÃ­a, Alejandro0 tPlant and soil.g2012 Sept., v. 358, no. 1-2 p.201-212dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-012-1173-z  aDNAL 7aarticle01390naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012900159300002000288520037100308592002800679650002300707650002300730650002200753700001800775700001400793700001400807700001700821700001900838773013600857856007400993852000901067655001201076IND60660989920221117001104.0190827e20150616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066098992DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc03203b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jianlin10aCatalytic asymmetric desymmetrization of N-arylmaleimides: efficient construction of both atom chirality and axial chirality  ap. 10554-10557.  aThe catalytic asymmetric Michael addition/desymmetrization reaction of N-(2-t-butylphenyl)maleimides with unprotected 3-substituted-2-oxindoles was successfully realized using a chiral N,N′-dioxide-Sc(iii) complex, leading to succinimides with two kinds of stereogenic elements—atom chirality and axial chirality—in up to 99% yield, 99% ee and >19 : 1 d.r.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical compounds 3aoptical isomerism1 aZhang, Yulong1 aLin, Lili1 aYao, Qian1 aLiu, Xiaohua1 aFeng, Xiaoming0 tChemical communications.g2015 June 16, v. 51, no. 52 p.10554-10557dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5cc03203b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008600164520124400250592002801494650002101522650001401543650001901557650001601576650002301592650001001615650003001625650001901655650001901674650001001693650002501703650002201728650001701750653001601767653001001783653002101793653002901814700001301843700001901856700001501875700001701890700002001907700001701927700001701944700001701961773009801978856008202076852000902158655001202167IND60720509420221119012934.0220906e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072050942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1188752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xiaofeng10aFGF21 promotes non-small cell lung cancer progression by SIRT1/PI3K/AKT signaling  aLung cancer is a key contributor to the cancer-related death throughout the world.

The aim of this research was to explore the expression and function of FGF21 in lung cancer. The mRNA and protein expression of FGF21 were analyzed through qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration were analyzed by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry and wound-healing assay, respectively. ROS, SOD, LDH and CK were examined with respective commercially kit. FGF21 level was increased in lung cancer tissue samples and cell lines at both mRNA and protein levels. Overexpressing FGF21 promoted cell growth and migration significantly. It also increased SOD and reduced ROS, LDH and CK contents. By contrast, down-regulated FGF21 presented the opposite effect on lung cancer cells. Furthermore, FGF21 may function as a tumor promotor by activating the SIRT1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in lung cancer. This study demonstrated that FGF21 was a tumor promoter in lung cancer development, serving as a feasible therapeutic target in the treatment of lung cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogenesis 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3adeath 3afibroblast growth factors 3aflow cytometry 3alung neoplasms 3alungs 3aneoplasm progression 3aprotein synthesis 3atherapeutics 0aLung cancer 0aFGF21 0aCell progression 0aSIRT1/PI3K/AKT signaling1 aLi, Ying1 aJiang, Guodong1 aFang, Jian1 aYou, Zhaolei1 aShao, Guangyuan1 aZhang, Zheng1 aJiao, Aihong1 aPeng, Xiaonu0 tLife sciences.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 269 p.118875-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1188753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245016100162300002000323500001900343520134000362592002801702650002501730650001701755650001201772650001101784650001401795650001501809650001101824650004901835650002601884650001401910650001501924650001301939650003001952650001201982650001501994650001002009650001602019700005502035700001402090700001502104700001602119700001402135700001902149700005702168700001402225773014202239856007902381852000902460655001202469IND60675343420221121083541.0191105e20191018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067534342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.9b047042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zijian10aReactive Nitrogen Species Mediated Degradation of Estrogenic Disrupting Chemicals by Biochar/Monochloramine in Buffered Water and Synthetic Hydrolyzed Urine  ap. 12688-12696.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThere is increasing concern about the severe endocrine-related health problems because of the discharge of estrogenic disrupting chemicals (EDCs) into the natural environment. In this study, we investigated the activation of monochloramine (NH₂Cl) by biochar [pyrolyzed by cotton straw at 350 °C (Cot350), wheat straw at 350 and 700 °C (WS350 and WS700), and corn straw at 350 and 700 °C (CS350 and CS700)] for the degradation of estradiol (E2) and ethinylestradiol (EE2). Approximately 95% of parent E2 and EE2 was removed by Cot350/NH₂Cl in buffered solution, and 87% of E2 and 75% of EE2 were removed in urine within 24 h. Electronic paramagnetic resonance analysis and radical-quenching experiments showed that biochar activated NH₂Cl and primarily generated •NO radicals for the degradation of the EDCs. The nitrogen and silicon elements of Cot350 served as primary catalytic sites for NH₂Cl activation, whereas the sp²-hybridized carbon on WS700 and CS700 played a major role. The effect of major urine components (i.e., ammonia species, chloride, and bicarbonate) on the reaction pathways of biochar/NH₂Cl was also elucidated. This study provides new insights into the reaction pathways of NH₂Cl activation by biochar and suggests potential applications for other carbonaceous materials for NH₂Cl activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmmonia (Rotaliidae) 3abicarbonates 3abiochar 3acarbon 3achlorides 3acorn straw 3acotton 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenvironmental science 3aestradiol 3ahydrolysis 3anitrogen 3areactive nitrogen species 3asilicon 3atechnology 3aurine 3awheat straw1 aSun, Peizhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7538-53451 aLi, Yaxiu1 aMeng, Dan,1 aLi, Zhipeng1 aZhang, Xu1 aZhang, Ruochun1 aJia, Hanzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9838-28811 aYao, Hong0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Oct. 18, v. 53, no. 21 p.12688-12696dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b047043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01984naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245006500193300001600258500001700274520064900291592002800940596005700968596001001025596004501035650002101080650001601101650001101117650001001128650001801138650001201156650000901168650002001177650001701197651001401214651001101228700005201239700005301291773013601344856007301480852000901553655001201562IND60746810520221118153810.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074681052DNAL7 a10.1111/avj.130732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenckel, M1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9104-236910aFirst description of hepatitis E virus in Australian rabbits  ap. 356-358.  aCase Reports  aWe report the first detection of hepatitis E virus in rabbits in Australia.

Two viral genome sequences were obtained, which shared 96% nucleotide identity and clustered with hepatitis E strains isolated from rabbits and humans in Europe. This raises a potential public health risk in Australia, as the abundance of wild rabbits and the increasing popularity of domestic rabbits as pets represent a substantial human/rabbit interface to allow for potential zoonotic infections to occur.  aPublisher supplied data  aP01‐B‐002cCentre for Invasive Species Solutions  cCSIRO  aP.PSH.1059cMeat and Livestock Australia 3aOrthohepevirus A 3ahepatitis E 3ahumans 3aliver 3apublic health 3arabbits 3arisk 3atranscriptomics 3aviral genome 3aAustralia 3aEurope1 aHall, RN1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5836-29901 aStrive, T1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2971-84060 tAustralian veterinary journal.g2021 Aug., v. 99, no. 8 p.356-358dWiley Publishing Asia Pty LtdwJournal:jnl45498x0005-04237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avj.130733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011500161300001600276520160700292592002801899650001701927650002601944650001601970650001901986650001202005650001902017650000902036650002502045650001902070650002802089650001302117700001302130700001402143700001402157700001602171700001202187700001602199700001502215773009002230856008102320852000902401655001202410IND60439573420221119222845.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043957342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-015-1379-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, J. F.10aQTL identification on two genetic systems for rapeseed glucosinolate and erucic acid contents over two seasons  ap. 647-657.  aGlucosinolate and erucic acid are important plant compounds in rapeseed believed to have numerous functions in rapeseed-environment interactions. However, little is known about the QTL information related to the two different genetic systems including the embryo nuclear chromosomes and maternal plant nuclear chromosomes for glucosinolate content (GSLC) and erucic acid content (EAC) in rapeseed. Differences in QTL distribution between these two genetic systems, which control the performance of GSLC and EAC across different environmental conditions, were analyzed in the present study. A set of 202 DH populations derived from an elite hybrid cross of ‘Tapidor’ × ‘Ningyou7’ and their two backcross populations BC₁F₁ 1 (DHs × Tapidor) and BC₁F₁ 2 (DHs × Ningyou7) generated in two years were used as experimental materials for the study. A total of nine loci for GSLC and three loci for EAC with significant embryo additive main effects, embryo dominant main effects and/or maternal additive main effects, explaining 83.8 and 89.7 %, respectively, of their phenotypic variation, were identified. Although QTL × environment interaction effects were also detected in the present experiment, they played a minimum role in influencing the phenotypic variation. It was noted that qEAC-7-1 for EAC mapped on linkage group A7 was detected as the major QTL and could explain 68.32 % of the phenotypic variation for this trait. These results could be useful for the molecular maker-assisted breeding of GSLC and EAC quality traits based on the influence of two genetic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abackcrossing 3aenvironmental factors 3aerucic acid 3aglucosinolates 3ahybrids 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3aphenotypic variation 3aplant breeding 3aquantitative trait loci 3arapeseed1 aLong, Y.1 aWu, J.

It is found in animal derived products from the unstable residual penicillin. Previous studies have only reported the allergic reaction caused by BPNLA, but not described its toxicity. In this study, the toxicity of BPNLA was evaluated to report the potential public health risk posed by animal derived products using in vivo and in vitro models, including the acute toxicity assays, cytotoxicity assays, apoptosis assays and cell cycle progression assay. The LD50 value for BPNLA was 8.48 g/kg [bw] intraperitoneally. BPNLA showed cytotoxicity and inhibition of cell proliferation on SK-N-SH cells, MRC-5 cells and GC-1 cells. Further, Annexin-v/PI staining and Hoechst 33342 staining showed increased cell apoptosis and nucleus morphological changes with toxic levels of BPNLA. BPNLA arrested cells in G1 phase and reduced cells population in S phase in a dose-dependent manner. This work suggests that BPNLA might be a potential toxic agent and might have public health significance. However, the toxic concentrations of BPNLA are relatively high compared to levels that would result from the degradation of antibiotics residues in meat from animals that have received a therapeutic dose of benzylpenicillin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute toxicity 3aanimals 3aapoptosis 3abenzylpenicillin 3acell proliferation 3acleavage (chemistry) 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3aheat treatment 3ahypersensitivity 3ainterphase 3alethal dose 50 3ameat 3amodels 3apublic health 3arisk 3astaining 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity testing 0aBenzylpenicilloic acid 0aCell cycle 0aBPNLA 0aBP 0aRPIM 1640 medium 0aMEM 0aFBS 0aUPLC 0aMS 0a1H-NMR1 aLu, Huijun1 aHui, Qi1 aLu, Shiying1 aLiu, Yan1 aAhmad, Waqas1 aWang, Yang1 aHu, Pan1 aLiu, Xilin1 aCai, Yan1 aLiu, Lingjiu1 aZhang, Xiang1 aZhao, Ke1 aLi, Yansong1 aRen, Honglin1 aJin, Ningyi1 aLiu, Zengshan0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2018 Jan., v. 111 p.567-577dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2017.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245015100170300001600321520154000337592002801877650001501905650001201920650001801932650001101950650001301961650001601974650001601990650000902006650002102015650002102036650001802057650003102075650001502106650001702121650003302138650001902171653002902190653002002219653001702239700005702256773012502313856008302438852000902521655001202530IND60678198520221119150735.0200210e20200307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067819852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.11.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStecher, Johannes10aAdsorbed layer thickness of polycarboxylate and polyphosphate superplasticizers on polystyrene nanoparticles measured via dynamic light scattering  ap. 204-212.  aCommon superplasticizers (dispersants) for cementitious materials such as concrete include carboxylated comb polymers which strongly chelate Ca²⁺ ions. Thus, a substrate holding Ca²⁺ as docking site on its surface and of a narrow particle size distribution was expected to produce reliable values for the adsorbed layer thickness (ALT) of polycarboxylate comb polymers, as measured via dynamic light scattering. ALT presents a key parameter which controls the dispersion power of these polymers and provides the steric hindrance effect between cement particles.Using octadecyl phosphate as emulsifier, phosphate modified polystyrene nanoparticles (dH₍z₎~86 nm) of narrow size distribution were successfully synthesized and characterized via scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential measurements. The particles allowed to measure concentration dependent adsorbed layer thicknesses of a series of structurally different, self-synthesized polycarboxylate superplasticizers.The phosphate-modified polystyrene nanoparticles were found to present a suitable substrate for ALT measurements of adsorbed polycarboxylate comb polymers. DLS measurements revealed that with progressing adsorption, these polymers develop a concentration-dependent isothermal ALT. At saturation point, layer thicknesses of 3 to 8 nm were observed. The values correlate well with molecular properties of the polymers whereby increasing side-chain length, side-chain density and molecular weight provoke higher ALTs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acalcium 3acarboxylation 3acement 3aconcrete 3adispersants 3aemulsifiers 3aions 3alight scattering 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size distribution 3aphosphates 3apolystyrenes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3azeta potential 0aAdsorbed layer thickness 0aPolycarboxylate 0aComb polymer1 aPlank, Johann1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4129-47840 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Mar. 07, v. 562 p.204-212dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.11.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245017200201300002000373520137000393592002801763650001401791650001101805650001401816650002301830650001301853650002101866650001501887650001101902650002201913650001301935650001301948650001301961653002001974653002701994653002102021653003002042653003002072700005502102700001602157700001602173700002502189700001802214700005702232700001602289773014202305856007802447852000902525655001202534IND60704249020221120164345.0200722e20200626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070424902DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c072252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Cheolmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6740-278210aTetraruthenium Polyoxometalate as an Atom-Efficient Bifunctional Oxygen Evolution Reaction/Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalyst and Its Application in Seawater Batteries  ap. 32689-32697.  aAlthough development and utilization of efficient catalysts with earth-abundant and cheap elements are desired, precious noble metal-based catalysts are still widely used and studied due to the urgent need to address energy and environmental issues. Polyoxometalates (POMs) can be excellent candidates in this context. In this study, we found that oxo-bridged tetraruthenium polyoxometalate (RuPOM) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for both oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) with minimal use of noble metal elements and can be used for the development of efficient seawater batteries (SWBs). The deposition of RuPOM on a desired electrode with conducting carbon Ketjen black (KB) by the simple slurry coating method imparted bifunctional OER/ORR activity to the underlying electrode. Although the mass activity was similar, RuPOM/KB mixtures exhibited superior activity even compared to commercially available Pt/C when comparing the activity per noble metal element. Based on these findings, we employed RuPOM to develop efficient SWBs. RuPOM significantly lowered the charging potential and increased the discharging potential of SWBs, which are related to OER and ORR, respectively. This study can provide insights into the development of POM-based electrocatalysts and their application in energy storage and conversion devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoatings 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aoxygen production 3aplatinum 3aseawater 3aslurries 0apolyoxometalate 0abifunctional catalysts 0aseawater battery 0aoxygen evolution reaction 0aoxygen reduction reaction1 aJeon, Dasom1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2297-03961 aPark, Jehee1 aLee, Wonsuk1 aPark, J.q(Jaehyun),1 aKang, Seok Ju1 aKim, Youngsik1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7076-94891 aRyu, Jungki0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 June 26, v. 12, no. 29 p.32689-32697dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c072253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010600162300001600268520174700284592002802031650002502059650001402084650001302098650001802111650003002129650001802159650001302177650001302190650001502203700001502218700001702233700001402250700001802264700002002282773009602302856008102398990002302479852000902502655001202511IND60093410920221118174928.0141103e20120326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009341092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2011.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jian10aExperimental analysis of forced convective heat transfer in novel structured packed beds of particles  ap. 126-137.  aFollowed by the numerical study of Yang et al. (2010), the macroscopic hydrodynamic and heat transfer characteristics in some novel structured packed beds are experimentally studied in this paper, where the packings of ellipsoidal or non-uniform spherical particles are investigated for the first time with experiments and some important results are obtained. For present experiments, the interstitial heat transfer coefficient in the packed bed is determined using an inverse method of transient single-blow technique. The effects of packing form and particle shape are carefully investigated and the experimental and numerical results (Yang et al., 2010) are also compared in detail. Firstly, it is discovered that, the computational method reported by Yang et al. (2010) might be appropriate for heat transfer predictions in structured packings, while it might underestimate the friction factors, especially when the porosity is relatively low. Secondly, it is found that, the traditional Ergun's and Wakao's equations might overpredict the friction factors and Nusselt numbers for the structured packings, respectively, and some experimental modified correlations are obtained. Furthermore, it is also revealed that, both the effects of packing form and particle shape are significant to the macroscopic hydrodynamic and heat transfer characteristics in structured packed beds. With proper selection of packing form, such as simple cubic packing (SC) and particle shape, such as ellipsoidal particle, the pressure drops in the structured packed beds can be greatly reduced and the overall heat transfer performances will be improved. These experimental results would be reliable and useful for the optimum design in industry applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3aequations 3afriction 3aheat transfer 3aheat transfer coefficient 3ahydrodynamics 3aindustry 3aporosity 3aprediction1 aWang, Jing1 aBu, Shanshan1 aZeng, Min1 aWang, Qiuwang1 aNakayama, Akira0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 Mar. 26, v. 71 p.126-137dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2011.12.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245022600158300001600384520158100400592002801981650002102009650001802030650003002048650002802078650002302106650001602129650002402145650001802169650001702187650001402204650001102218650002302229650002202252650001402274650001402288650001902302650001202321650000902333650001202342650001402354653002302368653002102391653002102412700001902433700001402452773013802466856007902604852000902683655001202692IND60645692920221121005253.0190823e20181031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064569292DNAL7 a10.1139/cjas-2017-02032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, H.M.10aEffect of dietary supplementation of fermented garlic by Leuconostoc mesenteroides KCCM35046, on growth performance, blood constituents, nutrient digestibility, fecal microflora, and fecal scores in sows and their piglets  ap. 349-356.  aEighteen lactating sows (Landrace × Yorkshire) were used in an experiment to determine the effects of fermented garlic by Leuconostoc mesenteroides KCCM35046 on growth performance, blood constituents, nutrient digestibility, fecal microflora, and fecal scores in sows and their piglets. The experiment was started before farrowing 30 d to weaning, and sows were randomly assigned to the following dietary treatments: control basal diet (CON) and the CON + 0.1% or 0.2% fermented garlic (FG). During the lactation period, sows had free access to feed and water. At farrowing day and weaning (day 28), body weight (BW) loss of sows reduced linearly (P = 0.042; P = 0.006, respectively) in FG diets. There was a linear improvement in piglets’ BW with increasing dietary FG levels at weaning (P = 0.033). Piglets fed the diets with the FG linearly increased the average daily gain (ADG) at the 3rd and 4th weeks (P = 0.041; P = 0.002, respectively). Overall, the ADG of piglets linearly increased when lactating sows fed the diets with FG supplementation (P = 0.004). Red blood cell concentrations linearly decreased (P = 0.004) in sows fed dietary FG supplementation at the weaning day. Dietary inclusion of the FG tended to increase the fecal Lactobacillus population and decrease Escherichia coli population of piglets at weanling day (P = 0.075; P = 0.051, respectively). In conclusion, the results of this study indicated that dietary supplementation of FG (0.1% and 0.2%) improved growth performance in sows and their piglets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 3aYorkshire (swine breed) 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3adietary supplements 3adigestibility 3aerythrocytes 3afarrowing 3agarlic 3agrowth performance 3alactating females 3alactation 3alandraces 3amicroorganisms 3apiglets 3asows 3aweaning 3aweanlings 0ablood constituents 0afecal microflora 0afermented garlic1 aNyachoti, C.M.1 aKim, I.H.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2018 Oct. 31, v. 99, no. 2 p.349-356dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1932x1918-18257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjas-2017-02033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013200169300001600301520156100317592002801878650001701906650001901923650002001942650002301962650001201985650001401997650001302011650001602024650002302040650001202063650001902075650001102094650001302105650001302118650001402131650001502145650002402160650000902184650001102193650001602204650001402220650002102234651000902255700001302264700001802277700002302295700001602318700001302334700001602347700001702363700002102380700001702401700001902418773012802437856008202565852000902647655001202656IND60516403820221116150837.0190727e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051640382DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797140004532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGautam, Priyanka,10aApplication time of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization mitigates the adverse effect of submergence in rice (oryza sativa l.)  ap. 522-539.  aLarge areas of rainfed lowlands of Asia annually experienced flash flooding during the rice-growing season, which is an important abiotic stress that adversely affect grain yield of rice (Oryza sativa L.) crop. Submergence stress is a common environmental challenge for agriculture sustainability in these areas because lack of high-yielding, flood-tolerant cultivars. In this study, IR64-Sub1 and IR64 were compared for their tolerance to submergence at active tillering (AT), panicle initiation (PI) and heading (H) stages with nitrogen and phosphorus application time. We evaluated the role of cultivars, stage of submergence and N and P application on phenology, leaf senescence (LS), photosynthetic (Pn) rate, yield attributes and yield. Under non-submerged conditions, no difference was observed in phenology, Pn rate and yield of both cultivars. Submergence substantially reduced biomass, Pn rate, yields attributes and yield across cultivars with more drastic reduction in IR64. Submergence at H stage proves to be most detrimental. Nitrogen application after desubmergence with basal P improved the Pn rate resulting in significantly higher yield and yield components. Nitrogen application before submergence resulted in increased LS and ethylene accumulation in shoots leading to drastic reduction in growth, Pn rate and yield. Crop establishment and productivity could therefore be enhanced in areas where untimely flooding is anticipated by avoiding N application before submergence and applying N after desubmergence with basal P (phosphorus).  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aabiotic stress 3aadverse effects 3aapplication timing 3abiomass 3acultivars 3aethylene 3agrain yield 3agrowth retardation 3aheading 3ainflorescences 3aleaves 3alowlands 3anitrogen 3aphenology 3aphosphorus 3aplant establishment 3arice 3ashoots 3asubmergence 3atillering 3ayield components 3aAsia1 aLal, B.,1 aNayak, A.

A questionnaire‐style interview guide was used by a representative at each university to interview educators. Educators were interviewed about their teaching of euthanasia decision‐making for four categories of animals: livestock, equine, companion and avian/wildlife. Using thematic analysis, the terms provided by participants to describe how (mode of teaching) and what (specific content) they taught to students were categorised. Information about content was categorised into human‐centred factors that influence decision‐making, and animal‐based indicators used to directly inform decision‐making. All eight representatives reported some teaching relevant to euthanasia decision‐making at their university for livestock, companion animal and avian/wildlife. One representative reported no such teaching for equid animals at their university. Observation of a euthanasia case was rarely reported as a teaching method. Five universities reported multiple modes of teaching relevant information, while two universities made use of modalities that could be described as opportunistic teaching (e.g., 'Discussion of clinical cases'). Factors taught at most universities included financial considerations, and that it is the owner's decision to make, while animal‐based indicators taught included QoL/animal welfare, prognosis and behaviour change. Overall, most universities used a variety of methods to cover relevant material, usually including lectures and several other approaches for all animal types. However, because two universities relied on presentation of clinical cases, not all students at these veterinary schools will be exposed to make, or assist in making, euthanasia decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior change 3abirds 3adecision making 3aeuthanasia 3ahorses 3apets 3aprognosis 3awildlife1 aBeausoleil, NJ1 aStafford, KJ1 aStephens, C.,1 aCollins, T1 aQuain, A1 aHazel, S1 aLloyd, JK.F1 aMallia, C1 aRichards, L.,1 aWedler, NK1 aZito, S0 tAustralian veterinary journal.g2021 Aug., v. 99, no. 8 p.334-343dWiley Publishing Asia Pty LtdwJournal:jnl45498x0005-04237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avj.130773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01826naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245011400135300001600249500001900265520087400284592002801158650002001186650001401206650001101220650001001231650001501241650001301256650001001269653002201279653001001301653001701311700001901328773013201347852000901479655001201488IND60706298820221120184514.0200807e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070629882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, Ajay Kumar10aRelative bioefficacy of acaricide, Abamectin 1.9 EC against European red mite, Panonychus ulmi Koch. in apple  ap. 101-104.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVarious dosage viz., 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 1.2 ml/l of newer acaricide, abamectin 1.9 EC against European red mite, Panonychus ulmi infesting apple crop at Harsil (2500 m ASL) in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand were compared with conventional acaricides viz., propargite 57 EC (0.5 ml/l), fenazaquin 10 EC (0.4 ml/l) and water spray.

Although wide distribution of the two species in the brackish waters of South and South-East Asia has been reported, their habitat preference remains unknown. We surveyed 12 sites in five estuarial areas of the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia from Kuala Gula to Tanjung Piai. Both species were found in all five areas, suggesting their distribution throughout the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. This is the southernmost-recorded appearance of O. dancena, to the best of our knowledge. However, the habitats of the two species were essentially separated: of the 12 surveyed sites, the species were found in co-existence at only two sites, and one or the other species was found alone at the remaining 10 sites. We compared temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO) at the sampling sites and found that the habitat of O. javanicus is with higher salinity and DO. The salinity and DO at the sites of co-existence are near the lowest values found at the O. javanicus-only sites, and the highest values at the O. dancena-only sites. These results suggest that O. javanicus and O. dancena habitats are essentially separated; the former prefers hyperosmotic conditions while the latter prefers hypoosmotic conditions, and the latter may be more tolerant of hypoxia. The two sites of co-existence are points of contact between the speciesâ separate distribution areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryzias 3abiogeography 3abrackish water 3acoasts 3adissolved oxygen 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahypoxia 3asalinity 3aseawater 3atemperature 3aMalaysia 3aSouth Asia1 aIsmail, Ahmad1 aKoito, Tomoko1 aKinoshita, Masato1 aInoue, Koji0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2012 Jan., v. 93, no. 1 p.43-49dSpringer-Verlagx0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9888-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245017500181300001600356520158500372592002801957650001701985650002202002650001102024650001502035650001702050650002002067650001702087651001202104651002502116700002102141700002102162773009102183856008502274990002302359852000902382655001202391IND60096255220221117014918.0141104e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009625522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cretres.2010.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCvetko Tešović, Blanka,10aIntegrated biostratigraphy and carbon isotope stratigraphy of the Lower Cretaceous (Barremian to Albian) Adriatic-Dinaridic carbonate platform deposits in Istria, Croatia  ap. 301-324.  aThe Adriatic-Dinaridic carbonate platform (ADCP) was one of the largest and relatively well preserved Mesozoic platforms in the Mediterranean region (central Tethys). The peninsula Istria, in the northwestern part of the ADCP, is built up predominantly of shallow-water carbonates of the Middle Jurassic (Dogger) to Eocene age and, to a lesser extent, of Paleogene clastic deposits (flysch and calcareous breccia). This study focuses on a Lower Cretaceous (Barremian to Albian) succession of strata at five localities in western Istria. Stratigraphic determinations are based on identification of nine microfossil assemblages (benthic foraminifera and calcareous algae Dasycladales) and on using their taxa as index fossils. The age of strata with these microfossil assemblages, however, is questionable. Most of the age uncertainties are associated with a regional emersion, which occurred on the ADCP during the Aptian or close to the Aptian–Albian transition. It is unclear what portions of the Upper Aptian and/or Lower Albian are missing along this unconformity. A stable isotope study was conducted on homogenous micritic matrix samples in an attempt to resolve some of these uncertainties. Variations in carbon isotope compositions proved useful for stratigraphic correlation between the examined successions of strata, for improving their age determination, and for relating them to other coeval successions that span an important time interval of major oceanographic changes and carbon-cycle perturbations associated with the Early Aptian oceanic anoxic event (OAE 1a).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDasycladales 3aage determination 3acarbon 3acarbonates 3amicrofossils 3astable isotopes 3astratigraphy 3aCroatia 3aMediterranean region1 aGlumac, Bosiljka1 aBucković, Damir0 tCretaceous research.g2011 June, v. 32, no. 3 p.301-324dElsevier Ltdx0195-66717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2010.12.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013200166300001600298520122400314592002801538650002101566650001801587650002501605650002501630650001201655650000901667650001701676650005201693650002401745650003801769653002501807653002501832653001501857653003801872700001901910700001601929700001801945700001701963700001201980700001701992773012002009856008202129852000902211655001202220IND60528687220221122004405.0160716e20160527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052868722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.04.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shukun10aHigh glucose-induced Matrilin-2 expression in mouse mesangial cells was mediated by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1)  ap. 303-308.  aThis study aimed at evaluating the effect of high glucose on the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) protein Matrilin-2 and the mechanism underlying this effect by using a mouse mesangial cell line. Mouse mesangial cells (MMCs) were cultured in media containing normal (5 mM d-glucose) or high concentrations of glucose (30 mM d-glucose). The expression of Matrilin-2 was assessed by either RT-PCR or western blot. Additionally, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) inhibitors and TGF-β1 were used to determine whether glucose-regulated Matrilin-2 expression was mediated by the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway. Our data demonstrated that Matrilin-2 expression was markedly induced by high glucose and TGF-β1. High glucose-induced Matrilin-2 expression was inhibited by TGF-β1/Smad3 inhibitors, indicating that Matrilin-2 was markedly induced by high glucose and this induction was mediated by the TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway. Taken together, our results showed that high-glucose-induced Matrilin-2 expression that was mediated by the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway might play a role in Diabetic nephropathy (DN) pathogenesis and our finding provided a potential diagnostic and/or therapeutic target for DN.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aculture media 3adiabetic nephropathy 3aextracellular matrix 3aglucose 3amice 3apathogenesis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 0aDiabetic nephropathy 0aExtracellular matrix 0aMatrilin-2 0aTransforming growth factor beta 11 aZhang, Menglan1 aHuang, Hong1 aZhou, Shiying1 aDu, Yanshneg1 aYi, Xin1 aLuo, Junming0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 May 27, v. 474 p.303-308dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.04.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011600167300001600283520183400299592002802133650001202161650000902173650000902182650001002191650002102201650002002222650001202242650001102254650002202265650001402287650000902301650001602310650001302326650001102339650001102350650001602361650001302377650001202390651001202402700002502414700002302439700002102462700001802483700002002501773012802521856008202649852000902731655001202740IND60516403920221116150853.0190727e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051640392DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797140004652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQUYEN, LUU NGOC10aSowing windows for a spring crop introduced in rice cultivation areas affected by low temperature and radiation  ap. 540-566.  aIn mountainous areas of Continental South East Asia, double cropping in the irrigable valleys and terraces is often promoted as a way to increase farmers’ income while alleviating the pressure of agriculture on fragile slopes. However, cold temperature and low global radiation may constrain this strategy. Lethally cold events may occur, and increases in crop cycle length may jeopardize the correct timing of the main rice crop, taking place in summer. The model PYE (potential yield estimator) simulating the impact of temperature and radiation on the development and yield of annual crops was adapted to account for the range of temperature occurring in the area under study. It was calibrated against experimental data for the three crops that are most often considered as spring crops in the irrigable land of the northern mountains of Vietnam: rice, soybean and maize. Then a virtual experiment was designed in order to simulate various scenarios combining crop species and sowing date with climatic data accounting for variability of climate across years, location and elevation. Completed with a sensitivity analysis, it allowed to define favourable ‘sowing windows’ for non-water limited environments, based on the three following criteria: high average yield, low incidence over years of lethally cold events and low incidence over years of delays in the maturity of the spring crop. The length of this sowing window varied greatly across the scenarios tested. The widest was obtained for the case of soybean whatever the location and elevation, which makes it the less risky of the tested options. The approach followed proved effective to identify favourable and unfavourable environments in order to help better targeting the policy in support to the introduction of a spring crop in the mountains of Vietnam.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acold 3acorn 3acrops 3acultivation area 3adouble cropping 3afarmers 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amountains 3arice 3asowing date 3asoybeans 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3aterraces 3avalleys 3aVietnam1 aAFFHOLDER, FRANÇOIS1 aMONTAGNE, JENNIFER1 aJOURDAIN, DAMIEN1 aRIPOCHE, AUDE1 aCAPILLON, ALAIN0 tExperimental agriculture.g2015 Oct., v. 51, no. 4 p.540-566dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46155x1469-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797140004653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009800155300001600253500002000269520164600289592002801935596005101963596005102014650001402065650001002079650000902089650001302098650001702111650002502128650001302153650001402166650001502180650001902195700001502214773013602229856007302365852000902438655001202447IND60746810820221118154927.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074681082DNAL7 a10.1111/avj.130762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephen, CP10aDesign and development of a biological implant for long term intravaginal retention in cattle  ap. 326-333.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: Design, develop and trial an intravaginal device able to remain within the bovine vagina for up to 6 months, accommodating various technologies, while not adversely affecting the cow, or pregnancy. METHODS: Device scoping required minimal interference with vaginal drainage, no constant pressure on any single point of the vaginal mucosa and minimal footprint on the vaginal floor. A polycarbonate prototype was developed consisting of a central cargo space to house sensors and battery, with a separate retention module. Mathematical modelling informed the required length and flexibility of the arms on the retention module to reduce pressure necrosis and inflammation within the vagina. The prototype was initially trialled, with a loaded cargo pod, for 4 weeks in five non‐pregnant cows. Cows were monitored for signs of systemic infection and inflammation by collecting blood samples for haematology and acute phase inflammatory proteins. Cows were also assessed for general demeanour, signs of discomfort and positioning of the device. Later, the device was inserted into 20 early pregnant cows, with 20 contemporary, untreated controls. Cows were monitored, as in the initial trial, every 4 weeks for the next 5 to 6 months until calving. RESULTS: In Trial 1, there was 100% retention with no adverse effects. In Trial 2, device retention was 75% until calving with no adverse effects on cow health or pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the longest successful deployment of an intravaginal device in pregnant and non‐pregnant cattle, with long‐term retention, no adverse effects and 28 cm³ of cargo space.  aPublisher supplied data  aB.NBP.0666cMeat and Livestock Australia (MLA)  aB.NBP.0545cMeat and Livestock Australia (MLA) 3abatteries 3ablood 3acows 3adrainage 3ainflammation 3aintravaginal devices 3anecrosis 3apregnancy 3aprototypes 3avaginal mucosa1 aNorman, ST0 tAustralian veterinary journal.g2021 Aug., v. 99, no. 8 p.326-333dWiley Publishing Asia Pty LtdwJournal:jnl45498x0005-04237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avj.130763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01259naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245012200129300001600251500001900267520026700286592002800553650002400581650001200605650001400617650001300631650001100644653001500655653001600670653001200686700001600698700001600714700001900730700001900749773013200768852000900900655001200909IND60706299020221120200220.0200807e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070629902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonica, V.L.10aBioefficacy of some acaricides against Tetranychus urticae Koch under field and laboratory conditions on brinjal crop  ap. 111-114.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEight acaricides were evaluated against Tetranychus urticae Koch on brinjal, dicofol @ 4 ml/lit. was highly effective and showed excellent acaricidal properties followed by fenopyroximate @ 0.8 ml/lit.

Thus, ubiquitination seems to function as a general tag for selective autophagy in mammalian cells. This review discusses the present model of how autophagy sequesters invading bacteria through ubiquitination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautophagy 3abacteria 3alysosomes 3amammals 3amitochondria 3amodels 3aperoxisomes 3aprotein aggregates 3aubiquitination1 aYoshimori, Tamotsu0 tCurrent Opinion in Cell Biology.g2011 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.492-497dElsevier Ltdx0955-06747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceb.2011.03.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01819naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245011000131300001600241500001900257520088100276592002801157650002301185650001401208650001501222650001301237650001301250651001001263653003401273653003601307700002101343773013201364852000901496655001201505IND60706299120221120200146.0200807e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070629912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThodsare, N.H.10aEfficacy of indoxacarb and emamectin benzoate against Bihar hairy caterpillar, Spilosoma obliqua (Walker)  ap. 115-120.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe toxicity of indoxacarb and emamectin benzoate was evaluated against 10 days old larvae of S. obliqua by residue contact bioassay method.

(Fabaceae) using in vitro/in vivo models of liver injury. The EAS was characterized by HPLC and flavonoids (14 mg/g dw) and saponins (8 mg/g dw) were proved. The flavonoids (ASF1, ASF3 and ASF5) were isolated from the same extract and partially identified by LC-MS. In in vitro models of non-enzyme induced (Fe2+/AA) lipid peroxidation in isolated liver microsomes and CCl4-induced metabolic bioactivation and t-BuOOH-induced oxidative stress in isolated rat hepatocytes, both EAS and the flavonoids exerted similar to silybin (positive control) an antioxidant and cytoprotective activity, discerned by decreased MDA production in the microsomes and by preserved cell viability and GSH levels as well as by decreased LDH activity and MDA quantity in isolated rat hepatocytes. The antioxidant and hepatoprotective effect of EAS has been confirmed in vivo against CCl4-induced liver injury in rats. EAS restored the GSH levels and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes CAT and SOD, affected by CCl4 administration, as well as decreased the production of MDA. The effect of EAS was commensurable with those of silymarin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus 3aantioxidants 3acatalase 3acell viability 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3aliver microsomes 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3asaponins 3asilymarin 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicology 0aAstragalus spruneri 0aIsolated rat liver microsomes 0aAntioxidant activity 0aCytoprotection 0aAA 0aCAT 0aEAS 0aGSH 0aLDH 0aLPO 0aMDA 0at-BuOOH 0aNADPH 0aSOD1 aShkondrov, Aleksandar1 aSimeonova, Rumyana1 aVitcheva, Vessela1 aKrasteva, Ilina1 aIonkova, Iliana0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2018 Jan., v. 111 p.631-640dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2017.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014300172300001600315520159400331592002801925650001301953650001701966650002101983650001702004650001402021650001802035651000902053700002302062700002502085700002702110773009102137856008502228990002302313852000902336655001202345IND60096255420221117015320.0141104e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009625542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cretres.2011.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahanipour, Azam10aPalaeoecology and biostratigraphy of early Cretaceous (Aptian) calcareous nannofossils and the δ¹³Ccₐᵣb isotope record from NE Iran  ap. 331-356.  aUpper Barremian–Lower Aptian sediments of the Sarcheshmeh and Sanganeh formations in the Kopet Dagh area, northeast Iran were studied with regard to their calcareous nannofossil content and their δ¹³Ccₐᵣb signal. The sediments are composed mainly of marlstones, argillaceous limestones and limestones. Based on the occurrence of biostratigraphic index taxa, the calcareous nannofossil zones NC5, NC6 and the NC7A Subzone were recognised. The calcareous nannofossils and the δ¹³Ccₐᵣb data enable recognition of the early Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (OAE 1a). The deposits of the OAE 1a interval are characterised by the rarity of nannoconids and a sharp negative δ¹³Ccₐᵣb excursion (1.36‰), followed by an abrupt positive δ¹³Ccₐᵣb excursion of 4–5‰; both events have been recognised elsewhere in OAE 1a deposits in the Tethys. In the OAE 1a interval, the relative abundance of Watznaueria barnesiae/Watznaueria fossacincta is higher (more than 40%) than that of Biscutum spp., Discorhabdus spp. and Zeugrhabdotus spp., which indicates dissolution. In the upper part of the section, the higher relative abundance of mesotrophic and oligotrophic taxa (Watznaueria spp. and nannoconids respectively) and the enhanced relative abundance of eutrophic taxa (Biscutum spp., Discorhabdus spp., Zeugrhabdotus spp.) is indicative of an environment with slightly increased nutrient content. The presence of warm water taxa (Rhagodiscus asper and nannoconids) and the absence of cool water taxa (Repagulum and Crucibiscutum) suggest warm surface-water conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aisotopes 3amicrofossils 3anutrient content 3apaleoecology 3asediments 3asurface water 3aIran1 aMutterlose, Jörg,1 aKani, Anoshiravan L.1 aAdabi, Mohammad Hosein0 tCretaceous research.g2011 June, v. 32, no. 3 p.331-356dElsevier Ltdx0195-66717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2011.01.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245013500172300001600307500001500323520100300338592002801341650002501369650001901394650002601413650001201439650001301451650000701464650001101471650001401482650001901496650001501515650002301530651001801553653001701571653000901588653001301597653002401610653002101634653001101655700001901666700002101685700001701706700001501723700001901738700001301757700001901770773011601789856008801905852000901993655001202002IND60561744020221121022024.0190318e20170130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056174402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.10.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIglikowska, A.10aChemical composition of two mineralogically contrasting Arctic bivalves' shells and their relationships to environmental variables  ap. 903-916.  a2019-12-06  aThe main goal of this study was to determine the concentrations of trace elements in the mineralogically contrasting shells of two Arctic bivalves: Chlamys islandica and Ciliatocardium ciliatum. Aragonite shells seem to be more susceptible to the binding of metal ions, which is most likely a result of their crystal lattice structure. We suggest that less biologically controlled aragonite mineralization tends to incorporate more metal impurities into the crystal lattice in waters with a lower pH, where metal ions are more available. Higher concentrations of impurities may further increase the lattice distortion causing lower crystal lattice stability and higher susceptibility to dissolution. Calcitic shells seem to be less prone to bind metal ions than aragonite shells most likely because under strict biological control, the uptake of ions from ambient seawater is more selective; thus, the final crystal lattice is less contaminated by other metals and is more resistant to dissolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3amineralization 3aenvironmental factors 3aChlamys 3aseawater 3apH 3ametals 3aaragonite 3atrace elements 3ametal ions 3abiological control 3aArctic region 0aTrace metals 0aions 0aBivalves 0aSeawater carbonates 0aShell mineralogy 0aArctic1 aBełdowski, J.1 aChełchowski, M.1 aChierici, M.1 aKędra, M.1 aPrzytarska, J.1 aSowa, A.1 aKukliński, P.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2017 Jan. 30, v. 114, no. 2 p.903-916dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.10.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01767naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245004800170300001600218520079600234592002801030650001901058650002601077650002001103650001401123650001901137650002701156700001701183700002501200773010301225856008101328990002301409852000901432655001201441IND60094065620221122074037.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009406562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ceb.2011.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiuliani, Fabrizio10aUnconventional secretion: a stress on GRASP  ap. 498-504.  aMost proteins follow the classical secretory pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum, via the Golgi, to the plasma membrane or extracellular medium. However, some proteins reach these final destinations by two alternative routes. One sustains the extracellular delivery of cytoplasmic proteins that lack a signal peptide, the other supports the transport of transmembrane proteins to the plasma membrane in a manner that bypasses the Golgi. Here, we highlight the observation that some unconventional secretion events are triggered by cellular stress. Furthermore, one Golgi protein, Golgi Re-Assembly and Stacking Protein (GRASP), has been shown to be essential to both types of unconventional secretion and we discuss ways in which it may support these events in a Golgi-independent manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood proteins 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aplasma membrane 3asecretion 3asignal peptide 3atransmembrane proteins1 aGrieve, Adam1 aRabouille, Catherine0 tCurrent Opinion in Cell Biology.g2011 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.498-504dElsevier Ltdx0955-06747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceb.2011.04.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245007500199300001600274500002000290520129200310592002801602596008801630650001201718650001201730650002001742650002601762650002301788650001401811650001801825650001001843650001701853650001501870700002501885700002701910700002401937700002401961700003101985700001902016700002302035773013102058856007502189852000902264655001202273IND60788200820221121064928.0220811e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078820082DNAL7 a10.1002/jeq2.200142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzewczak, Kamil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2250-396610aImpact of soil incorporation of biochar on environmental radioactivity  ap. 428-439.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBiochar (charcoal made from biomass in the pyrolysis process) has found broad application in agriculture. It helps to improve both the physical and chemical properties of soil through decontamination of heavy metals and pesticides. This work examines the potential for biochar application to improve the radiological condition of soil. We investigated the activity concentration of natural and anthropogenic radionuclides in soil samples collected from fields treated with various doses of biochar (in 1–100 Mg ha⁻¹). In addition, we directly measured radon emission rate at the experimental fields. The analyses were performed using gamma spectrometry and an active method for radon emission using an AlphaGUARD instrument equipped with an accumulation box. The results of activity concentration assessments for six radionuclides, five natural and one anthropogenic, show that the only effect of biochar application into the soil is associated with the reduction of soil bulk density by this material. The radon emission rate increased by 6 mBq m⁻¹ s⁻¹, on average, depending on the biochar dose (from 1 to 100 Mg ha⁻¹). Our results demonstrate that application of biochar into soil kept without vegetation had a limited influence on the radioactivity in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data  aBIOSTRATEG3/345940/7/NCBR/2017cPolish National Centre for Research and Development 3abiochar 3abiomass 3adecontamination 3aenvironmental quality 3agamma spectrometry 3apyrolysis 3aradioactivity 3aradon 3asoil density 3avegetation1 aJednoróg, Sławomir1 aWołoszczuk, Katarzyna1 aSzlązak, Radosław1 aPodgórska, Zuzanna1 aRafalska‐Przysucha, Anna1 aGluba, Łukasz1 aŁukowski, Mateusz0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2020 Mar., v. 49, no. 2 p.428-439dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.200143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245009800180300001600278520125300294592002801547650001601575650002001591650003101611650001101642650002501653650001401678650002101692650001901713650001201732650001901744650002101763650004001784650002001824650002601844650003601870650001601906650002001922650003801942650003301980650003402013650003602047650001402083650002102097650002402118650003602142700002002178773010402198856008102302852000902383655001202392IND4458838520221119223217.0141110e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445883852DNAL7 a214404902pmid7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2011.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyko, Alex10aGenome instability and epigenetic modification—heritable responses to environmental stress?  ap. 260-266.  aAs sessile organisms, plants need to continuously adjust their responses to external stimuli to cope with changing growth conditions. Since the seed dispersal range is often rather limited, exposure of progeny to the growth conditions of parents is very probable. The plasticity of plant phenotypes cannot be simply explained by genetic changes such as point mutations, deletions, insertions and gross chromosomal rearrangements. Since many environmental stresses persist for only one or several plant generations, other mechanisms of adaptation must exist. The heritability of reversible epigenetic modifications that regulate gene expression without changing DNA sequence makes them an attractive alternative mechanism. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding how changes in genome stability and epigenetically mediated changes in gene expression could contribute to plant adaptation. We provide examples of environmentally induced transgenerational epigenetic effects that include the appearance of new phenotypes in successive generations of stressed plants. We also describe several cases in which exposure to stress leads to nonrandom heritable but reversible changes in stress tolerance in the progeny of stressed plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenome 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3aplant adaptation 3apoint mutation 3aprogeny 3aseed dispersal 3astress tolerance 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aDNA Methylation 2aDNA, Plantxchemistry 2aEpigenesis, Geneticxphysiology 2aEpigenomics 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Rearrangementxgenetics 2aGenetic Variationxphysiology 2aGenomic Instabilityxphysiology 2aPhenotype 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aSignal Transduction 2aStress, Physiologicalxgenetics1 aKovalchuk, Igor0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2011 June, v. 14, no. 3 p.260-266dElsevier Ltdx1369-52667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2011.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245012100174300001400295520149700309592002801806650001401834650002301848650002701871650000801898650002501906650001501931650002101946650001601967650002501983650002702008650002002035650001602055650001302071650002302084650001502107650001502122650001402137650001302151650002102164650001402185650002602199650002602225650001602251700002002267700001902287700001602306700001902322700001702341773009002358852000902448856008802457930003302545946001102578655001202589IND60440564620221117111046.0151024e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044056462DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1444-2906.2007.01303.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Seung-Cheol10aDietary medicinal herbs improve growth performance, fatty acid utilization, and stress recovery of Japanese flounder  ap. 70-76.  aSome effects of dietary medicinal herbs mixture (HM), Massa medicata fermentata, Crataegi fructus, Artemisia capillaries, and Cnidium officinale, in the proportions 2:2:1:1 were identified in juvenile Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus. In an 8-week feeding trial, fish were fed with 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0% HM in a moist diet composed of horse mackerel and an artificial diet in equal parts. Fish fed the diets with 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0% HM showed higher weight gain and feed efficiency than fish in 0.1 and 0% HM feed groups. No significant differences were found in survival, feed intake, final carcass proximate composition, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, plasma total cholesterol level, and alanine aminotransferase activity among the dietary treatments. Fish fed with 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0% HM showed higher total carcass unsaturated fatty acid content and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) level, and plasma high density lipoprotein-cholesterol level, but lower carcass saturated fatty acid content and plasma aspartate aminotrasferase activities than the control group. Moreover, a 10-min air exposure test with five times repeat, and an anesthesia test for 2 min with 200 p.p.m. 2-phenoxyethanol, also revealed lower mortality and lower recovery time in 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0% HM groups than the control group at the end of the trial. These results indicate that the medicinal herb mixture is useful to improve growth, fatty acid utilization, and stress recovery in the Japanese flounder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aCnidium officinale 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3aair 3aalanine transaminase 3aanesthesia 3aartificial diets 3acholesterol 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3afatty acid composition 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3aflounder 3agrowth performance 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3ajuveniles 3amackerel 3amedicinal plants 3amortality 3aproximate composition 3asaturated fatty acids 3aweight gain1 aJeong, Gwan-Sik1 aGwang-Soon, IM1 aLee, Si-Woo1 aYoo, Jin-Hyung1 aTakii, Kenji0 tFisheries science.g2007 Jan., v. 73, no. 1 p.70-76dSpringer-Verlagx0919-92687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2007.01303.x3Available from publisher's site  a20070209b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02408naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013000165300001400295520105200309592002801361650001401389650001601403650001101419650001101430650001501441650003101456650001501487650001101502650001901513650001101532650001501543653002201558653002601580653002901606653002001635700001401655700001801669700001601687700001701703700001501720773012301735856008301858852000901941655001201950IND60678198920221119150811.0200210e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067819892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.11.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiuli10aTemplate synthesis of structure-controlled 3D hollow nickel-cobalt phosphides microcubes for high-performance supercapacitors  ap. 23-31.  aGiven that combined merits of both compositions and novel structures play important roles in energy storage of electrode materials, we herein use [CH₃NH₃][NiₓCo₁₋ₓ(HCOO)₃] as self-sacrificed precursors to synthesize structure-controlled hollow nickel cobalt phosphides microcubes.

Higher weed infestation was recorded in DSR than in TRCF and TRAWD. Raising rice as TRAWD and DSR had considerable water savings but a lower grain yield than TRCF. High panicle sterility was primarily responsible for low grain yield in TRAWD and DSR systems. Nonetheless, water productivity was better in DSR and TRAWD than TRCF. Shaheen Basmati in the DSR system and Basmati 2000 in TRCF fetched the highest economic returns during 2008 and 2009, respectively. In conclusion, fine-grain rice cultivars can be grown in water-saving production systems (e.g. TRAWD and DSR); however, these water-saving production systems might incur a yield penalty.  aPublisher supplied data 3acosts and returns 3acultivars 3adirect seeding 3adrying 3agrain yield 3ainflorescences 3aproduction technology 3arice 3awater conservation 3aweeds1 aULLAH, E.1 aHUSSAIN, M.1 aFarooq, M.,1 aHAIDER, N.1 aChauhan, B.

TNT degradation rates were determined using HPLC analysis, and products were identified using LC/MS. Minimal or no TNT photolysis occurred under a 395-nm long pass filter, but under a 295-nm filter, first-order TNT degradation rate constants and apparent quantum yields increased with increasing salinity in both natural and artificial seawater. TNT rate constants increased slightly with increasing temperature (10 to 32°C) but did not change significantly with pH (6.4 to 8.1). The addition of dissolved organic matter (up to 5mg/L) to ultrapure water, artificial seawater, and natural seawater increased the TNT photolysis rate constant. Products formed by TNT photolysis in natural seawater were determined to be 2,4,6-trinitrobenzaldehyde, 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene, 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid, and 2-amino-4,6-dinitrobenzoic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrackish water 3adissolved organic matter 3aestuaries 3afilters 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apH 3aphotolysis 3asalinity 3aseawater 3atemperature 3atrinitrotoluene 0aExplosives 0aUltraviolet radiation 0aNitrogen compounds 0aPhotochemistry1 aBreuer, James E.T.1 aRios, Evelyn A.1 aJedlicka, Erin E.1 aO'Sullivan, Daniel W.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2017 Jan. 30, v. 114, no. 2 p.977-986dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.10.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010000167300001600267520205600283592002802339650001302367650001102380650002402391650001302415650001402428650001302442650001102455651001002466773009102476856008502567990002302652852000902675655001202684IND60096255620221117015452.0141104e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009625562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cretres.2011.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaioumy, H.10aRare earth elements and sulfur and strontium isotopes of upper Cretaceous phosphorites in Egypt  ap. 368-377.  aUpper Cretaceous Phosphorites from different localities in Egypt were analyzed for their rare earth elements (REEs) contents and sulfur and strontium isotopes to examine the effect of depositional conditions versus diagenesis on these parameters. The negative Ce and Eu anomalies of the study phosphorites suggest its formation under reducing conditions. However, chondrite-normalized REEs patterns show relative enrichments of LREEs over the HREEs, which is obviously different from the seawater REEs pattern suggesting post-depositional modifications on the REEs distributions during diagenesis. The difference in the REEs concentrations and Ce anomalies among the study localities as well as the similarity between the REEs patterns of these phosphorites and associated black shales might support this interpretation. The concentration of structural SO₄ ²⁻ (0.6–3.7%) and their δ³⁴S values (+0.5 to –20‰) in the upper Cretaceous phosphorites in Egypt suggest the formation of these phosphorites in the zone of sulfate reduction. On the other hand, the sulfur isotopes in the pyrite from the study phosphorites (δ³⁴S = +4.6‰ − 23‰ with an average of −7.7‰) are attributed to the influence of seawater from which pyrite was formed during diagenesis. The difference between the δ³⁴S values in the phosphorites (all are positive values) and those in the associated pyrite (mostly negative values) reflect an asymmetric sulfate and sulfide sulfur isotopic composition due to the formation of francolite (source of sulfate) and pyrite (source of sulfide) in different conditions and/or process. The ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr values of the upper Cretaceous phosphorites in Egypt are very close to the marine values during the Campanian–Maastrichtian time and their average (0.707622) is more or less comparable to the average ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr values of the Cretaceous–Eocene Tethyan phosphorites. This suggests no post-depositional alteration (i.e. diagenetic effect) on the Sr isotopic composition of these phosphorites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aisotopes 3apyrite 3arare earth elements 3aseawater 3astrontium 3asulfates 3asulfur 3aEgypt0 tCretaceous research.g2011 June, v. 32, no. 3 p.368-377dElsevier Ltdx0195-66717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2011.01.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01665naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009100161300001600252520069800268592002800966650001400994650002301008650001301031650002801044650002201072650002401094700002001118700002601138773010301164856007501267852000901342655001201351IND60578818920221120212044.0170814e20140207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057881892DNAL7 a10.1021/ol403632t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMargrey, Kaila A.10aSynthesis of 2-Pyridones by Cycloreversion of [2.2.2]- Bicycloalkene Diketopiperazines  ap. 904-907.  aA general strategy for the conversion of [2.2.2]-diazabicyclic alkene structures to 2-pyridone aromatic heterocyclic products is reported.

The technical exploitation of osseous raw materials, represented by the new concepts applied to the antler working, is recognized as one of several innovations that occur both in the Levant and in Europe during this time.Here we present preliminary results of a technological analysis conducted on the Aurignacian bone and antler industry from the Early Upper Palaeolithic layers of Manot Cave, Israel. The industry displays several similarities with its European counterpart such as the choice of bone for making “domestic” tools (recurrent morpho-types like awls) while antler was used predominantly for hunting equipment (projectile points). The complex technical exploitation of antler, almost exclusively devoted to making hunting weapons, constitutes a major feature both in the European Early Aurignacian and in the Levantine Aurignacian. Nevertheless, while simple-based antler points are common in the Levantine Aurignacian, split-based antler points, characteristic of the European Early Aurignacian are only anecdotally documented in the Levant. Unique to the Levantine industry is the common exploitation of fallow deer antler. While some of these particularities seem to be related to the different ecological niches exploited, others, such as the different type of hunting weapons, need to be assessed in light of different cultural contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus dama 3aequipment 3ahumans 3aindustry 3aniches 3araw materials 3aEurope 3aIsrael 0aLevant 0aEarly Upper Palaeolithic 0aAurignacian 0aManot Cave bone and antler technology 0aSimple-/massive-based projectile points1 aYeshurun, Reuven1 aBarzilai, Omry1 aGoder-Goldberger, Mae1 aHershkovitz, Israel1 aLavi, Ron1 aSchneller-Pels, Nehora1 aMarder, Ofer0 tQuaternary international.g2016 June 01, v. 403 p.90-106dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01602naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008500159300002000244520055000264592002800814650001500842650001200857650001400869650001700883650001100900650001500911700001800926700002000944700001700964700001700981700001600998700001901014773012401033856007401157852000901231655001201240IND60640319620221122060054.0190504e20160127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064031962DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra27713b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ning-zhi10aDeactivation of Mn/TiO₂ catalyst for NH₃-SCR reaction: effect of phosphorous  ap. 11226-11232.  aThe deactivation mechanism of phosphorous on a Mn/TiO₂ catalyst for selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH₃ was investigated in this study.

Polysaccharides from seaweed have been shown to have significant antioxidant activity both in vivo and in vitro. The ameliorative effect of Ulva lactuca polysaccharide extract (UPE) on renal injury induced by oxidative stress was analyzed. As shown by hematoxylin–eosin staining results, UPE can significantly improve the kidney injury induced by D-galactose (D-gal). Additionally, the protective mechanism of UPE on the kidney was explored. The results showed that UPE could decrease the levels of serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum cystatin C (Cys-C), lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and DNA oxidative damage (8-OHdG) and improve kidney glutathione content. Moreover, UPE significantly increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant activity in mice. UPE also decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Further investigation into the expression of apoptotic protein caspase-3 showed that UPE decreased the expression of apoptotic protein caspase-3. These results indicate that UPE has a potential therapeutic effect on renal injury caused by oxidative stress, providing a new theoretical basis for the treatment of oxidative damage diseases in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aUlva lactuca 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3acaspase-3 3acreatinine 3agalactose 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-6 3akidneys 3alipid peroxidation 3amacroalgae 3aoxidative stress 3apolysaccharides 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atherapeutics 3aurea nitrogen1 aJiang, Yanhui 1 aFu, Shan 1 aShen, Zhaopeng 1 aZong, Wenwen 1 aXia, Zhongning 1 aZhan, Zhaoya 1 aJiang, Xiaolu 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Sept. 25, v. 19, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md191005393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03921naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245014800210506011700358506007600475520196200551592002802513506003702541650001202578650001602590650002502606650002302631650002502654650002002679650001502699650002002714650001302734650001502747650001402762650002002776650001602796650001902812650002102831650001502852650001802867651001102885653001402896653002102910653002302931653001702954653000902971653000802980653000802988653000702996653000703003653000703010653000803017700002403025700001803049700002403067773011003091856008503201852000903286655001203295IND60768822320221207063705.0220404e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076882232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1190592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaolacci, Simona1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0057-623X10aWastewater valorisation in an integrated multitrophic aquaculture system; assessing nutrient removal and biomass production by duckweed species  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aquaculture industry is considered a key sector for the supply of high quality, nutritious food. However, growth of the aquaculture sector has been slow, particularly in Europe, and this is amongst others linked to concerns about environmental impacts of this industry. Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture (IMTA) has been identified as an important technology to sustainably improve freshwater fish production. In IMTA, economically valuable extractive species feed on waste produced by other species, remediating wastewater, and minimising the environmental impact of aquaculture. This study presents quantitative information on the nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency of a duckweed-based, pilot, semi-commercial IMTA system. Duckweed species are free-floating freshwater species belonging to the family of Lemnaceae. The aim of this study was to test the potential of duckweed-based IMTA under realistic environmental conditions. Three different approaches were used to assess remediation capacity; 1) assessment of water quality pre and post treatment with duckweed showed that the system can remove 0.78 and 0.38 T y⁻¹ of Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP), respectively 2) based on nitrogen and phosphorus content of newly grown duckweed biomass, it was shown that 1.71 and 0.22 T y⁻¹ of TN and TP can be removed, respectively 3) extrapolation based on laboratory established nitrogen and phosphorus uptake rates determined that 0.88 and 0.08 T y⁻¹ of TN and TP can be removed by the system. There is substantive agreement between the three assessments, and the study confirms that duckweed can maintain good quality water in an IMTA system, while yielding high protein content (21.84 ± 2.45%) biomass. The quantitative data on nitrogen and phosphorus removal inform the design of further IMTA systems, and especially create a scientific basis to determine the balance between aquaculture and extractive species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAraceae 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture industry 3abiomass production 3aenvironmental impact 3afish production 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3aprotein content 3aremediation 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awastewater 3awater quality 3aEurope 0aLemnaceae 0aPhytoremediation 0aEcointensification 0aRemoval rate 0aIMTA 0aRAS 0aRGR 0aTN 0aTP 0aDM 0aLCA1 aStejskal, Vlastimil1 aToner, Damien1 aJansen, Marcel A.K.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 June 01, v. 302 p.119059-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1190593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245009000165300001600255520122200271592002801493650001001521650002201531650001601553650001401569650001801583650001201601650001501613650001301628650000901641650001001650650002301660650002401683650001301707650002101720650002701741650001801768650001301786650001701799650001301816650001401829650001601843650001001859650001101869650001001880700002601890773013801916856007702054852000902131655001202140IND60523995120221121214828.0160701e20081230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052399512DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2008.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUcar Turker, Arzu10aEfficient plant regeneration of bittersweet (Solanum dulcamara L.), a medicinal plant  ap. 275-280.  aSolanum dulcamara L.

A reliable in vitro culture protocol for bittersweet was established. Explants (leaf and petiole segments) were cultured on Murashige and Skoog minimal organics (MSMO) medium with various plant growth regulator combinations. Leaf explants formed more shoots than petiole explants. Plant regeneration was observed through indirect organogenesis with both explants. Best shoot proliferation was obtained from leaf explants with 3 mg/l BA (benzyladenine) and 0.5 mg/l IAA (indole-3-acetic acid). Regenerated shoots were transferred to rooting media containing different levels of IAA (indole-3-acetic acid), IBA (indole-3-butyric acid), NAA (naphthalene acetic acid) or 2,4-D (2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid). Most shoots developed roots on medium with 0.5 mg/l IBA. Rooted explants were transferred to vermiculate in Magenta containers for acclimatization and after 2 weeks, they were planted in plastic pots containing potting soil and maintained in the plant growth room.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aSolanum dulcamara 3aacclimation 3aarthritis 3abenzyladenine 3acolitis 3acontainers 3aexplants 3aeyes 3aheart 3aindole acetic acid 3aindole butyric acid 3ajaundice 3amedicinal plants 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aorganogenesis 3apetioles 3aplant growth 3aplanting 3apneumonia 3apotting mix 3aroots 3ashoots 3awarts1 aCanserver Multu, Esra0 tActa Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae.g2008 Dec. 30, v. 77, no. 4 p.275-280dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:12967x0001-69777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp.2008.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245013100213300001600344520171600360592002802076650002202104650001002126650002102136650001502157650001502172650001002187650001202197650001902209650003002228650001302258650001902271650001102290650001302301650001302314650001302327650002202340650003302362650002302395650001702418650001102435653002402446653002002470653002002490653001902510653001802529700002002547700001902567700001802586773011902604856008802723852000902811655001202820IND60635076220221123033556.0190502e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063507622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.3632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRashid, Jamshaid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8031-121X10aSynthesis using natural functionalization of activated carbon from pumpkin peels for decolourization of aqueous methylene blue  ap. 369-376.  aIn this study, a novel approach was applied for modification and functionalization of pumpkin peels (PP) derived carbon using natural beetroot extract. PP waste biomass was carbonized at 250 (AC250), 350 (AC350), 450 (AC450) and 550 °C (AC550) and used as adsorbent for the scavenging of methylene blue (MB). The adsorption results revealed that AC250 was the most efficient material. Thereafter, AC250 was further modified with different acids and natural beetroot extract to enhance the adsorption efficiency for MB removal. Modified and functionalized carbon materials were characterized to determine the functional groups, crystalline nature and surface morphology of adsorbents using Fourier Transformed Infra-Red spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy. The pore size distribution measurements by non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) revealed the presence of large number of mesopores in the beetroot activated carbon (BAC) with the BET specific surface area of 3.6 m2.g−1. The adsorption studies exhibited the highest adsorption (198.15 mg.g−1) for MB using 0.5 g.L−1 of adsorbent mass at 200 mg.L−1 MB concentration and 50 °C within 180 min. Reaction kinetics analysis of the experimental data revealed that adsorption followed pseudo second order kinetic model where BAC250 showed highest reaction rate constant value of 0.0095 and correlation coefficient value of 0.9992. The equilibrium data were tested by using Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models. For both isotherms, the characteristic parameters were determined and the adsorption behaviour was found to fit well with the Langmuir isotherm model indicating monolayer adsorption of MB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacids 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abeets 3abiomass 3adecolorization 3adensity functional theory 3akinetics 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3amoieties 3aporosity 3apumpkins 3areaction kinetics 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3awastes 0aAdsorption kinetics 0aGreen synthesis 0aModified carbon 0aMethylene blue 0aPumpkin peels1 aTehreem, Fakhra1 aRehman, Adeela1 aKumar, Rajeev0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 25, v. 671 p.369-376dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.3633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245007900175300001800254520098300272592002801255596007001283650001701353650001601370650002401386650002101410650001101431650002601442650001101468650002501479650001501504651001201519653002401531653002501555653002401580653002901604653002301633700002301656700002201679700001801701773011901719856008501838852000901923655001201932IND60654110220221122045643.0190722e20190824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065411022DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2018.14742732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDragicevic, Nevena,10aEffect of source-varying input data on erosion potential model performance  ap. 1109-1122.  aThis paper examines the performance of the Erosion Potential Method (EPM or Gavrilović) and the model response to input data variations caused by choosing different sources of information for the same parameter. The research presented addresses the input data uncertainty via an analysis of the two model input parameters (the soil protection coefficient and the soil erodibility coefficient). The parameter uncertainty analysis is performed following two different approaches: uncertainty analyses of both the selected sample size and the entire population are conducted for an erosion assessment case study of the Dubračina River catchment, Croatia. The analysis indicated that, when changing the data source, significant changes in the model outcome values can occur (up to 47% for this case study). Future method modifications should consider the mitigation of these two parameters by potentially making structural changes in the model and therefore moderating the effect.  aPublisher supplied data  a114-0982709-2549cHydrology of Sensitive Water Resources in Karst 3acase studies 3aerodibility 3ainformation sources 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aparameter uncertainty 3arivers 3auncertainty analysis 3awatersheds 3aCroatia 0aSediment production 0auncertainty analysis 0asource-varying data 0aErosion Potential Method 0aGavrilović method1 aKarleuša, Barbara1 aOžanić, Nevenka1 aKisić, Ivica0 tGeocarto international.g2019 Aug. 24, v. 34, no. 10 p.1109-1122dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2018.14742733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009300155300002000248520162400268592002801892650000801920650001201928650001401940650000901954650001901963650001401982650001901996650001302015650001402028650003002042650001602072650001902088650001402107700001502121700001802136700001302154773012402167856007402291852000902365655001202374IND60640319920221122060020.0190504e20160223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064031992DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra27719a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiao10aSpecific interaction of platinated DNA and proteins by surface plasmon resonance imaging  ap. 21900-21906.  aThe DNA-targeting platinum complex cisplatin is one of the most successful drugs for clinical treatment of solid tumors, and several new analogues of transplatin have shown cytostatic activity recently. The specific recognition of platinated DNA with cellular proteins is of great interest for better understanding of the pharmaceutical mechanisms. Herein, a surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) method to differentiate the interaction between the protein human high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and DNAs, and human nuclear protein positive cofactor 4 (PC4) and DNAs has been developed. Four kinds of DNAs were immobilized on the gold films including platinated-DNA adducts (cisplatin and trans-[PtCl₂(NH₃)(thiazole)] (trans-PtTz) damaged DNAs; referred to as cisPt–DNA1 and transPtTz–DNA2, respectively) and native DNAs (DNA1 and DNA2, as controls). The validation of the method has been proven by the specific recognition of HMGB1 and cisPt–DNA1 first. The results obtained indicated that the PC4 was more likely to bind to platinated DNAs (cisPt–DNA1 and transPtTz–DNA2) than the native DNAs. Temperature-dependent kinetics and thermodynamics revealed that the recognition behavior was not affected by a temperature changefrom 15 °C to 42 °C. This label-free method provides authentic results, as the controls can be simultaneously determined by a single chip under the same conditions, and this makes it suited for other high throughput analyses of interactions between drug-damaged DNAs and proteins to better understand the activity/inactivity mechanisms of drugs and drug screening/discovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aammonia 3acisplatin 3agold 3aimage analysis 3aneoplasms 3anucleoproteins 3aplatinum 3ascreening 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3athiazoles1 aXu, Jiying1 aLiu, Chanjuan1 aChen, Yi0 tRSC advances.g2016 Feb. 23, v. 6, no. 26 p.21900-21906dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra27719a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02073naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012800160520081700288592002801105650001301133650002201146650003601168650001701204650001601221650001701237650001001254650002401264700001801288700001901306700001401325700002001339700001901359700002001378700002001398700001801418700001501436773012801451856007501579852000901654655001201663IND60754279220221121224413.0211023e20210926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075427922DNAL7 a10.3390/md191005432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Wei-Mao 10aStructurally Diverse Polycyclic Salicylaldehyde Derivative Enantiomers from a Marine-Derived Fungus Eurotium sp.

However, our knowledge about these intra-African dispersals and the character of the demographic connection between North and sub-Saharan Africa are poorly understood and archaeological records in the Sahel are limited. Between 1940 and 1960, the Senegalese littoral yielded prehistoric sites attributed to the Middle Stone Age (MSA) or Middle Palaeolithic. This chrono-cultural framework is based on typological considerations about lithic industries generally found in secondary or disturbed stratigraphic contexts. Of these sites, Tiemassas has been considered to be the most important. Located about 100 km from Dakar, the site has been considered Middle Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and even Neolithic, but has not been analysed in detail. In this paper, the compositions of the lithic assemblages represented at Tiemassas are discussed and their technological strategies are analyzed. Results indicate that the site is characterized by the use of diverse strategies of raw material exploitation in relation to the morphology and morphometry of the exploited pebbles. The assemblage is flake dominated, generally characterized by typical MSA methods such as Levallois, opportunistic (Système par Surface de Débitage Alterné (SSDA)) and discoid flaking, and more rarely by laminar methods. Finally, retouch is usually applied to transform objects into side-scrapers. These results are indicative of a MSA cultural attribution and represent a first step in the process of definition and description of the Senegalese MSA together with its wider continental context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSahel 3aflaking 3ahumans 3aindustry 3alittoral zone 3amorphometry 3araw materials 3aSahara Desert 3aSenegal 0aMiddle Stone Age 0aWest Africa 0aTiemassas 0aHomo sapiens dispersal1 aNdiaye, Matar0 tQuaternary international.g2016 July 15, v. 408 p.4-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01638naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245015200169300001400321520057000335592002800905650002500933650001900958650001700977650001100994650002001005650001501025650003801040700002401078773013601102856007701238852000901315655001201324IND60523995320221121214739.0160701e20121119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052399532DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2012.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrabsztunowicz, Magda10aIsolation of intact and pure chloroplasts from leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana plants acclimated to low irradiance for studies on Rubisco regulation  ap. 91-95.  aA protocol is presented for low-cost and fast isolation of intact and pure chloroplasts from leaves of plants acclimated to low irradiance.

The water sample was prepared without filtered through microfiltration membrane and 500mL of source water was enriched by the solid phase extraction (SPE). The targent compounds were analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS). The optimized analytical method was validated in terms of recovery, precision and method detection limits (MDLs). The recovery values after correction with the corresponding labeled standard were between 97.3 and 113.0% for samples spiked at 5ng/L, 10ng/L and 20ng/L. All PFCs showed good linearity and the linear correlation coefficient was over 0.99. The precisions were 1.0–9.0% (n=6). As the result of the enrichment, the MDL values ranged from 0.03 to 1.9ng/L and were enough for analysis of the trace levels of PFCs in the Taihu Lake. The method was further validated in determining the source water and the results showed that PFHxS, PFHxA, PFOA and PFOS were the primary PFCs in Taihu Lake which might be different from the other researches. The method can be used for determination of PFCs in water with a stable recovery, good reproducibility, low detection limit, less solvent consumption, time saving and labor saving. To our knowledge, this is the first method that describes the effect of the filter membrane on the determination of PFCs in water which might acquire more accurate concentration of PFCs in Taihu Lake.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3alabor 3alakes 3aliquid chromatography 3amicrofiltration 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aPerfluorinated compounds (PFCs) 0aTaihu Lake 0aUHPLC–MS/MS 0aFilter membrane1 aLing, Xia1 aLiu, Wenwei1 aKong, Lingcan1 aYao, Yuyang0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 1031 p.61-67dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2016.07.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245014600196300001800342500002000360520141500380592002801795596008601823596007501909650002501984650001702009650001702026650002602043650001502069650002302084650001202107650001402119650002502133650001902158650001402177650001002191700005902201700006102260700005802321700005902379700006802438700007802506773011502584856007402699852000902773655001202782IND60778446020221120065137.0220527e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077844602DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.157412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yu‐chi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3023-666610aFunctional divergence of a pair of Arabidopsis phospho‐base methyltransferases, PMT1 and PMT3, conferred by distinct N‐terminal sequences  ap. 1198-1212.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn seed plants, phospho‐base N‐methyltransferase (PMT) catalyzes a key step in the biosynthesis pathway of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the most abundant phospholipid class. Arabidopsis thaliana possesses three copies of PMT, with PMT1 and PMT3 play a primary role because the pmt1 pmt3 double mutant shows considerably reduced PC content with a pale seedling phenotype. Although the function of PMT1 and PMT3 may be redundant because neither of the parental single mutants showed a similar mutant phenotype, major developmental defects and possible functional divergence of these PMTs underlying the pale pmt1 pmt3 seedling phenotype are unknown. Here, we show the major developmental defect of the pale seedlings in xylem of the hypocotyl with partial impairments in chloroplast development and photosynthetic activity in leaves. Although PMT1 and PMT3 are localized at the endoplasmic reticulum, their tissue‐specific expression pattern was distinct in hypocotyls and roots. Intriguingly, the function of PMT3 but not PMT1 requires its characteristic N‐terminal sequence in addition to the promoter because truncation of the N‐terminal sequence of PMT3 or substitution with PMT1 driven by the PMT3 promoter failed to rescue the pale pmt1 pmt3 seedling phenotype. Thus, PMT3 function requires the N‐terminal sequence in addition to its promoter, whereas the PMT1 function is defined by the promoter.  aPublisher supplied data  aKAKENHI, 20K06691cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology  a109‐2628‐B‐001‐027cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abiosynthesis 3achloroplasts 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3ahypocotyls 3amethyltransferases 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphotosynthesis 3aseedlings 3axylem1 aTan, Yue‐Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2817-34081 aChang, Chin‐Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2609-758X1 aNguyen, Van C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8702-33221 aKanehara, Kazue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3779-14971 aKobayashi, K.q(Koichi),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3726-47901 aJohnson, Yuki N.q(Yuki Nakamura),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2897-43010 tplant journal.g2022 May, v. 110, no. 4 p.1198-1212dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.157413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245010700203300001600310500001100326520176900337592002802106596007402134650001302208650002502221650002102246650002802267650002002295650001802315650001702333650001502350650002202365650002502387700005502412700005502467773011902522856008202641852000902723655001202732IND60673903120221121225717.0191020e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067390312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-019-03968-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhenhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6576-894010aModeling of stress corrosion cracking growth rates for key structural materials of nuclear power plant  ap. 439-463.  aReview  aStress corrosion cracking in light water reactor is one of the most important factors threatening the safe operation of nuclear power plants. Due to the severity, generality and various safety and economic problems caused by this phenomenon, it is necessary to establish a model for predicting the stress corrosion cracking growth rates. This paper provides an overview of three main methods for predicting stress corrosion cracking growth rates in recent decades, i.e., empirical, deterministic and calculation methods, which are introduced in detail. Empirical models describe classical statistical analysis and emerging artificial neural network method, both of which are based on a large number of experimental test data mining. They are convenient and relatively accurate in predicting, but require extensive, time-consuming and expensive tests for different service environments. Deterministic models aim to establish a theoretical relationship between crack growth rate and various influencing parameters by studying the stress corrosion cracking mechanism. Many scholars have proposed different mechanisms to scientifically explain the stress corrosion cracking phenomenon and propose corresponding crack growth rate models. Calculation models reveal the mechanism of crack initiation and propagation in different layers of materials by means of finite element method based on fracture mechanics and multiscale method based on quantum mechanics. They provide new idea for future research on stress corrosion cracking and bridge the quantitative mechanism or model, but no specific stress corrosion cracking growth rate model is formed. The article concludes with the prospect, aim and direction for stress corrosion cracking mechanism and prediction model.  aPublisher supplied data  aZ181100005218005cBeijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission 3acracking 3adeterministic models 3aempirical models 3afinite element analysis 3aneural networks 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3aprediction 3aquantum mechanics 3astatistical analysis1 aLu, Yonghao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0464-29541 aWang, Xinyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5867-90230 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Jan., v. 55, no. 2 p.439-463dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-019-03968-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245014400204300001400348520158900362592002801951650001801979650001001997650001302007650001302020650002002033650001102053650001802064651001102082651001202093653001802105653001602123653001502139653001302154653002002167653002202187700001602209700001402225700001302239700001702252700001602269700001402285700001502299773010602314856008502420852000902505655001202514IND60567332320221121120943.0180904e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056733232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeckel, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8505-657X10aF-content variation in mammoth ivory from Aurignacian contexts: Preservation, alteration, and implications for ivory-procurement strategies  ap. 40-50.  aThis article presents the results of two series of micro-PIXE/PIGE analysis on mammoth ivory samples from four Aurignacian sites in France (Abri Castanet, Grotte d'Isturitz) and Germany (Hohle Fels, Vogelherd). Specifically, we report variation in ivory preservation as indicated by fluorine (F) content and ratios of MgO/CaO from Aurignacian horizons known to contain ivory industries. Though all samples derive from respectively homogenous sedimentary contexts, results show very different pattern of F-content variation among sites. F uptake in ivory is a more complex process than that observed for bone, and the structural/morphological reasons for this are explained. High-resolution data on the archaeological context of the samples from Abri Castanet also allows for examination of the effects of horizontal and vertical distribution on F-content and the sorting of F-content data by sedimentary unit. A definitive model for fluorine uptake during ivory diagenesis will require further investigation, but a close examination of the current data provides novel insight into processes of taphonomy and diagenesis in this exceptional and highly valued raw material, as well as further evidence to support regionally distinct strategies of ivory procurement in the Early Aurignacian. In combination with additional lines of faunal and archaeological evidence, it is demonstrated that ivory procurement in the Swabian Jura focused on fresh local sources of ivory, while procurement strategies in Northern Aquitaine focused on ivory collection from natural deposits of varying age.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium oxide 3afauna 3afluorine 3aindustry 3amagnesium oxide 3amodels 3araw materials 3aFrance 3aGermany 0aMammoth ivory 0aAurignacian 0aDiagenesis 0aFluorine 0aMicro-PIXE/PIGE 0aUpper Paleolithic1 aMüller, K.1 aWhite, R.1 aWolf, S.1 aConard, N.J.1 aNormand, C.1 aFloss, H.1 aReiche, I.0 tQuaternary international.g2016 June 01, v. 403 p.40-50dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010900165300001600274520165700290592002801947650000801975650001501983650001701998650001802015650001702033650001502050650002002065650003102085650001002116650002802126650001102154650001702165650001602182650002402198650002202222650002902244650002602273650001502299653000902314653000802323653000802331653000802339653000802347653000802355653000902363653000902372653000802381653000802389653000802397653000802405653000802413653000802421653002702429653000902456653002502465700001602490700001602506700001502522700001602537773007402553856008202627852000902709655001202718IND60552512020221118012832.0161021e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055251202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.08.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Meiling10aAnalysis of differentially expressed genes under UV-B radiation in the desert plant Reaumuria soongorica  ap. 265-272.  aReaumuria soongorica is one of the typical desert plants that present excellent tolerance to adverse environments. However, its molecular response to UV-B radiation remains poorly understood. To test the response and tolerance mechanisms of R. soongorica to the increasing UV-B radiation, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were investigated between the control and UV-B radiation groups. A total of 2150 DEGs were detected between the two groups, of which 561 were up-regulated and 1589 were down-regulated. For functional analysis, DEGs were divided into three groups: (i) Chloroplast-localized proteins, including photosynthesis-associated proteins, ribulose-phosphate-3-epimerase, and ATP-dependent Clp protease. Their transcripts were inhibited, implying that the normal function of chloroplast was affected by UV-B radiation. (ii) Proteins involved in signaling transduction, such as phototropins and GTP-binding proteins. The transcriptional alternation of phototropins may reduce the penetration of UV-B radiation by regulating phototropism, stomatal opening, and chloroplast relocation. The down regulation of GTP-binding proteins may inhibit replication of potentially damaged DNA through preventing cell division; and (iii) proteins for lipid transfer and flavonoids biosynthesis. The up-regulation of these genes suggested that lipid transfer and flavonoids may have a protective function in response to UV-B radiation. Thus, UV-B radiation may lead to the disruption of chloroplasts function. The induction of genes for signal transduction and protective proteins may be a strategy for responding to UV-B radiation in R. soongorica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aG-proteins 3abiosynthesis 3acell division 3achloroplasts 3aflavonoids 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alipid transfer proteins 3alipids 3aphototropism 3aproteinases 3asignal transduction 3astomatal movement 3atranscription (genetics) 3aultraviolet radiation 3axerophytes 0aDEGs 0aLTP 0aDGE 0aTPM 0aFDR 0aPsb 0aLhcI 0aphot 0aRan 0aArf 0aCHS 0aFGT 0aLAR 0aDFR 0aDigital gene profiling 0aUV-B 0aReaumuria soongorica1 aLi, Xinrong1 aLiu, Yubing1 aShi, Yulan1 aMa, Xiaofei0 tGene.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 574 p.265-272dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.08.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03761naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245016200172300001400334500001500348520182500363592002802188650001202216650002002228650001102248650001002259650001502269650003302284650002902317650001302346650001902359650003102378650001402409650002802423650002202451650002002473650001102493650002602504650001702530650001302547650000902560650002902569650002202598650002202620650002102642650001702663650002002680650002302700650002502723650001302748653002602761700002102787700002002808700002302828700002402851700002002875700002102895773010402916856008203020852000903102655001203111IND60532084520221119223950.0180905e20170725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053208452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2016.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLicciardello, Grazia10aTranscriptome analysis of Pseudomonas mediterranea and P. corrugata plant pathogens during accumulation of medium-chain-length PHAs by glycerol bioconversion  ap. 39-47.  a2019-12-06  aPseudomonas corrugata and P. mediterranea are soil inhabitant bacteria, generally living as endophytes on symptomless plants and bare soil, but also capable of causing plant diseases. They share a similar genome size and a high proteome similarity. P. corrugata produces many biomolecules which play an important role in bacterial cell survival and fitness. Both species produce different medium-chain-length PHAs (mcl-PHAs) from the bioconversion of glycerol to a transparent film in P. mediterranea and a sticky elastomer in P. corrugata. In this work, using RNA-seq we investigated the transcriptional profiles of both bacteria at the early stationary growth phase with glycerol as the carbon source. Quantitative analysis of P. mediterranea transcripts versus P. corrugata revealed that 1756 genes were differentially expressed. A total of 175 genes were significantly upregulated in P. mediterranea, while 217 were downregulated. The largest group of upregulated genes was related to transport systems and stress response, energy and central metabolism, and carbon metabolism. Expression levels of most genes coding for enzymes related to PHA biosynthesis and central metabolic pathways showed no differences or only slight variations in pyruvate metabolism. The most relevant result was the significantly increased expression in P. mediterranea of genes involved in alginate production, an important exopolysaccharide, which in other Pseudomonas spp. plays a key role as a virulence factor or in stress tolerance and shows many industrial applications. In conclusion, the results provide useful information on the co-production of mcl-PHAs and alginate from glycerol as carbon source by P. mediterranea in the design of new strategies of genetic regulation to improve the yield of bioproducts or bacterial fitness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzymes 3aplant pathogens 3acarbon 3agenes 3aendophytes 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aPseudomonas mediterranea 3aproteome 3acell viability 3agene expression regulation 3avirulence 3aindustrial applications 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptomics 3aenergy 3aquantitative analysis 3apyruvic acid 3aglycerol 3asoil 3atranscription (genetics) 3abiotransformation 3abiobased products 3astress tolerance 3abiosynthesis 3astress response 3aexopolysaccharides 3abiochemical pathways 3abacteria 0aPseudomonas corrugata1 aFerraro, Rosario1 aRusso, Marcella1 aStrozzi, Francesco1 aCatara, Antonino F.1 aBella, Patrizia1 aCatara, Vittoria0 tNew biotechnology.g2017 July 25, v. 37 p.39-47dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4392691x1871-67847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2016.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006400167506011700231506007600348520115100424592002801575506003701603650001601640650002401656650001701680650001801697650001401715650001301729650001601742700002901758773012101787856008301908852000901991655001202000IND60794700820221207061028.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079470082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jafr.2022.1003932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillamiel, Mar10aUpdate of challenges for food quality and safety management  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis article aims to review how the concept of food quality and safety has evolved in recent years depending on the different circumstances that have been occurring from both, the point of view of scientific-technological progress and the influence that external agents have had, environmental and biological, with special emphasis on the recent pandemic. With this work, we have tried to show that the notion of food quality reposes on an intricate and multi-dimensional idea, which is affected by a broad series of situational and contextual factors. Thus, it has been showed that the traditional concept of food quality based on consumer acceptance and nutrition has been unavoidably implemented with an approach of a personalized nutrition. Approaches related to authentication and safety control based on noninvasive techniques and robust tools for the data treatment also offer new perspectives in food quality and safety. However, perhaps the most urgent point is to link in such a way the innovation and the production of sustainable food systems to demonstrate that the One Health and Zero Waste concepts are not a wishful but a reality.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagriculture 3aconsumer acceptance 3afood quality 3afood research 3anutrition 3apandemic 3azero wastes1 aMéndez-Albiñana, Pablo0 tJournal of agriculture and food research.g2022 Dec., v. 10 p.100393-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27273x2666-15437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafr.2022.1003933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245009800167300001200265500002000277520192400297592002802221650001802249650002102267650001202288650001402300650002002314650001802334650001902352651001002371773012002381856008002501852000902581655001202590IND60778446320221120065225.0220527s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077844632DNAL7 a10.4195/nse2018.11.00202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahler, Robert L.10aUniversity Science‐Based Education Positively Impacts College Student Views of Water Issues  ap. 1-8.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCORE IDEAS: This study measured student opinions about water issues. Students participated in a paired‐survey instrument of an environmental science class. tSudent views of water resources were affected by gender and college major. Science‐based education changed preconceived water resource opinions of students. Most students entering universities in the United States have established views on water resource issues. The purpose of this 25‐year study was to measure the impact of science‐based education on student opinions of water quality, water quantity, and drinking water issues. A total of 8523 students enrolled in the introductory environmental science class between 1993 and 2017 at the University of Idaho provided opinions to specific water‐related statements by taking a repeated measures survey that was administered at the beginning (Week 1) and end (Week 15) of the course. Over 60% of students initially believed (Week 1) that water pollution had gotten worse in the last 25 years; however, by Week 15, 62.8% believed that water pollution had actually decreased. Males were more likely to consider water cleaner, safer, and more plentiful than females. A majority of students initially felt that bottled water was safer than urban tap water (66.1%); however, by the end of the course only 13.4% thought that bottled water was safer. The most important finding of this study was that through a science‐based education process, students learned and were willing to change their initial ideas about water issues to align with views that are most accepted by science. Consequently, as long as this and other similar courses at universities across the country are taught from a science‐based perspective, they effectively align student opinions with current scientific thought and improve student preparation for making sound decisions about the environment in an increasingly complex world.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottled water 3acollege students 3asurveys 3atap water 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awater quantity 3aIdaho0 tNatural sciences education.g2019, v. 48, no. 1 p.1-8dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:27126x2168-82817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4195/nse2018.11.00203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01249naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009200157300001600249520019000265592002800455650002300483650002300506650001500529650002900544700002100573700001900594700002000613700001900633700001900652700002000671700002100691773010300712856007500815852000900890655001200899IND60578819520221120212156.0170814e20140207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057881952DNAL7 a10.1021/ol403645y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Chia-Chi10aPractical Synthesis of N-Substituted Cyanamides via Tiemann Rearrangement of Amidoximes  ap. 892-895.  aA facile and general synthesis of various N-substituted cyanamides was accomplished by the Tiemann rearrangement of amidoximes with benzenesulfonyl chlorides (TsCl or o-NsCl) and DIPEA.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3acyanamides 3aorganochlorine compounds1 aHsieh, Tsung-Han1 aLiao, Pen-Yuan1 aLiao, Zhen-Yuan1 aZhang, Zhiwei,1 aShih, Yu-Chiao1 aYeh, Wen-Hsiung1 aChien, Tun-Cheng0 tOrganic letters.g2014 Feb. 07, v. 16, no. 3 p.892-895dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fol403645y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245014700172300001600319520074700335592002801082650004401110650003701154650001201191650001401203650001201217650001401229650002601243650002001269650001101289650001901300650001701319650001601336650002401352650001201376653003201388653002601420653002201446653002401468653002201492700001201514700001401526700002301540700001601563700001401579700001501593700001401608773010101622856008601723852000901809655001201818IND60562599720221121131938.0170713e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056259972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2017.01.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, M.E.10aFunctionalization of biochar derived from lignocellulosic biomass using microwave technology for catalytic application in biodiesel production  ap. 165-173.  aA studyto produce an efficient catalyst to be used for biodiesel production was carried out introducingsulfonic groups in biochar using a microwave reactor.The transesterification reaction of waste cooking oils using the catalyst was also evaluated in a microwave reactor.

These results were confirmed through FT-IR and XPS analyses. A reduction in the surface area of the biochar was observed during the sulfonation. An increase of SO3H groups on the biochar surface was responsible for a higher FAME yield close to 90%.

Excavated in the 1950s and more recently, the richness and time-depth of the cave's archaeological record are unsurpassed by any other site in northern Cyrenaica. As a result, the Haua Fteah sequence has long been used to represent the culture history of the region as a whole. Recent geoarchaeological surveys of the Gebel Akhdar, as well as pre-desert and desert biomes further to the south, have resulted in the discovery of numerous MSA and LSA sites. The vast majority of these sites consist of surface lithics that cannot be dated currently. In contrast, parts of the Haua Fteah sequence have been dated using various chronometric methods. Using data collected through lithic attribute analysis, coupled with various statistical approaches (including Discriminant Function Analysis, or DFA), this paper explores variation in core reduction strategies within Haua Fteah from the early MSA to early LSA. Collections of cores from various sites located throughout the landscape are contrasted against those from Haua Fteah. By comparing undated cores from the landscape with those from different occupation phases at Haua Fteah, DFA classification is tested as a method for imparting an approximate chronology to the former. The results indicate notable variation in reduction strategies within the MSA at Haua Fteah, and notable similarities between early MSA (“Pre-Aurignacian”) and early LSA (“early Dabban”) core morphologies and technologies. Because of the latter in particular, together with several other factors that may be underpinning spatio-temporal variability in core reduction strategies, caution is recommended in loosely assigning approximate chronologies to surface lithic sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adata collection 3adiscriminant analysis 3aecosystems 3alandscapes 3asurveys 3aLibya 0aHaua Fteah 0aLibya 0aMiddle Stone Age 0aLate Stone Age 0aLithic technology 0aDiscriminant Function Analysis0 tQuaternary international.g2016 July 15, v. 408 p.53-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.12.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245011700171520118000288592002801468650001001496650000801506650001501514650001001529650001901539650001801558700003701576700002301613700003201636700003601668773012801704856007501832852000901907655001201916IND60754279820221121224506.0211023e20210928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075427982DNAL7 a10.3390/md191005472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamora-Bustillos, Roberto 10aIdentification of Novel Conotoxin Precursors from the Cone Snail Conus spurius by High-Throughput RNA Sequencing  aMarine gastropods of the genus Conus, comprising more than 800 species, have the characteristic of injecting worms and other prey with venom. These conopeptide toxins, highly diverse in structure and action, are highly potent and specific for their molecular targets (ion channels, receptors, and transporters of the prey’s nervous system), and thus are important research tools and source for drug discovery. Next-generation sequencing technologies are speeding up the discovery of novel conopeptides in many of these species, but only limited information is available for Conus spurius, which inhabits sandy mud. To search for new precursor conopeptides, we analyzed the transcriptome of the venous ducts of C. spurius and identified 55 putative conotoxins. Seven were selected for further study and confirmed by Sanger sequencing to belong to the M-superfamily (Sr3.M01 and Sr3.M02), A-superfamily (Sr1.A01 and Sr1.A02), O-superfamily (Sr15.O01), and Con-ikot-ikot (Sr21.CII01 and Sr22.CII02). Six of these have never been reported. To our knowledge, this report is the first to use high-throughput RNA sequencing for the study of the diversity of C. spurius conotoxins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aConus 3aRNA 3aconotoxins 3adrugs 3anervous system 3atranscriptome1 aMartínez-Núñez, Mario Alberto1 aAguilar, Manuel B.1 aCollí-Dula, Reyna Cristina1 aBrito-Domínguez, Diego Alfredo0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Sept. 28, v. 19, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md191005473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04059naa a2201297 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245009900161300001600260520105800276592002801334650001701362650002801379650001301407650002101420650001001441650002301451650002101474650001401495650000901509650001401518650002001532650003101552650001501583650001101598650001001609650001501619650002001634650002001654653001001674653001601684653001501700653000801715653001001723653001201733653000901745653001101754653001401765653001301779653000901792653001001801653000801811653000801819653000901827653000901836653000801845653000801853653000901861653000901870653000801879653000801887653000901895653000901904653001001913653000901923653000701932653000901939653000901948653000901957653000901966653000901975653000901984653000901993653002002002653000802022653001002030653001002040653000902050653000902059653000902068653000902077653000802086653000902094653000902103653001702112653000702129653001702136653001702153653001702170653001802187653001802205653001602223653001902239653001802258653001802276653001702294653001202311653000802323653001602331653001102347653001002358653000902368653001502377653001802392700005802410700001302468700001402481700002002495700001502515700001802530700001802548700001802566773007402584856008202658852000902740655001202749IND60552512320221118012821.0161021e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055251232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.08.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ling10aTranscriptome analysis of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) fed with animal and plant diets  ap. 371-379.  aNumerous studies have been focused on the replacement of fish meal by other alternative protein sources. However, little is currently known about the molecular mechanism of utilization of diets with different protein sources in fish. Grass carp is a typical herbivorous fish. To elucidate the relationship between gene expression and utilization of animal and plant diets, transcriptome sequencing was performed in grass carp fed with chironomid larvae and duckweed. Grass carp fed with duckweed had significantly higher relative length of gut than those fed with chironomid larvae. 4435 differentially expressed genes were identified between grass carp fed with chironomid larvae and duckweed in brain, liver and gut, involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, appetite control, circadian rhythm, digestion and metabolism pathways. These pathways might play important roles in utilization of diets with different protein sources in grass carp. And the findings could provide a new insight into the replacement of fish meal in artificial diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomidae 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aappetite 3aartificial diets 3abrain 3acell proliferation 3acircadian rhythm 3adigestion 3afish 3afish meal 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aherbivores 3alarvae 3aliver 3ametabolism 3aprotein sources 3atranscriptomics 0aABCA1 0aABCB11/BSEP 0aABCC2/MRP2 0aAkt 0aANOVA 0aApoA-IV 0aApoB 0aArntl2 0aBhlhb/Dec 0aBSSL/CEL 0aCELA 0aClock 0aCPA 0aCPB 0aCry2 0aCTRL 0aDEG 0adph 0aEgfr 0aFBP1 0aFDR 0aFgf 0aFgfr 0aG6PC 0aGalR1 0aGhrb 0aGK 0aHRas 0aInsr 0aIrs2 0aKEGG 0aMAPK 0aMGAM 0aNCBI 0aNr1d1/Rev-erbα 0aOxt 0aPEPCK 0aPer1b 0aPer3 0aPI3K 0aPLA2 0aPRSS 0aPyy 0aRorc 0aRPKM 0aSCARB1/SR-B1 0aSI 0aSLC1A1/EAAT3 0aSLC1A5/ASCT2 0aSLC2A2/GLUT2 0aSLC6A19/B0AT1 0aSLC7A7/y+LAT1 0aSLC7A8/LAT2 0aSLC7A9/B0,+AT1 0aSLC15A1/PepT1 0aSLC16A10/TAT1 0aSLC22A7/OAT2 0aSLC38A2 0aSRA 0aUtilization 0aAnimal 0aPlant 0aDiet 0aGrass carp 0aTranscriptome1 aLiang, Xu-Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6010-30661 aHe, Shan1 aSun, Jian1 aWen, Zheng-Yong1 aHe, Yu-Hui1 aCai, Wen-Jing1 aWang, Ya-Ping1 aTao, Ya-Xiong0 tGene.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 574 p.371-379dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.08.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01930naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013300166300001600299520088200315592002801197650001001225650001001235650001501245650001001260650001201270650001601282650001001298700001901308700002901327700002101356700002001377773012601397856004801523852000901571655001201580IND50070416920221118034057.0131107e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007041692DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590130600952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaumova, E.

The morphology of the gastrointestinal tract of hares, which is similar in the two species studied, was described in detail. The macrostructure of the inner surface of the ileocecal junction was investigated. The particularities of the architectonics of the mucous membrane of the intestine that are specific for hares were revealed. In the jejunum of both hare species, the mucous membrane is represented by villi with merged bases, which form circular plates. The mucosa of the colon forms large conical villi, the surface of which is scattered with secreting cells. The possible functional significance of the revealed morphological particularities is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepus 3acolon 3acoprophagy 3ahares 3ajejunum 3amicroscopes 3avilli1 aZharova, G.

In our research program to use natural hard fibers in the woven fabric of composite materials, we have initiated a characteriza tion study of lechuguilla fibers obtained from the plant Agave lechuguilla, which grows in a wild form in the arid and semiarid lands of the North American continent, particularly in the Chihuahuan desert. These fibers were characterized in their physical properties such as porosity, density, diameter, and length distribution and in their mechanical properties such as tenacity, percent elongation, and initial modulus. This characterization was carried out statistically for the bases and the tips of the fibers, although in some cases the intermediate segment was also included. The results obtained indicate that the fiber tips are of greater tenacity, initial modulus, and density than the fiber bases. Additionally, the physical and the mechanical data show that lechuguilla fibers are comparable to glass fibers and therefore are potentially an acceptable candidate for applications in composite materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMexico1 aCastillo, J.

Heavy metal sources, as well as triggering mechanism, were analyzed using a physicochemical, statistical and spatial approach. Results revealed that out of the 2600 samples analyzed, 214 (representing 8.24%) for Fe and 606 wells (representing 23.34%) for Mn exceeded the water standard. Organic matter–rich sediments and Fe-Mn nodules in aquifer and soil serve as sources of Fe and Mn. Organic and inorganic complex formations, as well as long residence time, were found to foster the release of Fe and Mn into groundwater. Additionally, pH and well depth was important in triggering Mn dissolution while groundwater mineralization, depth to the water table and well proximity to the river were found to have minimal/negligible effect on heavy metal mobilization. The removal of Fe and Mn from the water before use was proposed along with the sinking of deeper wells for groundwater exploitation to limit the use of polluted water.  aPublisher supplied data  a41572216cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  aDD20190340-W09cChina Geological Survey Shenyang Geological Survey Center "Hydrogeological Survey of Songnen Plain" Project  a2018-13cGeological Survey Foundation of Jilin Province 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amanganese 3amineralization 3apH 3arivers 3asoil 3awater pollution 3awater table 3aChina1 aXiao, Changlai1 aZhang, Zhihao1 aLiang, Xiujuan0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 Oct., v. 192, no. 10 p.619-619dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08571-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009500165300001600260520133800276592002801614650001501642650001501657650002201672650001201694650002001706650001301726650002401739650001301763650001301776650001501789650002101804650001301825650001201838650002301850650000901873650002501882653001201907653003401919653001001953653001401963653001501977700001401992700001702006700001402023773009902037856008502136852000902221655001202230IND60609697920221120053255.0181010e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060969792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2017.07.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ming10aMethanol promoted synthesis of porous hierarchical α-Ni(OH)2 for the removal of Congo red  ap. 377-385.  aPorous hierarchical Ni(OH)2 composed of petal-like nanosheets with a mix of α- and β-phase was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method using urea as precipitating agent. In order to tune the pore properties and optimize phase compositions of Ni(OH)2, different types of alcohols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol) were added into the hydrothermal systems. It was found that the addition of methanol would retain the porous hierarchical structure of Ni(OH)2, enlarge the pore size and volume, make the transformation of β phase to α phase. However, other alcohols (ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol) would destroy the porous hierarchical structure and have little impact on the phase transformation. Using the as-prepared samples as adsorbents for the removal of Congo red (CR), Ni(OH)2 synthesized in methanol aqueous solution exhibited excellent adsorption performance than other samples. When the volume ratio of methanol to water is 1:1, the as-prepared Ni(OH)2 (Ni(OH)2-m1/1) exhibited best adsorption capacity. The adsorption kinetics fitted well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model of Ni(OH)2-m1/1. Equilibrium data were best described by Langmuir model. The estimated maximum adsorption capacity of Ni(OH)2-m1/1 for CR was 206.2mg/g, making it a promising candidate for wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aethanol 3aethylene glycol 3aglycerol 3ahot water treatment 3akinetics 3amethanol 3ananosheets 3aphase transition 3aporosity 3apowders 3asorption isotherms 3aurea 3awastewater treatment 0aNi(OH)2 0aHierarchical porous structure 0aPhase 0aCongo red 0aAdsorption1 aWu, Yaqin1 aRao, Richuan1 aWang, Hui0 tPowder technology.g2017 Oct., v. 320 p.377-385dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2017.07.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01545naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001800146245007600164300001600240520068500256592002800941650001900969650001600988700001501004700002001019700001701039773012001056852000901176856008201185655001201267IND8000402420221121105713.0181030e197911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND800040242DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517579049011032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChauhan, R.S.10aMorphohgical and Mechanical Properties of Raw and Swollen Cotton Fibers  ap. 632-638.  aA study of the morphological features of cotton fibers and their relationship with tensile properties is described.

The port-city of Rome, which today lies 4km from the coastline, was established in a very constrained environment at the mouth of the River Tiber. Based on a review of the geoarchaeological and archaeological research at Ostia, 4 new cores analysed through palaeoenvionmental methods, and 21 new radiocarbon dates, we propose a new model of the fluvio-coastal landscape of Ostia from its origin: (1) the coastline shifted rapidly westward between the 8th and the 6th c. BCE followed by a slow progradation and possible erosion phases until the end of the 1st c. CE; (2) the castrum of Ostia (c. late 4th–early 3rd c. BCE) was founded away from the river mouth but close to the River Tiber; (3) between the 4th and the 1st c. BCE, the River Tiber shifted from a position next to the castrum, below the northern Imperial cardo of Ostia, to 150m to the north; (4) a possible harbour was established to the north of the castrum during the Republican period; (5) the city expanded and a district was built over the harbour and the palaeochannel between the Republican period and the beginning of the 2nd c. CE, showing that Ostia was a dynamic and resilient city during that time. Finally, we suggest the possibility to combine urban fabric analysis (the orientation of the structures) and palaeoenvironmental analysis for reconstructing the evolution of the city in relation to the fluvio-coastal mobility.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3acoasts 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apaleoecology 3aradiocarbon dating 3arivers 3aurban development 0aGeoarchaeology 0aRoman city 0aPalaeoenvironmental analysis 0aUrban fabric 0aResilience 0aOstia 0aRiver Tiber 0aTiber delta1 aGoiran, Jean-Philippe1 aNoirot, Brice1 aPleuger, Elisa1 aBukowiecki, Evelyne1 aMazzini, Ilaria1 aCarbonel, Pierre1 aGadhoum, Ahmed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8741-07521 aArnaud, Pascal1 aKeay, S.

To further improve the spatial resolution of HSIs, we propose HyperNet, a deep network for the fusion of HSI, MSI, and panchromatic image (PAN), which effectively injects the spatial details of an MSI and a PAN into an HSI while preserving the spectral information of the HSI. Thus, we design HyperNet on the basis of a uniform fusion strategy to solve the problem of complex fusion of three types of sources (i.e., HSI, MSI, and PAN). In particular, the spatial details of the MSI and the PAN are extracted by multiple specially designed multiscale-attention-enhance blocks in which multi-scale convolution is used to adaptively extract features from different reception fields, and two attention mechanisms are adopted to enhance the representation capability of features along the spectral and spatial dimensions, respectively. Through the capability of feature reuse and interaction in a specially designed dense-detail-insertion block, the previously extracted features are subsequently injected into the HSI according to the unidirectional feature propagation among the layers of dense connection. Finally, we construct an efficient loss function by integrating the multi-scale structural similarity index with the L1 norm, which drives HyperNet to generate high-quality results with a good balance between spatial and spectral qualities. Extensive experiments on simulated and real data sets qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the superiority of HyperNet over other state-of-the-art methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahyperspectral imagery 3amultispectral imagery 3apanchromatic imagery 3aphotogrammetry 0aImage fusion 0aDeep network 0aSharpening 0aMulti-scale structural similarity index1 aZhang, Wei1 aYu, Dian1 aTian, Xin0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2022 June, v. 188 p.30-44dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

House flies were immobilized and force fed suspensions of defined, donor strains of E. coli containing chloramphenicol resistance genes on a plasmid, or lysogenic, bacteriophage-born Shiga toxin gene stx1 (bacteriophage H-19B::Ap1). Recipient strains were E. coli lacking these mobile elements and genes but having rifampicin as a selectable marker. Plasmid transfer occurred at rates of 10(-2) per donor cell in the fly midgut and 10(-3) in the fly crop after 1 h of incubation postfeeding. Bacteriophage transfer rate was approximately equal to 10(-)6 per donor cell without induction, but induction with mitomycin C increased rates of transfer to 10(-2) per donor cell. These findings show that genes encoding antibiotic resistance or toxins will transfer horizontally among bacteria in the house fly gut via plasmid transfer or phage transduction. The house fly gut may provide a favorable environment for the evolution and emergence of pathogenic bacterial strains through acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes or virulence factors. 3achloramphenicol 3aShiga toxin 3agenetic transduction 3aantibiotic resistance 3amidgut 3abacteriophages 3aplasmids 3ainsect vectors 3agenes 3amitomycin 3aMusca domestica 3aEscherichia coli 2aAnimals 2aBacteriophages 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aConjugation, Genetic 2aDNA Primersxchemistry 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixclassificationxgenetics. 2aGastrointestinal Tractxmicrobiology 2aGene Transfer, Horizontalxgenetics 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aHousefliesxmicrobiology 2aPhenotype 2aPlasmids 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRifampin 2aShiga Toxin 1xgenetics 2aTransduction, Genetic 0aplasmid transfer 0avirulence genes 0ahorizontal gene transfer 0aconjugation1 aBagdasarian, M.1 aWaldor, M.K.1 aWalker, E.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2006 Mar., v. 43, no. 2 p.288-295dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-2585(2006)043[0288:HTOSTA]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20070917b20071002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/09/17  aOther US 7aarticle02846naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245012900203300001600332520176100348592002802109650001102137650002202148650001402170650003002184650001602214651002502230700002402255700002702279773013502306856008202441852000902523655001202532IND60588717720221122063808.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058871772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-017-1189-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReimann, Lena1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9405-914710aRegionalized Shared Socioeconomic Pathways: narratives and spatial population projections for the Mediterranean coastal zone  ap. 235-245.  aExisting narratives and population projections of the global-scale Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) do not capture regional differences in socioeconomic development in the Mediterranean region. In this study, we regionalize the global SSPs to account for differences in coastal population development between northern, eastern, and southern countries of the region. First, we develop coastal SSP narratives that include region-specific elements and differentiate between geographical regions. Based on these narratives, we derive coastal population growth rates that vary for each SSP as well as between coastal, inland, rural, and urban areas. We apply these growth assumptions to observed population growth patterns in a spatially explicit manner. The Mediterranean coastal SSPs thereby reflect socioeconomic development patterns across countries as well as coastal versus inland development within countries. Our results show that coastal population in the Mediterranean increases across SSPs 2–5 by 3% to 130% until 2100 except for SSP1, where population declines by almost 20% compared to 2010. We observe considerable differences between geographical regions and countries. In the Mediterranean north, coastal population declines in SSP1, SSP3, and SSP4 and experiences the highest increase of more than 100% in SSP5. In southern and eastern Mediterranean countries, the highest increase in coastal population takes place in SSP3 and amounts to almost 180% by 2100. The regionalized SSP narratives and population projections are intended for assessing future exposure, vulnerability, and impacts of population to coastal hazards and sea-level rise but can also be of use for a wider range of Impact, Adaptation, and Vulnerability (IAV) studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3apopulation growth 3asea level 3asocioeconomic development 3aurban areas 3aMediterranean region1 aMerkens, Jan-Ludolf1 aVafeidis, AthanasiosT.0 tRegional environmental change.g2018 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.235-245dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-017-1189-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245016400213300001600377520099800393592002801391650001001419650002701429650002901456650001901485650001101504650001401515650001501529650002401544650001301568650002401581650002101605650001901626653001601645653001001661653002901671653002101700653001201721700002701733700002301760700001801783773009501801856008701896852000901983655001201992IND60543085820221118004117.0190408e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054308582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2014.09.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMataragas, Marios1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0782-895410aEvaluation of the Listeria monocytogenes inactivation during post-process storage of fermented sausages: A basis for the development of a decision support tool  ap. 568-573.  aIn situ quantitative data on Listeria monocytogenes survival during storage of vacuum-packaged fermented sausages at various temperatures were collected from the literature to develop a generic predictive model regarding its fate at a specific storage temperature. The development of the tool was based on the z-concept. The time needed for 4D reduction of the pathogen was estimated and its influence by the temperature was further described by linear regression. A secondary model was developed for describing the effect of sausage water activity on the z-concept parameters at the reference temperature. The decision support tool was successfully validated against the studies not used during the development of the model. Based on the model predictions, a decision can be made about the required time of product storage before its distribution to achieve an additional pathogen inactivation. Such tools can be incorporated in a HACCP plan of a food-producing company to assure food safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHACCP 3aListeria monocytogenes 3adecision support systems 3afermented meat 3amodels 3apathogens 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asausages 3astorage temperature 3avacuum packaging 3awater activity 0aFood safety 0aHACCP 0aNon-thermal inactivation 0aPredictive model 0aStorage1 aAlessandria, Valentina1 aRantsiou, Kalliopi1 aCocolin, Luca0 tFood control.g2015 Apr., v. 50 p.568-573dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2014.09.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01916naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245010500172300001300277520080100290592002801091650002601119650001301145650001401158650001001172650001401182653001801196653001001214653001501224653002101239653001801260700002101278700001901299700002701318773010001345856008801445852000901533655001201542IND60585737420221119091645.0190620e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058573742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGholami, Raoof12aA review on borehole instability in active shale formations: Interactions, mechanisms and inhibitors  ap. 2-13.  aShale formations are known for their chemical interactions with water based muds which may result in swelling, bit balling or even closure of the wellbore. As a result, eco-friendly water based fluids with inhibitive characteristics are required for drilling through shale formations. The aim of this study is to provide a deeper insight into drilling through shale formations by providing few approaches for different circumstances. Many inhibitors developed so far are introduced with their mechanism of shale inhibition presented. It appears that silicate based muds and thermally activated mud emulsion (TAME) are the best option to mitigate shale related issues, but more studies are required to provide a permanent solution for this very complicated issue, especially under HPHT conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical interactions 3adrilling 3aemulsions 3ashale 3asilicates 0aActive shales 0aClays 0aInhibition 0aWater based muds 0aEncapsulation1 aElochukwu, Henry1 aFakhari, Nikoo1 aSarmadivaleh, Mohammad0 tEarth-science reviews.g2018 Feb., v. 177 p.2-13dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03473naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159100002100168245011000189300001800299500002400317500001500341520154200356650001801898650001601916650001401932650002801946650002201974650001401996650002002010650001402030650002702044650002002071650001002091650001602101650001402117650002302131650002402154650001202178650001702190650001602207650002302223650002702246650001202273650002702285650001102312650003602323650003102359650001402390650000902404650001402413650003602427653002402463653001402487700001902501773011902520852000902639856008002648930003302728945002502761946001302786655001202799IND4430541720221121062432.0091228e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443054172DNAL7 a200217622pmid7 a10.1603/022.038.06192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aYang, Xiang-Bing10aLife History and Life Tables of Bactericera cockerelli (Homoptera: Psyllidae) on Eggplant and Bell Pepper  ap. 1661-1667.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe development, survivorship, and fecundity of the potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc), fed on eggplant (Solanum melongena L., variety Special Hibush) and bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L., variety Capsitrano) were studied in the laboratory at 26.7 ± 2°C, 70 ± 5% RH, and at a photoperiod of 14:10 (L:D) h. Immature B. cockerelli developed faster (24.1 d) when fed on eggplant than on bell pepper (26.2 d). Survival rates of immature stages from egg to adult emergence were higher on eggplant (50.2%) than on bell pepper (34.6%). The longevity of B. cockerelli female adults fed on bell pepper was similar to that of females fed on eggplant (62.2 versus 55.0 d), but the male adults fed on eggplant lived shorter lives (39.4 d) than those fed on bell pepper (53.9 d). However, the preoviposition and oviposition periods, fecundity, and sex ratio of B. cockerelli fed on eggplant were not different from those fed on bell pepper. The r(m) value and the finite rate of increase (λ) of B. cockerelli were higher on eggplant (0.1099 and 1.116, respectively) than on bell pepper (0.0884 and 1.0924, respectively). Mean generation time and doubling time of B. cockerelli were shorter on eggplant (40.4 and 6.3 d, respectively) than on bell pepper (46.1 and 7.8 d, respectively). In contrast, lifetime fecundity of B. cockerelli was greater on bell pepper (227.3 offspring) than on eggplant (186.5 offspring). Based on these life history parameters, we concluded that B. cockerelli performed better on eggplant than on bell pepper. 3asweet peppers 3aoviposition 3aeggplants 3ainterspecific variation 3aSolanum melongena 3alongevity 3aCapsicum annuum 3afecundity 3aBactericera cockerelli 3avegetable crops 3amales 3aplant pests 3asex ratio 3ainsect development 3ainsect reproduction 3afemales 3ainsect pests 3ahost plants 3agender differences 3alife cycle (organisms) 2aAnimals 2aCapsicumxparasitology 2aFemale 2aHemipteraxgrowth & development 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aLongevity 2aMale 2aOviparity 2aSolanum melongenaxparasitology 0aspecies differences 0aPsyllidae1 aLiu, Tong-Xian0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2009 Dec., v. 38, no. 6 p.1661-1667dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/022.038.06193Available from publisher's Web site  a20100317b20100403c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/09  aOther US 7aarticle03730naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100001700191245009500208300001600303506002800319506003600347506007600383506003100459520144500490592002801935596008301963596004502046506003702091650001102128650002102139650002002160650002602180650002602206650002402232650001102256650001402267650000902281650001602290650001502306650002302321651001202344651001202356653002102368653002302389653001402412653000902426653000702435653000802442653000802450653000902458653000902467653001002476653000902486653000902495653000702504653001302511653001002524653000902534653001202543700001502555700001802570700001602588700001702604700001702621700001702638700001602655700002102671773012602692856008502818903002402903852000902927655001202936IND60528507920221207144459.0190318e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052850792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2016.06.0212chorus7 a10.1016/j.compag.2016.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVellidis, G.10aDevelopment and assessment of a smartphone application for irrigation scheduling in cotton  ap. 249-259.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe goal of this work was to develop an easy-to-use and engaging irrigation scheduling tool for cotton which operates on a smartphone platform. The model which drives the Cotton SmartIrrigation App (Cotton App) is an interactive ET-based soil water balance model. The Cotton App uses meteorological data from weather station networks, soil parameters, crop phenology, crop coefficients, and irrigation applications to estimate root zone soil water deficits (RZSWD) in terms of percent as well as of inches of water. The Cotton App sends notifications to the user when the RZSWD exceeds 40%, when phenological changes occur, and when rain is recorded at the nearest weather station. It operates on both iOS and Android operating systems and was released during March 2014. The soil water balance model was calibrated and validated during 2012 and 2013 using data from replicated plot experiments and commercial fields. The Cotton App was evaluated in field trials for three years and performed well when compared to other irrigation scheduling tools. Its geographical footprint is currently limited to the states of Georgia and Florida, United States, because it is enabled to use meteorological data only from weather station networks in these states. A new version is currently under development which will use national gridded meteorological data sets and allow the Cotton App to be used in most cotton growing areas of the United States.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acotton 3acrop coefficient 3adata collection 3afield experimentation 3airrigation scheduling 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3aphenology 3arain 3arhizosphere 3asoil water 3asoil water balance 3aFlorida 3aGeorgia 0aCrop coefficient 0aSoil water balance 0aPhenology 0aGDDs 0aET 0aETo 0aETc 0aFAWN 0aFRET 0aGAEMN 0aGDDs 0aIMZs 0aKc 0aNOAA NWS 0aRZSWD 0aSIRP 0aUGA SSA1 aLiakos, V.1 aAndreis, J.H.1 aPerry, C.D.1 aPorter, W.M.1 aBarnes, E.M.1 aMorgan, K.T.1 aFraisse, C.1 aMigliaccio, K.W.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2016 Sept., v. 127 p.249-259dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2016.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013300157300002000290520137400310592002801684650002101712650001501733650001301748650001101761650001501772650001901787650001901806650001901825650001801844650001501862650001501877650001801892650001501910650002201925650001501947650001201962650001101974650001101985650001301996700001802009700001902027773014302046856007402189852000902263655001202272IND60642562220221119045936.0190507e20171003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064256222DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta02854g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Kaijie10aFacile fabrication of freestanding all-carbon activated carbon membranes for high-performance and universal pollutant management  ap. 20316-20326.  aFreestanding all-carbon activated carbon membranes (ACMs) were fabricated for the first time in an environmentally friendly manner using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a coupling agent for activated carbon particles. Due to the tunable noncovalent π–π interactions between the AC particles and rGO nanosheets, the ACMs not only displayed unique chemical and thermal stabilities but also had controllable pore sizes over a wide range, from microns to nanometers, and could be applied to pollutant management in both water and organic solvents. The powerful adsorption capability of activated carbon was well preserved in the ACMs. The ACMs can exclude micrometer and nanometer particles (such as bacteria, silica nanoparticles and silver nanoparticles) with 100% removal efficiency; adsorb dissolved pollutants with an excellent saturation capacity of 7.7 mg g⁻¹ for Ag⁺, 235.2 mg g⁻¹ for methylene blue, and higher than 410 mg g⁻¹ for phenanthrene; and simultaneously remove multiple pollutants from both water and organic solvents through a one-step filtration process while maintaining high water flux. The ACM surfaces possess high surface energy and exhibit superhydrophilic properties. Thus, the novel ACMs, with combined sieving and adsorption properties, have great potential for universal pollutant management and industrial chemical separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3abacteria 3aenergy 3afiltration 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3amethylene blue 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3ananosilver 3aphenanthrenes 3apollutants 3apollution control 3aseparation 3asieving 3asilica 3asilver 3asolvents1 aZhu, Xiaoying1 aChen, Baoliang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Oct. 3, v. 5, no. 38 p.20316-20326dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta02854g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245005700174300001400231520235200245592002802597650001102625650001902636650001202655650001402667650001002681650001302691650000902704650001602713650000902729650001202738650001402750650001402764650001402778651001002792653002402802653002102826653002102847653002402868653002202892773010102914856008803015852000903103655001203112IND60585737620221119091840.0190620e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058573762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerlito, Carmelo10aMount Etna volcano (Italy). Just a giant hot spring!  ap. 14-23.  aIt is usually believed that volcanoes explicate their activity erupting magma, in which volatiles (mostly H2O) are dissolved in modest quantities. At Mount Etna, the maximum H2O found in olivine melt inclusions is 3.5wt%, which would correspond to a moles H2O/mol basalt ratio of 0.14. A reappraisal of published data is proposed here, and a comparison is made between the gas flux and the volume of erupted lavas. The results are surprising: the moles H2O/mol basalt ratio is 1.41, which means that Mount Etna erupts 10 times the maximum H2O that could be dissolved in magma and 40% more moles of gas (H2O, CO2 and S) than moles of basalt. By calculating the molar volume of the basaltic melt components (silicate tetrahedra and metallic cations) and of the gas phase at a pressure of 250MPa, it is possible to envisage the magma within the deep plumbing system as a solution made of ~70% continuum gas phase (mostly H2O) at a supercritical state (density 360kg/m3) and 30% basaltic melt components. The transition from this low-density (1140kg/m3) water melt solution (WMS) to the high-density (2800kg/m3) basalt, usually erupted (defined as a continuous melt phase, CMP), occurs in the last 2km and marks the boundary between a deep and a shallow plumbing system. The depth of this boundary varies with time, being driven by the rate at which the gas escapes the WMS to feed the persistent gas plume at the summit craters, leaving the CMP, which accumulates within the shallow plumbing system, until erupted. The overpressure of the gas phase in the WMS, acting like a piston cylinder, is fundamental in driving the eruption. In this work, the thermal contribution provided to the CMP by the large gas flux has also been considered, proving that it can supply the heat necessary to maintain the CMP. The volcano is here considered a dynamic system in which the eruptive activity is ruled by discontinuities in the flux of gas and heat. Negative fluctuations in the gas flux would decrease the heat supply, promote viscosity and trigger eruptions. Moreover, this view of the volcanic system, subverting the common paradigm in which the gas emitted is associated with an equivalent amount of degassing magma, explains the phenomenon, known as the ‘excess degassing problem’, which affects volcanoes of basaltic and andesitic nature worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3acarbon dioxide 3acations 3acylinders 3agases 3ageometry 3aheat 3ahot springs 3alava 3amelting 3asilicates 3aviscosity 3avolcanoes 3aItaly 0aSupercritical fluid 0aBasalt viscosity 0aGas overpressure 0aExplosive volcanism 0aEruptive dynamics0 tEarth-science reviews.g2018 Feb., v. 177 p.14-23dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01578naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245007100158300001600229500002000245520055700265592002800822650002200850650002800872650001200900650001000912650001000922650002500932650002300957700002400980773014301004856007101147961001301218852000901231655001201240IND60680206120221119221830.0200104e196508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068020612DNAL7 a10.2307/12362822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrick, George E.10aAggregation Bias and Four Methods of Summing Farm Supply Functions  ap. 696-700.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe purpose of this paper was to test several select methods of grouping farms to minimize aggregation bias found in linear programmed area supply functions.

The GHS, recognized since the first geological explorations of the Himalayas, has been considered for a long time as a coherent tectonic unit, exhumed by the contemporaneous shearing along the Main Central Thrust and the South Tibetan Detachment System in the time span ~25–17Ma. A multidisciplinary approach, integrating geological mapping, structural analysis, petrology and geochronology allowed to better constrain on its internal architecture characterized by several levels of tectonic-metamorphic discontinuities on the regional scale with a top-to-the-S/SW sense of shear and active since ~40Ma. The GHS is consequently divided in three main tectonic units exhumed progressively from the upper part to the lower one by ductile shear zones, later involving the Lesser Himalayan Sequence.Above the Main Central Thrust a cryptic tectono-metamorphic discontinuity (Higher Himalayan Discontinuity; HHD) has been recognized and mapped in Central-Eastern Himalaya. The mapping of the HHD has been allowed by the use of a multidisciplinary approach involving structural analysis, geochronology and petrology. A new map of Western Nepal is presented.In this framework the popular models of exhumation of the GHS mainly based on the contemporaneous activity of the two bounding shear zones (Main Central Thrust and the South Tibetan Detachment) and considering the GHS as a coherent tectonic unit, should be reconsidered. An in-sequence shearing tectonic model, from the deeper to the upper structural levels, further affected by out-of-sequence-thrusts, is more appropriate to explain the deformation, metamorphism and exhumation of the mid-crust in the Himalayan belt.Geological mapping of the Himalayan belt is very far away to be exhaustively completed. Anyway during the last 20, and particularly during the last few years, it has been notably improved due to a new multidisciplinary approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3acartography 3adeformation 3amodels 3atectonics 3aHimalayan region 3aNepal 0aHimalaya 0aGeological maps 0aTectonic and metamorphic discontinuities 0aGreater Himalayan Sequence 0aExhumation 0aDuctile shear zone 0aIn sequence shearing1 aMontomoli, Chiara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0364-53951 aIaccarino, Salvatore1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9844-60050 tEarth-science reviews.g2018 Feb., v. 177 p.124-138dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03642naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007300139245009200212500001400304500002000318520205300338592002802391650002102419650001102440650000802451650001002459650001302469650001402482650001302496650001202509650001402521650001802535650001802553650001402571650001002585650002702595650000902622650002302631650001202654650002402666650002202690650001402712650002002726650001102746650001402757651001402771700002002785700002602805700001702831700002702848773011902875856007302994852000903067655001203076IND60715619320221121025712.0201030e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071561932DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.024012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez‐Curci, Natalia S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0104-738310aTo migrate or not: drivers of over‐summering in a long‐distance migratory shorebird  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe phenomenon of over‐summering in southern non‐breeding areas by boreal‐breeding birds is particularly prevalent among shorebirds. Despite its frequency, it is understudied compared with most other aspects of shorebird ecology. Our aim was to expand knowledge of this subject through a study of red knots Calidris canutus rufa over‐summering at a site in Argentina during the austral winter. We measured the proportion of one‐year‐old and adult over‐summerers and evaluated the roles of flight‐feather condition and physiological status (through leukocite profile, physiological stress index and presence of blood parasites) as triggers for over‐summering. We also explore sex‐ratio, the evolution of body mass and extent of breeding plumage within each age‐class. Over‐summerers were 57% yearlings and 43% adults, 46% females and 54% males. Almost all yearlings exhibited incomplete molt of primary feathers and some were in active primary molt. This suggests that the condition of flight‐feathers and the timing of molt are likely to be important factors selecting for deferred migration during the first year of life. Other factors, not associated with flight‐feather molt, seem to trigger over‐summering in adults, which had completed flight feather molt but had low fat loads and/or incomplete alternate plumage. We found no evidence of a weakened immune system, high loads of blood parasites or high stress levels that can explain this poor migratory conditioning and therefore over‐summering. Our data indicates that our adult age‐class comprises both young individuals postponing first breeding until they are at least two years old and sexually mature individuals with prior reproductive experience skipping a breeding opportunity. Breeding propensity and age at first breeding are both poorly known, but key demographic parameters that determine population growth. This study suggests that potentially they can be estimated from mark–recapture at non‐breeding areas and this warrants further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalidris canutus 3aadults 3aage 3abirds 3abreeding 3aevolution 3afeathers 3afemales 3afrequency 3ahemoparasites 3aimmune system 3aknowledge 3amales 3amark-recapture studies 3amass 3amigratory behavior 3amolting 3aphysiological state 3apopulation growth 3asex ratio 3asexual maturity 3awinter 3ayearlings 3aArgentina1 aIsacch, Juan P.1 aD'Amico, Verónica L.1 aRojas, Pablo1 aCastresana, Gabriel J.0 tJournal of avian biology.g2020 Oct., v. 51, no. 10dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3949829x0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.024013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245019300169300001600362520112200378592002801500650003101528650000901559650001801568650002001586650001701606650001701623653004001640653001601680653001501696653003101711653003301742653001901775700001301794700002001807700001401827700001201841700001701853700001601870700001601886700002801902700001701930700001401947773009501961856008702056852000902143655001202152IND60543086120221118004215.0190408e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054308612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2014.09.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSevenich, R.14aThe impact of high pressure thermal sterilization on the microbiological stability and formation of food processing contaminants in selected fish systems and baby food puree at pilot scale  ap. 539-547.  aTo this day there is no implementation of the high pressure thermal sterilization (HPTS) in the food industry. HPTS could result in better food quality, lower thermal load applied to the product and less unwanted food processing contaminants (FPCs) such as furan.Based on findings for selected foods at lab-scale extrapolated temperature-time combinations for a 12 log10 inactivation of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens were chosen for a scale-up with a 55 L vessel (HPHT system Hiperbaric). Temperature-time-combinations at 600 MPa were between 100 and 115 °C and 0.45–28min. The scale-up resulted in a reduction of furan, depending on the food system, between 41 and 98% to retorting. Results at pilot scale were similar to lab-scale experiments. The performed storage trials (standardized method NF V 08-408) showed that only for the baby food puree two selected treatment conditions (107.5 °C, 9.8 min and 115 °C, 0.45 min at 600 MPa) resulted in an unstable product. Overall the results of the scale-up process support the idea that the HPTS could be feasible for the implementation in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3afish 3afood industry 3afood processing 3afood quality 3ainfant foods 0aHigh pressure thermal sterilization 0aPilot scale 0aValidation 0aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 0aFood processing contaminants 0aStorage trials1 aBark, F.1 aKleinstueck, E.1 aCrews, C.1 aPye, C.1 aHradecky, J.1 aReineke, K.1 aLavilla, M.1 aMartinez-de-Maranon, I.1 aBriand, J.C.1 aKnorr, D.0 tFood control.g2015 Apr., v. 50 p.539-547dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2014.09.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01862naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245005700161300001600218500002000234520086900254592002801123650002701151650001801178650001201196650001001208650002301218650001101241650001801252650001601270651001501286773014301301856007101444852000901515655001201524IND60680206320221119221825.0200104e196508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068020632DNAL7 a10.2307/12362752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerrill, William C.10aAlternative Programming Models Involving Uncertainty  ap. 595-610.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA multiperiod linear programming model, a stochastic programming model, and a “linear team” programming model are investigated to determine how they can be applied to a farm planning problem and how widely the optimal farm plans obtained from these models differ when actual data are used.

Using data for an average farm in Yolo County, California, it is found that the optimal solutions obtained from these three models are not greatly different. The differences which do exist between optimal solutions can generally be traced to cash shortages. This result is partly due to the degree of diversification “forced” on the farmer by government production controls and recommended conservation practices as well as the wide differences that exist among the profitability of the activities considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation practices 3afarm planning 3afarmers 3afarms 3alinear programming 3amodels 3aprofitability 3auncertainty 3aCalifornia0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1965 Aug., v. 47, no. 3 p.595-610dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12362753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245008000179300001600259500001500275520120000290592002801490650002301518650001501541650001501556650001601571650001401587650002701601650002301628651001601651651001401667653001901681653001501700700002301715700001901738773010701757856005501864852000901919655001201928IND4470541920221120185419.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447054192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1747-0080.2011.01525.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'SULLIVAN, Therese A.10aJust what the doctor ordered: Moving forward with electronic health records  ap. 179-184.  a2019-12-06  aAim: To provide dietitians with information on the proposed introduction of electronic medical records in Australia and New Zealand and discuss potential benefits and challenges. Methods: An overview of the current status regarding electronic health (e‐health) records is given along with suggestions on how dietitians may like to become involved. Information was obtained by literature review and through contact with the National E‐Health Transition Authority in Australia and the National Health Information Technology Board in New Zealand. Results: Governments in both Australia and New Zealand are dedicated to the establishment of national electronic health record systems. Current issues in founding such a system include interoperability with existing systems, privacy concerns and the use of standardised terminologies. Conclusion: Integrated and practical e‐health records are an important part of an efficient and sustainable health system. Dietitians wishing to be involved can learn about the International Dietetics and Nutrition Terminology, actively seek and contribute to technology discussions in their workplace and register with available e‐health record initiatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aworking conditions 3adietitians 3aphysicians 3aterminology 3adietetics 3ainformation technology 3ahealth information 3aNew Zealand 3aAustralia 0anew technology 0atechnology1 aBILLING, Nathan A.1 aStokes, David,0 tNutrition & dietetics.g2011 Sept., v. 68, no. 3 p.179-184dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1446-63687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0080.2011.01525.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011500154300001600269520134000285592002801625650002101653650002301674650002201697650001301719650002401732650002101756650001501777650001501792650001401807650002101821650001801842650002501860700001401885700001401899700001501913700001501928700001601943700001301959773011601972856004102088852000902129655001202138IND50071858720221119040949.0140113e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007185872DNAL7 a10.1111/ejss.121022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaave, H.14aThe impact of activated carbon on NO₃ ⁻‐N, NH₄ ⁺‐N, P and K leaching in relation to fertilizer use  ap. 120-127.  aThe ability of light‐textured soils to retain nutrients and water is small. In agriculture such soils pose a risk of nutrient leaching when amended with fertilizers. This study investigated the effects of the incorporation of activated carbon (AC) into the soil to determine (i) if it would decrease leaching of major nutrient ions and (ii) if its effect on leaching is influenced by fertilizer use. Nitrate nitrogen (NO₃ ⁻‐N), ammonium nitrogen (NH₄ ⁺‐N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) leaching through two substrates (sandy loam soil (S) and a sandy loam soil mixed with activated carbon (S + AC), which were unfertilized (NF or control) or fertilized with inorganic fertilizer (F), pig slurry (PS), pig slurry digestate (PD) or sewage sludge digestate (SD) was studied using mini‐lysimeters. In soil enriched with AC mark K‐835, water percolation and NO₃ ⁻‐N and P leaching were significantly reduced, and K leaching was increased. Ammonium nitrogen leaching was not influenced by the AC amendment. The impact of AC on NO₃ ⁻‐N and P leaching and water percolation did not change during the two‐year period, from which it is concluded that AC mark K‐835 prevents the leaching of NO₃ ⁻‐N and P and increases soil water retention ability, and thus it is beneficial for light‐textured soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aagricultural soils 3aammonium nitrogen 3aleaching 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrate nitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apig manure 3apotassium 3asandy loam soils 3asewage sludge 3asoil water retention1 aKeres, I.1 aKauer, K.1 aNõges, M.1 aRebane, J.1 aTampere, M.1 aLoit, E.0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2014 Jan., v. 65, no. 1 p.120-127dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1351-07547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.12102  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245006300206300001600269506007600285520087200361592002801233506003701261650003201298650001401330650001101344650002401355653001301379653001401392653001501406653000901421653001901430700002101449700002601470773011601496856008201612852000901694655001201703IND60679741820221207072933.0191231e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067974182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2018.03.0052doi7 aPMC59597762pmcid7 a296362122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Qiuyan10aStructural Basis of Arrestin-Dependent Signal Transduction  ap. 412-423.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aArrestins are a small family of proteins with four isoforms in humans. Remarkably, two arrestins regulate signaling from >800 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or nonreceptor activators by simultaneously binding an activator and one out of hundreds of other signaling proteins. When arrestins are bound to GPCRs or other activators, the affinity for these signaling partners changes. Thus, it is proposed that an activator alters arrestin’s ability to transduce a signal. The comparison of all available arrestin structures identifies several common conformational rearrangements associated with activation. In particular, it identifies elements that are directly involved in binding to GPCRs or other activators, elements that likely engage distinct downstream effectors, and elements that likely link the activator-binding sites with the effector-binding sites.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aarrestins 3ahumans 3asignal transduction 0aarrestin 0astructure 0aactivation 0aGPCR 0acell signaling1 aIverson, Tina M.1 aGurevich, Vsevolod V.0 tTrends in biochemical sciences.g2018 June, v. 43, no. 6 p.412-423dElsevier LtdwJournal:6328x0968-00047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2018.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245016000155300002000315520141700335592002801752650001101780650002801791650002101819650001301840650001901853650002201872650002401894650002101918650001401939650002201953650002101975650001801996650002002014700001502034700001802049700001702067700001402084700001902098700001402117700001302131700002002144773014402164856007402308852000902382655001202391IND60642562620221119050045.0190507e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064256262DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta02874a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Rui10aMnCO₃/Mn₃O₄/reduced graphene oxide ternary anode materials for lithium-ion batteries: facile green synthesis and enhanced electrochemical performance  ap. 17001-17011.  aMn-Based compounds with high reversible capacities and eco-friendliness are one of the most promising anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), but their practical applications are still hindered by low rate capability, poor cycling stability, and high cost of production. Herein, we synthesize MnCO₃/Mn₃O₄/reduced graphene oxide (MnCO₃/Mn₃O₄/RGO) ternary composites through a green and facile strategy, which can take full advantage of the raw materials, mitigate pollution effectively, simplify the operating procedure, and shorten the preparation time to realize large-scale preparation. When used as anode materials for LIBs, benefitting from the advantage of their structure and effective synergy among MnCO₃, Mn₃O₄ and graphene, the ternary composites exhibit an excellent cycling stability of 988 mA h g⁻¹ after 200 cycles at 100 mA g⁻¹ and 532 mA h g⁻¹ after 800 cycles at 1 A g⁻¹, which is superior to those of binary MnCO₃/RGO and Mn₃O₄/RGO composites. Analyses using cyclic voltammetry, charge/discharge profiles, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveal improved kinetics in the electrochemical reaction of the MnCO₃/Mn₃O₄/RGO ternary composite with cycling. Furthermore, a systematic study of the potential difference of the redox reaction provides a good explanation for the observed electrochemical performance of the ternary composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3alithium batteries 3amanganese carbonate 3amanganese oxides 3apollution 3apollution control 3aproduction costs 3araw materials 3aredox reactions1 aWang, Dong1 aQin, Lu-Chang1 aWen, Guangwu1 aPan, Hong1 aZhang, Yingfei1 aTian, Nan1 aZhou, Yu1 aHuang, Xiaoxiao0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 5, no. 32 p.17001-17011dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta02874a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009100167520156300258592002801821650002501849650001501874650001101889650001901900650002001919650002001939650002001959650002501979651001002004653002702014653002002041653001402061653002002075653003602095700001402131700001502145700001602160700002002176700001402196773010402210856008602314852000902400655001202409IND60773173420221118155149.0220606e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077317342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.1066432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shan10aImproving footprint-based water use efficiency through planting structure optimization  aUnreasonable utilization of water resources cause serious water shortage and associated pollution problems. Improving water use efficiency (WUE) is helpful for alleviating water scarcity and mitigating water pollution. However, due to the conflict between water saving and economic development as well as uncertain parameter information, it is challenging to improve WUE. To address these problems, a water-footprint-based interval fuzzy robust fractional programming (WF-IFRFP) model was developed through integrating water footprint (WF), interval parameter programming (IPP) and fuzzy robust optimization (FRP) into a fractional programming (FP) framework. The developed WF-IFRFP model improved upon traditional methods by being able to tackle interval numbers and fuzzy sets under different system-violation risks. The developed model was applied to a water management case in the northwest of Inner Mongolia, China. The results of WF assessment showed that the water consumption of crop growth increased, water, whereas that used for reducing total nitrogen concentration decreased from 2012 to 2016. Then, specific benefit- and risk-explicit plans for cropping pattern adjustments were generated. The results showed that the water supply-demand ratio from WF-IFRFP would be [5.1, 10.7] % higher than that in the benchmark year of 2016. To assess its performance and merits, the optimal results from the WF-IFRFP model were compared to four alternative models. These comparisons reveal that the WF-IFRFP model is beneficial for improving irrigation WUE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3airrigation 3amodels 3atotal nitrogen 3awater footprint 3awater pollution 3awater shortages 3awater use efficiency 3aChina 0aFractional programming 0aWater footprint 0aFuzzy set 0aWater pollution 0aIrrigation water use efficiency1 aTan, Qian1 aZhao, Hang1 aZhang, Tong1 aZhang, Tianyuan1 aHu, Kejia0 tEcological engineering.g2022 July, v. 180 p.106643-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.1066433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04354naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245020400186300001600390520189400406592002802300650001902328650002102347650001702368650001602385650002702401650002102428650000902449650001702458650001002475650002002485650001002505650001602515650002502531650002102556650001002577650001102587650002202598650004302620650000902663650001702672650002602689650001502715650001202730650004202742650005002784650004402834650004302878650003802921650005002959650003403009650000903043650001903052650004003071650002903111650000903140650002503149650003003174650007103204650002703275700001703302700002003319700002303339700001903362700002103381773010403402856008103506852000903587655001203596IND50073060820221118060617.0150212e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007306082DNAL7 a252893902pmid7 a10.1007/s00394-013-0547-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuda, Hiroko10aRegulation of rat hepatic α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase, a key enzyme in the tryptophan-NAD pathway, by dietary cholesterol and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2  ap. 469-477.  aPURPOSE: Nicotinic acid is one of the older drugs used to treat hyperlipidemia, the greatest risk factor of coronary heart disease. Nicotinic acid is also a precursor of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). In mammals, α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) plays a key role in NAD biosynthesis from tryptophan. However, the relationship between ACMSD and cholesterol metabolism has not been clarified enough yet. The present study was performed to make clear the relationship between ACMSD and cholesterol metabolism using hypercholesterolemic rats and rat primary hepatocytes. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a diet containing cholesterol for 10 days to induce hypercholesterolemia. The NAD levels in the plasma and liver and hepatic ACMSD activity were determined. In vitro study, the expression of ACMSD and the transcriptional factors that regulate cholesterol metabolism were determined using rat primary hepatocytes treated with cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol or simvastatin, a statin medication, by quantitative real-time PCR analysis and Western blotting analysis. RESULTS: The hepatic NAD level of the hypercholesterolemic group was significantly higher than the control, and the hepatic ACMSD activity of this group was significantly suppressed. There was a significant negative correlation between the hepatic ACMSD activity and liver cholesterol levels. Additionally, in primary rat hepatocytes treated with cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol or simvastatin, ACMSD gene and protein expression was subjected to sterol-dependent regulation. This gene expression changed in parallel to sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-2 expression. CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence that ACMSD is associated with cholesterol metabolism, and ACMSD gene expression may be upregulated by SREBP-2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aWestern blotting 3abiosynthesis 3acholesterol 3acholesterol metabolism 3acoronary disease 3adiet 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3ahypercholesterolemia 3ain vitro studies 3aliver 3aniacin 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3arisk factors 3atranscription factors 3atryptophan 2aAnimals 2aCarboxy-Lyasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCholesterol, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aHepatocytesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aHydroxycholesterolsxpharmacology 2aHypercholesterolemiaxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aLiverxchemistryxenzymology. 2aMale 2aModels, Animal 2aNADxanalysisxbiosynthesisxblood. 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSimvastatinxpharmacology 2aSterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2xgeneticsxphysiology. 2aTryptophanxmetabolism1 aSato, Mayumi1 aYakushiji, Mako1 aKoshiguchi, Manami1 aHirai, Shizuka1 aEgashira, Yukari0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2014 Mar., v. 53, no. 2 p.469-477dSpringer-Verlagx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-013-0547-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04438naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245011100209300001600320520225200336592002802588650002902616650002602645650002302671650001602694650001502710650002502725650002202750650002502772650001802797650002902815650002202844650002002866650002002886650001402906650001302920650001502933650001702948650001902965650001602984650002803000650001503028650001503043651001303058651001103071700002703082700002503109700001803134700001703152700002103169700001603190700001403206700002403220700001803244700001803262700001903280700002003299700002603319700002203345700002403367700002203391700001603413700002203429700002703451773013503478856008203613852000903695655001203704IND60588718520221122063827.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058871852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-017-1244-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaldach, Rüdiger1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2513-977312aA model-based assessment of the environmental impact of land-use change across scales in Southern Amazonia  ap. 161-173.  aThis article describes the design of a new model-based assessment framework to identify and analyse possible future trajectories of agricultural development and their environmental consequences within the states of Mato Grosso and Pará in Southern Amazonia, Brazil. The objective is to provide a tool for improving the information basis for scientists and policy makers regarding the effects of global change and national environmental policies on land-use change and the resulting impacts on the loss of natural vegetation, greenhouse gas emissions, hydrological processes, and soil erosion within the region. For this purpose, the framework combines the regional land-use models, LandSHIFT and alucR, the farm-level model, MPMAS, and the MONICA crop model, with a set of environmental impact models that are operating at the regional and watershed levels. As a first application of the framework, four scenarios with the time horizon 2030 were specified and analysed. Future land-use change will strongly depend on the interplay between the production of agricultural commodities, the agricultural intensification in terms of increasing crop yields and pasture biomass productivity, and the enforcement of environmental laws and policies. On the regional level, the scenarios with the highest increase in agricultural production in combination with weak law enforcement (Trend and Illegal Intensification) generated the highest losses in natural vegetation due to the expansion of agricultural area as well as the highest greenhouse gas emissions. Also, at the watershed level, these scenarios are characterised by the highest changes in river discharge and soil erosion that might lead to a further decline in soil fertility in the long term. Moreover, the analysis of the Sustainable Development scenario indicates that a shift in agricultural production patterns from livestock to crop cultivation, together with effective law enforcement, can effectively reduce land-use change and its negative effects on the environment. With the scenario analysis, we could illustrate that our assessment framework is capable to provide a large variety of valuable information to support the development of future land-use strategies in the study region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural products 3abiomass production 3acrop models 3acrop yield 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental law 3aenvironmental policy 3aglobal change 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aintensive farming 3aland use change 3alaw enforcement 3alivestock 3apastures 3ascientists 3asoil erosion 3asoil fertility 3astream flow 3asustainable development 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil1 aMeurer, KatharinaH.

To clarify the mechanisms of DA-resistance in B. gibsoni, we initially examined the intracellular DA content in the DA-resistant isolate using high-performance liquid chromatography, and compared it with that in the wild-type. As a result, the intracellular DA content in the DA-resistant isolate was significantly lower than that in the wild-type, suggesting that the decreased DA content may contribute to DA-resistance. Additionally, the glucose consumption of the DA-resistant isolate was significantly higher than that of the wild-type, indicating that a large amount of glucose is utilized to maintain DA-resistance. It is possible that a large amount of energy is utilized to maintain the mechanisms of DA-resistance. It was reported that as the structure of DA is similar with that of adenosine, DA may be taken up by the P2 transporter, which contributes to the uptake of adenosine, in Trypanosoma brucei brucei, and that the uptake of adenosine is decreased in DA-resistant T. brucei brucei. In the present study, the adenosine incorporation in the DA-resistant B. gibsoni isolate was higher than in the wild-type. Moreover, the adenosine incorporation in the wild-type was not inhibited by the presence of DA. These results suggest that adenosine transport in B. gibsoni is not affected by DA and may not mediate DA-resistance. To clarify the mechanism of the development of DA resistance in B. gibsoni, we should investigate the cause of the decreased DA content in the DA-resistant isolate in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia gibsoni 3aTrypanosoma brucei brucei 3aadenosine 3adiminazene 3aenergy 3aglucose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 0aBabesia gibsoni 0aDiminazene aceturate-resistance 0aDiminazene aceturate content 0aAdenosine incorporation 0aGlucose consumption 0aDA 0aHSP70 0aATP 0aEDTA-2Na 0aHPLC1 aWatanabe, Nao1 aIdaka, Natsuki1 aYamamori, Tohru1 aOtsuguro, Ken-ichi1 aUchida, Naohiro1 aIguchi, Aiko1 aOhta, Hiroshi1 aTakiguchi, Mitsuyoshi0 tExperimental parasitology.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2017.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010900169300001600278500001400294520150000308592002801808650001601836650001201852650003201864650001001896650001901906650001501925650002301940650002001963650001601983650001601999650001402015650001902029650001502048650001002063650001502073650001402088653001602102653001102118653001902129653002502148653001502173700001802188700001702206700001602223700001302239773013702252856008602389852000902475655001202484IND60706019520221118235502.0200807e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070601952DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-181X.2014.01330.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuresh, B.N.10aEffect of Dietary Inclusion of Lipid Utilizing Agents and NSP-degrading Enzymes on Performance of Layers  ap. 379-384.  aNAL-light  aA study was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary supplements viz., lipase, lecithin and NSP degrading enzymes on production performance and egg quality of layers. For the purpose, a cornsoybean meal-sunflower-groundnut extractions type control diet and three test diets by fortifying the control diet with either lipid utilizing agents (lipase- 100units + lecithin- 20 g/kg diet) or NSP degrading enzymes (xylanase-1250, β-glucanase-500, cellulase-250, pectinase-125 units/kg diet) or both were prepared. Each diet was offered to four groups of four laying hens (42 wks old, BV-300 birds) each for a period of 84 days. The results revealed that there was no significant (P<0.05) difference in cumulative average egg production, feed consumption and feed efficiency and egg characteristics such as shape index, albumen index, yolk index, yolk colour, Haugh unit score and shell thickness among different groups. However, egg weight was significantly (P>0.01) higher in groups fed diet supplemented with lipase and lecithin. The metabolizability of dry matter and organic matter of and retention of calcium and phosphorus remained similar (P>0.05) among different groups. The serum calcium and inorganic P levels were also comparable to each other at different intervals. It is concluded that the dietary supplementation of either lipase with lecithin or NSP degrading enzymes has no influence on production performance, nutrient utilization and egg quality of layers except egg weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acolor 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3alaying hens 3alecithins 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3ashape 3atechnology 3athickness 0aEgg quality 0aLayers 0aLipid utilizer 0aNSP degrading enzyme 0aProduction1 aReddy, B.S.V.1 aPrabhu, T.M.1 aManju, G.U.1 aSuma, N.0 tANIMAL NUTRITION AND FEED TECHNOLOGY.g2014 May, v. 14, no. 2 p.379-384dAnimal Nutrition AssociationwJournal:2096x0974-181X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-181X.2014.01330.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03116naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245010100183300001600284520120900300592002801509650001601537650001101553650001301564650001901577650001501596650001501611650000901626650001501635650000901650650001901659650001501678650001101693650001001704650000701714650001301721650001101734650001701745650002001762650002001782650004001802650001201842650002301854650003701877650004201914650001101956650002501967650004801992650003602040650001502076650006802091650004102159650002602200700002202226700001502248700001702263773012902280856004802409852000902457655001202466IND4471718420221123040547.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447171842DNAL7 a215946742pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-011-9678-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Yuanxiang10aProteomic Analysis of Hepatic Tissue in Adult Female Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Exposed to Atrazine  ap. 127-134.  aAtrazine (ATZ), the most common herbicide, is a frequently observed contaminant in freshwater ecosystems. In the present study, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight-mass spectrometry, combined with histopathological analysis, were used to detect the hepatic damage in adult female zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to ATZ. More than 600 hepatic protein spots were detected in each gel with silver staining, and most of the proteins ranged from 20 to 70 kD and pH 4–9. Through comparison and analysis, 7 proteins were found to be upregulated >2-fold, whereas 6 protein spots were downregulated >2-fold after 10 and 1000 μg/l ATZ exposures for 14 days, which had caused histological effects in zebrafish livers. We found that these changed proteins were associated with a variety of cellular biological processes, such as response to oxidative stress, oncogenesis, etc. The results demonstrated that ATZ comprehensively influenced a variety of cellular and biological processes in zebrafish. The information presented in this study will be helpful in fully understanding the mechanism of the potential effects induced by ATZ in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3aatrazine 3acarcinogenesis 3adesorption 3aecosystems 3afish 3afreshwater 3agels 3ahistopathology 3aionization 3alasers 3aliver 3apH 3aproteins 3asilver 3aspectroscopy 3astress response 3atissue analysis 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 2aAnimals 2aAtrazinextoxicity 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aFemale 2aHerbicidesxtoxicity 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aProteomexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aProteomics 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 2aZebrafishxmetabolism1 aZhang, Xiangxiang1 aLu, Dezhao1 aFu, Zhengwei0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2012 Jan., v. 62, no. 1 p.127-134dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-011-9678-7  aDNAL 7aarticle04381naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003000166245015500196300001600351520191700367592002802284650002302312650001502335650001702350650001602367650001102383650001402394650001102408650001602419650002802435650001402463650001202477650001402489650003902503650001302542650002302555650001702578650001902595650002702614650002102641650001402662650000902676650002702685650002802712650001402740650003302754650003802787650002302825650002802848650002802876650002802904650001102932650001102943650001302954650001802967650001802985650000903003650001603012650002203028650002403050650002403074650001903098650002503117650002103142651001103163700002403174700002203198700003003220700002203250700002203272700002703294700002403321773010403345856008103449852000903530655001203539IND50073060920221118060513.0150212e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007306092DNAL7 a237931332pmid7 a10.1007/s00394-013-0548-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoutelidakis, Antonios E.10aEffect of green tea on postprandial antioxidant capacity, serum lipids, C-reactive protein and glucose levels in patients with coronary artery disease  ap. 479-486.  aPURPOSE: Cardiovascular risk factors have been identified in the postprandial state, particularly in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Tea consumption has been linked to cardiovascular risk reduction, but the beneficial effect of tea has not been investigated under postprandial conditions. The objective was to examine the effect of green tea on postprandial levels of plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC), serum lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP) and glucose in patients with CAD. METHODS: In a randomized controlled, parallel design with 2 arms, 43 patients with CAD were assigned to consume breakfast consisting of bread, butter and 330 ml water or tea (4.5 g green tea/330 ml, providing approximately 400 mg catechins). Blood samples were drawn immediately before and 1.5, 3 and 5 h after breakfast. TAC was measured in plasma with the ferric reducing antioxidant power of plasma and oxygen radical absorbance capacity assays. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, glucose, CRP, uric acid and pancreatic lipase levels were measured in serum. RESULTS: Tested biomarkers did not differ between tea and water group at baseline, 1.5, 3 and 5 h (P > 0.05) postprandially. However, TAC increased 1.5 and 3 h after consumption of breakfast with tea (P < 0.005), but no change was observed after consumption of breakfast with water. Serum triglycerides levels significantly increased 3 h after breakfast with water (P = 0.031), but not after breakfast with tea. Serum uric acid decreased 1.5 h after breakfast with tea (P = 0.038). Pancreatic lipase, CRP, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C and glucose levels remained unchanged after breakfast with tea at any time point (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Tea consumption did not affect selected biomarkers at any postprandial time point in patients with CAD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3abiomarkers 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3abreads 3abreakfast 3abutter 3acholesterol 3acoronary artery disease 3aflavanols 3aglucose 3agreen tea 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 3apatients 3apostprandial state 3arisk factors 3arisk reduction 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3atriacylglycerols 3auric acid 2aAged 2aAntioxidantsxanalysis 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBreakfast 2aC-Reactive Proteinxanalysis 2aCatechinxadministration & dosage 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aCoronary Diseasexblood 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aKinetics 2aLipasexblood 2aLipidsxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aPostprandial Period 2aSingle-Blind Method 2aTeaxchemistry 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aUric Acidxblood 0aGreece1 aRallidis, Loukianos1 aKoniari, Katerina1 aPanagiotakos, Demosthenes1 aKomaitis, Michael1 aZampelas, Antonis1 aAnastasiou-Nana, Maria1 aKapsokefalou, Maria0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2014 Mar., v. 53, no. 2 p.479-486dSpringer-Verlagx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-013-0548-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245008100204300001600285520119400301592002801495650001201523650001301535650001101548650002201559650002101581650001601602650002001618700001801638700002001656700002001676700001901696700002601715700001801741700002001759773013501779856008201914852000901996655001202005IND60588718620221122060309.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058871862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-017-1254-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Lindsey1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5568-220010aDesigning the next generation of climate adaptation research for development  ap. 297-304.  aAdaptation research has changed significantly in recent years as funders and researchers seek to encourage greater impact, ensure value for money and promote interdisciplinarity across the natural and social sciences. While these developments are inherently positive, they also bring fresh challenges. With this in mind, this paper presents an agenda for the next generation of climate adaptation research for development. The agenda is based on insights from a dialogue session held at the 2016 Adaptation Futures conference as well as drawing on the collective experience of the authors. We propose five key areas that need to be changed in order to meet the needs of future adaptation research, namely: increasing transparency and consultation in research design; encouraging innovation in the design and delivery of adaptation research programmes; demonstrating impact on the ground; addressing incentive structures; and promoting more effective brokering, knowledge management and learning. As new international funding initiatives start to take shape, we underscore the importance of learning from past experiences and scaling-up of successful innovations in research funding models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3alearning 3amodels 3aresearch programs 3aresearch support 3aresearchers 3asocial sciences1 aHarvey, Blane1 aCochrane, Logan1 aCantin, Bernard1 aConway, Declan1 aCornforth, RosalindJ.1 aDe Souza, Ken1 aKirbyshire, Amy0 tRegional environmental change.g2018 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.297-304dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-017-1254-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01823naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002800142245007400170300001600244520067200260592002800932650001600960650001800976650001300994650001401007650002501021650001301046650001201059700002701071700002301098700003001121700002501151700002701176700002201203773013901225856007601364852000901440655001201449IND60617881220221121025555.0181029e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061788122DNAL7 a10.2983/035.037.04092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArkhipkin, Alexander I.10aTechniques for Estimating the Age and Growth of Molluscs: Cephalopoda  ap. 783-792.  aGlobal abundances and commercial fisheries of cephalopods have increased over recent decades, creating a need for effective fishery management. This management is often focused on the ability to ascertain the age structure of key populations. There are several main techniques for age and growth rate determination in cephalopods. Because of biological differences between species groups, not all techniques are applicable for every species. This review outlines the use of five main ageregistering structures (statoliths, gladii, beaks, stylets, and eye lenses) along with one chemical aging technique (lipofuscin) and their application to cephalopod species groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCephalopoda 3aage structure 3aeye lens 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3amolluscs 3astylets1 aBizikov, Vyacheslav A.1 aDoubleday, Zöe A.1 aLaptikhovsky, Vladimir V.1 aLishchenko, Fedor V.1 aPerales-Raya, Catalina1 aHollyman, Phil R.0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2018 Oct., v. 37, no. 4 p.783-792dNational Shellfisheries AssociationwJournal:15036x0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.037.04093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009800169300001600267500001400283520156300297592002801860650003201888650001401920650001001934650002401944650001901968650001501987650002302002650001902025650002002044650001602064650001602080650001602096650001402112650002102126650002202147650001002169650001702179650001402196650001402210650001402224653002402238653001202262653001102274700001802285700002002303700002102323700002402344773013702368856008602505852000902591655001202600IND60706019820221118234938.0200807e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070601982DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-181X.2014.01334.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuresh, B.N.10aEffect of Low Nutrient Density Diets and Certain Feed Additives on Performance of Laying Hens  ap. 399-404.  aNAL-light  aA trial was conducted to investigate the effect of feeding low nutrient density diets with certain dietary agents on the egg production and nutrient metabolizability of layers (n=144). A practical type layer diet (BIS, 1992) served as control and test diets were prepared by replacing 10, 20 and 30 per cent of the control diet by a diluent feed ingredient i.e., sun-dried sugarcane press residue. Further, each diet was fortified with either lipid utilizing agents (lipase 100 units + lecithin 20 g/kg diet) or NSP degrading enzymes (xylanase 1000, β-glucanase 400, cellulose 200, pectinase 100 units/kg feed) or together to result in another set of three diets. Each diet was offered to triplicate groups of three laying hens (35 wks old, BV-300 birds) each for 56d. The results revealed a significant (P<0.01) reduction in per cent egg production and feed consumption with the decreased diet nutrient density. The feed efficiency was also significantly (P<0.01) poorer in birds fed lower nutrient density diets. The egg characteristics such as shape index, albumen index, yolk index, yolk colour, Haugh unit score and shell thickness including egg weight were statistically similar (P>0.05) among different groups. Further, the egg production, feed consumption, feed efficiency and egg qualities were similar (P>0.05) among the groups fed diets supplemented without or with lipid utilizing agents or NSP degrading enzymes or together. It was concluded that the diet dilution decreases the production performance of layers without affecting egg qualities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acellulose 3acolor 3adietary supplements 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3aexperimental diets 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3aingredients 3alaying hens 3alecithins 3anutrient density 3apolygalacturonase 3ashape 3asolar drying 3asugarcane 3athickness 3axylanases 0aEgg characteristics 0aEnzymes 0aLayers1 aReddy, B.S.V.1 aGloridoss, R.G.1 aUmashankar, B.C.1 aKumar, C.

The goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. Tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. Samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. Aerobic cultivation identified Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcusepidermidis, Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Escherichia coli from ≥50% of the pigs in both herds. For culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16S rRNA sequences using the Ribosomal Database Project Pipeline programs developed at Michigan State University. Dominant genera identified by 16S rRNA analysis in pigs from both herds included Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Pasteurella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and Prevotella. These genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. In contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. In addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. Our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. This is the first analysis using 16S rRNA sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in the porcine upper respiratory tract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacillus 3aBacteroides 3aDNA libraries 3aEscherichia coli 3aFusobacterium 3aHaemophilus 3aPasteurella multocida 3aPorphyromonas 3aPrevotella 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus dysgalactiae 3aStreptococcus suis 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3aherds 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3arespiratory system 3aribosomal RNA 3aswine 3atonsils 3auniversities 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aBacterial Physiological Phenomena 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aBiodiversity 2aCulture Techniques 2aMetagenomexphysiology 2aPalatine Tonsilxmicrobiology 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSwine 3aMichigan1 aMarsh, Terence L.1 aIsaacs-Cosgrove, Natasha1 aKirkwood, Roy N.1 aKiupel, Matti1 aMulks, Martha H.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2011 Jan. 27, v. 147, no. 3-4 p.346-357dElsevier B.V.x0378-11357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245013100176300001800307520141500325592002801740650001301768650001901781650002701800650001501827650002301842650001301865650001001878650001601888650001201904650002201916650001201938650001701950650001601967650001301983650001901996653000802015653002102023653001202044653001602056653001702072700002102089700002402110700002102134700002002155700001702175700002002192700002302212773009902235856008602334852000902420655001202429IND60528508720221118143932.0190319e20160712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052850872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.03.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHesseling, Anneke C.10aDelayed BCG immunization does not alter antibody responses to EPI vaccines in HIV-exposed and -unexposed South African infants  ap. 3702-3709.  aBacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is routinely given at birth in tuberculosis-endemic settings due to its protective effect against disseminated tuberculosis in infants. BCG is however contraindicated in HIV-infected infants. We investigated whether delaying BCG vaccination to 14 weeks of age affected vaccine-induced antibody responses to Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)-conjugate, pertussis, tetanus and Hepatitis B (HBV) vaccines, in HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) and -unexposed uninfected (HUU) infants.Infants were randomized to receive BCG at birth or at 14 weeks of age. Blood was taken at 14, 24, and 52 weeks of age and analyzed for Hib, pertussis, tetanus and HBV specific antibodies.BCG was given either at birth (106 infants, 51 HEU) or at 14 weeks of age (74 infants, 50 HEU). The timing of BCG vaccination did not influence the antibody response to any antigen studied. However, in a non-randomized comparison, HEU infants had higher Hib antibody concentrations at weeks 14 and 24 (p=0.001 and <0.001, respectively) and pertussis at week 24 (p=0.003). Conversely, HEU infants had lower antibody concentrations to HBV at 14 and 52 weeks (p=0.032 and p=0.031) with no differences in tetanus titres.HIV exposure, but not the timing of BCG vaccination, was associated with antibody concentrations to Hib, pertussis, HBV and tetanus primary immunization.Clinical Trial Registration: DOH-27-1106-1520.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfricans 3aHIV infections 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3aantigens 3ablood 3ahepatitis B 3ainfants 3aprotective effect 3atetanus 3atuberculosis 3avaccination 3avaccines 3awhooping cough 0aBCG 0aHumoral immunity 0aInfants 0aHIV-exposed 0aSouth Africa1 aBlakney, Anna K.1 aJones, Christine E.1 aEsser, Monika M.1 ade Beer, Corena1 aKuhn, Louise1 aCotton, Mark F.1 aJaspan, Heather B.0 tVaccine.g2016 July 12, v. 34, no. 32 p.3702-3709dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.03.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03621naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245011400213500002200327520176200349592002802111650002502139650001702164650001102181650002602192650001702218650000902235650001902244650002102263650001302284650001402297650001302311650001202324650001602336650001302352650001502365650001902380650002602399650003102425650001502456650003702471650001902508650001502527651001102542653002002553653003102573653001502604653002002619653003302639653001302672700002402685700002102709700003002730700001702760700003102777700002602808773005402834856008602888852000902974655001202983IND60585738420221119093306.0171114s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058573842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.10.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiapini, Mariane1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7111-055510aFormation of black carbon rich ‘sombric’ horizons in the subsoil – A case study from subtropical Brazil  aPre-press version  aThe formation of sombric horizons (dark horizons in the subsoil) is still not understood. In order to improve our understanding of the formation of sombric horizons we studied these soils in southern Brazil from various perspectives. The lateral configuration and grain size distribution excluded the possibility that the sombric horizon is a paleosol covered by an eolian deposit or colluvium. Micromorphology showed intense biological activity, indicating strong bioturbation. The absence of clay and OM coatings indicates that the sombric horizon in the study area was not formed by illuviation. Considering changes with depth, phytoliths and δ13C isotopes clearly showed that the OM from the sombric horizon had a larger contribution from grasses, while a larger contribution from black carbon (BC) was evidenced by the molecular composition. A larger contribution from grasses and BC both correspond to drier climatic conditions. However, similar depth trends for δ13C and PAHs were found in the reference profile (without sombric horizon), in agreement with climatic change but not explaining the different morphology. The molecular composition and C/N ratio showed that the profiles differed in degree of decomposition, with the OM in the soils that contained a sombric horizon being more decomposed than that in the reference profile. The sombric horizon is thus a remnant of an earlier phase of soil formation under a drier climate, which is made visible by differences in decomposition of OM related to subsequent more humid conditions. Stronger decomposition in the profiles with a sombric horizon may be related to better drainage, explaining their occurrence in the highest positions within the landscape and suggesting a topographic control.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abioturbation 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acase studies 3aclay 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acoatings 3acolluvium 3adrainage 3agrasses 3ailluviation 3aisotopes 3alandscapes 3amicrostructure 3apaleosolic soil types 3aparticle size distribution 3aphytoliths 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asoil formation 3atopography 3aBrazil 0aPyrolysis-GC/MS 0aδ13C isotopic composition 0aPhytoliths 0aMicromorphology 0aEnvironmental reconstruction 0aHolocene1 aSchellekens, Judith1 aCalegari, Marcia1 ade Almeida, Jaime Antonio1 aBuurman, P.,1 ade Camargo, Plinio Barbosa1 aTorrado, Pablo Vidal,0 tGeoderma.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.10.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245018600170520220700356592002802563650002002591650001302611650002402624650002202648650001702670650001502687650001502702650002402717650003302741650001202774651001502786651001202801700001502813700001402828700001902842700002202861773013402883856008503017852000903102655001203111IND60672753820221122025834.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067275382DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz034.P10-128-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Phuong10aIntervention Design Elements Are Associated with Frontline Health Workers’ Performance to Deliver Infant and Young Child Nutrition Services in Bangladesh and Viet Nam (P10-128-19)  aFrontline health workers (FLW) are needed for delivering interventions at scale to reduce maternal and child undernutrition, but low- and middle-income countries often face inadequate FLW performance. This study aimed to test whether and how intervention design elements such as training, supervision, and mass media improved FLW performance in delivering nutrition services. Survey data were collected in 2010 and 2014 as part of impact evaluations of Alive & Thrive (A&T) interventions to improve infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices in Bangladesh and Vietnam. FLWs in A&T intensive (A&T-I) areas received specialized IYCF training, job aids, and regular supportive supervision. Those in A&T non-intensive (A&T-NI) areas received standard government training and supervision; there was mass media exposure in both areas. Multiple regression was used to test differences in exposure to intervention design elements and performance outcomes between the two intervention areas. Structural equation modeling was conducted to examine the paths from exposure to performance outcomes measured at the FLW and end-user levels. Compared to FLWs in A&T-NI areas, those in A&T-I areas had higher scores in training (by 1.3–3.6 out of 10 points), supportive supervision (by 0.3–3.5 points), and mass media exposure (by 0.3–3.5 points). These intervention design elements were significantly associated with FLW knowledge and motivation, which in turn improved service delivery. FLW-level performance outcomes contributed to improving end-user-level outcomes such as higher service utilization (β = 0.12–1.04 in Bangladesh and 0.11–0.96 in Vietnam) and maternal knowledge (β = 0.12- 0.17 in Bangladesh and 0.04–0.21 in Vietnam). Training, supervision, and mass media exposure can contribute to improved FLW service delivery by enhancing knowledge and motivation, which in turn positively influence mother's service utilization and IYCF knowledge. These elements and mechanisms should be considered by policy makers and program implementers when designing interventions or reinforcing the work context of FLWs.

The unique feature of this material is the capability of a polymer gel to simultaneously provide shape stabilization of a liquid salt hydrate phase at a lower temperature, and to reversibly adjust its assembly strength in response to a temperature increase. This approach enables convenient control over the viscosity of the PCM gel system, allowing for filling and removal of the mixture in a liquid state but operation in the solid/gel regime. The system consists of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) dissolved in lithium nitrate trihydrate (LNH), a high-latent-heat salt hydrate PCM. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and viscometry studies indicate that in dilute solution, PVA chains are more expanded in LNH than in water. At a concentration of 15 wt% PVA, the PVA/LNH system – unlike PVA aqueous solutions – gels and exhibits a temperature-triggered gel-to-sol transition. Gelation is achieved only with PVA with the highest degree of hydrolysis (98%), with the gelation temperature of 20 ± 1 °C as measured by DLS and rheology. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy shows that the PVA gelation is enhanced due to dehydration of PVA chains in LNH, as compared to PVA aqueous solutions. Physically crosslinked PVA/LNH gels demonstrate highly repeatable and reproducible performance during ten cycles of LNH melting/freezing, as shown by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Taken together, these results confirm that PVA-based gels are promising matrices for hosting inorganic PCMs that withstand repeated melting/freezing cycling, but can be easily filled or drained as needed by raising the temperature well above the gelation temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3acrosslinking 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afreezing 3agelatinization temperature 3agelation 3agels 3ahydrolysis 3alight scattering 3aliquids 3alithium 3amelting 3anitrates 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3arheology 3aviscometry 3aviscosity1 aEmmons, Emily1 aGreen, Micah J.1 aShamberger, Patrick1 aSukhishvili, Svetlana A.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 June 20, v. 5, no. 24 p.12474-12482dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta02897k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009600165300001500261520135800276592002801634650002501662650001201687650001301699650002101712653001601733653002801749653003501777653001501812653001801827700001501845700001801860700001401878700001501892700001601907773009501923856008202018852000902100655001202109IND60772782720221119105515.0220410e20211130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077278272DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-bja100762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Caiping10aCharacterization of ground parenchyma cells in Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis–Poaceae)  ap. 92-102.  aGround parenchyma cells play a crucial role in the growth and the mechanical properties of bamboo plants. Investigation of the morphology of ground parenchyma cells is essential for understanding the physiological functions and mechanical properties of these cells. This study aimed to characterize the anatomical structure of bamboo ground parenchyma cells and provide a qualitative and quantitative basis for the more effective utilization of bamboo. To do this, the morphology of ground parenchyma cells in Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) was studied using light microscopy and field-emission environmental scanning electron microscopy. Results show that various geometric shapes of ground parenchyma cells were observed, including nearly circular, square, long, oval, and irregular shapes. Cell walls of both long and short parenchyma cells exhibited primary wall thickening and secondary wall thickening, resulting in a primary pit field and simple pits. Most long cells were strip-shaped (L/W = 2.52), while most short cells were short and wide (L/W = 0.59). The proportion of long cells was 11 times greater than that of short cells. Most long cells were filled with starch grains, and some short cells also occasionally had starch grains. These findings allowed the first construction of the three-dimensional structure of parenchyma cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3abamboos 3ageometry 3alight microscopy 0aMoso bamboo 0aground parenchyma cells 0amorphological characterization 0aparameters 0astarch grains1 aChen, Hong1 aZhang, Shuqin1 aLiu, Rong1 aWu, Zhihui1 aFei, Benhua0 tIAWA journal.g2021 Nov. 30, v. 43, no. 1-2 p.92-102dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-bja100763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010900170300001600279520133700295592002801632650001601660650001201676650001301688650003001701650001101731650002001742653002001762653001001782653003401792653002501826653002201851700002301873700005501896773009601951856008202047852000902129655001202138IND60772782820221119105157.0220410e20211103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077278282DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-bja100752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajput, Kishore S.10aStructure of the secondary xylem and development of a cambial variant in Serjania mexicana (Sapindaceae)  ap. 103-115.  aThe lianas in the family Sapindaceae are known for their unique secondary growth which differs from climbing species in other plant families in terms of their cambial variants. The present study deals with the stem anatomy of self-supporting and lianescent habit, development of phloem wedges, the ontogeny of cambial variants and structure of the secondary xylem in the stems of Serjania mexicana (L.) Willd. Thick stems (15–20 mm) were characterized by the presence of distinct phloem wedges and tangentially wide neo-formed cambial cylinders. As the stem diameter increases, there is a proportional increase in the number of phloem wedges and neo-formed vascular cylinders. The parenchymatous (pericyclic) cells external to phloem wedges that are located on the inner margin of the pericyclic fibres undergo dedifferentiation, become meristematic and form small segments of cambial cylinders. These cambia extend tangentially into wide and large segments of neoformations. Structurally, the secondary xylem and phloem of the neo-formed vascular cylinders remain similar to the derivatives produced by the regular vascular cambium. The secondary xylem is composed of vessels (wide and narrow), fibres, axial and ray parenchyma cells. The occurrence of perforated ray cells is a common feature in both regular and variant xylem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSapindaceae 3acambium 3aontogeny 3aparenchyma (plant tissue) 3aphloem 3asecondary xylem 0aCambial variant 0aliana 0aneo-formed vascular cylinders 0aperforated ray cells 0asuccessive cambia1 aGondaliya, Amit D.1 aMoya, Roger1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6201-83830 tIAWA journal.g2021 Nov. 03, v. 43, no. 1-2 p.103-115dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-bja100753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01748naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245006900130300001600199520075200215592002800967650002500995650002601020650001501046650001801061650001201079650003101091650002701122650001301149650001501162653002101177653000801198700001501206700002201221773014601243852000901389655001201398IND60706020120221122100218.0200807e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070602012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Rajesh10aEvaluation of IPM modules against Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner)  ap. 244-248.  aResults revealed that mean larval population of Helicoverpa armigera was considerably low after insecticidal sprays in different modules and lowest population of the insect (2.59/MRL) was recorded in Module 6 (spinosad @ 0.5 ml/l of water as 1ˢᵗ spray and indoxacarb @1 ml/l as 2ⁿᵈ spray) followed by Module 4 (indoxacarb @1.0 ml/l as 1ˢᵗ spray and triozophos @1.5 ml/l as 2ⁿᵈ spray) and Module 1 (spinosad @ 0.5 ml/l as 1ˢᵗ spray and triazophos @1.5 ml/l as 2ⁿᵈ spray) in 2009–2010.

Biochar (BC) has been considered a soil amendment to potentially improve soil fertility and crop productivity. However, little is known about the effects of N fertilization combined with BC on sugarcane growth, rhizosphere soil characteristics and microbial community composition. In this study, a greenhouse-pot experiment with six treatments in triplicates was carried out to examine the responses of root-shoot growth, rhizosphere soil properties and bacterial communities to different BC and N fertilization treatments in sugarcane monocropping soil (duration over 20 years). The results demonstrated that N fertilization combined with BC promoted the aboveground growth of sugarcane, while different dose of BC exhibited a significant effect on switching root and shoot growth responses. With the increase in the BC amendment rate, the rhizosphere soil pH, TC and C/N ratio increased correspondingly. As compared with the N-only treatment, N fertilization combined with moderate dose of BC significantly decreased soil NO₃⁻-N and nitrification potential (SNP), whereas N treatment with higher-dose BC resulted in a sharp increase in SNP. DESeq2 analysis revealed that N fertilization coupled with higher BC-amendment enriched Mesorhizobium, Porphyrobacter, Rhizobacter and Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium. Redundancy analysis indicated that soil pH, NO₃⁻-N and C/N were key edaphic factors that shifted the soil bacterial community composition, especially for nitrifying flora and N-fixing flora. The above findings suggest that the combination of N fertilization with moderate-dose BC might be an alternative strategy to promote crop growth and soil sustainability under sugarcane monocropping system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMesorhizobium 3aPorphyrobacter 3aRhizobacter 3abiochar 3acommunity structure 3acontinuous cropping 3aflora 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3arhizosphere 3asoil amendments 3asoil bacteria 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3asugarcane 3aChina 0aN fertilization 0aBiochar 0aNitrification 0aMonocropping soil 0aSugarcane1 aHuang, Jinwen1 aFallah, Nyumah1 aLin, Wenxiong1 aYuan, Zhaonian1 aHu, Chaohua0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Aug., v. 182 p.114899-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1148993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04025naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245017600209500002200385520219400407592002802601650002102629650001102650650002302661650001302684650002102697650001102718650001602729650001402745650000902759650001602768650002602784650001302810650002302823650001802846650000702864650002502871650001402896650001202910650002002922650001202942650001502954651001002969653001302979653001402992653001503006653002103021653002203042700002503064700002403089700006003113700001503173700002003188700002003208700002203228773005403250856008603304852000903390655001203399IND60585738720221119093412.0171114s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058573872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.10.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWille, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1083-473010aSilicon and chromium stable isotopic systematics during basalt weathering and lateritisation: A comparison of variably weathered basalt profiles in the Deccan Traps, India  aPre-press version  aGlobal biomass production is fundamentally affected by the hydrological cycling of elements at the Earth's surface. Continental weathering processes are the major source for most bio-essential elements in marine environments and therefore affect primary productivity. In addition, critical zone biomass depends on energy and chemical exchange reactions in weathering profiles. The latter reservoirs are in turn influenced by different climatic conditions that control weathering and pore water parameters like pH and Eh, these then regulate mineral break down rates that dictate the mobility and mass flux of elements.Two Deccan Trap basalt-weathering profiles of contrasting age and alteration intensity provide a natural laboratory for investigating the effects of rock alteration on Si and Cr and their isotopic systematics. The sub-recent Chhindwara profile has progressed to a moderate degree of alteration (saprolite), while the Paleogene Bidar example displays an extremely altered laterite. The Chhindwara profile shows a near uniform Cr and Si concentration and isotopic composition, whereas the Bidar profile is characterised by an intense loss of Si, a large enrichment of Cr within the most altered uppermost levels, and a wide range of Cr stable isotope ratios (−0.85 to 0.36‰ δ53/52Cr). A co-variation between Si and Cr isotopes, as well as their co-variation with iron content, provides empirical evidence that iron redistribution within the profile has a large effect on Cr mobility. Therefore, it is concluded that iron oxides exert a primary control over the isotopic composition of both Cr and Si in pore waters of laterites.Because laterite formation is promoted by tropical climates, the results of this study provide new evidence to suggest that the hydrological Cr and Si fluxes originating from continental weathering have changed in accordance with large-scale, deep time climate variation and continental plate configuration. An increased flux of Si and greater magnitude of Cr mobility and isotopic fractionation are possibly amplified under CO2-rich, greenhouse episodes and/or when large landmasses were tectonically arranged at near equatorial latitudes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaleogene period 3abasalt 3abiomass production 3achromium 3aclimatic factors 3aenergy 3agreenhouses 3ahydrology 3airon 3airon oxides 3aisotope fractionation 3alatitude 3amarine environment 3amass transfer 3apH 3aprimary productivity 3asaprolite 3asilicon 3astable isotopes 3atropics 3aweathering 3aIndia 0aLaterite 0aSaprolite 0aWeathering 0aSilicon isotopes 0aChromium isotopes1 aBabechuk, Michael G.1 aKleinhanns, Ilka C.1 aStegmaier, Jonas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0470-59751 aSuhr, Nils1 aWiddowson, Mike1 aKamber, Balz S.1 aSchoenberg, Ronny0 tGeoderma.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.10.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007300150245015900223300001400382520135500396592002801751650002601779650001601805650001901821650000901840650002901849650002601878650001701904650001701921650000901938650001901947650001301966650001701979650002001996650001602016653002002032653001502052653001502067653001502082653001402097653001902111653002902130700003202159700006602191700002802257773012202285856008502407852000902492655001202501IND60679742720221116204901.0201206e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067974272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Romero, Jesús Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0648-260510aSarcocornia fruticosa photosynthetic response to short-term extreme temperature events in combination with optimal and sub-optimal salinity concentrations  ap. 45-52.  aClimate change would increase frequency and intensity of extreme events as heat and cold waves. There is a lack of studies that consider the co-occurrence of these waves with other abiotic factors relevant on a climate change scenario as salinity. Therefore, it could be interesting to improve our knowledge about the effects that this co-occurrence could have in different species due to the species specific effect of the photosynthesis tolerance to extreme temperatures. A controlled condition experiment was performed using the salt marsh species Sarcocornia perrnis with eight experimental blocks combining temperature ranges (40-28/22-15/13-5 °C) and salinity concentration on the growth solution (171/1050 mM NaCl). After 3 days of treatment, gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence, pigment profile and water state measurement were applied. Photosynthetic machinery function of this perennial species decreased on for both high and low temperature range. Nevertheless, at 13-5 °C the effect of the salinity was mainly due to diffusion limitations more than to damage on the photosystems. At 40-28 °C, in presence of optimal salinity S. fruticosa was not altered overall. However, high temperatures in combination with high salinity reduced the photosynthetic capacity mainly by reducing the efficiency of the electron transport chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSarcocornia fruticosa 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3acold 3aelectron transport chain 3aenvironmental factors 3afluorescence 3agas exchange 3aheat 3aphotosynthesis 3asalinity 3asalt marshes 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 0aClimatic change 0aCold waves 0aHeat waves 0aHalophytes 0aTolerance 0aPhotosynthesis 0aChlorophyll fluorescence1 aBarcia-Piedras, Jose María1 aRedondo-Gómez, Susana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5280-93251 aMateos-Naranjo, Enrique0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2020 Mar., v. 148 p.45-52dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.12.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245009600177300001600273520150500289592002801794650002001822650001401842650001401856650001401870650001601884650001101900650002401911650001901935650001001954650001001964650002601974650001302000650002102013650002502034650001502059650001402074650001802088650001802106650001302124650001102137650001102148650004002159650002402199650001402223650003402237650002502271650002302296651001002319651001002329700001602339700001502355700001902370773012002389856004802509852000902557655001202566IND4474615020221122043131.0121003e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447461502DNAL7 a228068362pmid7 a10.1007/s11274-011-0831-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yu14aThe influence of the discharging sewage on microbial diversity in sludge from Dongting Lake  ap. 421-430.  aHuman activities have a tremendous impact not only on the macroscopic world, but also on the micro-organisms. Here, Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) was used for assessing the effect of the industrial sewage on the microbial community in sludge of Dongting Lake, the second-largest freshwater lake in China. The sludge samples from the outfall of the representative nitrogenous fertilizer plant near the lake were collected in March, 2010, and the sludge samples from the surrounding waters were treated as the control. The multi-element analysis results showed that the content of nitrogen, phosphorus in Sample SY were 1.9 and 1.47 times of the control group respectively. Based on restriction patterns derived from ARDRA, 26 representative clones (15 clones in the SY group and 11 clones in the DZ group) were sequenced. The sequence data and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene presented that microorganism diversity of two sludge samples were abundant. Bacterial diversity presented among the outfall samples was dominated by Aeromonas sp. (5.8%), Acidimicrobidae sp. (5.8%) and Gemmatimonas sp. (5.0%). In contrast, bacterial diversity presented among the control group was dominated by Xanthomonas sp. (8.0%), Lautropia sp. (5.8%) and Duganella sp. (5.1%). The results indicated that due to the excessive of nitrogen and phosphorus discharged by the nitrogen fertilizer plant, the eutrophication in Dongting Lake has great influence on the microbial community structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidimicrobidae 3aAeromonas 3aDuganella 3aLautropia 3aXanthomonas 3aclones 3acommunity structure 3aeutrophication 3agenes 3alakes 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aphosphorus 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3asampling 3asewage 3asludge 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aLakesxmicrobiology 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aWater Microbiology 3aChina 0aChina1 aWang, Xiang1 aShi, Jiafu1 aLi, Jiangjiang0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2012 Feb., v. 28, no. 2 p.421-430dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-011-0831-2  aDNAL 7aarticle04264naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015000168520250900318592002802827650003002855650001902885650001902904650001502923650002002938650001302958650002602971650002402997650002403021650002803045650000903073650001403082650001003096650001603106650001803122650001103140650002103151650001503172650000903187650002403196650001203220650001503232651001103247700001603258700002003274700002403294700001703318700002403335700002003359700002103379700002003400700002603420773013403446856008503580852000903665655001203674IND60672754120221121015146.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067275412DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz034.P10-131-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFord, Nicole13aAn Integrated Micronutrient Powder Intervention Improved IYCF Practices Among Caregivers of Children 6–23 Months in Eastern Uganda (P10-131-19)  aWe evaluated the impact of an integrated infant and young child feeding (IYCF) – micronutrient powder intervention on IYCF practices among caregivers of children 12–23 mo in Eastern Uganda. We used pre-/post- data from two population-based, cross-sectional surveys representative of children aged 12–23 mo in Amuria (intervention) and Soroti (non-intervention) districts. Caregivers were interviewed in June/July at baseline 2015 (N = 1260) and 12 mo after implementation in 2016 (N = 1490) about their IYCF practices the day preceding the survey. Logistic regression estimated the double-difference effect of the intervention on core World Health Organization (WHO) IYCF indicators: child ever breastfed, current breastfeeding, bottle feeding, complementary foods introduced at age 6 mo, consumption of vitamin A-rich fruits or vegetables, consumption of animal-flesh foods, minimum meal frequency (MMF) (received food ≥3 times for breastfed children and ≥4 times for non-breastfed children), minimum dietary diversity (MDD) (received foods from ≥4 of 7 WHO food groups), and minimum acceptable diet (MAD) (MDD and MMF among breastfed children, and ≥2 milk feeds, MDD not including milk feeds, and MMF among non-breastfed children). Analyses were weighted and accounted for complex sampling design. After controlling for child age and sex, household wealth, household food security, and caregiver education, the intervention was positively associated with MMF (Adjusted Prevalence Difference-in-Difference [APDiD] 18.6%; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 11.2, 26.0) and MAD (APDiD 5.6%; 95% CI 0.02, 11.2). The intervention was associated with 21.8% higher prevalence of timely introduction of complementary feeding (95% CI 13.4, 30.1) and with increased consumption of both vitamin A-rich fruits/vegetables (APDiD 23.5%; 95% CI 12.5, 34.5) and animal-flesh foods (APDiD 9.1%; 95% CI 1.5, 16.7). The intervention did not affect breastfeeding or bottle feeding practices. Despite program impact, prevalence of some IYCF practices were low in Amuria at endline including MAD (19%) and MMF (21%). The integrated IYCF intervention had a positive impact on many core WHO IYCF practices; however, low endline prevalence of some indicators suggests a continued need to improve complementary feeding practices in Eastern Uganda.

METHODS: Freeze-dried water extract (PTW), containing 5.1 % of ellagic acid, 0.2 % of proanthocyanidins, and soluble carbohydrates as a major part, and water–alcohol extract (PTE), containing 17.1 % of ellagic acid and 10.9 % of proanthocyanidins, were administered, in the equivalent quantity of 0.06 % of ellagic acid, to 4- to 8-week-old rats (8 animals per group), as a component of modified AIN-93 diets containing 5 % of cellulose or FOS. RESULTS: The addition of strawberry pomace extracts had no effect on either the diet intake or the body weight of experimental rats. Both extracts, similarly to FOS, beneficially reduced the activity of β-glucuronidase in caecal digesta, with the PTW effect being significantly higher than that of PTE (7.59 vs. 9.20 μmol/h/g, P = 0.001). In comparison with PTE, the PTW extract significantly increased the caecal digesta mass (1.45 vs. 1.27 k/kg BW) and the total production of SCFA (86.1 vs. 71.4 μmol/100 g BW). The extract enhanced the physiological effect of FOS by inhibiting the activity of β-glucuronidase, increasing the caecal digesta mass and SCFA production. Such an effect was not recorded in the case of the PTE preparation. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of strawberry pomace extracts affected the activity of certain enzymes of intestinal microflora and its most important products.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeta-glucuronidase 3abody weight 3acellulose 3achemical composition 3adietary fiber 3adigesta 3aellagic acid 3afreeze drying 3afructooligosaccharides 3agastrointestinal system 3aintestinal microorganisms 3apomace 3apomace extracts 3aproanthocyanidins 3arats 3astrawberries 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxenzymology 2aCatechinxanalysis 2aCecumxdrug effects 2aCellulosexanalysisxpharmacology. 2aDiet 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aDigestion 2aEllagic Acidxanalysis 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFermentation 2aFlavonoidsxanalysis 2aFragariaxchemistry 2aFruitxchemistry 2aGastrointestinal Tractxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aGlycolysis 2aMale 2aOligosaccharidesxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aPolyphenolsxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aProanthocyanidinsxanalysis 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects1 aZduńczyk, Zenon1 aKołodziejczyk, Krzysztof1 aKlimczak, Elżbieta1 aJuśkiewicz, Jerzy1 aZduńczyk, Przemysław0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2014 Mar., v. 53, no. 2 p.521-532dSpringer-Verlagx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-013-0557-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011200168300001600280520138600296592002801682650002601710650002001736650002901756650001301785650002601798650002901824650001201853650002901865650001501894650002001909650001701929650001501946650001901961650000901980650001201989651001202001653000902013653001202022653003102034653003302065653001402098653001202112700001802124700001602142773009602158856008702254852000902341655001202350IND60585738820221119093242.0190830e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058573882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeucher, A.10aArtificial neural networks and decision tree classification for predicting soil drainage classes in Denmark  ap. 351-359.  aSoil drainage constitutes a substantial factor affecting plant growth and various biophysical processes, such as nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas fluxes. Consequently, soil drainage maps represent crucial tools for crop, forest and environmental management purposes. As extensive field surveys are time- and resource-consuming, alternative spatial modelling techniques have been previously applied for predicting soil drainage classes. The present study assessed the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for mapping soil drainage classes in Denmark and compared it to a Decision Tree Classification (DTC) technique. 1702 soil observations and 31 environmental variables, including soil and terrain parameters, and spectral indices derived from satellite images, were utilized as input data. Based on a 33% holdback validation dataset, the best performing ANN and DTC models yielded overall accuracy values of 54 and 52%, respectively. DTC models benefited from the use of all variables, but ANN models performed better after variable selection. Notably, ANN and DTC model performances were comparable although differential costs for misclassification were only implemented for DTC modelling. Nevertheless, both methods produced predictive drainage maps in accordance with one another and demonstrated promising classification abilities over a large study area (c. 43,000km2).  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemical cycles 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3adrainage 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental management 3aforests 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alandscapes 3aneural networks 3aplant growth 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asoil 3asurveys 3aDenmark 0aSoil 0aMapping 0aArtificial neural networks 0aDecision tree classification 0aModelling 0aDenmark1 aMøller, A.B.1 aGreve, M.H.0 tGeoderma.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 352 p.351-359dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245014200186300001400328500001500342520101000357592002801367650001701395650002001412650001701432650002301449650006301472650002501535650003001560650004601590650003801636650004201674650002201716650005501738650001701793650002701810650003401837653001801871700001901889700002301908773012001931856008202051852000902133655001202142IND50060688120221120044331.0190411e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006068812DNAL7 a232767862pmid7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2012.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWuest, Samuel E10aCell-specific expression profiling of rare cell types as exemplified by its impact on our understanding of female gametophyte development  ap. 41-49.  a2019-12-06  aExpression profiling of single cells can yield insights into cell specification, cellular differentiation processes, and cell type-specific responses to environmental stimuli. Recent work has established excellent tools to perform genome-wide expression studies of individual cell types, even if the cells of interest occur at low frequency within an organ. We review the advances and impact of gene expression studies of rare cell types, as exemplified by recently gained insights into the development and function of the angiosperm female gametophyte. The detailed transcriptional characterization of different stages during female gametophyte development has significantly helped to improve our understanding of cellular specification or cell–cell communication processes. Next-generation sequencing approaches—used increasingly for expression profiling—will now allow for comparative approaches that focus on agriculturally, ecologically or evolutionarily relevant aspects of plant reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3agene expression 3agametophytes 3aplant reproduction 2aMagnoliopsidaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aCell Differentiation 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aHigh-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing 2aOrgan Specificity 2aOvulexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aReproduction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSingle-Cell Analysisxmethods 0aMagnoliophyta1 aSchmid, Marc W1 aGrossniklaus, Ueli0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2013 Feb., v. 16, no. 1 p.41-49dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2012.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245012100193300001300314520135300327592002801680650001301708650001001721650001101731650001901742650001001761650002801771650003501799650001201834650001301846650002101859650001901880650002101899650001301920650003501933650004501968650003602013650003802049650002302087700002002110700001802130700002102148700001702169700002102186773010602207856005502313852000902368655001202377IND4480429420221120031016.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448042942DNAL7 a222507332pmid7 a10.1111/j.1740-0929.2011.00927.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHOSOKAWA, Daisuke10aIdentification of divergently selected regions between Japanese Black and Holstein cattle using bovine 50k SNP array  ap. 7-13.  aDifferences between average allelic frequencies of genes that relate to traits suggest that it would be evidence of artificial selections. Sliding window approach is a useful method to identify genomic regions that have been differently selected between two breeds. The objective of this study was to identify the divergently selected regions between Japanese Black (JB) and Japanese Holstein (JH) cattle based on genotypic information obtained through a high‐density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel. After genotyping of 54 001 SNP markers on 100 animals (50 JB and 50 JH), 40 635 SNPs were suitable for the analysis. For each of these SNPs, the absolute difference between allelic frequencies of JB and JH was calculated. In the current study, 10 consecutive SNPs were defined as components of a window. For each window, the average difference in allelic frequency was calculated. This was termed sliding window average difference (SWAD). Among 40 055 windows, we focused on 39 windows with the largest SWAD. This was equivalent to 0.1% of all windows and the SWAD was more than 0.435. Some of these windows overlapped and were distributed in 11 regions. These regions were in good agreement with reported quantitative trait locus, therefore would be selection signatures and good candidates that harbor the causative mutations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aWagyu 3acattle 3agene frequency 3agenes 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgenetics 2aGene Frequency 2aGenomexgenetics 2aGenotype 2aGenotyping Techniquesxmethods 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aSelection, Genetic1 aIshii, Atsushi,1 aYAMAJI, Keita1 aSASAZAKI, Shinji1 aOYAMA, Kenji1 aMANNEN, Hideyuki0 tAnimal science journal =.g2012 Jan., v. 83, no. 1 p.7-13dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-0929.2011.00927.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245014100167300001300308520160200321592002801923650001601951650002301967650002501990650002202015650001302037650002002050650002102070650000802091650001502099650002102114650002202135650000902157650001602166650002502182650001502207650001702222651001002239653003202249653002702281653003702308700001302345700001902358700001202377700001502389700001502404700001602419700001902435700001802454773011602472856008802588852000902676655001202685IND60635073820221123033657.0190523e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063507382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.3302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hui10aAssociation of meteorological factors with infectious diarrhea incidence in Guangzhou, southern China: A time-series study (2006–2017)  ap. 7-15.  aInfectious diarrhea (ID) has exerted a severe disease burden on the world. The seasonal ID patterns suggest that meteorological factors (MFs) may influence ID incidence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of MFs on ID, and to provide scientific evidence to the relevant health authorities for disease control and prevention.Data from ID cases and daily MFs (including mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, relative humidity, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, and wind velocity) in Guangzhou, Southern China from 2006 to 2017 were collected. Using a distributed lag non-linear model approach, we assessed the relationship between MFs and ID incidence.Compared with the lowest ID risk values, low mean temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation were associated with an increased risk for ID, while higher diurnal temperature range and atmospheric pressure were also associated with increased risk. Maximum atmospheric pressure and minimum relative humidity had larger cumulative effects within 21 lag days, yielding relative risks of 133.11 (95% CI: 61.29–289.09) and 18.17 (14.42–22.89), respectively. The cumulative effect within 21 lag days of minimum temperature was higher than that from maximum temperature in all sub-populations. The cumulative effects of minimum temperature for men, teenagers, and young adults (10–29 years) were higher than those for other populations.MFs should be considered when developing prevention and surveillance programs for ID. Special attention should be paid to vulnerable populations, such as teenagers and young adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aat-risk population 3aatmospheric pressure 3aburden of disease 3adiarrhea 3adisease control 3adisease severity 3amen 3amonitoring 3anonlinear models 3arelative humidity 3arisk 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3awind speed 3ayoung adults 3aChina 0aInfectious diarrhea disease 0aMeteorological factors 0aDistributed lag non-linear model1 aDi, Biao1 aZhang, Tiejun,1 aLu, Yin1 aChen, Chun1 aWang, Dahu1 aLi, Tiegang1 aZhang, Zhoubin1 aYang, Zhicong0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 July 01, v. 672 p.7-15dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.3303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005400152245011700206300001600323520139600339592002801735650000801763650001201771650001901783650002201802650001001824650001701834650002901851650002101880650001701901650001801918650001601936651001001952653001701962653001801979653002101997653003002018700001502048700001702063700001402080700001902094773010102113856008602214852000902300655001202309IND60562596920221116182417.0170208e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056259692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.05.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6799-690410aInvestigation of thermodynamic performances for two solar-biomass hybrid combined cycle power generation systems  ap. 252-262.  aTwo solar-biomass hybrid combined cycle power generation systems are proposed in this work. The first system employs the thermochemical hybrid routine, in which the biomass gasification is driven by the concentrated solar energy, and the gasified syngas as a solar fuel is utilized in a combined cycle for generating power. The second system adopts the thermal integration concept, and the solar energy is directly used to heat the compressed air in the topping Brayton cycle. The thermodynamic performances of the developed systems are investigated under the on-design and off-design conditions. The advantages of the hybrid utilization technical mode are demonstrated. The solar energy can be converted and stored into the chemical fuel by the solar-biomass gasification, with the net solar-to-fuel efficiency of 61.23% and the net solar share of 19.01% under the specific gasification temperature of 1150K. Meanwhile, the proposed system with the solar thermochemical routine shows more favorable behaviors, the annual system overall energy efficiency and the solar-to-electric efficiency reach to 29.36% and 18.49%, while the with thermal integration concept of 28.03% and 15.13%, respectively. The comparison work introduces a promising approach for the efficient utilization of the abundant solar and biomass resources in the western China, and realizes the mitigation of CO2 emission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy efficiency 3afuels 3agasification 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3apower generation 3asolar energy 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature 3aChina 0aSolar energy 0aHybrid system 0aPower generation 0aThermodynamics evaluation1 aBai, Zhang1 aWang, Xiaohe1 aLei, Jing1 aJin, Hongguang0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 122 p.252-262dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.05.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03764naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245007500172300001600247520257200263592002802835650001402863650001302877650001202890650001202902650000902914650002002923650001102943650002002954650001202974650001402986650001203000650001003012700001903022700002103041700002603062700002903088700002103117773011203138856008303250852000903333655001203342IND50060338120221119104606.0141111e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006033812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2012.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Rayess, Youssef10aAnalysis of membrane fouling during cross-flow microfiltration of wine  ap. 398-408.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the individual impact on wine molecules as tannins, pectins and mannoproteins on multichannel ceramic membrane fouling during wine cross-flow microfiltration. The characterization of fouling mechanisms involved in the previous filtrations was realized by using the classical fouling models and the analysis of the total resistance curves. It was shown that the obtained initial fluxes are dependant of the nature of the studied molecules and their concentration. According to their increasing effect on permeate flux decline, the studied wine components could be ranked as: mannoproteins < tannins < pectins. During the filtration of wine added with tannins, it was found that the filtrations were governed by the cake layer formation mechanism. The presence of pectins caused the formation of gel-type layer which is found to be compressible under high pressures. For wines added with mannoprotein filtrations, it was shown that there is a threshold concentration above which a plateau value of permeate flux is obtained. INDUSTRIAL RELEVANCE: The cross-flow microfiltration applied to wine filtration has become a legitimate alternative to conventional filtration processes. However, membrane fouling which affects the operating costs and the plant maintenance, limits the widespread application of this technique. To avoid or reduce membrane fouling, it is extremely important to identify the fouling elements and the mechanisms that govern the process. A better understanding of the mechanisms whereby fouling is formed during wine microfiltration may lead to be in position to control fouling or reduce it, to improve cleaning procedures and to adapt the process to the product to be filtered. The results presented in this paper concern the investigation and the understanding of fouling mechanisms by wine colloids (tannins, pectins and mannoproteins). We found that wine colloids had a strong impact on membrane fouling. Independently of their concentrations found in wine, they can be ranked according to their increasing effect on permeate flux as: mannoproteins < tannins < pectins. Such result provides important information and a better vision on the methods which can be used to limit membrane fouling for example the use of pectinolytic enzymes before filtration in order to hydrolyze pectin chains or precipitation of unstable tannins by finning the wine with bentonite. By elucidating fouling mechanisms such as cake layer and gel type layer, we can adapt the hydrodynamic process to control membrane fouling.  aPublisher supplied data 3abentonite 3acolloids 3aenzymes 3afouling 3agels 3amicrofiltration 3amodels 3aoperating costs 3apectins 3apermeates 3atannins 3awines1 aAlbasi, Claire1 aBacchin, Patrice1 aTaillandier, Patricia1 aMietton-Peuchot, Martine1 aDevatine, Audrey0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2012 Oct., v. 16 p.398-408dElsevier Ltdx1466-85647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2012.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010500176300001600281520034300297536022600640592002800866596009800894596003500992596003801027596007201065650001301137650001101150650002601161650003001187650002101217650001001238650001201248651001201260651001201272653002801284653002401312653001701336653001601353700002201369700002101391700002401412700002001436700002001456700002401476773013001500856008501630852000901715655001201724IND60654108020221122012025.0190722e20190902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065410802DNAL7 a10.1080/09583157.2019.16085112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourchier, Robert S.10aEstablishment of Hypena opulenta (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) on Vincetoxicum rossicum in Ontario, Canada  ap. 917-923.  aHypena opulenta, a moth native to Ukraine, was released in 2013–2014 as a biocontrol agent for pale swallow-wort Vincetoxicum rossicum, an invasive vine, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

(J10) (KY608252) with two cultivars of Lolium perenne L. (small & jumbo) and Arabidopsis thaliana L. for total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) degradation, alkane monooxygenase (alkb) gene expression and phytotoxicity analysis. A plant-microbe phytoremediation system was established to investigate the bacteria's ability to colonize the plant body and quantification of alkb gene to help withstand TPH stress in soil as well as in hydroponics. A real-time PCR method was developed to analyze bacterial colonization and survival within the plant body. Analysis revealed that J10 efficiently colonized all the tested plant species and expressed alkb gene under hydrocarbon stress ranging between 3.7 × 102–3.9 × 106 in A. thaliana and L. perenne (small), respectively. The colonization was more pronounced in soil as compared to hydroponic system. J10 inoculation reduced phytotoxicity and suggested that inoculation had a positive effect on plant growth under stress conditions as compared to control. L. perenne (small) showed significant TPH removal efficiency (45.6%) followed by L. perenne jumbo (24.5%) and A. thaliana (6.2%). In hydroponics, L. perenne (small) degraded about 28.2% TPH followed by L. perenne (jumbo) as 24.4%. Potential of the indigenously isolated plant endophytes may be exploited further for phytoremediation efficiency and industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aLolium perenne 3aPseudomonas 3aalkanes 3abacteria 3abacterial colonization 3acultivars 3aendophytes 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahydroponics 3aindustrial applications 3apetroleum 3aphytoremediation 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant growth 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asoil 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aLolium perenne 0aEndophyte 0aPlant growth promotion 0aPseudomonas sp.1 aMukherjee, Maitreyee1 aRashid, Jamshaid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8031-121X1 aKhan, Saud Ahmed1 aAli, Muhammad Arif1 aArshad, Muḥammad,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2343-822X0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 25, v. 671 p.696-704dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.3313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013200165300001600297520177200313592002802085650001902113650001702132650001702149650001602166650002002182650001002202650001102212650001602223650002102239650001302260650001702273650001602290650002902306650001602335653001002351653001002361653001102371653001102382653001102393653000702404653001102411653000802422653000702430653000802437653000802445653000702453653000702460653000702467653000802474653000802482653000902490653001602499653004302515653002002558653002602578653002002604700001702624700001502641700001802656700001802674700001502692773007402707856008202781852000902863655001202872IND60552509620221118012816.0161021e20151210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055250962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Cheng10aFunctional conservation analysis and expression modes of grape anthocyanin synthesis genes responsive to low temperature stress  ap. 168-177.  aIn grape cultivation, low temperature generally increases the expression of genes involved in synthesis of anthocyanin. In this study, multi-type structural analysis of the proteins encoded by five anthocyanin biosynthesis genes VvF3H, VvPAL, VvCHS3, VvCHS2 and VvLDOX, in addition to nine of their homologous genes revealed that proteins in grapevine shared a high similarity with that in kiwi, red orange and some other species in which the biosynthesis of anthocyanin significantly influenced by low temperature as proved by previous studies. Low temperature regulatory elements were also found in the promoter region of the grapevine genes VvCHS2, VvPAL and VvF3H. These findings indicate that the functions of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in grapevine are conservative and might be sensitive to low temperature. In order to identify the specific expression patterns of the five anthocyanin biosynthesis genes and the changes of polyphenols, anthocyanins and flavonoids under low temperature stress. The transcription analysis of the five genes and the content of polyphenols, anthocyanins and flavonoids in grape skins were examined, by using Vitis vinifera L. cv. ‘Yongyou 1’ and ‘Juxing’ berries as experimental material and treated at 4°C and 25°C for 24h, 48h, 72h and 96h. The results showed that low temperature greatly enhanced the expression of the five anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. Low temperature greatly slowed down the decomposition of polyphenol, anthocyanin, and flavonoid in grape skins. Our study also found that cv. ‘Juxing’ responded more sensitively to low temperature than cv. ‘Yongyou 1’. All the findings would provide a basis for further study on the mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis under environmental stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3acold stress 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrapes 3apolyphenols 3apromoter regions 3aproteins 3asmall fruits 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviticulture 0aVvF3H 0aVvPAL 0aVvCHS3 0aVvCHS2 0aVvLDOX 0aRH 0aRT-PCR 0aSSC 0aTA 0aHY5 0aHYH 0aTP 0aTF 0aCA 0aCor 0aMYB 0abHLH 0aAnthocyanin 0aVitis vinifera L. cv.

Despite their mobile strategy, the Early Epipaleolithic inhabitants clearly preferred particular locations on the landscape and reoccupied them repeatedly over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3afauna 3ahighlands 3ahuman settlements 3ahumans 3ahunters 3alandscapes 3amortality 3atortoises 3aungulates 3aJordan 0aZooarchaeology 0aBehavioral ecology 0aMobility 0aSite occupation intensity 0aFauna1 aKennerty, Michael1 aMeier, Jacqueline S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2003-94821 aSamei, Siavash1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5664-12351 aal-Nahar, Maysoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1852-32591 aOlszewski, Deborah I.0 tQuaternary international.g2016 Mar. 07, v. 396 p.31-39dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.05.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015000170300001600320520213500336592002802471650001302499650001102512650001302523650002302536653002002559653002402579653002202603653001402625653001502639653002102654700002402675773010802699856008502807852000902892655001202901IND60567329620221119172838.0180904e20160307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056732962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadowaki, Seiji10aNew Epipalaeolithic assemblages from the middle Euphrates and the implications for technological and settlement trends in the northeastern Levant  ap. 121-137.  aThis paper concerns diachronic trends in human technological behaviors and settlements during the Early and Middle Epipalaeolithic periods in the northeastern Levant. The paper reconsiders a conventional view that links an increase in Epipalaeolithic settlements in the northeastern Levant to the archaeological entity called “Geometric Kebaran”. We re-examine the variability of the “Geometric Kebaran” assemblages in the northeastern Levant by adding two new microlithic assemblages (Wadi Kharar 16K and 16AT′) from the middle Euphrates region. On the basis of several techno-typological attributes of microliths, we suggest that the two assemblages represent two major techno-typological variants. The first group, including Wadi Kharar 16K, is characterized by large scalene triangles and truncations in association with the microburin technique, while the second group, represented by Wadi Kharar 16AT′, is dominated by trapeze-rectangles.We then discuss technological trends in the northeastern Levant in comparison with those in the southern Levant, where more comparative assemblages and radiocarbon dates are available. We argue that the group dominated by trapeze-rectangles in the northeastern Levant corresponds techno-typologically and chronologically to the Geometric Kebaran in the southern Levant. It is more difficult to specify which industry in the southern Levant is most similar to the group with scalene triangles and truncations in the northeastern Levant, but the latter group shows several techno-typological features that occur in the Early Epipalaeolithic in the southern Levant.Based on these chrono-cultural correlations between the northeastern and southern Levant, we suggest that Epipalaeolithic settlements started to increase in the northeastern Levant earlier than traditionally thought, i.e., before the appearance of the Geometric Kebaran. The proposed revision of the timing for the settlement intensification in the northeastern Levant significantly leads to a certain degree of parallel with a recent model of settlement dynamics in the southeastern Levant near the Azraq Basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3ahumans 3aindustry 3aradiocarbon dating 0aEpipalaeolithic 0aNortheastern Levant 0aLithic technology 0aMicrolith 0aSettlement 0aMiddle Euphrates1 aNishiaki, Yoshihiro0 tQuaternary international.g2016 Mar. 07, v. 396 p.121-137dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013900160300001800299520182000317592002802137650001502165650001302180650001402193650001102207650001202218650001602230650001202246650003202258650001102290650001802301651001502319700001602334773014002350856004802490852000902538655001202547IND50070392520221119115307.0140221e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007039252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-014-3095-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lu10aSpatiotemporal distribution of protozooplankton and copepod nauplii in relation to the occurrence of giant jellyfish in the Yellow Sea  ap. 1226-1240.  aThe occurrence of the giant jellyfish, Nemopilema nomurai, has been a frequent phenomenon in the Yellow Sea. However, the relationship between the giant jellyfish and protozoa, in particular ciliates, remains largely unknown. We investigated the distribution of nanoflagellates, ciliates, Noctiluca scintillans, and copepod nauplii along the transect 33°N in the Yellow Sea in June and August, 2012, during an occurrence of the giant jellyfish, and in October of that year when the jellyfish was absent. The organisms studied were mainly concentrated in the surface waters in summer, while in autumn they were evenly distributed in the water column. Nanoflagellate, ciliate, and copepod nauplii biomasses increased from early June to August along with jellyfish growth, the first two decreased in October, while N. scintillans biomass peaked in early June to 3 571 μg C/L and decreased in August and October. In summer, ciliate biomass greatly exceeded that of copepod nauplii (4.61–15.04 μg C/L vs. 0.34–0.89 μg C/L). Ciliate production was even more important than biomass, ranging from 6.59 to 34.19 μg C/(L·d) in summer. Our data suggest a tight and positive association among the nano-, micro-, and meso-zooplankton in the study area. Statistical analysis revealed that the abundance and total production of ciliate as well as loricate ciliate biomass were positively correlated with giant jellyfish biomass, indicating a possible predator-prey relationship between ciliates and giant jellyfish. This is in contrast to a previous study, which reported a significant reduction in ciliate standing crops due to the mass occurrence of N. nomurai in summer. Our study indicates that, with its high biomass and, in particular, high production ciliates might support the mass occurrence of giant jellyfish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiliophora 3aCopepoda 3aScyphozoa 3aautumn 3abiomass 3acorrelation 3anauplii 3apredator-prey relationships 3asummer 3asurface water 3aYellow Sea1 aXu, Kuidong0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2013 Nov., v. 31, no. 6 p.1226-1240dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:J000001677x0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-014-3095-5  aDNAL 7aarticle01518naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012800161300001600289520052800305592002800833650001400861650002300875650002300898650001300921650002200934700002100956700002000977700002000997773010301017856007501120852000901195655001201204IND60578817220221120212113.0170814e20140207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057881722DNAL7 a10.1021/ol403545b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakaguchi, Yusuke10aAsymmetric Conjugate Hydrocyanation of α,β-Unsaturated N-Acylpyrroles with the Ru(phgly)2(binap)–CH3OLi Catalyst System  ap. 808-811.  aAsymmetric conjugate hydrocyanation of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid derivatives catalyzed by a Ru[(S)-phgly]₂[(S)-binap]–CH₃OLi system was examined.

This mechanism has recently been exemplified by the discovery of new pathogenic viruses, such as the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, Middle-East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus epidemic in Saudi Arabia, and the deadly outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. The. SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), which is having a massive global impact in terms of economic disruption, and, above all, human health. The disease is characterized by dry cough, fever, fatigue, myalgia, and dyspnea. Other symptoms include headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, and gastrointestinal disorders. Pneumonia appears to be the most common and severe manifestation of the infection. Currently, there is no vaccine or specific drug for COVID-19. Further, the development of new antiviral requires a considerable length of time and effort for drug design and validation. Therefore, repurposing the use of natural compounds can provide alternatives and can support therapy against COVID-19. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the prophylactic and supportive therapeutic role of probiotics for the management of COVID-19. In addition, the unique role of probiotics to modulate the gut microbe and assert gut homeostasis and production of interferon as an antiviral mechanism is described. Further, the regulatory role of probiotics on gut-lung axis and mucosal immune system for the potential antiviral mechanisms is reviewed and discussed.Key points• Gut microbiota role in antiviral diseases• Factors influencing the antiviral mechanism• Probiotics and Covid-19  aPublisher supplied data  aEMR-2019cCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research, India 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3abiotechnology 3acough 3adrug design 3adyspnea 3afever 3agastrointestinal system 3aheadache 3ahomeostasis 3ahuman health 3aimmune system 3ainterferons 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amucosal immunity 3apandemic 3apathogenicity 3apharyngitis 3apneumonia 3aprobiotics 3atherapeutics 3avaccines 3aMiddle East 3aSaudi Arabia 3aWestern Africa1 aRay, Mousumi1 aRavindra, P.

Air or oxygen bleeding are the most common, cost-effective and easy-to-implement methods of mitigation for such conditions. In the present work, important restrictions of oxygen bleeding and disadvantages of continuous constant O2 bleeding are introduced. In order to simulating the problem, a mathematical model containing reaction kinetics, governing equations, boundary conditions and constitutive relations are presented and according to these, a comprehensive OpenFOAM transient multicomponent solver having the capability of simulating anode side of PEM fuel cell is developed, introduced and validated with existing experimental data. In addition, three novel methods of oxygen bleeding: namely pulsating, exponential and sinusoidal methods are introduced which are practical for both open-end and dead-end fuel cells. A quantitative criterion, Oxygen Bleeding Method Effectiveness (OBME), is also introduced to attain comparability of novel methods with continuous constant O2 bleeding as common method. Results showed up to more than 5% increase in recovery ratio accompanied with up to 63% save in oxygen consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aequations 3afuel cells 3afuels 3ahemorrhage 3amathematical models 3amethane 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3apolymers 3areaction kinetics 3asteam 0aPolymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) 0aOxygen bleeding 0aO2 bleeding 0aNovel technique 0aPulsating 0aOpenFOAM1 aRamiar, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0777-27781 aRanjbar, A.A.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 122 p.564-579dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.05.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008700174520161200261592002801873650003001901650001801931650001701949650002401966650002001990650001702010650002202027650001202049651001102061653002402072653002202096653003402118653000902152653001102161700002002172700002802192700001802220700002402238773010902262856008502371852000902456655001202465IND60768820720221119062710.0220509e20220515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076882072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1190422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamsipour, Mansour10aBurden of diseases attributed to traffic noise in the metropolis of Tehran in 2017  aAlthough road traffic noise is the most important source of environmental noise emission in large cities, little is known about health burden. The present study was conducted to estimate the burden of diseases attributed to traffic noise in the metropolis of Tehran in 2017. Using noise maps provided by the municipality of Tehran, we calculated population exposure distribution in term of Ldₙ and Lₙᵢgₕₜ and the number of DALYs lost due to ischemic heart disease, hypertension, high sleep disturbance, annoyance and stroke endpoints based on the World Health Organization Environmental Noise Guidelines for the European Region. We applied published dose-response functions to estimate the traffic noise burden for high sleep disturbance and annoyance. We estimated 61,284 DALYs or 697 DALYs per 100,000 population attributed to traffic noise in Tehran for the reference year 2017. Highly sleep disturbance with a share of 58.74% of the DALYs was recognized as the most important contributor of disease burden, and noise annoyance with a share of 23.12% was ranked next. Ischemic heart disease (11.71%), stroke (5.12%), and hypertension (1.31%) were ranked third to fourth, respectively, in terms of the burden of disease caused by environmental noise. A considerable fraction of the population of Tehran lives in areas with an environmental noise higher than the standard level. The findings showed that traffic noise pollution is an important environmental risk factor in Tehran imposes the greatest burden on the community, mainly through highly sleep disturbance and noise annoyance endpoints.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3adose response 3ahypertension 3amyocardial ischemia 3anoise pollution 3arisk factors 3asleep deprivation 3atraffic 3aEurope 0aEnvironmental noise 0aBurden of disease 0aDisability-adjusted life year 0aDALY 0aTehran1 aZaredar, Narges1 aMonazzam, Mohammad Reza1 aNamvar, Zahra1 aMohammadpour, Saman0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 May 15, v. 301 p.119042-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1190423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245015700213300001600370506007600386520132300462592002801785506003701813650001701850650001801867650002901885650002301914650002601937650002901963650001501992650001102007650001302018650001102031650001502042650001202057650001802069651001802087653001002105653002502115653002302140653002902163700002002192700002502212700002402237700001802261773010002279856008602379852000902465655001202474IND60582624820221207132327.0200517e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058262482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.08.0472doi7 aPMC66051022pmcid7 a312750642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, David M.10aDeveloping qualitative ecosystem service relationships with the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework: A case study on Cape Cod, Massachusetts  ap. 404-415.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnderstanding the effects of environmental management strategies on society and the environment is critical for evaluating their effectiveness but is often impeded by limited data availability. In this article, we present a method that can help scientists to support environmental managers’ thinking about causal effects on ecosystem services in coupled human and natural systems. Our method aims to model qualitative cause-effect relationships between management strategies and ecosystem services, using information provided by knowledgeable participants, and the tradeoffs between strategies. We select and organize management strategies, environmental variables, and ecosystem services as indicators using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework. We evaluate the relationship between indicators using a decision tree and numerical representations of interaction strength. We use a matrix multiplication procedure to model direct and indirect interaction effects, and we provide guidelines for combining effects. Results include several data tables from which information can be visualized to understand the plausible interaction effects of implementing management strategies on ecosystem services. We illustrate our method with a coastal water quality management case study on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acase studies 3acoastal water 3adecision support systems 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental management 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3amanagers 3amodels 3ascientists 3asociety 3awater quality 3aMassachusetts 0aDPSIR 0aInteraction strength 0aQualitative models 0aWater quality management1 aPiscopo, Amy N.1 aChintala, Marnita M.1 aGleason, Timothy R.1 aBerry, Walter0 tEcological indicators.g2018 Jan., v. 84 p.404-415dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.08.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04007naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245019100164300001600355520232600371592002802697650001502725650001802740650000902758650001302767650002802780650002202808650001502830650001202845650001302857650000902870650001502879650001202894650001202906650001402918650001502932650001102947650002302958650001702981650001502998650001103013650001403024650001503038651002603053651001403079700001403093700001903107700001603126700001303142700002603155700002303181700002303204773010003227856008103327852000903408655001203417IND50070398520221119115354.0150210e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007039852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10933-013-9735-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorrocks, M.10aPollen, phytoliths, arthropods and high-resolution 14C sampling from Rano Kau, Easter Island: evidence for late Quaternary environments, ant (Formicidae) distributions and human activity  ap. 417-432.  aA 20-m sediment core from Rano Kau, Easter Island provides plant microfossil, arthropod fossil and high-resolution¹⁴C sampling evidence for late Quaternary environments, ant (Formicidae) distributions and human activity. The record commences prior to or during the LGM, providing the two oldest dates for Rano Kau thus far, 20,340 ± 160 and 34,260 ± 440 BP. The vegetation at the time was mostly Arecaceae (palm)-dominated grassland-woodland, suggesting cooler/drier conditions than present. Near the start of the Holocene c. 12,500 cal BP, climate alleviation is indicated by Asteraceae shrubland increasing at the expense of grassland. There is an early to mid-Holocene sediment hiatus. The record recommences c. 3,500 cal BP, with in-washed clayey soils bearing charcoal and phytoliths of Polynesian-introduced Musa (banana) and mixed with wetland detritus, reflecting slumping as a result of forest clearance and gardening. Dates of material of other plants from the clay/detritus layers containing the Musa phytoliths are older than expected, within the range 3,680–2,750 cal BP, well before settlement of Eastern Polynesia. This could reflect horticultural material settling in an older part of the sediment column or age increase by reservoir effects. A long section of overlying unconsolidated detritus provides a progressively younger upward sequence from 2,840–2,870 to 930–810 cal BP, but dates are variable after 1,290–1,180 cal BP, where charcoal, disturbance-related pollen and older than expected ant exoskeletons demonstrate the inclusion of pre-aged material from the floating vegetation mat or upslope erosion in the sediment column. Arecaceae pollen declines sharply after 930–810 cal BP. Arthropod analysis reveals two new weevil species for Easter Island, and two ant taxa, Tetramorium bicarinatum and Pheidole sp., the latter of which is also new for the island. Three of the four age determinations on ant remains suggest that ants were present prior to c. 2,500 cal BP, and probably associated with the period following the resumption of sediment accumulation c. 3,500 cal BP. Unless the apparent ant¹⁴C ages have been increased by reservoir effects, these results question the long-accepted assumption that all Eastern Polynesia’s ant species have been introduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3aCurculionidae 3aMusa 3aPheidole 3aTetramorium bicarinatum 3aage determination 3aarthropods 3abananas 3acharcoal 3aclay 3aclay soils 3aclimate 3aforests 3agardening 3agrasslands 3ahumans 3aintroduced species 3amicrofossils 3aphytoliths 3apollen 3asediments 3ashrublands 3aPacific Ocean Islands 3aPolynesia1 aMarra, M.1 aBaisden, W.

Structural elucidation results indicated that Lactarius deliciosus Gray polysaccharide (LDG-B) had a backbone of (1,6)-linked d-galactose and (1, 2, 6)-linked d-galactose which branches were mainly composed of 4-linked d-glucose and 6-linked d-galactose residue. Cell cycle test results showed that LDG-B could promote the proliferation of B cells and macrophage cells by affecting G0/G1 phase, S phases and G2/M phases. The analysis of transcriptomes sequence of macrophages showed a total of 1839 genes were identified as DEGs, and approximately 708 genes were up-regulated, whereas 1131 genes were down-regulated in LDG-B group. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the MAPK, JAK-STAT and NF-κB signaling pathways are significantly enriched for DEGs in LDG-B group. Analysis of transcriptome resources enabled us to examine gene expression profiles, verify differential gene expression, and select candidate signaling pathways as the mechanisms of the immunomodulatory activity of LDG-B.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactarius deliciosus 3afruiting bodies 3agalactose 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglucose 3aimmunomodulation 3ainterphase 3amacrophages 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amolecular weight 3apolysaccharides 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0aPolysaccharide 0aStructure 0aMacrophage 0aImmunomodulatory activity 0aRNA-seq1 aLiu, Lu1 aDing, Xiang1 aZhao, Daqun1 aHou, Wanru0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Nov. 05, v. 152 p.648-657dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.07.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04499naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135024004500173040001800218100002300236245013100259300001600390506007600406506003100482520242500513592002802938596008302966596006803049596001203117596003303129506003703162650001103199650002603210650000903236650001903245650001103264650001303275650001603288650001503304650001503319650000803334650001003342650001203352650001403364650001303378650002303391650001103414650000903425650000903434650003003443650003003473650001703503651001503520653001103535653000903546653001503555653001703570653001103587653001703598700002303615773009303638856008503731852000903816655001203825IND60567329920221207111106.0170711e20151111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056732992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.07.0012chorus7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.07.0012doi7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.07.0012chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlunt, Ashleigh B.10aLake levels for the past 19,000 years from the TL05-4 cores, Tulare Lake, California, USA: Geophysical and geochemical proxies  ap. 122-130.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aGeochemical and geophysical proxy data from the TL05-4 lake-plain cores of Tulare Lake, California, are reported on here representing most of the past 19,000 years. The new record consists of carbon/nitrogen ratios, total organic carbon (TOC), nitrogen (N), total inorganic carbon (TIC), grain size, and magnetic susceptibility analyses from samples taken at 1-cm intervals (∼45 yr/sample). Age control is provided by 22 radiocarbon dates. The first part of the record (∼19.0–14.5 cal ka BP) consists of elevated sand and silt percentages and higher sedimentation rates interpreted as elevated runoff associated with melting of the Tioga-age Sierra Nevada ice cap. The TIC was undetectable and TOC and N were low suggesting low productivity in a relatively sterile, freshwater lake. From 14.5 to 10.3 cal ka BP, the deposits consisted of 50% clay and 50% silt with TIC and TOC extremely low, which is consistent with a stable, low productivity lake. From 10.3 to 7.5 cal ka BP, an initial pulse of fining upward sand gave way to increased clay deposition that suggests a lake transgression to a stable highstand, coeval with the deep water event found in previously published records of Tulare Lake and other lakes from central and southern California, including Owens Lake and Lake Elsinore. A few-hundred-year duration spikes in TIC centered at 8.0 cal ka BP is suggestive of evaporating lake conditions toward the end of this early Holocene highstand. Tulare Lake dropped quickly to a relative low at 7.5 cal ka BP, but then lake level increased steadily until 3.0 cal ka BP. High amplitude fluctuation in almost all proxies occurs from 2.5 to 1.8 cal ka BP at the end of the record, suggesting that this time interval was characterized by rapid fluctuations in lake level. Tulare Lake levels during the Holocene vary in conjunction with sea surface temperature (SST) records from the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1017 located off the coast of central California, which suggests that variations in SSTs throughout the Holocene drove changes in precipitation in the Sierra Nevada and hence, Tulare Lake level. Since historic lake-level histories have been shown to be directly related to stream discharge from the Sierra Nevada, this observation will be integral in forecasting future decadal-scale changes in southern San Joaquin Valley water supply due to anticipated climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006435  cChevron  cU.S. Department of Education0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aclay 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3adrilling 3aevaporation 3afreshwater 3ageophysics 3aice 3alakes 3amelting 3amountains 3anitrogen 3aradiocarbon dating 3arunoff 3asand 3asilt 3asurface water temperature 3atransgressive segregation 3awater supply 3aCalifornia 0aTulare 0aLake 0aCalifornia 0aGranulometry 0aSierra 0aPaleoclimate1 aNegrini, Robert M.0 tQuaternary International.g2015 Nov. 11, v. 387 p.122-130dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100004800139245013200187300001600319500002000335520136600355592002801721596008901749596006801838650002501906650001801931650001201949650002001961650002301981650001202004650001602016650001802032650001602050700004702066700006202113700003402175700004302209700003802252700004002290700002402330700002602354773013102380856007402511852000902585655001202594IND60778444020221122122111.0220527e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077844402DNAL7 a10.1111/jai.143032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Fátima de Cássia Evangelista10aPowdered coconut water with cryoprotectant can be used for cooling and future freezing of Tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) sperm  ap. 275-284.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe study aims to evaluate the main parameters of extended sperm in a solution of powdered coconut water (ACPᵀᴹ‐104) or glucose, both added or not with cryoprotectants during the following periods of cooling or equilibration time: 0 (time of the dilution), 3, 24, 48, and 72 h. The sperm was maintained at 4°C (cooling temperature) as: un‐extended (control) and in six different equilibration media combining two extenders (ACP‐104 or Glucose) and two cryoprotectants (methyl glycol or dimethylsulfoxide). After being extended and maintained in different equilibration times, sperm was evaluated for kinetic and morphology parameters. At 0 h, best motility results were found when the sperm was not extended; however, after 48‐h of equilibration, the sperm extended in ACPᵀᴹ‐104 (38.24%) showed better motility results than the fresh sperm (24.30%; p < .05). The un‐extended, after 72 h of cooling, presented lower motility rate and increased sperm abnormality percentages when compared to the one extended in ACPᵀᴹ‐104 (with or without the addition of cryoprotectants). Thus, tambaqui sperm extended in powdered coconut water can be cooled (4°C) up to 72 h. This study also analyzed tambaqui sperm quality during 72 h of exposure to cryoprotectants, providing data for possible extension of equilibration time when necessary.  aPublisher supplied data  cFUNCAP ‐ Fundação Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnológico  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aColossoma macropomum 3acoconut water 3acooling 3acryoprotectants 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aglucose 3aichthyology 3asperm quality 3atemperature1 aSalmito‐Vanderley, Carminda Sandra Brito1 aTorres, Thais Maia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7286-17881 aLeite‐Castro, Liliane Veras1 aSalgueiro, Cristiane Clemente de Mello1 aLinhares, Francisco Renan Aragão1 ade Carvalho, Maria Audália Marques1 aSales, Yara Silvino1 aNunes, José Ferreira0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2022 May, v. 38, no. 3 p.275-284dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3869522x0175-86597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.143033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03448naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245017600154300002000330520142300350592002801773650004401801650002201845650003701867650001501904650001501919650002201934650001301956650002001969650003101989650001502020650002602035650001902061650002102080650001902101650002002120650002302140650001402163650001902177650001102196650001802207650000702225650003302232650003502265650002302300650001802323650001602341650001602357650001902373650001902392700001702411700001802428700001702446700002102463700001902484700001802503700001902521700001502540700001202555773012402567856007402691852000902765655001202774IND60640317720221120205907.0190504e20160216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064031772DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra27657h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Wei10aDecontamination of methylene blue from aqueous solution by magnetic chitosan lignosulfonate grafted with graphene oxide: effects of environmental conditions and surfactant  ap. 19298-19307.  aIn this study, magnetic chitosan lignosulfonate grafted with graphene oxide (MCLS/GO) as an innovative adsorbent was prepared successfully through a hydrothermal reaction. The adsorbent was also characterized using SEM, XRD, VSM, FTIR, XPS, and zeta-potential. The effects of pH, ionic strength, temperature and SDBS (sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate) on the adsorption behavior of MB (methylene blue) by the MCLS/GO were investigated. The results indicate that MB removal is found to be more effective at a higher pH value and temperature. The adsorption process could be affected by ionic strength, particularly at a higher concentration. Isotherm and kinetics were well-fitted by a Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order model, respectively. In addition, the presence of SDBS had a positive effect on MB adsorption onto MCLS/GO. An intra-particle diffusion model indicates that both film diffusion and intra-particle diffusion were the rate-controlling processes. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the adsorption reaction was an endothermic and spontaneous process. The adsorption mechanism was proposed to be electrostatic attraction, π–π stacking interaction and hydrogen bonding via FTIR analysis. In conclusion, this study implies that MCLS/GO nanoparticles could be conveniently separated from a water body by an external magnet and utilized as an efficient adsorbent for environment purification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3achitosan 3adecontamination 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aendothermy 3aenvironmental factors 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen bonding 3aionic strength 3alignosulfonates 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate 3asorption isotherms 3asurface water 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3azeta potential1 aLiu, Yun-guo1 aHu, Xin-jiang1 aLiu, Shao-bo1 aZeng, Guang-ming1 aZheng, Bo-hong1 aJiang, Lu-hua1 aGuo, Fang-ying1 aDing, Yang1 aXu, Yan0 tRSC advances.g2016 Feb. 16, v. 6, no. 23 p.19298-19307dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra27657h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245012000155520131000275592002801585650001301613650002701626650002101653650002301674650001501697650002501712650002201737650001501759650002101774650001301795650003301808650001701841650001501858650001501873651001701888700001501905700001301920700001601933700001801949773011901967856007702086852000902163655001202172IND60754277120221121232526.0211023e20211013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075427712DNAL7 a10.3390/land101010802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Bo 10aLand Use and Land Cover Change in the Yellow River Basin from 1980 to 2015 and Its Impact on the Ecosystem Services  aLand use and land cover change is an important driving force for changes in ecosystem services. We defined several important human-induced land cover change processes such as Ecological Restoration Project, Cropland Expansion, Land Degradation, and Urbanization by the land use/land cover transition matrix method. We studied human-induced land cover changes in the Yellow River Basin from 1980 to 2015 and evaluated its impact on ecosystem service values by the benefit transfer method and elasticity coefficient. The results show that the cumulative area of human-induced land cover change reaches 65.71 million ha from 1980 to 2015, which is close to the total area of the Yellow River Basin. Before 2000, Ecological Restoration Project was the most important human-induced land cover change process. However, due to the large amount of cropland expansion and land degradation, the area of natural vegetation was reduced and the ecosystem value declined. Since 2000, due to the implementation of the “Grain for Green” program, the natural vegetation of upstream area and midstream area of Yellow River Basin has been significantly improved. This implies that under an appropriate policy framework, a small amount of human-induced land cover change can also improve ecosystem services significantly.  aPublisher supplied data 3acropland 3aecological restoration 3aecological value 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3aland degradation 3aland use 3aland use and land cover maps 3aurbanization 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aYellow River1 aPan, Libo 1 aQi, Yue 1 aGuan, Xiao 1 aLi, Junsheng 0 tLand.g2021 Oct. 13, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land101010803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01704naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013700168300001600305520063700321592002800958650001900986650002001005650001901025650001201044650002201056653000901078653002401087653001301111653000801124700001501132700001501147773009901162856008401261852000901345655001201354IND60609695120221123025824.0180823e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060969512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2017.07.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hongpeng10aSimulation of gas–solid flow characteristics in a circulating fluidized bed based on a computational particle fluid dynamics model  ap. 132-142.  aA computational particle fluid dynamics model of a pilot scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB) was used to numerically simulate its gas–solid flow characteristics.

In Exp. 2, seed from 88 cotton breeding lines was obtained from a public cotton breeding program and analyzed for CP, undegradable intake protein (UIP), degradable intake protein (DIP), gossypol concentrations, and seed size. In situ DM disappearance was greatest (P < 0.001) for NN after 48 h, and N/B was greater (P < 0.05) than BB. Cottonseed that was not burned had a greater (P = 0.01) amount of N degradable at a definable rate (B fraction) than BB, and the undegradable fraction (C fraction) tended to be less (P = 0.06) for NN than BB and N/B. Cotton breeding lines had a mean CP value similar to those reported by the NASEM (2016), whereas DIP, UIP, and gossypol values had greater variability than CP in the present study. Correlations between seed size and protein were low, but there was a positive correlation with free gossypol. Heat-damaged WCS has decreased DM disappearance and N disappearance. Characterization of DIP, UIP, and gossypol in cottonseed may provide baseline selection criteria for cotton breeding programs, as well as aid in ration formulation strategies. Measuring WCS quality can help cotton breeders, animal scientists, and livestock producers develop seed value and feed recommendations for use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abeef cattle 3acotton 3acottonseed 3adigestibility 3agossypol 3aheat 3aseed size 0awhole cottonseed 0adegradable intake protein 0aundegradable intake protein 0aoverheating1 aDavis, D.B.1 aMullenix, M.K.1 aKoebernick, J.C.1 aJustice, S.M.1 aDillard, S.L.1 aMuntifering, R.B.1 aStewart, R.L.0 tApplied animal science.g2022 Oct., v. 38, no. 5 p.409-416dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27212x2590-28657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.15232/aas.2022-02304  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006300149245008700212300001200299500001500311520086900326592002801195650002601223650001101249650001101260650001301271650002901284653000901313653002901322653002001351653003001371700002001401700002801421773009701449856008301546852000901629655001201638IND60532082620221119225810.0170626e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053208262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2016.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadsen, Claus Krogh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8921-392014aThe PARS sequence increase the efficiency of stable Pichia pastoris transformation  ap. 1-7.  a2019-12-06  aThe methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is a popular host for recombinant expression of proteins.Plasmids containing the Pichia autonomously replicating sequence (PARS) transform P. pastoris with higher efficiency than linear DNA equipped with termini designed for homologous recombination. Moreover, PARS containing constructs provide higher protein yields. Unfortunately, these autonomous plasmids are inherently unstable and the preferred method of P. pastoris transformation is therefore stable integration in the genome by homologous recombination. In the present study we report that a novel combination of PARS and linearization of plasmids for P. pastoris transformation serves to significantly increase the transformation efficiency. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the constructs do not re-circularize but integrate stably into the P. pastoris genome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKomagataella pastoris 3agenome 3ayeasts 3aplasmids 3ahomologous recombination 0aPARS 0aHomologous recombination 0aPichia pastoris 0aTransformation efficiency1 aVismans, Gilles1 aBrinch-Pedersen, Henrik0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2016 Oct., v. 129 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2016.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02163naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245017500153300001800328520095600346592002801302650002301330650001501353650002001368650002101388650001301409650001601422700001301438700001601451700001601467700001301483700001901496700001501515700001901530700001601549773012901565856007401694852000901768655001201777IND60676343720221120051305.0191115e20191114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067634372DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ay02069a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zilu12aA novel ratiometric fluorescent probe for highly sensitive and selective detection of peroxynitrite and its application for tracing endogenous peroxynitrite in live cells  ap. 5699-5703.  aPeroxynitrite (ONOO⁻) is a reactive and short-lived biological oxidant endogenously generated in biosystems, and its excessive production is related to various diseases. However, the functional mechanisms of ONOO⁻ are not fully understood. Here, we present a novel ratiometric fluorescent probe CPD-ratio for the accurate detection of ONOO⁻ under single wavelength excitation. This study showed that the probe CPD-ratio can achieve the ratiometric detection of ONOO⁻ with rapid response, and it possessed excellent selectivity and sensitivity (detection limit was calculated to be 47 nM). These properties and its non-toxicity demonstrated that probe CPD-ratio could be potentially employed to accurately monitor ONOO⁻ levels in biological systems. We have thoroughly demonstrated the utility of the probe CPD-ratio for ratiometric bioimaging, because it has been effectively used to trace the exogenous and endogenous ONOO⁻ in live cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abioimaging 3adetection limit 3afluorescent dyes 3aoxidants 3awavelengths1 aYu, Chen1 aChen, Yanan1 aLiu, Caiyun1 aJia, Pan1 aZhu, Hanchuang1 aZhang, Xue1 aSheng, Wenlong1 aZhu, Baocun0 tAnalytical methods.g2019 Nov. 14, v. 11, no. 44 p.5699-5703dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ay02069a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010300168300001600271520171900287592002802006650001502034650001702049650001402066650001002080650001002090650001302100650001202113650001302125650002302138650001602161650001502177650002502192650002502217650002002242650001602262650001402278651002202292653002402314653001502338653001502353653003402368653001702402653002102419653003102440653003202471773011202503856008502615852000902700655001202709IND60612437120221119181654.0180905e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061243712DNAL7 a10.1080/00049158.2018.15096832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavey, S. M.10aReporting Australia’s forest biodiversity I: forest-dwelling and forest-dependent native species  ap. 196-209.  aSpecies-level indicators based on the Montreal Process criteria and indicators framework are used to report Australia’s progress towards sustainable forest management, in national and international reporting of Australia’s forest biodiversity status and trends. This paper reviews the historical development of these indicators and related databases. A recent major development has been the establishment of a comprehensive suite of national inventory databases on Australia’s native forest-dwelling vertebrate fauna and vascular flora for reporting in the Australia’s State of the Forests Report series. Although these databases are incomplete, nearly 17 000 species records of vascular plants and over 2000 vertebrate species records have been assembled. Of the 2212 records of forest-dwelling vertebrate species, half (1101 species) are forest-dependent species that require a forest habitat for at least part of their lifecycle. Based on the frequency of habitat-use records, eucalypt open forest and eucalypt woodland forest are the most important habitat types for both forest-dwelling and forest-dependent vertebrate species. Monitoring of species varies nationally and across states and territories, with the most comprehensive approach undertaken in south-west Western Australia. Improved application of these databases to the reporting of species indicators will require improved collection of species records, inclusion of habitat data in records, and analysis of these records as time series with changing forest cover and condition. These databases also have application for informing forest-related indicators for the 2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3abiodiversity 3adatabases 3afauna 3aflora 3aforestry 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3ainventories 3amonitoring 3asustainable forestry 3atime series analysis 3avascular plants 3avertebrates 3awoodlands 3aWestern Australia 0aforest biodiversity 0amonitoring 0aindicators 0asustainable forest management 0aconservation 0aMontreal Process 0aAichi Biodiversity Targets 0aState of the Forests Report0 tAustralian forestry.g2018 July 3, v. 81, no. 3 p.196-209dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11662x2325-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00049158.2018.15096833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01953naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245007300170300002000243520086300263592002801126650001101154650003301165650001001198650001501208650002601223650001201249650001301261650001301274650002201287700002101309700002601330700002401356773012101380856008101501852000901582655001201591IND60586451920180323000000.0171213e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058645192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b019852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrade, Laize
A. F.10aInfrared Fingerprints of nN → σ*NH Hyperconjugation in Hydrazides  ap. 12181-12187.  aAn earlier study demonstrated that hyperconjugation operates in hydrazides by analyzing the N–H stretching mode in gas phase infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and then observing two very distinct bands corresponding to isolated isomers experiencing or not the nN → σ*N–H electron delocalization. The present work reports a chemical method to obtain insight on the hyperconjugation in hydrazide derivatives from solution IR spectroscopy. The analogous amides did not show a νN–H red-shifted band, as the electron donor orbital in the above hyperconjugative interaction does not exist. In addition, the effect of electron withdrawing groups bonded to a nitrogen atom, namely the trifluoroacetyl and the methanesulfonyl groups, was analyzed on the conformational isomerism and on the ability to induce a stronger hyperconjugation in the resulting compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamides 3aconformational isomerization 3agases 3ahydrazides 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aisomers 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3aorganic chemistry1 aSilla, Josué M.1 aCormanich, Rodrigo A.1 aFreitas, Matheus P.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 82, no. 23 p.12181-12187dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.7b019853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009200161300001800253520095000271592002801221650002301249650001501272650001901287650002501306650001301331650001501344650001501359650001601374650001901390650001401409650001701423650001401440650001201454650001701466700001601483700001601499700001201515700001301527700001301540700001101553700001601564773012901580856007401709852000901783655001201792IND60676343820221120070447.0191115e20191114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067634382DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ay02090j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Changchong12aA folic acid modified polystyrene nanosphere surface for circulating tumor cell capture  ap. 5718-5723.  aCirculating tumor cells (CTCs) have been considered as a significant biomarker for cancer metastasis and relapse. Effective detection of CTCs will play an important role in early cancer diagnosis, prognosis, progress monitoring, and personalized therapy. In this work, we developed a polystyrene (PS) nanosphere substrate to capture CTCs from whole blood samples. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), as an antifouling molecule, and folic acid, as a recognizing agent, were modified onto the surface of PS nanospheres via self-polymerization of dopamine. 8 HeLa cells could be captured when 10 cells were spiked into 1 mL of the whole blood sample. Then, the captured target cells were further proliferated through an in situ culture strategy on the polystyrene (PS) nanosphere substrate, and nearly 80 HeLa cells were obtained from 1 captured cell after 7 days of in situ culture, revealing the potential application for CTC isolation and proliferation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abiomarkers 3ablood sampling 3abovine serum albumin 3adopamine 3afolic acid 3ametastasis 3ananospheres 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apolystyrenes 3aprognosis 3arelapse 3atherapeutics1 aWang, Zhili1 aZhao, Yuewu1 aCao, Yi1 aDing, Pi1 aLiu, Hui1 aSu, Na1 aPei, Renjun0 tAnalytical methods.g2019 Nov. 14, v. 11, no. 44 p.5718-5723dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ay02090j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006700152245009800219520086900317592002801186650001501214650001501229650001301244650001801257650002301275650002101298650003201319650001101351653001301362653001901375653000801394653001201402700003201414700002601446700004001472700003601512700003301548700003501581773008801616856008701704852000901791655001201800IND60730153720221118000636.0220103e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073015372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2021.1023542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, Guilherme Guerra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7775-673610aProduction and purification of Clostridium perfringens type D epsilon toxin and IgY antitoxin  aThe aim of this study was to purify Clostridium perfringens type D epsilon toxin and produce and purify anti-epsilon chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY).

Ghrelin is synthesized in the fundus region of the stomach. In the gastrointestinal system, ghrelin affects multiple functions, including secretion of gastric acid, gastric motility, and pancreatic protein output. The study consisted of 49 Holstein male calves (23 ± 5 days old, 50 ± 5 kg). Control and experimental groups were differentiated only with the additive amount added to the morning food source. Three prebiotic groups were fed Jerusalem artichoke flour (inulin content increased by 50%) in three amounts: 6 g (lowest) PreG₆, 12 g (medium) PreG₁₂, and 24 g (highest) PreG₂₄. Three synbiotic groups were added 0.25 g of prebiotic Enterococcus faecium (2∗109 CFU/g) to the respective prebiotic, obtaining a new synbiotic (SynG₆, SynG₁₂, and SynG₂₄). Calves were slaughtered after 56 days to obtain abomasum samples for ghrelin IR cell examination, and carcass weight was determined. It shows that ghrelin IR cell count in the abomasum was (p<0.05) reduced in 6g and 12g inulin dosage, but carcass weight was significantly (p<0.05) higher for PreG₁₂ and PreG₂₄ (p<0.05) and then for CoG (CoG 42.6 kg; PreG₁₂ 51.4 kg; and PreG₂₄ 54.0 kg) and (p<0.05) for SynG₁₂ and SynG₂₄ (SynG₁₂ 52.3 kg and SynG₂₄ 49.6 kg), which indicates longer satiety and more wholesome breakdown of the food uptake. It was concluded that ghrelin IR cells in 12-week-old calves are more abundant in the fundus region. Medium- and high-dosage prebiotic inulin feeding to the calves improves overall food digestion, allowing for longer satiety and higher cold carcass weight without increasing food amount. Adding synbiotic 0.25 g Enterococcus faecium (2∗10⁹ CFU/g (Protexin, UK)) to inulin (produced in Latvia LTD „Herbe”) does not improve the results of this prebiotic.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Research Program, Agricultural Resources for Sustainable Production of Qualitative and Healthy Foods in Latvia 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aHolstein 3aJerusalem artichokes 3aabomasum 3acarcass weight 3acold 3adigestion 3aflour 3agastric acid 3agastrointestinal motility 3aghrelin 3ainulin 3amales 3aprebiotics 3asatiety 3asecretion 3aveterinary medicine 3aLatvia1 aIlgaza, Aija1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7126-878X1 aKalnina, Liga Astra0 tVeterinary medicine international.g2021 Sept. 21, v. 2021dHindawiwJournal:21537x2042-00487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/55423723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245018600171300001600357520157100373536019401944592002802138650002102166650002002187650002402207650001302231650001202244650001202256650001202268650002202280650002202302650001002324650001202334650002302346650001902369650002002388650002002408650001902428650002202447650002302469650002202492650000902514650001702523653001002540653001602550653001502566653001402581653001302595700002302608700003402631700003202665700002702697700001902724700002202743773010602765856008002871852000902951655001202960IND60624075120221117224306.0181130e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062407512DNAL7 a10.1177/02601060177374652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, Alan Lins10aDifferent protein and derivatives supplementation strategies combined with resistance training in pre-frail and frail elderly: Rationale and protocol for the “Pro-Elderly” Study  ap. 251-260.  aFrailty is a multifactorial geriatric syndrome characterized by progressive decline in health and associated with decreased muscle mass, strength, and functional capacity. Resistance training (RT) combined with protein or amino acids supplementation has been shown to be promising for mitigating age-related impairments. To investigate the chronic effects of different strategies of protein and derivatives supplementation in association with RT on selected health-related parameters in pre-frail and frail elderly. This is a series of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials. Volunteers will be divided into nine groups, comprising four different sub-studies evaluating the effects of: isolated leucine supplementation (study 1); protein source (whey vs. soy – study 2); combination of whey protein and creatine (study 3); and sexual dimorphism on the response to protein intake and RT (males vs. females – study 4). Muscle cross-sectional area, fiber cross-sectional area, body composition, lower-limb maximal dynamic and isometric strength, functionality, lipid profile, biochemical parameters, renal function, quality of life, and nutritional status will be assessed before and after a 16-week intervention period. Data will be tested for normality and a mixed-model for repeated measures will be conducted to assess within- and between-group effects of the intervention on the dependent variables. Confidence intervals (95%), effect sizes, and relative changes will also be determined, with significance set at p < 0.05.  aFunding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The trial was funded by postgraduate scholarships.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody composition 3aclinical trials 3aconfidence interval 3acreatine 3aelderly 3afemales 3aleucine 3alipid composition 3along term effects 3amales 3amuscles 3anutritional status 3aprotein intake 3aprotein sources 3aquality of life 3arenal function 3asexual dimorphism 3astatistical models 3astrength training 3awhey 3awhey protein 0aAging 0amuscle loss 0asarcopenia 0anutrition 0aexercise1 aHayashi, Ana Paula1 aJambassi-Filho, José Claudio1 ade Capitani, Mariana Dutilh1 ade Santana, Davi Alves1 aGualano, Bruno1 aRoschel, Hamilton0 tNutrition and health.g, v. 23, no. 4 p.251-260dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl34213x2047-945X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/02601060177374653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007000169300001800239500001900257520141100276592002801687650002501715650002501740650002101765650002101786650002601807650001001833650002201843650001901865650001501884650001801899650002301917700002701940700002501967700002501992700001802017700001702035700005902052773012802111856008402239852000902323655001202332IND60725555220210421000000.0210126e20201217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072555522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c031802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLesur, Antoine10aHighly Multiplexed Targeted Proteomics Acquisition on a TIMS-QTOF  ap. 1383-1392.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTargeted proteomics allows the highly sensitive detection of specific peptides and proteins in complex biological samples. Here, we describe a methodology for targeted peptide quantification using a trapped ion mobility quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (timsTOF Pro). The prm-PASEF method exploits the multiplexing capability provided by the trapped ion mobility separation, allowing more than 200 peptides to be monitored over a 30 min liquid chromatography separation. Compared to conventional parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), precursor ions are accumulated in the trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) cells and separated according to their shape and charge before eluting into the quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) part of the mass spectrometer. The ion mobility trap allows measuring up to six peptides from a single 100 ms ion mobility separation with the current setup. Using these improved mass spectrometric capabilities, we detected and quantified 216 isotope-labeled synthetic peptides (AQUA peptides) spiked in HeLa human cell extract with limits of quantification of 17.2 amol for some peptides. The acquisition method is highly reproducible between injections and enables accurate quantification in biological samples, as demonstrated by quantifying KRas, NRas, and HRas as well as several Ras mutations in lung and colon cancer cell lines on fast 10 min gradient separations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acolorectal neoplasms 3ahuman cell lines 3aisotope labeling 3aliquid chromatography 3alungs 3amass spectrometry 3aneoplasm cells 3aproteomics 3aspectrometers 3asynthetic peptides1 aSchmit, Pierre-Olivier1 aBernardin, François1 aLetellier, Elisabeth1 aBrehmer, Sven1 aDecker, Jens1 aDittmar, Gunnar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3647-86230 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Dec. 17, v. 93, no. 3 p.1383-1392dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c031803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01223naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006100170300001600231520031800247592002800565650002000593650002100613650002100634650001800655650002600673650001200699773009400711856008400805990002300889852000900912655001200921IND60094808220221121041651.0141104e20131125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009480822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.devcel.2013.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevine, Tim P.12aA Twoferase for Lipid Transfer at ER-Golgi Contact Sites  ap. 369-370.  aReporting in Cell, Mesmin et al.

Despite all the benefits linked to PEGylation, high cost of PEGylated products has hindered accessibility of these products to patients. Continuous processing offers a solution to this predicament with its proven capability to improve economics without sacrificing product quality. In this study, we report the development of an integrated continuous PEGylation and purification process for a therapeutic protein, PEG-GCSF. The methodology to achieve this consisted of developing the batch PEGylation and purification protocols followed by their conversion into an integrated continuous process. A batch process involving rapid and highly productive PEGylation (reaction completion within one hour of reaction time) followed by cation exchange chromatography was developed. Enabling technologies like coiled flow inversion reactor, inline concentrator and counter-current chromatography, were utilized for the successful conversion of the batch process to continuous mode. The final integrated continuous process consisted of continuous PEGylation in a coiled flow inverter reactor followed by four column continuous counter-current cation exchange chromatography. Continuous chromatography was performed in a novel displacement mode, wherein all the multi-PEGylated impurities were removed in the loading flow-through and the pure mono-PEGylated protein was obtained in a single step salt elution. In combination with our previously established GCSF manufacturing train, the end-to-end continuous manufacturing process starting from inclusion bodies to unformulated PEG-GCSF drug substance was successfully run for 12 h. All attributes were found to be consistent over the period of operation with product purity > 99 % and high molecular weight impurities < 0.5 %. We hope that the current study will lay the foundation for implementation of continuous processing as a method to improve manufacturability of PEGylated therapeutic proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatch systems 3abioavailability 3abiotechnology 3acation exchange chromatography 3achemical bonding 3acountercurrent chromatography 3ahalf life 3amolecular weight 3apharmacokinetics 3aproduct quality 3apurification methods 3atherapeutics 0aGCSF 0aHCP 0apI 0aCEX 0aSEC 0aPEGpolyethylene 0aCV 0aCIP 0aA280 0aDo 0aContinuous processing 0aDownstream 0aBiosimilars 0aPEGylation 0aPurification1 aNitika, 1 aDureja, Samit1 aRathore, Anurag S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5913-42440 tJournal of biotechnology.g2020 Oct. 10, v. 322 p.79-89dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2020.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03668naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245011500170300001600285520202400301592002802325650001902353650001602372650001002388650001402398650001202412650001802424650001602442650001502458650002102473650001302494650001402507650000902521650002602530651001002556653001902566653002602585653000902611653001502620653002202635653002302657700001202680700002002692700001802712700001702730700001602747700001402763700001502777700001302792700001602805700001902821700001702840773012402857856008802981852000903069655001203078IND60597249320221120174302.0190617e20180915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059724932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoyu10aRice yield potential, gaps and constraints during the past three decades in a climate-changing Northeast China  ap. 173-183.  aNortheast China (NEC) is one of the most important rice production areas in China, accounting for approximately 15% of its total national rice production, and is one of the regions most vulnerable to global climate change. Knowing crops’ potential yields is crucial to understanding comparisons of different cultivars, crops and environments as well as plausible future increases and limits to crop yields. To mitigate the impacts of climate change and enhance food security, investigating yield potential (YP), attainable yield (YPA), nitrogen-limited potential yield (YPN), and actual farmers’ yield (Ya) as well as rice yield gaps and their causes in NEC under the climate change background is necessary. In this study, the ORYZA (v3) crop model was calibrated and validated for rice phenology and yields. The validated model was then used to determine YP, YPA and YPN values as well as yield gaps caused by nitrogen management factors (YGAN) and other agronomic and socioeconomic factors (YGNa) for five agroclimatic zones in NEC from 1981 to 2010. The regional area-weighted mean YP levels estimated by the model were 12.9 t ha−1 for YP and 11.6 t ha−1 for YPA with decreasing trends and 8.7 t ha−1 for YPN with an increasing tendency. The Ya was 6.8 t ha−1, with a significant increase of 1.1 t ha− 1 per decade (p < 0.01), and farmers achieved 58.6% of the YP. The YPA accounted for 80.9–94.8% of the YP in NEC. The regional exploitable yield gap (YGE) was 4.8 t ha−1. The regional yield gaps were shrinking at 0.47 and 0.88 t ha−1 per decade for YGAN and YGNa, respectively. In conclusion, because of the persistently large yield gap between farmers and YPN, YPA provides the government and farmers an opportunity to significantly increase rice production by controlling socioeconomic factors and adopting high-yield agronomic management practices based on site-specific conditions, including optimized irrigation and fertilization practices and “super” rice cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acrop models 3acrops 3acultivars 3afarmers 3afood security 3agrain yield 3airrigation 3amodel validation 3anitrogen 3aphenology 3arice 3asocioeconomic factors 3aChina 0aClimate change 0aORYZA (v3) crop model 0aRice 0aYield gaps 0aYield constraints 0aAgroclimatic zones1 aLi, Tao1 aYang, Xiaoguang1 aZhang, Tianyi1 aLiu, Zhijuan1 aGuo, Erjing1 aLiu, Ziqi1 aQu, Huihui1 aChen, Xi1 aWang, Lizhi1 aXiang, Hongtao1 aLai, Yongcai0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 259 p.173-183dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03990naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007500139245015000214300001800364500001900382500002000401520146900421592002801890596002701918596003701945596003001982596007002012596003202082596003902114596007502153650002702228650002202255650002502277650001502302650001302317650001502330650002002345650001802365650001602383650001402399650001102413650001602424650001702440650002102457650002102478650001902499650001602518650002002534651002102554651001502575700002202590700002302612700002802635700002302663700001802686700002102704700001602725700003202741700002702773700001702800700002402817700002702841700005702868700002102925700001902946700005502965773013003020856007303150852000903223655001203232IND60696590420221122084741.0200528e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069659042DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.137372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClemente‐Moreno, María José1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3288-631210aLow‐temperature tolerance of the Antarctic species Deschampsia antarctica: A complex metabolic response associated with nutrient remobilization  ap. 1376-1393.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe species Deschampsia antarctica (DA) is one of the only two native vascular species that live in Antarctica. We performed ecophysiological, biochemical, and metabolomic studies to investigate the responses of DA to low temperature. In parallel, we assessed the responses in a non‐Antarctic reference species (Triticum aestivum [TA]) from the same family (Poaceae). At low temperature (4°C), both species showed lower photosynthetic rates (reductions were 70% and 80% for DA and TA, respectively) and symptoms of oxidative stress but opposite responses of antioxidant enzymes (peroxidases and catalase). We employed fused least absolute shrinkage and selection operator statistical modelling to associate the species‐dependent physiological and antioxidant responses to primary metabolism. Model results for DA indicated associations with osmoprotection, cell wall remodelling, membrane stabilization, and antioxidant secondary metabolism (synthesis of flavonols and phenylpropanoids), coordinated with nutrient mobilization from source to sink tissues (confirmed by elemental analysis), which were not observed in TA. The metabolic behaviour of DA, with significant changes in particular metabolites, was compared with a newly compiled multispecies dataset showing a general accumulation of metabolites in response to low temperatures. Altogether, the responses displayed by DA suggest a compromise between catabolism and maintenance of leaf functionality.  aPublisher supplied data  cREDES‐CONICYT 170102  cHorizon 2020 Framework Programme  aNXR17‐002cNEXER‐UFRO  a11130332cFondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico  cMax‐Planck‐Gesellschaft  cEuropean Regional Development Fund  aCTM2014‐53902‐C2‐1‐PcMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad 3aDeschampsia antarctica 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiochemical pathways 3acatabolism 3acatalase 3acell walls 3adata collection 3aecophysiology 3aenvironment 3aflavonols 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aoxidative stress 3aphenylpropanoids 3aphotosynthesis 3atemperature 3avascular plants 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica1 aOmranian, Nooshin1 aSáez, Patricia L.1 aFigueroa, Carlos María1 aDel‐Saz, Néstor1 aElso, Mhartyn1 aPoblete, Leticia1 aOrf, Isabel1 aCuadros‐Inostroza, Alvaro1 aCavieres, Lohengrin A.1 aBravo, León1 aFernie, Alisdair R.1 aRibas‐Carbó, Miquel1 aFlexas, Jaume1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3069-175X1 aNikoloski, Zoran1 aBrotman, Yariv1 aGago, Jorge1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4293-01050 tPlant, cell and environment.g2020 June, v. 43, no. 6 p.1376-1393dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl11406x0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.137373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245011800175300001800293500001900311520181100330592002802141650002502169650001502194650001702209650001402226650002302240650001402263650001302277650002002290650001902310700002302329700001702352700006102369773012802430856008402558852000902642655001202651IND60725555420221120050105.0210126e20201222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072555542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c032112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Heather M.

In this process, termed myogenesis, satellite cells get activated, proliferate, and differentiate. Myogenesis is recapitulated in the tissue culture of myoblasts that differentiate by fusion and then by the formation of myotubes. Autophagy plays an important role in myogenesis, but the asynchronous and unique trajectory of differentiation of each myoblast along the myogenic lineage complicates teasing apart at what stages of differentiation autophagy plays a critical role. In this report, we describe a mass cytometric, multidimensional, individual cell analysis of differentiating myoblasts that characterizes autophagy flux (i.e., autophagy rate) at separate myogenesis stages. Because mass cytometry uses a set of lanthanide-tagged antibodies, each being specific for a desired molecular target, quantification of each molecular target could be exaggerated by nonspecific binding of its respective antibody to other nontarget cellular regions. In this report, we used lanthanide-tagged isotypes, which allowed for correction for nonspecific binding at the single-cell level. Using this approach, myoblasts were phenotypically identified by their position in the myogenic lineage, simultaneously with the quantification of autophagic flux in each identified subset. We found that generally autophagy flux is upregulated specifically during myoblast fusion and declines in myotubes. We also observed that mitophagy (i.e., selective autophagic degradation of mitochondria) is also active after myotube formation. The ability to track different types of autophagy is another feature of this methodology, which could be key to expand the current understanding of autophagy regulation in regenerating the skeletal muscle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aantibodies 3amitochondria 3amitophagy 3amuscle development 3amyoblasts 3amyotubes 3askeletal muscle 3atissue culture1 aKuhns, Michelle M.1 aMaxwell, Zoe1 aArriaga, Edgar A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8863-61740 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Dec. 22, v. 93, no. 3 p.1401-1408dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c032113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01919naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012100160300002000281520065900301592002800960650001400988650002301002650001101025650002101036650001201057650001101069650002201080650001501102650001701117650002401134700001301158700001901171700001301190700001901203700001401222700002401236700001801260773013601278856007401414852000901488655001201497IND60676344120221120042849.0191115e20191114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067634412DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc06164a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Chwen-Haw10aFrom a layered iridium(iii)–cobalt(ii) organophosphonate to an efficient oxygen-evolution-reaction electrocatalyst  ap. 13920-13923.  aBimetallic MOF precursors can produce a homogeneous distribution of mixed-metal oxides after calcination, and thus may provide high efficiency as electrocatalysts in the water splitting process.

Partitioning-defective (Par) proteins promote self-renewal, and their asymmetric distribution provides a mechanism for asymmetric division. Near the end of neural development, most asymmetric division ends and precursors differentiate. This correlates with Par protein disappearance, but mechanisms that cause downregulation are unknown. MicroRNAs can promote precursor differentiation but have not been linked to Par protein regulation. We tested a hypothesis that microRNA miR-219 promotes precursor differentiation by inhibiting Par proteins. Neural precursors in zebrafish larvae lacking miR-219 function retained apical proteins, remained in the cell cycle, and failed to differentiate. miR-219 inhibited expression via target sites within the 3′ untranslated sequence of pard3 and prkci mRNAs, which encode Par proteins, and blocking miR-219 access to these sites phenocopied loss of miR-219 function. We propose that negative regulation of Par protein expression by miR-219 promotes cell-cycle exit and differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3abrain 3acell cycle 3alarvae 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3aneurodevelopment 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins1 aBlasky, Alex J.1 aAppel, Bruce0 tDevelopmental cell.g2013 Nov. 25, v. 27, no. 4 p.387-398dElsevier Inc.x1534-58077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2013.10.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141242013000166242014400296245014000440300001500580520113200595592002801727650001801755650001501773650001201788650001501800650001201815650002101827650001801848650001001866651002201876651001001898653001901908653001301927653001601940653002201956653001301978653001201991653001702003700003002020700002202050773013702072856007502209852000902284655001202293IND60701862020221118041125.0200716e20200409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070186202DNAL7 a10.30963/aramit59122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrientos, José A.10aLinyphiidae (Araneae) in Baumhöhlen in mediterranen Eichenwäldern: Neubeschreibungen und Phänologie bemerkenswerter Arten.10aLinyphiidae (Araneae) en oquedades de roble en un bosque Mediterráneo: nuevas descripciones y distribución temporal de especies notables.10aLinyphiidae (Araneae) inhabiting hollow oaks in Mediterranean forests: new descriptions and temporal distribution of remarkable species  ap. 97-107.  aHollows in mature trees provide a variety of habitats for high species richness and diversity of different arthropod groups.

This has many areas of wetland, which provide important ecological services, especially carbon sequestration in the semi-arid terrestrial ecosystems. However, the area of wetland has decreased sharply in the past two decades. This study examined ways to recognize and extract wetland from grassland to determine the difference among net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) between wetland and grassland and to evaluate the influence of wetland loss on carbon sequestration in the grassland. The eddy covariance (EC) flux technique was coupled with the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM) to upscale the spatial patterns of carbon flux. The results showed that the region was a carbon source in 2016, probably caused by overharvesting and degradation of forests. The value of the NEE (average: 6.63 ± 3.50 g C m−2 d−1) in grassland was apparently higher than that in wetland (average: 0.86 ± 1.69 g C m−2 d−1), which suggested that the capability of carbon sequestration in wetland was still stronger than that in grassland even in carbon loss condition. The results showed a positive relationship between aboveground biomass (AGB) and ground-based daily GPP or Reco for both wetland and grassland and a negative relationship between AGB and NEE. The ground-based daily NEE was also significantly related to soil water content (SWC) but showed no relationship with daily precipitation (PRE), which suggested that SWC was a more important impact factor than precipitation on CO2 flux exchange in the study area. The change between wetland and grassland did not influence the positive relationship between AGB or SWC and CO2 flux. Our study provides a new way to determine the spatial CO2 flux exchange and its controlling factors (environmental variables and vegetation patterns) and to successfully analyze its differences in wetland and grassland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aarid lands 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aecosystem respiration 3aecosystem services 3aeddy covariance 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3agrasslands 3amodels 3anet ecosystem exchange 3aphotosynthesis 3aprimary productivity 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awetlands 3aChina 0aWetland 0aGrassland 0aCarbon fluxes 0aSpatial exchange 0aRemote sensing 0aVPRM1 aWang, Guoqiang1 aLiu, Tingxi1 aXue, Bao-Lin1 aA, Yinglan0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 259 p.196-210dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245006500173300001600238520103800254592002801292650002201320650001701342650002001359650003701379653001901416653000901435653001601444653002501460653001601485653001701501700001801518700002201536773009401558856008401652852000901736655001201745IND60535605020221119235926.0190401e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053560502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2015.04.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerain, Muriel C.D.10aSustainable food consumption.

The present paper empirically explores different types of sustainable food behaviors. A distinction between sustainable product choices and curtailment behavior has been investigated empirically and predictors of the two types of behavior have been identified. Respondents were classified into four segments based on their sustainable food behaviors: unsustainers, curtailers, product-oriented consumers, and sustainers. Significant differences between the segments were found with regard to food choice motives, personal and social norms, food involvement, subjective knowledge on sustainable food, ability to judge how sustainably a product has been produced and socio-demographics.

In complex geometries, such as shell-and-tube storage systems with extended fins, a good approximation of the impact of natural convection on the melting process is very difficult. There are no correlations for such geometries, and simulations of these storage systems require extensive computational effort. In the present work, we analyzed the impact of natural convection in four vertical shell-and-tube extended fin systems with a common tube height. To investigate the influence of the tube height, one of the fins was additionally modeled with two further tube heights. We scaled the resulting liquid fraction evolutions into a dimensionless form and used a convective enhancement factor to assess the strength of natural convection. A linear fit function for the mean convective enhancement factor was derived to estimate the melting process considering natural convection. With it, natural convection may be incorporated into the design process of storage systems to optimize the charging time. The results indicate a negligible impact of natural convection in fins with a small tube spacing and a high fin fraction. There is a considerable impact from natural convection in fins designed with a large tube spacing and a low fin fraction. However, large fin heights lead to decreased heat transfer enhancement by natural convection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconvection 3ageometry 3alatent heat 3aliquids 3amelting 3athermal energy 0aHeat transfer 0aPhase change material (PCM) 0aFinned tube heat exchanger 0aComputational fluid dynamics (CFD) 0aConvective enhancement factor1 aJohnson, M.0 tApplied energy.g2019 July 15, v. 246 p.38-52dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100002200191245013100213300001400344520136000358592002801718596006701746596006601813650002101879650001201900650002401912650001201936650001301948650002501961650001401986650001102000650002002011651002302031651001802054653002102072653002402093653002102117653001702138773011402155856008502269852000902354655001202363IND60526241820221119202406.0190403e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052624182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2016.04.0402chorus7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2016.04.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrose, Patrick H.10aOrigin, development, and impact of mountain laurel thickets on the mixed-oak forests of the central Appalachian Mountains, USA  ap. 33-41.  aThroughout forests of the northern hemisphere, some species of ericaceous shrubs can form persistent understories that interfere with forest regeneration processes. In the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America, mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia) may interfere in the regeneration of mixed-oak (Quercus spp.) forests. To verify this possibility, I conducted a dendroecology study from 2001 to 2005 in three mixed-oak stands with mountain laurel thickets to elucidate how and when the thickets originated, developed, and were impacting hardwood seedlings. At all three sites, the oldest mountain laurel dated to the 1930s when the stands emerged from a period of recurring disturbance. However, most of the mountain laurel has originated since the 1950s when the stands were generally undisturbed. More recently, insect defoliations have accelerated the development of the thickets by increasing available sunlight. A strong negative relationship exists between the percent cover of mountain laurel and the density of hardwood seedlings with 20–30% cover being sufficient to inhibit seedling establishment and survival. Perpetuating mixed-oak forests that contain mountain laurel thickets will require reducing shrub cover to less than 20–30% at the beginning of the regeneration process to help ensure adequate densities of hardwood seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data  cJoint Fire Science Programdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100015231  cNorthern Research Stationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100014511 3aKalmia latifolia 3aQuercus 3aforest regeneration 3aforests 3ahardwood 3aphytophagous insects 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3asolar radiation 3aAppalachian region 3aUnited States 0aDendrochronology 0aForest regeneration 0aKalmia latifolia 0aQuercus spp.0 tForest ecology and management.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 374 p.33-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2016.04.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009300169300001600262500001400278520141800292592002801710650001601738650000901754650001001763650000901773650001501782650001601797650001801813650001201831653001001843653001001853653001401863653001101877700001701888773012601905856008502031852000902116655001202125IND60694485320221121154407.0200513e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069448532DNAL7 a10.1080/1828051X.2017.14157052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbecia, J.

CH lambs were kept with their mothers during the first 30 days of age; from that moment onwards, ewes were machine-milked. LA lambs were not allowed to suckle their mothers, and ewes were machine-milked from parturition. Milking length (ML), total milk yield (TMY) and daily milk yield (DMY) (TMY/ML) were calculated. For the CH breed, there was an effect (p < .001) of prolificacy on ML, TMY and DMY and of offspring gender on TMY and DMY. For the LA breed, prolificacy and offspring gender had an effect (p < .001) on ML, TMY and DMY. Ewes giving birth to twin lambs produced more milk (CH: +0.15 l/d and +27.5 l/ewe; LA: +0.15 l/d and +11 l/ewe), than ewes giving birth to single lambs. For single parturitions in the CH breed, ewes giving birth to females produced more milk (+0.04 l/d and +5.2 l/ewe) (p < .0001) than ewes giving birth to males. In this breed, this effect of female offspring on milk production was similar for those ewes giving birth to twin lambs. In conclusion, ewes presenting twin parturitions produced more milk than single parturitions and the presence of female lambs had a positive effect on milk yield. These results open new possibilities to increase profitability of dairy sheep farms through a selection of the offspring gender.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy sheep 3aewes 3amales 3amilk 3amilk yield 3aparturition 3aprofitability 3aprogeny 0aSheep 0adairy 0aoffspring 0agender1 aPalacios, C.0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2018 July 3, v. 17, no. 3 p.736-739dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2017.14157053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011400168300001400282520184700296592002802143650002902171650001802200650001502218650001402233650001602247650001302263650001802276651001402294700001502308700002002323700002202343700001802365773010802383856008102491852000902572655001202581IND50072724620221120030439.0160623e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007272462DNAL7 a10.1007/s11355-012-0189-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunaratne, G. L.10aEffect of inlet morphometry changes on natural sensitivity and flushing time of the Koggala lagoon, Sri Lanka  ap. 87-97.  aThe changes of natural sensitivity in terms of lagoon morphometry, particularly the inlet morphometry and flushing properties of the Koggala lagoon, Sri Lanka, are presented in this paper. The morphometric assessment is based on analysis and consideration of morphometric characteristics for three scenarios of the lagoon, namely: (1) before the construction of the old groyne system or time period before 1996 (Koggala Scenario 1—KS1); (2) existing situation or time period after 2007 (Koggala Scenario 2—KS2); and (3) future scenario with respect to proposed groyne interventions for the mouth width of 20 m, as proposed by Gunaratne et al. (J Environ Sci 22(6):813–819, 2010) (Koggala Scenario 3—KS3). The morphometric assessment provides a simple means of defining natural sensitivity or vulnerability of individual scenarios of Koggala lagoon to external loads and anthropogenic activities. We found that KS1 and KS3 scenarios are relatively more sensitive than KS2, whereas KS1 has the highest natural sensitivity, and KS2 has the lowest natural sensitivity or the most robust conditions. In quantifying the tidal flushing of Koggala lagoon, the concept of flushing half-life (T ₅₀% h) was adapted as the optimum measure of flushing time. Flushing half-life was calculated for KS2 and KS3 scenarios. The flushing half-life ranges from 9 to 37 h (1.5 days) for KS2 and from 12 to 72 h (3 days) for KS3. Flushing half-life suggests that the exchange rate between the lagoon and the ocean is controlled by the balance between fresh water inflow and the seawater inflow. Applications of the morphometric classification and flushing half-life presented in this article can be used to help guide management and policy-making decisions for the coastal environment of Koggala lagoon and other coastal water bodies of Sri Lanka.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acoastal water 3afreshwater 3ahalf life 3amorphometry 3aseawater 3asurface water 3aSri Lanka1 aTanaka, N.1 aAmarasekara, P.1 aPriyadarshana, T.1 aManatunge, J.0 tLandscape and ecological engineering.g2014 Jan., v. 10, no. 1 p.87-97dSpringer Japanx1860-18717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11355-012-0189-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03640naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002100160245010200181300001800283500000900301520263400310592002802944650001302972650001502985650002503000650001803025700001803043700001803061700001703079773012403096852000903220856009703229655001203326IND8505132920221120091609.0191122e198411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND850513292DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1984.00021962007600060034x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCormick, R. A.10aIncreased N Efficiency from Nitrapyrin Added to Liquid Swine Manure Used as a Fertilizer for Corn  ap. 1010-1014.  aepub  aIncreases in the price of N fertilizers encourage farmers to utilize alternative sources of nutrients such as sewage sludges and animal manure when the wastes are available. However, a portion of the applied N may be lost by leaching and/or denitrification after organic N and NH ⁺₄-N in the waste is converted to NO ⁻₃ by ammonification and nitrification. One way to reduce leaching and denitrification losses is through the use of a nitrification inhibitor. Therefore, field experiments were conducted during three growing seasons to evaluate the effects on corn (Zea mays L.) grain yield and plant composition of mixing nitrapyrin [2-chloro-6(trichlormethyl)pyridine], a nitrification inhibitor, with liquid swine (Sus spp.) manure applied to a silty clay loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic, Typic Haplaquoll). Nitrapyrin was added to swine manure at rates of 0, 25, and 50 mg L⁻, and the swine manure was soil injected in bands during the fall or spring prior to corn planting. Corn grain yields, ear leaf N levels, and grain N concentrations were measured. In 1978, the addition of nitrapyrin (at a rate of SO mg L⁻¹) to liquid swine manure springapplied at a rate of 49 Mg ha⁻¹ (154 kg available N ha⁻¹) significantly increased grain yield, but not tissue N levels when compared to plots receiving only manure. Yields obtained from plots treated with manure (49 Mg ha⁻¹) plus nitrapyrin were similar to those from plots receiving swine manure at a rate of 110 Mg ha⁻¹ (345 kg available N ha⁻¹) without nitrapyrin or from 134 or 180 kg urea N ha⁻¹. During the 1979 and 1980 growing seasons, the addition of 25 or 50 mg nitrapyrin L⁻¹ of swine manure applied at rates of 31 to 60 and 38 to 60 Mg ha⁻¹, respectively, in the fall significantly increased yields as compared to plots receiving waste without the inhibitor. In 1979 and 1980, addition of nitrapyrin to swine manure applied in the spring at rates of 63 and 78 Mg ha⁻¹ (161 and 286 kg available N ha⁻¹, respectively) had no effect upon corn yield. However, in 1980 the addition of 50 mg nitrapyrin L⁻¹ to manure applied in the spring at a rate of 44 Mg ha⁻¹ (159 kg available N ha⁻¹) significantly increased yields as compared to plots receiving waste without the inhibitor. Large losses of applied N apparently occurred following fall applications of manure. Based upon yield results of manure treatments it is likely that nitrapyrin was effective in reducing losses of applied N and, thereby, increased corn yields by maintaining adequate levels of available N in the plant rooting zone throughout the growing season  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3anitrapyrin 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aliquid manure1 aNelson, D.

In recent years, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have become an excellent electrocatalyst due to its characteristics. NiFeCr-MOFs were synthesized and prepared in one step by simple solvothermal method, which improved the OER performance compared with NiFe-MOFs. When the doping dosage of Cr³⁺ is 0.3 mmol, the performance of ternary MOFs is optimal, requiring only 333 mV overpotential to provide a current density of 10 mA/cm², and the slope of Tafel is only 66 mV dec⁻¹. In this paper, the role of Cr³⁺ in the catalyst and the reason and mechanism for the improvement of OER performance were studied from the aspects of electrochemical surface area (ESCA), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electronic structure of the catalyst. Experiments have proved that the preparation of ternary MOFs by co-doping with an appropriate amount of Ni, Fe, and Cr has practical significance for improving the performance of OER.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen production 3asurface area 0aCr doping 0aNiFe-MOFs 0aOER 0aDirect application1 aMō̜ Yō̜ng,1 aWang, Shuai1 aZhong, Hong1 aCao, Zhanfang1 aMa, Xin0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 June 05, v. 642 p.128469-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1284693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011200167300001600279520119800295592002801493650002001521650001101541650001001552650003201562650001101594650002501605653003701630653004501667653003601712653004301748653003101791700001601822700001301838700001801851700001901869700001901888773009801907856008702005852000902092655001202101IND60637441320221119005712.0191214e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063744132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Feng12aA comprehensive dynamic efficiency-enhanced energy management strategy for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles  ap. 657-669.  aThis paper presents a comprehensive dynamic efficiency model for the overall powertrain efficiency that considers the internal combustion engine and electric motor generators in depth as well as a planetary coupling transmission system of PHEVs example. In particular, the dynamic forces of planetary coupling transmission system with an effect on the dynamic transmission efficiency are taken into consideration. Then a dynamic efficiency optimization strategy is proposed to improve the fuel economy, and an improved dynamic efficiency optimization strategy, consisting in adding to the dynamic efficiency optimization strategy a penalty coefficient, is applied to reach the trade-off between energy consumption and fatigue life of planetary coupling transmission system. Eventually, the dynamic efficiency optimization strategy and improved dynamic efficiency optimization strategy are validated by hardware-in-the-loop experiments. The main contribution of this study is to explore a novel way to optimize the comprehensive dynamic efficiency of whole powertrain, and also improve ride comfort by avoiding planetary coupling transmission system working in the inefficient resonance region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric motors 3aenergy 3afuels 3ainternal combustion engines 3amodels 3avehicles (equipment) 0aPlug-in hybrid electric vehicles 0aDynamic efficiency optimization strategy 0aDynamic transmission efficiency 0aPlanetary coupling transmission system 0aEnergy management strategy1 aZhang, Jian1 aXu, Xing1 aCai, Yingfeng1 aZhou, Zhiguang1 aSun, Xiaoqiang0 tApplied energy.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 247 p.657-669dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245008200180300001600262500001400278520144800292592002801740650001401768650001101782650000901793650002701802650001401829650000901843650002101852650001501873650003201888650002601920650001401946650002501960650003201985650001702017650002302034653001302057653001602070653001802086653003102104700002102135700001802156700002302174700002302197773012602220856008502346852000902431655001202440IND60694485420221121154442.0200513e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069448542DNAL7 a10.1080/1828051X.2017.14166852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManuelian, Carmen Loreto10aPhenotypic variation of milk fatty acid composition of Pinzgauer cattle breed  ap. 574-577.  aNAL-light  aThis paper investigated sources of variation of milk fatty acid (FA, g/100 g total FA) profile routinely predicted by mid-infrared spectroscopy in Pinzgauer dual-purpose cattle breed. A total of 19,578 individual milk samples collected from 1232 cows and 77 herds between 2011 and 2014 were available for phenotypic characterisation. Data were analysed using a linear mixed model which included stage of lactation, parity and their interaction as fixed effects, and cow and herd-test-day as random effects. Milk yield averaged 20.87 kg/d, and means for fat, protein and casein were 4.01, 3.44 and 2.72%, respectively. Saturated FA (SFA), monounsaturated FA (MUFA) and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) averaged 69.20, 25.43 and 3.19 g/100 g total FA, respectively. About half of the SFA were provided by C16:0 (31.24 g/100 g total FA), and almost all MUFA by C18:1 (22.18 g/100 g total FA). Fixed effects were significant in explaining the variation of the studied traits. Milk of first-parity cows had the lowest percentage of SFA, medium-chain FA and C14:0, and the greatest percentage of MUFA, PUFA, trans FA, short- and long-chain FA, and C18:1. Saturated FA, C14:0 and C16:0 increased from calving until 120 days in milk, whereas unsaturated FA, MUFA, PUFA, long-chain FA, C18:0 and C18:1 decreased. Although both parity and stage of lactation affected milk FA, greater variation was observed during lactation than among parities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinzgauer 3acasein 3acows 3afatty acid composition 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk fatty acids 3amilk yield 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3aparity (reproduction) 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aspectroscopy 3astatistical models 0aCow milk 0alocal breed 0amountain area 0apolyunsaturated fatty acid1 aVisentin, Giulio1 aPenasa, Mauro1 aCassandro, Martino1 aDe Marchi, Massimo0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2018 July 3, v. 17, no. 3 p.574-577dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2017.14166853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03920naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003100149245013200180300001600312520210700328592002802435650001302463650002402476650002202500650001002522650002102532650001502553650001702568650002502585650001302610650000902623650003102632650002302663651001702686653000802703653000802711653000802719653000802727653000702735653000702742653000802749653000902757653001802766653002302784653003602807653001902843653001702862653003202879700002402911700002502935700002402960700002902984700002103013700002003034700002303054700001803077773009403095856008403189852000903273655001203282IND60535605320221120000145.0190401e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053560532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2015.04.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIuel-Brockdorf, Ann-Sophie10aAcceptability of new formulations of corn-soy blends and lipid-based nutrient supplements in Province du Passoré, Burkina Faso  ap. 278-286.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of new formulations of six corn-soy blended flours (CSB) and six lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) with different quantities of milk and qualities of soy to be used for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). Furthermore, we wanted to explore the acceptability of foods currently used for the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in Burkina Faso to identify possible barriers that could affect the acceptability of the new formulations of supplementary foods. The study was carried out prior to a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of these new formulations. The study involved an observed test-meal and a three-day take-home ration of the experimental food supplements to 6- to 30-months-old healthy children, followed by questionnaire-based interviews about the acceptability of these supplements. Interviews and focus group discussions were carried out to explore the acceptability of foods currently used for the prevention and treatment of malnutrition. The results suggest that both LNS and CSB products with different quantities of milk and qualities of soy are equally well accepted among healthy children in rural Burkina Faso based on general appreciation of the supplements and organoleptic properties. All experimental foods received good ratings and there was no significant difference between the foods. However, after the take-home ration, 58% of participants receiving CSB reported having left-overs at the end of the day compared to 37% (n = 33) of the participants receiving LNS (p = 0.004), suggesting that CSB was not as readily consumed as LNS. Yet, both CSB and LNS products were perceived as easy to administer and the frequency of feeding was estimated to be adequate. The study also found that similar foods, used for the prevention and treatment of malnutrition, were well appreciated in the study location. LNS were to a higher degree associated with medicine or foods with medicinal properties, but both LNS and CSB were perceived as beneficial to child health.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3adietary supplements 3afeeding frequency 3aflour 3afunctional foods 3ainterviews 3amalnutrition 3amedicinal properties 3amedicine 3amilk 3arandomized clinical trials 3asensory properties 3aBurkina Faso 0aMAM 0aCSB 0aLNS 0aWHO 0aDS 0aSI 0aDSM 0aMUAC 0aAcceptability 0aSupplementary food 0aLipid-based nutrient supplement 0aCorn soy blend 0aMalnutrition 0aModerate acute malnutrition1 aDræbel, Tania Aase1 aFabiansen, Christian1 aCichon, Bernardette1 aChristensen, Vibeke Brix1 aYameogo, Charles1 aRitz, Christian1 aFrahm Olsen, Mette1 aFriis, Henrik0 tAppetite.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 91 p.278-286dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2015.04.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245012500164300002000289520170700309592002802016650001302044650001502057650001402072650002302086650002002109650001302129650002302142650001702165650001502182650001202197650000902209650001102218650002202229650002002251650001602271650001602287653002702303653002602330653002202356653001802378653002202396653003002418700001602448700001802464773012802482856007802610852000902688655001202697IND60528289520221118005010.0160716e20150520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052828952DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b017562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChou, Ying-Nien10aApplying Thermosettable Zwitterionic Copolymers as General Fouling-Resistant and Thermal-Tolerant Biomaterial Interfaces  ap. 10096-10107.  aWe introduced a thermosettable zwitterionic copolymer to design a high temperature tolerance biomaterial as a general antifouling polymer interface. The original synthetic fouling-resistant copolymer, poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-co-poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (poly(VP-co-SBMA)), is both thermal-tolerant and fouling-resistant, and the antifouling stability of copolymer coated interfaces can be effectively controlled by regulating the VP/SBMA composition ratio. We studied poly(VP-co-SBMA) copolymer gels and networks with a focus on their general resistance to protein, cell, and bacterial bioadhesion, as influenced by the thermosetting process. Interestingly, we found that the shape of the poly(VP-co-SBMA) copolymer material can be set at a high annealing temperature of 200 °C while maintaining good antifouling properties. However, while the zwitterionic PSBMA polymer gels were bioinert as expected, control of the fouling resistance of the PSBMA polymer networks was lost in the high temperature annealing process. A poly(VP-co-SBMA) copolymer network composed of PSBMA segments at 32 mol % showed reduced fibrinogen adsorption, tissue cell adhesion, and bacterial attachment, but a relatively higher PSBMA content of 61 mol % was required to optimize resistance to platelet adhesion and erythrocyte attachment to confer hemocompatibility to human blood. We suggest that poly(VP-co-SBMA) copolymers capable of retaining stable fouling resistance after high temperature shaping have a potential application as thermosettable materials in a bioinert interface for medical devices, such as the thermosettable coating on a stainless steel blood-compatible metal stent investigated in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3aannealing 3abacterial adhesion 3ablood platelets 3acoatings 3acomposite polymers 3aerythrocytes 3afibrinogen 3afouling 3agels 3ahumans 3amedical equipment 3astainless steel 3atemperature 3azwitterions 0azwitterionic copolymer 0atemperature tolerance 0afouling-resistant 0athermosetting 0acharge neutrality 0asulfobetaine methacrylate1 aChang, Yung1 aWen, Ten-Chin0 tACS applied materials .g2015 May 20, v. 7, no. 19 p.10096-10107dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b017563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03893naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245011300205300001400318500001500332520204300347592002802390650002402418650001402442650001302456650002902469650001402498650001902512650001002531650001702541650001502558650001102573650001402584650002102598650002302619650002202642650001602664650001702680650001102697650001302708650001802721650001602739650001902755650001602774650000702790650001302797650001002810651001002820653002802830653001902858653002002877653001402897653002502911700002002936700002002956700006002976773012703036856008303163852000903246655001203255IND60544673920221118013328.0190426e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054467392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2015.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevy, Evan S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9900-683X10aEffects of hydrographic conditions of ponds on juvenile fish assemblages in the Kakum mangrove system, Ghana  ap. 19-27.  a2019-12-06  aThe importance of mangrove ecosystems as nursery grounds for fishes is well established and documented. This paper reports on the possible role of hydrographic dynamics in the selection and utilization of tropical mangrove ponds as nursery habitats for juvenile fishes of ecological and commercial importance. The study was conducted in the Kakum River Estuary mangrove ecosystem near Elmina in the Central Region of Ghana during the peak of the monsoon season. Fish assemblages were sampled using a cast net and a pole seine. Aspects of hydrographic conditions of the ponds were studied. A total of 265 fish specimens, belonging to 18 species and 12 families were sampled. The commonest fish was the blackchinned tilapia Sarotherodon melanotheron, a typical brackish water fish in West Africa, which accounted for 66.4% of the total fish sampled. Ten of the 18 species belonging to 7 families, namely Elops lacerta, Eucinostomus melanopterus, Porogobius schlegelii, Gobionellus occidentalis, Mugil bananensis, Liza falcipinnis, Epinephelus sp., Serranus accraensis, Penaeus notialis and Callinectes amnicola were of marine origin. Spatial and temporal variations in the prevailing hydrographic conditions appeared to influence the fish species composition, density and size classes to varying degrees. Changes in salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity and pond size correlated significantly with abundance of juvenile fish. Major fluctuations in fish species composition occurred on a weekly basis with changing pond depth and volume, indicating the dynamic nature of mangroves ponds that may serve the ecological needs of different species over time. Smaller juvenile fishes seemed better adapted to high variations in hydrographic conditions compared to larger juveniles. Higher fish densities and lower species diversity were encountered when the ponds were shallow compared to deep ponds. The utilization of mangrove tidal ponds as nurseries by juvenile fish may therefore be influenced primarily by the salinity and pond size.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrackish water fish 3afish nets 3aSerranus 3aFarfantepenaeus notialis 3ajuveniles 3amonsoon season 3aponds 3aSarotherodon 3aecosystems 3aoxygen 3aestuaries 3aLiza falcipinnis 3atemporal variation 3aspecies diversity 3aGobionellus 3aEucinostomus 3arivers 3asalinity 3aElops lacerta 3aCallinectes 3amarine science 3aEpinephelus 3apH 3ahabitats 3aMugil 3aGhana 0aHydrographic conditions 0aNursery ground 0aJuvenile fishes 0amangroves 0aMangrove tidal ponds1 aAsare, Noble K.1 aYankson, Kobina1 aWubah, Daniel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7206-40790 tRegional studies in marine science.g2015 Nov., v. 2 p.19-27dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2015.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245011300177300001400290520167100304592002801975650001402003650001102017650001202028650001602040650001502056650001002071650001502081650001702096650001102113651001502124653003002139653002002169653001502189653002702204653001902231700001902250700002002269773010302289856009002392852000902482655001202491IND60127518220221120105430.0151110e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012751822DNAL7 a10.1655/HERPETOLOGICA-D-13-000352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZappalorti, Robert10aHome Range Size and Distance Traveled from Hibernacula in Northern Pinesnakes in the New Jersey Pine Barrens  ap. 26-36.  aWe studied home range size and maximum dispersal distance from hibernacula in Northern Pinesnakes (Pituophis m. melanoleucus) at a 1418-ha preserve in Cumberland County, New Jersey, USA, between 1993 and 2003. We discovered 22 different winter hibernacula that were used by 39 Northern Pinesnakes. Of the 10 snakes monitored in hibernacula for 3–5 yr, shifting was observed by 8 individuals, and 2 females showed hibernacula philopatry for five consecutive years. The average minimum convex polygon home range of 14 radio-tracked Northern Pinesnakes was 105.51 ha (located 30–108 times/snake), whereas the average kernel density estimator home range was 50% isopleth = 38.99 ha and 90% isopleth = 133.15 ha. There were no differences in home range as a function of sex, but the number of years snakes were radio-tracked affected home range size. An adult male had the largest home range of 258 ha. The average distance traveled by radio-tracked Northern Pinesnakes from their winter hibernacula was 1321.05 m, with a maximum distance of 2146.91 m. Of all snakes followed, 27.3% (n = 3) traveled <1000 m, 18.2% (n = 2) traveled 1000–1100 m, 18.2% (n = 2) traveled 1100–1200 m, and 36.4% (n = 4) traveled >1200 m. The average number of hibernacula available per home range was 3.2. Snakes that were monitored for ≥2 yr had larger home ranges than snakes that were only radio-tracked for 1 yr. Thus, radio-tracking several adult snakes over a 3–5-yr period is the most effective method to determine home ranges, locate hibernacula sites of meta-populations, and reveal an understanding of their ecology, behavior, and conservation requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPituophis 3aadults 3afemales 3ahibernation 3ahome range 3amales 3aphilopatry 3apine barrens 3asnakes 3aNew Jersey 0aDistance from hibernacula 0aHome range size 0aPhilopatry 0aPituophis melanoleucus 0aRadio-tracking1 aBurger, Joanna1 aPeterson, Frank0 tHerpetologica.g2015 Mar., v. 71, no. 1 p.26-36dThe Herpetologists' League, Inc.x1938-50997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1655%2FHERPETOLOGICA-D-13-000353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008300169520162200252592002801874650001501902650001501917650001201932650002501944650001201969650003501981650001902016650003102035650001902066650001102085650004402096650001102140650002102151650002302172650002102195650001502216653000802231653001402239653001502253653001102268700002002279700001702299700001602316773010502332856008702437852000902524655001202533IND60766410520221118172146.0220628e20220520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076641052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1284792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haitao10aCationic surfactant modified attapulgite for removal of phenol from wastewater  aIn order to improve the adsorption and removal function of attapulgite (ATP) for phenol, we synthesized a cationic surfactant (Gemini) with double cation active sites and used it to modify ATP combined with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The analysis results of infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H NMR) confirmed the special structure of Gemini. Compared with pure ATP (P-ATP), Gemini modified ATP (G-ATP) not only have better dispersibility, but also has abundant active cationic groups on the surface. Moreover, the cationic surfactant molecule could replace the adsorbed water on the ATP surface, enhancing the surface hydrophobicity of G-ATP. Therefore, the positively charged G-ATP with a hydrophobic surface can not only interact with the π-π interaction between the benzene ring in the phenol molecular structure, but also adsorb phenol through electrostatic attraction. The adsorption behavior of modified ATP on phenol conformed to the Freundlich isotherm adsorption model, indicating that phenol molecules bind to the modified ATP in a multilayer form. Reusability measurements showed that Gemini -modified ATP has better long-term stability in phenol adsorption applications. These results indicate that Gemini modified ATP is not only a good adsorbent for phenol, but also has good regeneration performance. As a good adsorption material with high performance and green pollution-free, we have reason to believe that the ATP modified by the new aromatic surfactant has a good development prospect in the future tobacco industry sewage treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abenzene 3acationic surfactants 3acations 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3adispersibility 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphenol 3asewage treatment 3asorption isotherms 3atobacco industry 3awastewater 0aATP 0aMetal ion 0aAdsorption 0aPhenol1 aZhang, Dongdong1 aZhao, Yiping1 aXie, Manman0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 May 20, v. 641 p.128479-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1284793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245024200161300001800403500002000421520141600441592002801857650002401885650003401909650002001943650000901963650001201972700002001984700005702004773012002061856007802181852000902259655001202268IND60608295120221122043225.0180807e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060829512DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2018000322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarlot, Léa10aComparison between centrifugal partition chromatography and preparative liquid chromatography as first dimensions in off‐line two‐dimensional separation: Application to the isolation of multi‐targeted compounds from Edelweiss plant  ap. 2011-2019.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPreparative two‐dimensional chromatography is gaining interest in the elucidation of complex samples as it allows the recovery of a large number of molecules without the risks inherent to tedious multi‐step sample preparation. While the second dimension is often selected to be liquid chromatography, it may be of interest to compare the specificities of two different techniques, namely liquid chromatography and centrifugal partition chromatography, to be used as first dimension. A fair comparison between off‐line CPCxLC and prepLCxLC in selective comprehensive mode for preparative purposes is carried out in this study, illustrated by the isolation of five compounds from high‐value Edelweiss plant. The method development of each configuration is achieved on laboratory scale instruments. The quality of separation is compared using 2D‐contour plots. The prepLCxLC exhibits a large separation space that leads to an overall large peak capacity, which is of great interest for complex samples. But its limited loading capacity involves a large number of ²D runs increasing the running costs for preparative purposes. On the other hand, CPCxLC provides a low peak capacity due to the poor efficiency provided by CPC. However, this liquid‐liquid technique can be finely tuned to generate a high selectivity, decreasing the number of runs necessary to produce a limited number of target solutes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeontopodium nivale 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aelectrophoresis 3arisk 3asolutes1 aBatteau, Magali1 aFaure, Karine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5416-49110 tElectrophoresis.g2018 Aug., v. 39, no. 15 p.2011-2019dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2018000323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245019900171520095700370592002801327650002501355650001701380650001901397650002501416650001701441650002001458650001701478650001401495650001701509650001601526650000701542650001501549650002001564650001601584653004201600653002501642653002501667700001901692700001901711700002101730773010501751856008701856852000901943655001201952IND60766410720221118171033.0220228e20220505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076641072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1284842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Kavita10aEffective biocatalyst developed via genipin mediated acetylcholinesterase immobilization on rice straw derived cellulose nanofibers for detection and bioremediation of organophosphorus pesticide  aThis study aims to utilize cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) derived from rice straw to immobilize acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and their effective use as fluorescent sensor cum biocatalyst for sensing and degradation of chlorpyrifos (CPF) into 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) and benign metabolites.

As compared to free enzyme, a better storage stability, higher endurance to change in pH and temperature and recyclability upto 20 cycles with 8% loss of activity was achieved. AChE@CFs effectively degraded CPF in 36 h.

The diamino-triazine ring facilitated the absorption of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules in the mixed monolayer. The diamino s-triazine ring-containing copolymers into which a hydrogenated hydrophobic chain was introduced were able to form mixed-phase-separated monolayers when combined with an s-triazine ring-containing fluorocarbon-based molecule with low molecular weight having no hydrophilic group. Hydrocarbon-based copolymers that formed side-chain crystals in the single-component monolayer influenced the steric hindrance of the diamino s-triazine ring and tended to be amorphous in the mixed film. However, the regularity along the c-axis direction was guaranteed, and introducing long-chain alkylated amphiphilic molecules enhanced the crystallinity and promoted the formation of circular domains. Comparatively, the fluorocarbon, which was amorphous in the single-component monolayer, promoted two-dimensional crystallization by enhancing the π-π interaction between the s-triazine rings in the phase-separated monolayer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aabsorption 3acomposite polymers 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular weight 3aperfluorocarbons 0aDNA 0aPFOS 0aLB 0aVDAT 0aOA 0aAIBN 0aAFM 0aXRD 0as-Triazine ring 0aComb copolymer 0aFluorocarbon 0aPhase separation 0aMixed monolayer 0aLangmuir-Blodgett film1 aShioda, Yoshiki1 aMaeda, Momo1 aFujimori, Atsuhiro0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 May 20, v. 641 p.128485-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1284853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01751naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009500170300001400265520072100279592002801000650001201028650001201040650001201052650001901064650001201083650001301095650002401108650001001132653001901142653002401161653001201185773011201197856008301309852000901392655001201401IND60544674220221118013302.0190426e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054467422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2015.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFortunato, Helena10aBryozoans in climate and ocean acidification research: A reappraisal of an under-used tool  ap. 32-44.  aBryozoans are colonial animals that are widely distributed in marine benthic environments and play an important role in temperate and cold-water oceanic shelves as habitat providers. Morphologically and mineralogically diverse, bryozoans are important carbonate producers with an extensive fossil record, which makes them good indicators in environmental and (paleo) environmental research. Existing data, though insufficient, suggests that bryozoans can become a valuable tool in investigating present-day climate change.

Physiologic responses to acute opioidergic blockade, indexed by cortisol changes and nausea, may represent indirect functional measures of opioid-mediated hedonic eating drive and predict weight loss following a mindfulness-based intervention for stress eating. In the current study, we tested whether cortisol and nausea responses induced by oral ingestion of an opioidergic antagonist (naltrexone) correlated with weight and self-report measures of hedonic eating and predicted changes in these measures following a mindfulness-based weight loss intervention. Obese women (N = 88; age = 46.7 ± 13.2 years; BMI = 35.8 ± 3.8) elected to complete an optional sub-study prior to a 5.5-month weight loss intervention with or without mindfulness training. On two separate days, participants ingested naltrexone and placebo pills, collected saliva samples, and reported nausea levels. Supporting previous findings, naltrexone-induced cortisol increases were associated with greater hedonic eating (greater food addiction symptoms and reward-driven eating) and less mindful eating. Among participants with larger cortisol increases (+1 SD above mean), mindfulness participants (relative to control participants) reported greater reductions in food addiction symptoms, b = −0.95, SE(b) = 0.40, 95% CI [−1.74, −0.15], p = .021. Naltrexone-induced nausea was marginally associated with reward-based eating. Among participants who endorsed naltrexone-induced nausea (n = 38), mindfulness participants (relative to control participants) reported greater reductions in food addiction symptoms, b = −1.00, 95% CI [−1.85, −0.77], p = .024, and trended toward reduced reward-based eating, binge eating, and weight, post-intervention. Single assessments of naltrexone-induced cortisol increases and nausea responses may be useful time- and cost-effective biological markers to identify obese individuals with greater opioid-mediated hedonic eating drive who may benefit from weight loss interventions with adjuvant mindfulness training that targets hedonic eating.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadjuvants 3aantagonists 3abinging 3abiomarkers 3abody mass index 3acortisol 3acost effectiveness 3aeating disorders 3anausea 3aobesity 3aplacebos 3asaliva 3aweight loss 3awomen 0aHedonic eating 0aMindfulness intervention 0aNaltrexone 0aCortisol 0aNausea1 aLustig, Robert H.1 aBrown, Rashida R.1 aAcree, Michael1 aBacchetti, Peter1 aMoran, Patricia J.1 aDallman, Mary1 aLaraia, Barbara1 aAdler, Nancy1 aHecht, Frederick M.1 aDaubenmier, Jennifer1 aEpel, Elissa S.0 tAppetite.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 91 p.311-320dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2015.04.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245010200161300002000263520176100283592002802044596006402072596006402136650001402200650002002214650001202234650001502246650003502261650002802296650001902324650001102343650001302354650001902367650000702386650002002393650001502413650001202428650001302440650001702453650001302470650001802483700001702501700001502518700005502533700001402588700001602602700001902618700001302637773016902650856008202819852000902901655001202910IND60637772920221118150409.0190424e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063777292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-04511-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Juan10aImpact of phosphate additive on organic carbon component degradation during pig manure composting  ap. 11805-11814.  aPhosphate, as an additive to composting, could significantly reduce ammonia emission and nitrogen loss but may also cause adverse effects on the degradation of organic matter. However, there is little information about the influence of pH change, salt content, and phosphate on different organic fraction degradation during composting with the addition of phosphate at a higher level. In this study, the equimolar phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), and dipotassium phosphate (K₂HPO₄) were added into pig manure composting with 0.25 mol mass per kilogram of dry matter basis addition amount to evaluate the effect of H⁺, PO₄³⁻, and salinity on carbon component transformation and organic matter degradation. The results showed that both H₃PO₄ and K₂HPO₄ additives could lead to shorter duration in the thermophilic phase, lower degradation of lignocellulose, and lesser carbon loss compared to CK, even though had different pH, i.e., acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. Besides, the addition of H₃PO₄, H₂SO₄, and K₂HPO₄ could increase the degradation of soluble protein and lipid during composting. Redundancy analysis demonstrated that the variation in different organic carbon fractions was significantly correlated with the changes of pH and the presence of PO₄³⁻, but not with SO₄²⁻ and electrical conductivity, suggesting that pH and phosphate were the more predominant factors than salinity for the inhibition of organic matter degradation. Taken together, as acidic phosphate addition produces a true advantage of controlling nitrogen loss and lower inhibition of organics transformation during composting, the expected effects may result in more efficient composting products.  aPublisher supplied data  a41275161cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  a2017M620801cPostdoctoral Research Foundation of China (CN) 3aadditives 3aadverse effects 3aammonia 3acomposting 3adipotassium hydrogen phosphate 3aelectrical conductivity 3alignocellulose 3alipids 3anitrogen 3aorganic carbon 3apH 3aphosphoric acid 3apig manure 3aprotons 3asalinity 3asalt content 3asulfates 3asulfuric acid1 aZhang, Aiguo1 aLi, Guoxue1 aWei, Yuquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1309-51391 aJia, Fuya1 aLiang, Ying1 aCheng, Yandong1 aLiu, Yan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Apr., v. 26, no. 12 p.11805-11814dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04511-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014400164300001600308500001500324520129200339592002801631650001401659650001201673650001601685650001801701650002501719650001501744650001401759650001201773650001101785650001501796650001501811650002701826650003001853650001301883650001101896653001501907700001601922700001501938700001401953700001601967773009801983856008102081990002302162852000902185655001202194IND60093141320221121172524.0141103e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009314132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Meiyan10aPerformance and mechanism of vermifiltration system for liquid-state sewage sludge treatment using molecular and stable isotopic techniques  ap. 143-150.  a2019-12-06  aPerformance and mechanism of a conventional biofilter (BF) and a vermifilter (VF) containing earthworms were studied for liquid-state sewage sludge treatment. Results showed that removal rates of the VF for suspended solid (SS), volatile SS, total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) and 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD₅) were higher than that of the BF. The effluent sludge of VF (ESVF) had lower N, C and H contents, with higher quantities of δ¹⁵N, δ¹³C and aromatic groups than that of BF (ESBF). Compared to ESBF, ESVF had higher activities of protease, glucosidase, lipase and amylase, and less densities of total bacteria, α-, β- and γ-proteobacteria. These indicated the presence of earthworm improved the treatment performance of the VF and promoted the stabilization of ESVF. Additionally, passage through the intestinal tract of earthworms caused a decrease in the densities of α- and β-proteobacteria, and an increase in the density of Nitrospira of the VF biofilms. Stable isotopic analyses implied that earthworm adults, hatchlings and cocoons appeared to be found in the highest position; hirudinea in the second highest position; gastropoda adults and larvae, diptera adults at intermediate level; diptera larvae in the lower position of food web in VF system.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood webs 3abiofilm 3aproteinases 3asewage sludge 3achemical engineering 3abiofilters 3aHirudinea 3acocoons 3aadults 3aintestines 3aearthworms 3achemical oxygen demand 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abacteria 3alarvae 0aNitrospira1 aLi, Xiaowei1 aYang, Jian1 aLv, Baoyi1 aLu, Yongsen0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 July 15, v. 197 p.143-150dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.05.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002000160245007100180300001600251500000900267520159300276592002801869650002701897650002101924650001801945700002201963700001901985773012202004852000902126856009702135655001202232IND8505198320221120101516.0191122e198503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND850519832DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1985.00021962007700020007x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, James A.10aEnhancing Germination of Indian Ricegrass Seeds with Sulfuric Acid  ap. 203-206.  aepub  aIndian ricegrass [Oryzopsis hymenoides (R. & S.) Ricker] is the dominant forage species on millions of hectares of rangeland in the western United States. Revegetation of degraded rangeland by seeding Indian ricegrass has been generally unsuccessful because of low seed germination. Our purpose was to evaluate the influence of acid seed scarification on germination of Indian ricepass seeds. Seeds of ‘Paloma’ and ‘NezPar’ Indian ricegrass were scarified in sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) from 0 through 45 min at 5-min intervals. Without scarification, germination of the seeds of these two cultivars was less than 10%. Seedlots from 1 to 11 years old were treated. Germination data were used to develop regression equations for the relationship between duration of acid seed scarification and germination for each cultivar. Seeds of Paloma Indian ricegrass required 25 to 35 min of scarification, whereas seeds of NezPar required 15 to 25 min scarification. The relative composition and morphological forms of the seed may explain the difference in duration of required scarification. The scarified seeds were incubated at 55 constant and alternating temperatures to obtain data with which to construct quadratic response surfaces for temperature-germination profiles. Even with scarification, the seeds of the two cultivars produced mean germination for the profiles of only 9 to 31%. The dormancy of Indian ricegrass seeds is controlled by complex interacting factors. Acid scarification is a very imprecise tool for enhancing the germination of dormant seeds of Indian ricegrass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchnatherum hymenoides 3aseed germination 3asulfuric acid1 aEvans, Raymond A.1 aEasi, Debra A.0 tAgronomy journal.g1985 Mar., v. 77, no. 2 p.203-206dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1985.00021962007700020007x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01769naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003100144245008300175300001800258500002000276520068200296592002800978650002501006650001701031650002001048650002401068650002301092650001601115700003801131700001901169700003601188773012001224856007801344852000901422655001201431IND60608295420221122043019.0180807e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060829542DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2017003992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez‐Seoane, Paula10aPressurized hot water extraction of β‐glucans from Cantharellus tubaeformis  ap. 1892-1898.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCantharellus tubaeformis was processed by pressurized hot water extraction (80–240°C) with the aim of maximizing the extraction of oligomeric fractions, β‐glucans, and the in vitro antioxidant properties of the extracts.

Three hundred thirty day-old Ross 308 male broiler chicks assigned to six treatments in a completely randomised design experiment with a factorial arrangement (2 × 3) and five replicates of 11 chicks each. The treatments included two levels of dietary probiotic supplementation (0 and 1 × 10¹⁰ CFU lactic acid/kg of diet) and three levels (0%, 1%, and 2%) of DW supplemented with vinegar (5% acetic acid concentration). The study lasted from 1 to 42 d. Growth performance, meat yields and lymphoid organs relative weight, humoral and cellular immune responses, and small intestine histomorphometry were measured. The average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) during 1–10 days of age significantly decreased in the birds that fed supplemented diet with probiotic and drunk supplemented water with vinegar than the birds fed and drunk free of any additive. Experimental treatments did not have a significant effect on performance during other growth periods, carcase yields, and lymphoid organs relative weight. DW supplemented with vinegar significantly increased villus height (VH), crypt depth (CD) and decreased small intestine muscular thickness (MT) and abdominal fat. Dietary supplementation of probiotic significantly improved immune response to sheep red blood cell (SRBC) inoculation. In conclusion, this study confirms beneficial effects of probiotic and vinegar on 1–10 d performance, immune and intestine health of broiler chickens.  aWe greatly appreciate the financial support of this research from vice president of research at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran (Project code: 3/30644).  aPublisher supplied data  a3/30644cFerdowsi University of Mashhad 3aabdominal fat 3aacetic acid 3adietary supplements 3aerythrocytes 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3ahistology 3aimmune response 3alactic acid 3amales 3ameat 3aprobiotics 3asheep 3asmall intestine 3avilli 3avinegars 0aBroiler chickens 0aperformance 0aintestine morphology 0avinegar1 aGhodraty, Javad1 aZarghi, Heydar1 aSaadatfar, Zohre1 aKermanshahi, Hassan1 aEdalatian Dovom, Mohammad Reza0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2018 July 3, v. 17, no. 3 p.675-685dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2018.14245703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01970naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009400158300001600252520068400268592002800952650002100980650001301001650001101014650001501025650001801040650001401058650001801072650001401090650000901104650002201113650001201135651001101147700001501158700001701173700001401190700001601204700001801220700001801238700001701256700001401273773014201287856007401429852000901503655001201512IND60661988120221118114700.0190904e20110209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066198812DNAL7 a10.1039/c0em00407c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPourcelot, L.10aIsotopic evidence of natural uranium and spent fuel uranium releases into the environment  ap. 355-361.  aUranium and plutonium isotopes were measured in soils, sediments and waters in an area subject to the past and present discharges from the uranium conversion plant of Malvési (France).

Such findings contribute to improve the monitoring of the actinides releases by nuclear fuel facilities (mining sites, conversion, enrichment and fuel plants, reprocessing plants).  aPublisher supplied data 3aindustrial sites 3aisotopes 3amining 3amonitoring 3anuclear fuels 3aplutonium 3aradionuclides 3asediments 3asoil 3atracer techniques 3auranium 3aFrance1 aBoulet, B.1 aLe Corre, C.1 aLoyen, J.1 aFayolle, C.1 aTournieux, D.1 aVan Hecke, W.1 aMartinez, B.1 aPetit, J.0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2011 Feb. 9, v. 13, no. 2 p.355-361dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0em00407c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015000169300001600319520149700335592002801832596006001860650001601920650001701936650001701953650001701970650001901987650001602006650001602022650001302038650001902051650001802070650000802088650002602096650001602122650001002138650002202148650002502170650001602195651001002211651002402221700002202245700005602267773011202323856008302435852000902518655001202527IND60755384720221123015857.0211031e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075538472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10453-021-09715-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Aman Deep10aSeasonal bioaerosol load and statistical analysis within different microenvironments of an academic institute situated in the Indo-Gangetic Plain  ap. 663-680.  aBioaerosols have gained importance in atmospheric sciences in the past few decades. Their exposure upsurges the health problems in sensitive population and is also known to participate in atmospheric chemistry. The present study assesses the monthly distribution of bioaerosol load at four different microenvironments inside an academic institute in Kanpur situated in Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). The study duration was from November 2017 to April 2018. The measured total bioaerosol concentrations were highest during April (418–610 CFU/m³) at all sites followed by the post-monsoon month of November (369–577 CFU/m³). The winter period showed low concentrations with lowest concentration obtained in January (251–419 CFU/m³). The indoor–outdoor (I/O) bioaerosol ratio was mostly less than one for bacteria depending on microenvironment, but for fungi it was always less than one. The Gram-positive bacteria (GPB) comprised 70–80% of total bacterial concentration, while Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) contributed 20–30% to bacterial concentration in ambient air. The bacterial genera were mostly dominated by Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, while the fungal genera of Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhizopus, Cladosporium, Basidiobolus, and Epidermophyton were seen in the campus. The statistical analysis showed a weak positive correlation of bioaerosol concentration with meteorological parameters: temperature and relative humidity (RH).  aPublisher supplied data  aEMR/2016/005596cScience and Engineering Research Board 3aAspergillus 3aBasidiobolus 3aCladosporium 3aEnterococcus 3aEpidermophyton 3aMicrococcus 3aPenicillium 3aRhizopus 3aStaphylococcus 3aStreptococcus 3aair 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abioaerosols 3afungi 3arelative humidity 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3aIndia 3aIndo-Gangetic Plain1 aSrivastava, Vivek1 aGupta, Tarun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0982-29270 tAerobiologia.g2021 Dec., v. 37, no. 4 p.663-680dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870027x0393-59657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10453-021-09715-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245016300161300002000324520122500344592002801569650002201597650002201619650001701641650002101658650002801679650001001707650003301717650003701750650002001787653001801807653001601825653001901841653003001860653003701890653002001927700001701947700002201964700001801986700001802004700001802022773012502040856008002165852000902245655001202254IND60528290020221118004959.0160716e20150520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052829002DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b019702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandhu, Sana10aUltratrace Detection of Nitroaromatics: Picric Acid Responsive Aggregation/Disaggregation of Self-Assembled p-Terphenylbenzimidazolium-Based Molecular Baskets  ap. 10491-10500.  a1-(p-Terphenyl)-benzimidazolium (TRIPOD-TP) molecules undergo self-assembly to form rodlike structures in aqueous medium, as shown by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering studies. Upon gradual addition of picric acid (PA), these aggregates undergo an aggregation/disaggregation process to complex morphological structures (10–¹²–10–¹⁰ M PA) and spherical aggregates (10–⁹–10–⁸ M PA). These spherical aggregates undergo further dissolution to well-dispersed spheres between 10–⁷–10–⁶ M PA. During fluorescence studies, these aggregates demonstrate superamplified fluorescence quenching (>97%) in the presence of 10–⁵ to 0.2 equiv of the probe concentration, an unprecedented process with PA. The lowest detection limits by solution of TRIPOD-TP are 5 × 10–¹³ PA, 50 × 10–¹² M 2,4-dinitrophenol, 200 × 10–¹² M 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, and 1 nM 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Paper strips dipped in the solution of TRIPOD-TP demonstrate quantitative fluorescence quenching between 10–¹⁷ and 10–⁶ M PA using front-surface steady state studies and can measure as low as 2.29 × 10–²⁰ g/cm² PA.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dinitrophenol 3achemical elements 3afluorescence 3alight scattering 3anitroaromatic compounds 3apaper 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atrinitrotoluene 0aself-assembly 0aaggregation 0adisaggregation 0anitro-aromatic explosives 0aamplified fluorescence quenching 0avapor detection1 aRahul Kumar,1 aSingh, Prabhpreet1 aMahajan, Aman1 aKaur, Manmeet1 aKumar, Subodh0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 May 20, v. 7, no. 19 p.10491-10500dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b019703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001700167245007500184300001600259500000900275520094300284592002801227650001001255650002101265650001401286650002101300650002201321650002301343650003201366650001101398650002001409650001301429650001401442650001201456650001401468773012301482852000901605856009701614655001201711991599118180742620221121092208.0191122e197309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7392231922DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1973.00021962006500050053x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYates, R.

GA induced the typical growth stimulation, lasting: about 4 weeks in these trials. MCPA induced a transient growth stimulation (lasting only one week) followed by growth retardation. The coadministration of MCPA sharply curtailed the growth response to GA. Suitable combinations increased stem weights without reducing the ,concentration of total sugars, and induced “ripening” by causing the conversion of reducingsugars to sucrose. Such coadministration appears worthy of field-testing under conditions which favor high levels of reducing-sugars in the cane; in contrast to the probable effects of growth retardants, this mixture should not introduce any penalty of reduced weight of cane.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-CPA 3aMCPA (herbicide) 3aSaccharum 3agibberellic acid 3agrowth inhibitors 3agrowth retardation 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aleaves 3areducing sugars 3aripening 3ascreening 3asucrose 3asugarcane0 tAgronomy journal.g1973 Sept., v. 65, no. 5 p.844-845dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1973.00021962006500050053x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02790naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013600166300001500302520133500317592002801652650002101680650002201701650001101723650001101734650001601745650001401761650001901775650002301794650001301817650001101830650001501841650001201856650002001868651001201888653001301900653001301913653002001926653002001946653001601966653001701982700002001999700002402019700001602043700002002059773011302079856008302192852000902275655001202284IND60544674620221118013442.0190426e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054467462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2015.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerard, Trika10aIsotopic signatures in the otoliths of reef-associated fishes of southern Florida: Linkages between nursery grounds and coral reefs  ap. 95-104.  aEcologically and economically important coral reef fishes are believed to migrate to reefs from juvenile nursery areas such as sea grass and mangrove habitats. Little is known about the migration corridors that exist between nursery and coral reefs, or the timing of these migrations. This study investigated the possibility of identifying connections between juvenile nursery areas and nearby coral reef adult habitats using stable isotope analysis of the otoliths of gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus) (n= 71) and yellowtail snapper (Ocyuruschrysurus) (n=60), collected from 10 sites along the Florida Keys coral reef tract in 2003. Measurements of carbon and oxygen isotope ratios were compared to existing isotopic signatures of juvenile snapper from nursery areas around southern Florida. Data showed overlap for 13C and 18Oisotope measurements for the juvenile portion of sub-adult otoliths to isotope values for the middle and lower Florida Keys regions, thereby suggesting a migratory connection. Specific nursery habitats contributed approximately 93 % of individuals sampled for yellowtail and approximately 98 % for gray snapper to the Florida Keys coral reef tract. Results from this study indicate locally important source regions and habitats for the successful recruitment of fish to the Florida Keys coral reef tract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLutjanus griseus 3aOcyurus chrysurus 3aadults 3acarbon 3acoral reefs 3ajuveniles 3amarine science 3amigratory behavior 3aotoliths 3aoxygen 3aseagrasses 3asnapper 3astable isotopes 3aFlorida 0aOtoliths 0aSnappers 0aStable isotopes 0aNursery habitat 0aCoral reefs 0aConnectivity1 aMalca, Estrella1 aMuhling, Barbara A.1 aMateo, Ivan1 aLamkin, John T.0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2015 Nov., v. 2 p.95-104dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2015.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03645naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245016200163300002000325520184500345592002802190596006502218596006902283596005402352650001702406650001602423650001702439650001702456650001602473650001602489650002102505650001302526650001202539650002602551650001502577650004202592650001802634650002602652650001302678650001702691650001002708650001802718700001802736700002002754700001602774700001802790700001602808700001902824773016902843856008203012852000903094655001203103IND60637773420221118150415.0190424e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063777342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-04605-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Ying10aEffects of operating parameters on in situ NH3 emission control during kitchen waste composting and correlation analysis of the related microbial communities  ap. 11756-11766.  aAmmonia emission during composting results in anthropogenic odor nuisance and reduces the agronomic value of the compost due to the loss of nitrogen. Adjusting the operating parameters during composting is an emerging in situ odor control technique that is cheap and highly efficient. The effects of in situ NH₃ emission control were investigated in this study by simultaneously adjusting key operating parameters (such as C/N ratio, aeration rate, and moisture content) during the composting processes (C1–C9). Results showed that the average NH₃ emission concentrations for different treatments were in the order of C1 > C4 > C2 > C5 > C3 > C6 > C7 > C8 > C9. The total content of NH₃ emission (21.02 g/kg) in C9 (C/N ratio = 35, aeration rate = 15 L/min, and moisture content = 60%) was much lower than that (65.95 g/kg) in C1 (C/N ratio = 15, aeration rate = 5 L/min, and moisture content = 60%). The nitrogen loss ratio was 27.36% for C1, while 16.15% for C9. The microbial diversity and abundance in C9 and C1 were compared using high-throughput sequencing. The relationship between NH₃ emission, operating parameters, and the related functional microbial communities was also investigated. Results revealed that Nitrosospira, Nitrosomonas, Nitrobacter, Pseudomonas, Methanosaeta, Rhodobacter, Paracoccus, and Sphingobacterium were negatively related to NH₃ emission. According to the above results, the optimal values for different operating parameters for the in situ NH₃ control during kitchen waste composting were, respectively, moisture content of 70%, C/N ratio of 35, and aeration rate of 15 L/min, with the order of effectiveness from high to low being aeration rate > C/N > moisture. This information could be used as a valuable reference for the in situ NH₃ emission control during kitchen waste composting.  aPublisher supplied data  a20160533B78cThe social development project of Hangzhou City  aLY14E080020cThe Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province  a41001147cThe Natural Science Foundation of China 3aMethanosaeta 3aNitrobacter 3aNitrosomonas 3aNitrosospira 3aPseudomonas 3aRhodobacter 3aSphingobacterium 3aaeration 3aammonia 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acomposting 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3akitchen waste 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3aodor control 3aodors 3awater content1 aWei, Jiaojiao1 aXiong, Junsheng1 aZhou, Bowei1 aCai, Hanjiang1 aZhu, Weiqin1 aZhang, Hangjun0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Apr., v. 26, no. 12 p.11756-11766dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04605-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245010600179300001600285520105200301592002801353650001601381650002301397650002001420650003101440650001701471650003601488650001401524650001901538700001701557700002701574700002001601700002601621700001701647700001901664700001501683700001601698700002101714700002001735700001701755700001801772700002001790700001801810700002301828773007401851856008201925852000902007655001202016IND60551709320221120035017.0161019e20150409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055170932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2015.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKravtsova-Ivantsiv, Yelena10aKPC1-Mediated Ubiquitination and Proteasomal Processing of NF-κB1 p105 to p50 Restricts Tumor Growth  ap. 333-347.  aNF-κB is a key transcriptional regulator involved in inflammation and cell proliferation, survival, and transformation. Several key steps in its activation are mediated by the ubiquitin (Ub) system. One uncharacterized step is limited proteasomal processing of the NF-κB1 precursor p105 to the p50 active subunit. Here, we identify KPC1 as the Ub ligase (E3) that binds to the ankyrin repeats domain of p105, ubiquitinates it, and mediates its processing both under basal conditions and following signaling. Overexpression of KPC1 inhibits tumor growth likely mediated via excessive generation of p50. Also, overabundance of p50 downregulates p65, suggesting that a p50-p50 homodimer may modulate transcription in place of the tumorigenic p50-p65. Transcript analysis reveals increased expression of genes associated with tumor-suppressive signals. Overall, KPC1 regulation of NF-κB1 processing appears to constitute an important balancing step among the stimulatory and inhibitory activities of the transcription factor in cell growth control.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ainflammation 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3aubiquitin 3aubiquitination1 aShomer, Inna1 aCohen-Kaplan, Victoria1 aSnijder, Berend1 aSuperti-Furga, Giulio1 aGonen, Hedva1 aSommer, Thomas1 aZiv, Tamar1 aAdmon, Arie1 aNaroditsky, Inna1 aJbara, Muhammad1 aBrik, Ashraf1 aPikarsky, Eli1 aKwon, Yong Tae1 aDoweck, Ilana1 aCiechanover, Aaron0 tCell.g2015 Apr. 09, v. 161 p.333-347dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03802naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245019600164300001600360520216500376592002802541650001502569650001402584650001502598650003002613650001402643650001202657650001502669650002002684650001102704650002902715650002502744650001502769650001902784650001702803650002202820650001202842650001802854650001502872650001402887651001802901651002202919700001502941700001802956700002402974700002702998700002203025773014203047856007403189852000903263655001203272IND60661988420221118114647.0190904e20110405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066198842DNAL7 a10.1039/c0em00410c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarmendia, Larraitz10aApplication of a battery of biomarkers in mussel digestive gland to assess long-term effects of the Prestige oil spill in Galicia and Bay of Biscay: Tissue-level biomarkers and histopathology  ap. 915-932.  aIn order to assess the biological effects of the Prestige oil spill (POS), mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, were collected in 22 localities along the North coast of the Iberian Peninsula over 3 years (April 2003–April 2006). Different tissue-level biomarkers including cell type composition (volume density of basophilic cells, VvBAS) in digestive gland epithelium, structural changes of digestive alveoli (mean luminal radius to mean epithelial thickness, MLR/MET) and histopathological alterations (prevalence and intensity) of the digestive gland were analysed. Severe alterations in the general condition of the digestive gland tissue were observed all over the study area up to 2004–2005. High VvBAS values were recorded mainly in Galicia but also to a lesser extent in the Bay of Biscay in 2003–2004. Atrophy of the digestive alveoli, measured in terms of MLR/MET, was detected all along the studied area up to 2006. Inflammatory responses cannot be related to pollution due to the POS: (a) prevalence and intensity of focal hemocytic infiltration were higher in the Bay of Biscay than in Galicia but they did not show a clear temporal trend; (b) high intensities of brown cell aggregates were only sporadically recorded; and (c) granulocytomas were more frequently recorded in the Bay of Biscay than in Galicia and especially in localities (i.e. Arrigunaga) subjected to chronic pollution. Likewise, Marteilia, trematodes, intracellular ciliates, unidentified eosinophilic bodies, R/CLO and Mytilicola did not follow any recognisable pattern that could be associated to the POS. In contrast, high Nematopsis intensities recorded in several localities in 2003 might suggest some response of local interest after the POS (i.e., in combination with particular factors/conditions). More data at a regional scale are needed before histopathology may provide a reliable ecosystem health assessment but the present results suggest that the approach is worthwhile. Overall, although VvBAS returned to reference values by 2004–2005, MLR/MET values indicated that the mussel health condition was affected during the whole study period up to April 2006.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiliophora 3aMarteilia 3aMytilicola 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3aTrematoda 3aatrophy 3abiomarkers 3acell aggregates 3acoasts 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental health 3aepithelium 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3along term effects 3amussels 3anormal values 3aoil spills 3apollution 3aBay of Biscay 3aIberian Peninsula1 aSoto, Manu1 aVicario, Unai1 aKim, Y.q(Yungkul),1 aCajaraville, Miren P.,1 aMarigómez, Ionan0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2011 Apr. 5, v. 13, no. 4 p.915-932dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0em00410c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005300152245013700205300001600342520137100358592002801729650001501757650003201772650001901804650002401823650001101847650001101858650001501869650001701884653003801901653003001939653002501969653004401994653002102038700001702059700001502076700001902091700005402110700005602164700001802220773009802238856008702336852000902423655001202432IND60637442520221119010003.0191214e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063744252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSui, Quan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8251-235710aOptimal use of electric energy oriented water-electricity combined supply system for the building-integrated-photovoltaics community  ap. 549-558.  aAs a new application form of sustainable energy generation, building-integrated photovoltaics provide great flexibility for energy conservation and emission reduction. However, due to the randomness and volatility from photovoltaic generation, the full exploitation of the advantages of building-integrated photovoltaics has become an important question for the utilities. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel and comprehensive (combined) water-energy supply system applied to the smart community with building-integrated photovoltaics and two-stage electric-hydraulic dispatching method. It was designed to minimize the electricity consumption cost and power fluctuation while meeting the water demand loads, followed by the iterative algorithm as well as linearized techniques to solve the optimisation model. The Shapley value method was introduced to ensure the fair revenue between the property company and owners. Simulation studies on a building-integrated-photovoltaics community and a 15-node water distribution system indicates that the annual operation cost of the water-electricity combined supply system was reduced by 29.6% while the external grid obtained a better prediction regarding the real-time exchange power. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model on peak shaving and valley filling and fluctuation smoothing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectric power 3aenergy conservation 3aincome 3amodels 3aprediction 3asolar energy 0aBuilding-integrated photovoltaics 0aWater distribution system 0aShapley value method 0aElectric-hydraulic combined dispatching 0aIterative method1 aWei, Fanrong1 aZhang, Rui1 aLin, Xiangning1 aTong, Ning1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1016-19351 aWang, Zhixun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2886-94591 aLi, Zhengtian0 tApplied energy.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 247 p.549-558dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03791naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011800170300001800288520213100306592002802437650003002465650001502495650001102510650002902521650001202550650001202562650001402574650002102588650001402609650002802623650001302651650001602664650001302680650001902693650001702712650001502729650001402744650000702758650001402765650001302779650001102792650002102803650001202824650002702836650001802863650002802881650001502909651001002924700001802934700001702952700001402969700001802983700001403001773010503015856004803120852000903168655001203177IND50061039720221120134924.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006103972DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-012-1658-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Abhay Kumar10aHydrogeochemical processes and quality assessment of groundwater in Dumka and Jamtara districts, Jharkhand, India  ap. 2175-2191.  aThe hydrogeochemical study of groundwater in Dumka and Jamtara districts has been carried out to assess the major ion chemistry, hydrogeochemical processes and groundwater quality for domestic and irrigation uses. Thirty groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness, anions (F⁻, Cl⁻, NO₃ ⁻, HCO₃ ⁻, SO₄ ²⁻) and cations (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺, K⁺). The analytical results show the faintly alkaline nature of water and dominance of Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ in cationic and HCO₃ ⁻ and Cl⁻ in anionic abundance. The concentrations of alkaline earth metals (Ca²⁺ + Mg²⁺) exceed the alkali metals (Na⁺ + K⁺) and HCO₃ ⁻ dominates over SO₄ ²⁻ + Cl⁻ concentrations in the majority of the groundwater samples. Ca–Mg–HCO₃ is the dominant hydrogeochemical facies in 60 % of the groundwater samples, while 33 % samples occur as a mixed chemical character of Ca–Mg–Cl hydrogeochemical facies. The water chemistry is largely controlled by rock weathering and ion exchange processes with secondary contribution from anthropogenic sources. The inter-elemental correlations and factor and cluster analysis of hydro-geochemical database suggest combined influence of carbonate and silicate weathering on solute acquisition processes. For quality assessment, analyzed parameter values were compared with Indian and WHO water quality standards. In majority of the samples, the analyzed parameters are well within the desirable limits and water is potable for drinking purposes. Total hardness and concentrations of TDS, Cl⁻, NO₃ ⁻ , Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ exceed the desirable limits at a few sites, however, except NO₃ ⁻ all these values were below the highest permissible limits. The calculated parameters such as sodium adsorption ratio, percent sodium (%Na) and residual sodium carbonate revealed excellent to good quality of groundwater for agricultural purposes, except at few sites where salinity and magnesium hazard (MH) values exceeds the prescribed limits and demands special management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadsorption 3aanions 3aanthropogenic activities 3acalcium 3acations 3achlorides 3acluster analysis 3adatabases 3aelectrical conductivity 3afluorine 3agroundwater 3ahardness 3ahydrochemistry 3aion exchange 3airrigation 3amagnesium 3apH 3apotassium 3asalinity 3asodium 3asodium carbonate 3asolutes 3atotal dissolved solids 3awater quality 3awater quality standards 3aweathering 3aIndia1 aMondal, G.

In this study, we evaluated the renal protective effect and possible mechanism of eleutheroside B. In order to solve the allergic reactions, side effects, and low oral bioavailability of eleutheroside B, we successfully prepared PLGA (poly [lactic‐co‐glycolic acid])–eleutheroside B nanoparticles (NPs) with the diameter of about 128 nm. In vitro and in vivo results showed that eleutheroside B could inhibit expression levels of α‐smooth muscle actin (α‐SMA) and collagen I. Molecular docking results showed that eleutheroside B bound to Smad3 and significantly decreased the expression of phospho‐Smad3 (p‐Smad3). Silencing Smad3 reversed the fibrotic protective effect of eleutheroside B in HK2 cells. Furthermore, small animal imaging showed that NPs can selectively accumulate in the UUO kidneys of mice, and retention time reached as long as 7 days. In conclusion, our results suggested that eleutheroside B is a potential drug to protect renal fibrosis and PLGA–eleutheroside B NPs could facilitate specific targeted therapy for renal fibrosis.  aPublisher supplied data  aKJ2020A0155cNatural Science Project of Anhui Universities Fund 3aactin 3abioavailability 3acollagen 3adrugs 3afibrosis 3akidney diseases 3amuscles 3aphytotherapy 3aprotective effect 3arenoprotective effect 3aresearch1 aLiu, Qixia1 aYang, Jing1 aKan, Min1 aJin, Rui1 aPu, Tian1 aYang, Yaru1 aXing, Tian1 aMeng, Xiaoming1 aZang, Hongmei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5370-84220 tPhytotherapy research.g2021 Nov., v. 35, no. 11 p.6401-6416dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.72933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009500169300001600264520165600280592002801936650002501964650001401989650002402003650003102027650002002058650001002078650001102088650001502099653003202114653002302146653003302169700002002202700001902222700001602241773009802257856008702355852000902442655001202451IND60637442620221119005728.0191214e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063744262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucchini, T.10aModeling advanced combustion modes in compression ignition engines with tabulated kinetics  ap. 537-548.  aNew combustion modes for compression ignition engines are currently under investigation to achieve a further reduction noxious emissions and fuel consumption. Among them, partially premixed (PPC or PCCI) and dual fuel combustion (including RCCI) seem to be the most promising technologies. To support the design of new combustion systems, rapid and accurate models are required to correctly describe the fuel auto-ignition chemistry together with the complex structure of the diffusion flame due to the presence of different fuel jets. A combustion model based on tabulated kinetics was developed and presented in this work. Reaction rates and chemical composition are stored in a lookup table which is generated by processing results of auto-ignition calculations in a homogeneous reactor. Multi-component fuels are supported and the use of virtual species allows an easy integration with the Lagrangian spray model. Compared to approaches where chemical direct integration is employed, tabulated kinetics offers reduced computational time with a very similar level of accuracy such that it is suitable to be applied for engine design. The proposed approach was implemented in the Lib-ICE code which based on the OpenFOAM® technology. Validation was carried out considering conventional Diesel, PCCI and dual-fuel combustion. Satisfactory results were achieved, the proposed approach correctly predicted in-cylinder pressure development and pollutant formation in a wide range of operating conditions. The results also show that the model is consistent with energy conservation and can be applied in design phases of different engine configurations.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3aemissions 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy use and consumption 3afuel combustion 3afuels 3amodels 3apollutants 0aInternal combustion engines 0aTabulated kinetics 0aComputational fluid dynamics1 aDella Torre, A.1 aD’Errico, G.1 aOnorati, A.0 tApplied energy.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 247 p.537-548dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245009900210300001600309520172500325592002802050650001402078650001402092650001702106650002102123650001102144650001802155650000902173700006002182700007102242700006202313700006402375700002002439700006202459773011202521856008302633852000902716655001202725IND60755385220221123015800.0211031e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075538522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10453-021-09726-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTegart, Lachlan J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2727-397610a‘Pollen potency’: the relationship between atmospheric pollen counts and allergen exposure  ap. 825-841.  aPollen allergies are responsible for a considerable global public health burden, and understanding exposure is critical to addressing the health impacts. Atmospheric pollen counts are routinely used as a predictor of risk; however, immune responses are triggered by specific proteins known as allergens, which occur both within and on the surface of the pollen grain. The ratio between atmospheric pollen counts and allergen concentrations (‘pollen potency’) has been shown to be inconsistent, with potentially important implications for pollen monitoring practice. Despite this, there has been no previous synthesis of the literature and our understanding of the factors that influence pollen potency remains poor. We conducted a scoping review with the aim of deriving a current understanding of: (a) the factors that influence pollen potency; (b) its variation through time, between taxa and by location; and (c) the implications for pollen monitoring practice. Our synthesis found that pollen potency is highly variable within and between seasons, and between locations; however, much of this variability remains unexplained and has not been deeply investigated. We found no predictable pollen potency patterns relating to taxon, geography or time, and inconclusive evidence regarding possible driving factors. With respect to human health, the studies in our synthesis generally reported larger associations between atmospheric allergen loads and allergy symptoms than whole pollen counts. This suggests that pollen potency influences public health risk; however, the evidence base remains limited. Further research is needed to better understand both pollen potency variability and its implications for health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergens 3ageography 3ahuman health 3ahypersensitivity 3apollen 3apublic health 3arisk1 aJohnston, Fay H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5150-86781 aBorchers Arriagada, Nicolas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8973-56921 aWorkman, Annabelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4403-614X1 aDickinson, Joanne L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4621-17031 aGreen, Brett J.1 aJones, Penelope J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4880-67110 tAerobiologia.g2021 Dec., v. 37, no. 4 p.825-841dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870027x0393-59657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10453-021-09726-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01809naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245009400158300002000252520067000272592002800942650001400970650001500984650001000999650002201009650001701031650002201048653001601070653001801086653002201104653001601126700001401142700001601156700001701172700001901189773012801208856007801336852000901414655001201423IND60528290420221118005012.0160716e20150520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052829042DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b020112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Juan10aLet It Shine: A Transparent and Photoluminescent Foldable Nanocellulose/Quantum Dot Paper  ap. 10076-10079.  aExploration of environmentally friendly light-emitting devices with extremely low weight has been a trend in recent decades for modern digital technology. Herein, we describe a simple suction filtration method to develop a transparent and photoluminescent nanocellulose (NC) paper, which contains ZnSe quantum dot (QD) with high quantum yield as a functional filler. ZnSe QD can be dispersed uniformly in NC, and a quite low coefficient of thermal expansion is determined for the resultant composite paper, suggesting its good dimensional stability. These results indicate that the meeting of NC with ZnSe QD can bring a brilliant future during the information age.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3afiltration 3apaper 3aphotoluminescence 3aquantum dots 3athermal expansion 0aquantum dot 0ananocellulose 0aphotoluminescence 0aflexibility1 aSong, Fei1 aYin, Xue-wu1 aWang, Xiu-li1 aWang, Yu-zhong0 tACS applied materials .g2015 May 20, v. 7, no. 19 p.10076-10079dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b020113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245013700181300001800318500001400336520149000350536017001840592002802010596008002038650002602118650001202144650001502156650001502171650001302186650002002199650002002219650001202239650000902251650001202260650003602272650002602308650001602334650001202350650001402362653002102376653001102397700003402408700002102442700002602463700003002489700002302519700003502542773012802577856008502705852000902790655001202799IND60694486820221121185655.0200513e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069448682DNAL7 a10.1080/1828051X.2018.14263962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenturini, Francine Perri10aEffects of different stunning methods on blood markers and enzymatic activity of stress responses of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)  ap. 1094-1098.  aNAL-light  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate less stressful stunning methods for tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). A preliminary experiment was performed to elect a chemical anaesthetic to be used as control in the following electronarcosis assays. Fish (498.8 ± 16.7 g) were submitted to four treatments: 1 (T1) and 2 minutes (T2) of electronarcosis at 205 volts and 10.8 amperes; and immersion in benzocaine (TB) and eugenol (TE), both at 100 mg L⁻¹. After plasma stress biomarkers evaluation, that is, ammonia, glucose and lactate, and considering use safety, eugenol was elected as control anaesthetic method. In the second experiment, fish were submitted to three electronarcosis frequencies: 400 (T400), 800 (T800) and 1200 (T1200) Hz, all of them at 203 V, ∼3.3 A for 15 sec. After electronarcosis, plasma lactate was increased by 121 and 146% in fish submitted to T400 and T800, respectively, when compared to control. Ammonia and glucose did not depict significant differences. White muscle catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities were also assessed. Catalase activity augmented in the measure of 25% in T400 and T800, while GR activity was increased in the measure of 41, 43 and 29% for T400, T800 and T1200, respectively. Boosts of 50 and 38% in LDH activity were observed in T400 and T800 groups. Our findings suggest that higher frequency (T1200) electronarcosis improves O. niloticus welfare during slaughter.  aThe authors would like to thank National Council for Scientific and Technological Development – CNPq – for the financial support (Project number: 401417/2014-0).  aPublisher supplied data  a401417/2014-0cNational Council of Technological and Scientific Development 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aammonia 3abenzocaine 3abiomarkers 3acatalase 3aelectronarcosis 3aenzyme activity 3aeugenol 3afish 3aglucose 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alactic acid 3amuscles 3aslaughter 0astunning methods 0astress1 aVargas Baldi, Sheyla Cristina1 aParisi, Giuliana1 aCosta, Thayssa Duarte1 aRucinque, Daniel Santiago1 aPires Melo, Mariza1 aViegas, Elisabete Maria Macedo0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2018 Oct. 2, v. 17, no. 4 p.1094-1098dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2018.14263963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245009200163300001400255520103200269592002801301650001901329650000901348650001501357650002201372650002901394650002601423650001701449650001101466650002001477650001501497650002101512650001401533650001901547651001001566653003001576653002401606653002201630653001901652653002201671653002101693700001301714700001801727700001801745773010601763856008501869852000901954655001201963IND60582485820221117020720.0200607e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058248582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Dan10aLife cycle analysis of direct and indirect coal liquefaction for vehicle power in China  ap. 42-49.  aIn the present paper, life cycle analysis of several typical coal liquefaction technical routes for vehicle power in China is performed with full considerations of environmental pollutants (e.g. SO₂ and NOₓ), greenhouse gas emissions, costs, and energy efficiency. Direct and indirect coal liquefactions are discussed in detail with comparisons of several different technical routes (e.g. different transportation methods and liquefaction factory locations). Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of three direct coal liquefaction routes is performed with a focus on the transportation distance and vehicle internal combustion engine efficiency. Our analysis shows that the direct coal liquefaction with railway distribution is the best technical route among all the routes investigated, which could significantly reduce the emissions of CO₂, the production costs with acceptable energy efficiency. Generally speaking, the coal liquefaction factory should be located at the coal mining area to minimize the costs of products.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3acombustion 3aenergy efficiency 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alife cycle assessment 3aliquefaction 3amining 3anitrogen oxides 3apollutants 3aproduction costs 3arailroads 3asulfur dioxide 3aChina 0aCoal chemical engineering 0aLife cycle analysis 0aCoal liquefaction 0aCoal-to-liquid 0aEnergy efficiency 0aProduction costs1 aYe, Chao1 aRen, Xiangkun1 aZhang, Yuning0 tFuel processing technology.g2018 Jan., v. 169 p.42-49dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009400166500002200260500002200282520173200304592002802036650002002064650001802084650001702102650001102119650001502130650002102145650001002166650001602176650001502192650003102207651001002238653003002248653004002278653000902318700001502327700001702342700001202359700001202371700001502383700001602398700001402414700001302428700001802441700001602459700002002475700002002495773007702515856008302592852000902675655001202684IND60612434320221116170223.0180911s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061243432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scib.2018.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Zhaofeng10aExplicit Diagnosis of the Local Ozone Production Rate and the Ozone-NOx-VOC Sensitivities  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aIn the troposphere, ozone is a harmful gas compound to both human health and vegetation. Ozone is produced from the reaction of NOx (=NO+NO2) and VOCs (volatile organic compounds) with light. Due to the highly nonlinear relationships between ozone and its precursors, proper ozone mitigation relies on the knowledge of chemical mechanisms. In this study, an observation-based method is used to simulate ozone formation and elucidate its controlling factors for a rural site on the North China Plain. The instantaneous ozone production rate is calculated utilizing a box model using the dataset obtained from the Wangdu campaign. First, the model was operated in a time-dependent mode to calculate the ozone production rate at each time stamp. The calculated ozone formation rate showed a diurnal average maximum value of 17 ppbv/h (1-h diurnal averaged). The contribution of individual peroxy radicals to ozone production was analyzed. In addition, the functional dependence of calculated P(O3) reveals that ozone production was in a NOx-limited regime during the campaign. Furthermore, the missing peroxy radical source will further extend NOx-limited conditions to earlier in the day, making NOx limitation dominate more of a day than the current chemical model predicts. Finally, a multiple scenarios mode, also known as EKMA (empirical kinetic modeling approach), was used to simulate the response of P(O3) to the imaginary change in precursor concentrations. We found that ozone production was in the NOx-limited region. However, the use of NO2 measured by the molybdenum converter and/or the absence of a peroxy radical source in the current chemical model could over-emphasize the VOC-limited effect on ozone production.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3afree radicals 3ahuman health 3amodels 3amolybdenum 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3atroposphere 3avegetation 3avolatile organic compounds 3aChina 0aObservational-based model 0aInstantaneous ozone production rate 0aEKMA1 aLu, Keding1 aDong, Huabin1 aHu, Min1 aLi, Xin1 aLiu, Yuhan1 aLü, Sihua,1 aShao, Min1 aSu, Rong1 aWang, Haichao1 aWu, Yusheng1 aWahner, Andreas1 aZhang, Yuanhang0 tScience bulletin.g2018, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12554x2095-92737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2018.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02106naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009600165300001800261520110500279592002801384650001301412650001801425650002901443650002201472651001801494651001201512651001201524651001001536700002101546700001801567773009301585856008101678852000901759655001201768IND60438355220221120123641.0151023e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043835522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-006-0311-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuklinski, P.10aLatitudinal patterns of diversity and abundance in North Atlantic intertidal boulder-fields  ap. 1577-1583.  aIn order to study taxon richness, biodiversity and abundance patterns in the North Atlantic from temperate latitudes through Arctic to high Arctic latitudes, we recorded the faunas (at ELWS level) colonizing 20 cobbles from three sites at each of seven boulder-field localities (south-west England, 50°N; Wales, 51°N; west Scotland, 56°N; Iceland, 64°N; Tromsø, 70°N; Svalbard, 77°N, 79°N). Inverse correlations were found between latitude and all measures of richness (species, orders, and phyla numbers) and biodiversity (S–W, P). However, these correlations were driven mostly by the consistently impoverished Arctic sites; an even cline of decreasing diversity from south to north did not exist. Multidimensional scaling revealed two communities, temperate–subarctic species-rich and high arctic species-poor. Evenness as measured by Pielou’s index was similar across all latitudes. Abundance data exhibited a similar trend to the species richness and diversity data with a significant negative correlation with latitude, but when Arctic data were excluded the correlation vanished.  aPublisher supplied data 3alatitude 3alittoral zone 3amultidimensional scaling 3aspecies diversity 3aArctic region 3aEngland 3aIceland 3aWales1 aBarnes, D.

However, conventional methods such as pumping tests, among other limitations, are costly and time-consuming. Thus, this study aims to estimate hydraulic properties of basement aquifers of the Idi-Ishin area of Ibadan, southwest Nigeria using an indirect electrical resistivity technique. Sixty-two (62) vertical electrical soundings (VES) were carried out along eleven (11) E-W established traverse lines with a view to intercepts the fracture systems. The acquired resistivity data were subsequently interpreted using computer software, IP12WIN, for iteration and generated layered parameters. Layer parameters were further evaluated to derive the Dar–Zarrouk parameters such as longitudinal conductance (S) and transverse resistance (R) to estimate the aquifers transmissivity (T) and hydraulic conductivities (H). Pumping test was performed, and the hydraulic conductivities and transmissivities determined were correlated with the calculated values from the electrical sounding data. The subsurface geophysical investigation revealed three to four-layer systems; topsoil, weathered-partially weathered basement, fractured basement and fresh basement. The weathered-fractured basement at varied depths serves as shallow groundwater aquifers. The computed T and H ranged from 9.69 × 10–² to 1.71 × 10–¹ m²/day and 9.13 × 10–³ to 1.86 × 10–² m/day which give a good relationship with the respective in-situ values from 2.46 to 6.15 × 10–¹ m²/day and 1.88 × 10–² to 4.70 × 10–³ m/day. S and R vary between 0.014 and 0.714 Ω⁻¹ and 84.48–30,112.57 Ωm², revealing a poor to good recharge and huge aquifer thickness. Also, longitudinal resistivity (LR) and transverse resistivity (TR) range from 12.3 to 242.7 Ωm⁻¹ and 20,333.1–106.5 Ωm⁻¹ an indicative of variation in the basement lithology as coefficient of anisotropy (λ) vary from 2.1 to 14.9, reflecting differences in basement characteristics for direction of fluid motion and accumulation. This study supports using electrical resistivities measurement to determine aquifer hydraulic conductivities, transmissivities, and protective capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aaquifers 3acomputer software 3aelectrical resistance 3ageophysics 3agroundwater 3alithology 3aprediction 3atopsoil 3aNigeria1 aObini, Nnamdi1 aInim, Iniemem J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9640-32740 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2021 July, v. 80, no. 14 p.466-466dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-021-09759-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012300169300001200292520110900304592002801413650002601441650002601467650000801493650002101501650001201522650002501534650001101559650004201570650002001612650001201632650001601644650003301660650001801693653001801711653002001729653002901749653002601778700001501804700002101819700001501840700002001855700001801875773009401893856008601987852000902073655001202082IND60597246720221120203348.0180624e20180702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059724672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2018.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Yanhong10aProfiling of small RNAs derived from cucumber mosaic virus in infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants by deep sequencing  ap. 1-7.  aIn plants, RNA silencing is a conserved mechanism underlying antiviral immunity. To investigate antiviral responses in Nicotiana benthamiana, we analyzed the profiles of the virus-derived small RNAs (vsRNAs) in wild-type N. benthamiana and NbRDR6 mutant plants infected with the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) 2b-deficient mutant. We observed that NbRDR6 regulates RNA silencing by producing vsRNAs that trigger an effective antiviral response, while NbRDR1 may nonredundantly and synergistically function with NbRDR6 to mediate immune responses. The vsRNAs in N. benthamiana and NbRDR6 mutant plants mainly comprised 21 or 22 nucleotides, and mostly consisted of a 5′-terminal adenine. Additionally, NbAGO2 expression was significantly up-regulated in N. benthamiana and NbRDR6 mutant plants, suggesting that NbAGO2 is closely associated with the antiviral activities of vsRNAs. The distribution of vsRNAs in the CMV genome was biased toward RNA sense strands in both N. benthamiana and NbRDR6 mutant plants. These findings indicate the specific and conserved antiviral immunity in Nicotiana benthamiana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aRNA 3aRNA interference 3aadenine 3aantiviral properties 3agenome 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aimmune response 3amutants 3anucleotides 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 0aRNA silencing 0aDeep sequencing 0aVirus-derived small RNAs 0aCucumber mosaic virus1 aWu, Yuping1 aZhang, Yongjiang1 aXu, Wenjie1 aWang, Chenguang1 aZhu, Shuifang0 tVirus research.g2018 July 02, v. 252 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2018.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002200191245012600213300001300339520100100352592002801353650001901381650001501400650001401415650001101429650002101440700002501461700002601486700002201512700002801534700002501562700002001587700002201607700004001629700002001669773009101689856008401780990002301864852000901887655001201896IND60094805020221122101556.0141104e20131014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009480502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.devcel.2013.09.0032doi7 aPMC40327912pmcid7 a241352282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBandiera, Roberto10aWT1 Maintains Adrenal-Gonadal Primordium Identity and Marks a Population of AGP-like Progenitors within the Adrenal Gland  ap. 5-18.  aAdrenal glands and gonads share a common primordium (AGP), but the molecular events driving differentiation are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the Wilms tumor suppressor WT1 is a key factor defining AGP identity by inhibiting the steroidogenic differentiation process. Indeed, ectopic expression of WT1 precludes differentiation into adrenocortical steroidogenic cells by locking them into a progenitor state. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments identify Tcf21 and Gli1 as direct targets of WT1. Moreover, cell lineage tracing analyses identify a long-living progenitor population within the adrenal gland, characterized by the expression of WT1, GATA4, GLI1, and TCF21, that can generate steroidogenic cells in vivo. Strikingly, gonadectomy dramatically activates these WT1⁺ cells and leads to their differentiation into gonadal steroidogenic tissue. Thus, our data describe a mechanism of response to organ loss by recreating hormone-producing cells at a heterotopic site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadrenal glands 3acastration 3achromatin 3agonads 3aprecipitin tests1 aVidal, Valerie P.I.1 aMotamedi, Fariba Jian1 aClarkson, Michael1 aSahut-Barnola, Isabelle1 avon Gise, Alexander1 aPu, William T.1 aHohenstein, Peter1 aMartinez, Antoinec(Microbiologist)1 aSchedl, Andreas0 tDevelopmental cell.g2013 Oct. 14, v. 27, no. 1 p.5-18dElsevier Inc.x1534-58077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2013.09.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03481naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245005100211300001100262520233100273592002802604596005902632650001602691650002002707650001402727650001302741650001702754650003002771650001302801650001502814650002002829650001302849700001502862700001602877773012202893856008303015852000903098655001203107IND60743498520221120031740.0220421e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074349852DNAL7 a10.1186/s12711-021-00647-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDekkers, Jack C.

While deterministic models for selection on pedigree-based estimates of breeding values (PEBV) are available, these have not been fully developed for genomic selection, with a key missing component being the accuracy of genomic EBV (GEBV) of selection candidates. Here, a deterministic method was developed to predict this accuracy within a closed breeding population based on the accuracy of GEBV and PEBV in the reference population and the distance of selection candidates from their closest ancestors in the reference population. METHODS: The accuracy of GEBV was modeled as a combination of the accuracy of PEBV and of EBV based on genomic relationships deviated from pedigree (DEBV). Loss of the accuracy of DEBV from the reference to the target population was modeled based on the effective number of independent chromosome segments in the reference population (Mₑ). Measures of Mₑ derived from the inverse of the variance of relationships and from the accuracies of GEBV and PEBV in the reference population, derived using either a Fisher information or a selection index approach, were compared by simulation. RESULTS: Using simulation, both the Fisher and the selection index approach correctly predicted accuracy in the target population over time, both with and without selection. The index approach, however, resulted in estimates of Mₑ that were less affected by heritability, reference size, and selection, and which are, therefore, more appropriate as a population parameter. The variance of relationships underpredicted Mₑ and was greatly affected by selection. A leave-one-out cross-validation approach was proposed to estimate required accuracies of EBV in the reference population. Aspects of the methods were validated using real data. CONCLUSIONS: A deterministic method was developed to predict the accuracy of GEBV in selection candidates in a closed breeding population. The population parameter Mₑ that is required for these predictions can be derived from an available reference data set, and applied to other reference data sets and traits for that population. This method can be used to evaluate the benefit of genomic prediction and to optimize genomic selection breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016-10148cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3achromosomes 3adata collection 3aevolution 3agenomics 3aheritability 3amarker-assisted selection 3apedigree 3aprediction 3aselection index 3avariance1 aSu, Hailin1 aCheng, Jian0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2021 Dec., v. 53, no. 1 p.55-55dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x1297-96867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12711-021-00647-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013800161300001600299520187000315592002802185650002602213650001402239650002102253650002402274650002902298650001902327650001002346651001002356653004302366653002402409653002702433653004202460653002602502700002002528700002002548700001802568700001902586773012402605856008202729852000902811655001202820IND60730151220221118000635.0210820e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073015122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2021.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Lei10aBiodegradable dissolved organic carbon shapes bacterial community structures and co-occurrence patterns in large eutrophic Lake Taihu  ap. 205-217.  aInteractions between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and bacteria are central in the biogeochemical cycles of aquatic ecosystems; however, the relative importance of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) compared with other environmental variables in structuring the bacterial communities needs further investigation. Here, we investigated bacterial communities, chromophoric DOM (CDOM) characteristics and physico-chemical parameters as well as examined BDOC via bioassay incubations in large eutrophic Lake Taihu, China, to explore the importance of BDOC for shaping bacterial community structures and co-occurrence patterns. We found that the proportion of BDOC (%BDOC) correlated significantly and positively with the DOC concentration and the index of the contribution of recent produced autochthonous CDOM (BIX). %BDOC, further correlated positively with the relative abundance of the tryptophan-like component and negatively with CDOM aromaticity, indicating that autochthonous production of protein-like CDOM was an important source of BDOC. The richness of the bacterial communities correlated negatively with %BDOC, indicating an enhanced number of species in the refractory DOC environments. %BDOC was identified as a significant stronger factor than DOC in shaping bacterial community composition and the co-occurrence network, suggesting that substrate biodegradability is more significant than DOC quantity determining the bacterial communities in a eutrophic lake. Environmental factors explained a larger proportion of the variation in the conditionally rare and abundant subcommunity than for the abundant and the rare bacterial subcommunities. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering bacteria with different abundance patterns and DOC biodegradability when studying the interactions between DOM and bacteria in eutrophic lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial communities 3abioassays 3abiodegradability 3acommunity structure 3adissolved organic carbon 3aeutrophication 3alakes 3aChina 0aBiodegradable dissolved organic carbon 0aBacterial community 0aCo-occurrence networks 0aChromophoric dissolved organic matter 0aHabitat niche breadth1 aZhou, Yongqiang1 aTang, Xiangming1 aZhang, Yunlin1 aJeppesen, Erik0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2021 Sept., v. 107 p.205-217dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2021.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008500169300001400254520146500268592002801733650000801761650003101769650001101800650001901811650001601830650001301846650001301859650001501872650001201887650001101899650001101910650001301921650002201934650001201956650001701968650001701985650001202002653000702014653000802021653000802029653000902037653000702046653000902053653000802062653000802070653000902078653000802087653001002095653001002105653000802115653000802123653000702131653001602138653000902154653003102163653002902194653002102223653003002244700001902274700002002293700001602313773011102329856008602440852000902526655001202535IND60597247020221120203226.0180624e20180702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059724702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2018.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Doyeong10aEmpty Turnip yellow mosaic virus capsids as delivery vehicles to mammalian cells  ap. 13-21.  aTurnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) was able to enter animal cells when the spherical plant virus was conjugated with Tat, a cell penetrating peptide (CPP). Tat was chemically attached to the surface lysine residues of TYMV using hydrazone chemistry. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were incubated with either unmodified or Tat-conjugated TYMV and examined by flow cytometry and confocal microscopic analyses. Tat conjugation was shown to be more efficient than Lipofectamine in allowing TYMV to enter the mammalian cells. Tat-assisted-transfection was also associated with less loss of cell viability than lipofection. Among the CPPs tested (Tat, R8, Pep-1 and Pen), it was observed that R8 and Pen were also effective while Pep-1 was not. We also examined if the internal space of TYMV can be used to load fluorescein dye as a model cargo. When TYMV is treated by freezing and thawing, the virus is known to convert into a structure with a 6–8 nm hole and release viral RNA. When the resultant pot-like particles were reacted with fluorescein-5-maleimide using interior sulfhydryl groups as conjugation sites, about 145 fluorescein molecules were added per particle. The fluorescein-loaded TYMV particles were conjugated with Tat and introduced into BHK cells, again with higher transfection efficiency compared to lipofection. Our studies demonstrate the potential of modified TYMV as an efficient system for therapeutic cargo delivery to mammalian cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aTurnip yellow mosaic virus 3acapsid 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescein 3afreezing 3ahamsters 3ahydrazones 3akidneys 3alysine 3amodels 3amoieties 3asulfhydryl groups 3athawing 3atherapeutics 3atransfection 3aviruses 0aAF 0aBHK 0aCAR 0aCCMV 0aCP 0aCPMV 0aCPP 0a4FB 0aFACS 0aF/T 0aHCRSV 0aHyNic 0aMTT 0aPBS 0aR8 0aSulfo-S-4FB 0aTYMV 0aTurnip yellow mosaic virus 0aCell penetrating peptide 0aDelivery vehicle 0aBaby hamster kidney cells1 aLee, YoungHee,1 aDreher, Theo W.1 aCho, Tae-Ju0 tVirus research.g2018 July 02, v. 252 p.13-21dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2018.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008200163300001600245520211600261592002802377650001902405650002002424650001802444650001402462650001302476650002302489650002102512650002202533650001102555650001402566650001502580650002802595650001602623650001002639650001402649650002002663700003002683700001902713700001702732773010302749856008102852852000902933655001202942IND50059557620221119225326.0151024e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005955762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-012-9708-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrido, I.10aOxidative reactions in axenically seedling roots of olive (Olea europaea, L.)  ap. 203-210.  aThe production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays important roles in the life cycle and in the stress response and defence mechanisms of plants. Various enzyme systems are involved in the formation of ROS in the apoplast, including plasmalemma NADPH oxidase and apoplastic peroxidases. The production of O ₂ ·⁻ and apoplastic peroxidase and exogenous NADH oxidation activities are all strongly dependent on the age of roots—the younger the root, the greater the activity. Apoplastic production of ROS is shown in the root by using specific histochemical probes, this ROS production is growing zone dependent. In the present study, using olive seedlings, differences were also observed between cultivars, especially in O ₂ ·⁻ production by the Verdial cultivar which was well above that of other cultivars studied. In all the cultivars, treatment of roots with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or methyl salicylate (MeSA) increased O ₂ ·⁻ production. Similar results were observed for peroxidase activity, but not for the oxidation of exogenous NADH which was either unaffected (MeJA) or even partially inhibited (MeSA). A conclusion was that MeJA or MeSA induced apoplastic production of ROS does not use exogenous NADH. Treatment with diphenylene iodonium (DPI) reduced the formation of O ₂ ·⁻ , but affected neither peroxidase nor NADH oxidation activities. Cyanide inhibited O ₂ ·⁻ production and peroxidase and NADH oxidation activities. Treatment with MnCl₂ had a strong stimulatory effect on peroxidase and NADH oxidation activities, but much less on O ₂ ·⁻ production. Finally, azide greatly reduced all activities, but especially O ₂ ·⁻ production. Together, these results indicate a relationship between oxidative activities and the processes of root growth, and that those activities are also dependent on the cultivar, as well as an involvement of peroxidases and plasmalemma NADPH oxidase in apoplast ROS production which is sensitive to DPI, azide, and cyanide but relatively insensitive to MnCl₂, while exogenous NADH oxidation is linked to peroxidase activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aOlea europaea 3acultivars 3acyanides 3adefense mechanisms 3amethyl jasmonate 3amethyl salicylate 3aolives 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3areactive oxygen species 3aroot growth 3aroots 3aseedlings 3astress response1 aCaraballo-Sánchez, A.

In this study, atomically dispersed Au1 catalyst is synthesized and applied in electrochemical synthesis of ammonia under ambient conditions. A high NH4⁺ Faradaic efficiency of 11.1% achieved by our Au1 catalyst surpasses most of reported catalysts under comparable conditions. Benefiting from efficient atom utilization, an NH4⁺ yield rate of 1,305 μg h⁻¹ mgAu⁻¹ has been reached, which is roughly 22.5 times as high as that by supported Au nanoparticles. We also demonstrate that by employing our Au1 catalyst, NH4⁺ can be electrochemically produced directly from N2 and H2 with an energy utilization rate of 4.02 mmol kJ⁻¹. Our study provides a possibility of replacing the Haber–Bosch process with environmentally benign and energy-efficient electrochemical strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aammonium 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrosynthesis 3aenergy efficiency 3agold 3ahydrogen 3ananogold 0aNH3 synthesis 0aMetal single sites 0aElectrocatalysis 0aHaber–Bosch process 0aNitrogen reduction1 aWang, Wenyu1 aQiao, Man1 aWu, Geng1 aChen, Wenxing1 aYuan, Tongwei1 aXu, Qian1 aChen, Min1 aZhang, Yan1 aWang, Xin1 aWang, Jing1 aGe, Jingjie1 aHong, Xun1 aLi, Yafei1 aWu, Yuen1 aLi, Yadong0 tScience bulletin.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 63, no. 19 p.1246-1253dElsevier B.V.aScience China PresswJournal:12554x2095-92737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2018.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245012800153300001800281500001900299520091600318592002801234650000801262650002501270650002201295650001701317650000701334650002001341700001601361700001501377700001601392700001401408773014101422856007401563852000901637655001201646IND60696587920221120165255.0200528e20200527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069658792DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb00450b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xilu14aThe phosphatase-like activity of zirconium oxide nanoparticles and their application in near-infrared intracellular imaging  ap. 4428-4433.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, the phosphatase mimetic activity of zirconium oxide nanoparticles (ZrO₂ NPs) has been demonstrated. They can effectively catalyze the dephosphorylation of a series of commercial fluorogenic and chromogenic substrates of natural phosphatases. Compared with natural phosphatases, ZrO₂ NPs possess several advantages such as low cost, facile preparation procedures, and high stability in a broader pH range or at high temperatures. In addition, the activity of ZrO₂ NPs toward some important biomolecules was investigated. The ZrO₂ NPs can catalyze the dephosphorylation of ATP and o-phospho-l-tyrosine, but they cannot react with DNA strands. These data are important for the further bio-related applications of ZrO₂ NPs. Finally, the potential application of ZrO₂ NPs in intracellular imaging is also demonstrated by using a near-infrared fluorescent substrate of alkaline phosphatase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalkaline phosphatase 3adephosphorylation 3afluorescence 3apH 3azirconium oxide1 aHuang, Ting1 aLiao, Hong1 aHu, Lianzhe1 aWang, Min0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 May 27, v. 8, no. 20 p.4428-4433dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb00450b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03612naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003000132024001100162040001800173100001600191245014100207300001600348500000900364506017300373520153400546592002802080650002102108650001202129650001202141650001102153650001102164650001102175650000902186650001402195650001402209650001302223650001402236650001502250650001702265650001402282650001902296650001502315650000902330650001102339650002002350650001502370650000902385700002002394700002002414700002702434700001502461773021702476856011202693856007702805956009802882961000902980852000902989655001202998IND50074373820221214223816.0191028e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007437382DNAL7 a2797462aris7 a10113/586442hdl7 a10.2134/jeq2012.00702doi8 ans4297  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Jing10aEffects of Bedding Materials in Applied Poultry Litter and Immobilizing Agents on Runoff Water, Soil Properties, and Bermudagrass Growth  ap. 290-296.  aepub  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aPoultry producers in the United States have begun using different types of bedding materials in production houses. Release into the environment of nutrients from applied poultry litter (PL) made with different bedding materials has not been investigated, and little information is available on nutrient concentrations in soils that receive broiler litter made with such materials. In this greenhouse study, two bedding materials (rice hulls and pine chips) in PL and two nutrient-immobilizing agents (gypsum and biochar) were applied to bermudagrass, and chemical and microbial contents of runoff water, soil properties, and plant growth were evaluated. Treatments with rice hull bedding material in PL had less runoff nutrient and greater soil soluble N and P compared with pine chip bedding. Gypsum and biochar both significantly reduced C, N, P, Cu, and Zn losses from the first runoff event, which were reduced by 26, 30, 37, 38, and 38% and by 25, 24, 30, 29, and 35%, respectively, but only gypsum obviously reduced these nutrients from later events. Potassium, Ca, Mg, and Mn increased by 2, 36, 11, and 9 times, respectively, and soluble P, Cu, and Fe significantly decreased by 68, 72, and 98%, respectively, in soil amended with gypsum. Rice hull PL in combination with gypsum significantly increased the growth of bermudagrass. Our results indicate that rice hull PL posed less risk for nutrient loss than pine chip PL when applied to fields and that gypsum was better than biochar for reducing runoff C, N, P, and Cu.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3abiochar 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acopper 3agypsum 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3apoultry manure 3arice hulls 3arisk 3arunoff 3asoil properties 3awood chips 3azinc1 aAdeli, Ardeshir1 aBrooks, John P.1 aMcLaughlin, Michael R.1 aRead, John0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2014 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.290-296dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/586443Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2012.00703Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/279746%20-%20Adeli.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245012600168300001600294520172300310536021202033592002802245650001102273650001602284650001802300650001602318650002802334650003802362650002802400650001202428650002202440650002302462650002302485650004302508650001302551650002302564653001602587653002002603653002402623653002302647653003102670700003202701700003102733700003202764773010602796856008002902852000902982655001202991IND60624073320221121004246.0181130e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062407332DNAL7 a10.1177/02601060177087302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChailurkit, La-or10aIs bisphenol A exposure associated with the development of glucose intolerance and increased insulin resistance in Thais?  ap. 185-191.  aBisphenol A (BPA), the monomeric component of polycarbonate plastics, reportedly possesses endocrine-disrupting effects. Exposure to low levels of BPA during more vulnerable periods leads to abnormalities related to sexual development in experimental animals. Moreover, recently a few epidemiological studies in Caucasians have demonstrated the association of BPA exposure with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, in the present study we examined the association of BPA exposure and abnormal glucose tolerance in Thais. This is a cross-sectional study of 240 participants aged at least 50 years, randomly selected by computer-generated random numbers within each glucose tolerance status from an oral glucose tolerance study of 661 participants. There were 80 participants in each group of type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Serum BPA was measured by competitive ELISA. The detection rate of BPA was significantly higher in participants with IGT compared to those with NGT (p < 0.05), while no difference was found between participants with type 2 diabetes and NGT. When participants with type 2 diabetes were stratified into those with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) under the diabetic threshold (<126 mg/dL) and those over (≥126 mg/dL), it was found that those with FPG under the diabetic threshold had measurable rates of BPA comparable to those with IGT, and rates significantly higher than the NGT group (p < 0.05), while those with FPG over the diabetic threshold did not have higher rates of measurable BPA compared with the NGT group. In conclusion, BPA exposure is not uncommon in Thais. There is an association between BPA exposure and IGT, but not type 2 diabetes.  aFunding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by a research grant from Mahidol University.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWhites 3abisphenol A 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3across-sectional studies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepidemiological studies 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ainsulin resistance 3alaboratory animals 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aplastics 3asexual development 0abisphenol A 0atype 2 diabetes 0ainsulin sensitivity 0ainsulin resistance 0aimpaired glucose tolerance1 aTengpraettanakorn, Pechngam1 aChanprasertyotin, Suwannee1 aOngphiphadhanakul, Boonsong0 tNutrition and health.g, v. 23, no. 3 p.185-191dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl34213x2047-945X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/02601060177087303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011600170520136700286592002801653650002501681650001301706650001201719650002201731650001901753650001701772650001701789650001901806650001101825650001401836650003301850650001501883650001801898650001601916653001401932653001701946653001401963653002201977653003301999700002102032700001602053700002302069773012502092856008302217852000902300655001202309IND60702593120221119064747.0220809e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070259312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2020.1048912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakari, Ramadhani10aSimulation and optimisation of the pyrolysis of rice husk: Preliminary assessment for gasification applications  aThermochemical conversion of biomass into useful products is a promising route to harness biofuels. This process is clean, renewable and can reduce the use of fossil fuel. In this study, SuperPro Designer (SPD) software and response surface methodology (RSM) is used to simulate and optimize rice husk pyrolysis process. The SPD simulator was built to handle kinetics and stoichiometric reaction of lignocellulosic composition of rice husk into final products. The SPD simulation and RSM optimization were performed at a temperature ranging from 350 to 800 °C and residence time of 0.25−60 s. The simulated results were in agreement with product yield published in the literature at an average relative error of 6.8 %. The combined effect of temperature and residence time were analysed by using RSM and analysis of variance (ANOVA). A cubic model for bio-oil and quartic model for char and gas yield were proposed. The desirability function in Design-Expert showed that the optimum bio-oil yield (36.72 %) could be attained at a temperature 588 °C and a residence time 0.25 s while the optimum gas yield (73.25 %) could be achieved at a temperature 798.8 °C and a residence time 15.47 s. These findings therefore revealed that the energy content of the rice husk could be harnessed by pyrolysis/gasification to obtain substantial fuel products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acomputer software 3aenergy content 3afossil fuels 3agasification 3alignocellulose 3amodels 3apyrolysis 3aresponse surface methodology 3arice hulls 3astoichiometry 3atemperature 0aPyrolysis 0aGasification 0aRice husk 0aSuperPro designer 0aResponse surface methodology1 aKivevele, Thomas1 aHuang, Xiao1 aJande, Yusufu A.C.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2020 Sept., v. 150 p.104891-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2020.1048913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245010700154300001800261500001900279520151600298592002801814650002001842650001701862650001401879650001601893650001701909650001301926650002501939650001901964650001101983650001801994650001202012650001002024650001702034650001302051650001402064700001502078700002002093700001502113700001402128700001902142700002202161773014102183856007402324852000902398655001202407IND60696588120221122004425.0200528e20200527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069658812DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb00483a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Thou12aA decellularized scaffold derived from squid cranial cartilage for use in cartilage tissue engineering  ap. 4516-4526.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDecellularized cartilage scaffold (DCS) is an emerging substitute for cartilage defect application. However, it is hard to preserve an intact structure of such scaffolds derived from terrestrial animals, because of their dense and compact constitution. In contrast, squid (Dosidicus gigas) cranial cartilage, which possesses a relatively loose structure, could be easily decellularized using mild conditions and it retains the original microstructures of extracellular matrix (ECM). Herein, decellularized squid cranial cartilage scaffold (DSCS) was fabricated successfully after substantially removing the cells, which contained abundant ECM components (proteoglycans and type II collagen). Microscopic structure results showed that the DSCS possesses a relatively smooth and dense surface with a favorable interconnected inner porous structure for cell growth. DSCS exhibited excellent biomechanics and hydrophilicity. In vitro experiments indicated that the scaffold extracts were not toxic to cells, and were amenable to chondrocyte migration. Meanwhile, chondrocytes seeded in DSCS could maintain a favorable viability and present a spreading morphology. Furthermore, the in vivo experiments revealed that both cell-free scaffold and cell-laden scaffold exert promotive effects for the regeneration of cartilage in a full-thickness rabbit cartilage defect model. Taken together, these results suggested that DSCS presents a novel and promising cell-free therapeutic choice for cartilage tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDosidicus gigas 3abiomechanics 3acartilage 3acell growth 3achondrocytes 3acollagen 3aextracellular matrix 3ahydrophilicity 3amodels 3aproteoglycans 3arabbits 3asquid 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3aviability1 aTang, Qian1 aZhu, Zhen-Zhong1 aFeng, Yong1 aZhan, Shi1 aWei, Xiao-Juan1 aZhang, Chang-Qing0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 May 27, v. 8, no. 20 p.4516-4526dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb00483a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01206naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002300191245004800214300001600262520032000278592002800598650001400626650001000640650001900650700002500669773009400694856008400788990002300872852000900895655001200904IND60094805720221122170413.0141104e20131028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009480572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.devcel.2013.10.0132doi7 aPMC38902502pmcid7 a241766382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPierce, Nathan W.10aCilia Grow by Taking a Bite out of the Cell  ap. 126-127.  aAutophagy and primary cilium assembly have long been known to be induced by the same conditions in cultured cells.

Particularly, the advent of genetic engineering of filamentous fungi has led to a growing number of molecular tools to adopt filamentous fungi for biotechnical applications. Here, we summarize recent developments in fungal biology, where fungal host systems were genetically manipulated for optimal industrial applications. Firstly, available inducible promoter systems depending on carbon sources are mentioned together with various adaptations of the Tet-Off and Tet-On systems for use in different industrial fungal host systems. Subsequently, we summarize representative examples, where diverse expression systems were used for the production of heterologous products, including proteins from mammalian systems. In addition, the progressing usage of genomics and functional genomics data for strain improvement strategies are addressed, for the identification of biosynthesis genes and their related metabolic pathways. Functional genomic data are further used to decipher genomic differences between wild-type and high-production strains, in order to optimize endogenous metabolic pathways that lead to the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant end products. Lastly, we discuss how molecular data sets can be used to modify products for optimized applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3adata collection 3afungi 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3aindustrial applications 3amammals 3amycology 3apromoter regions 3aproteins 3asecondary metabolites1 aTerfehr, Dominik1 aKück, Ulrich0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 Aug., v. 102, no. 15 p.6357-6372dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-9115-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01143naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245004700174300001600221520030000237592002800537650001600565650001200581650001400593650001400607650001300621700002000634773010500654856008500759852000900844655001200853IND60615772020221120170722.0200523e20180816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061577202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2018.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDreher, Lena-Sophie10aERADicate Tumor Progression with Metformin  ap. 481-482.  aEndoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) plays a crucial role in turnover of defective secretory proteins to maintain protein homeostasis.

Therefore, energy balance depends on the regulation of the hunger–satiety mechanism, which involves interconnection of the central nervous system and peripheral signals from the adipose tissue, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract, generating responses in short-term food intake and long-term energy balance. Increased body fat alters the gut- and adipose-tissue-derived hormone signaling, which promotes modifications in appetite-regulating hormones, decreasing satiety and increasing hunger senses. With the failure of conventional weight loss interventions (dietary treatment, exercise, drugs and lifestyle modifications), bariatric surgeries are well-accepted tools for the treatment of severe obesity, with long-term and sustained weight loss. Bariatric surgeries may cause weight loss due to restriction/malabsorption of nutrients from the anatomical alteration of the gastrointestinal tract that decreases energy intake, but also by other physiological factors associated with better results of the surgical procedure. This review discusses the neuroendocrine regulation of energy balance, with description of the predominant hormones and peptides involved in the control of energy balance in obesity and all currently available bariatric surgeries. According to the findings of our review, bariatric surgeries promote effective and sustained weight loss not only by reducing calorie intake, but also by precipitating changes in appetite control, satiation and satiety, and physiological changes in gut-, neuro- and adipose-tissue-derived hormone signaling.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3acentral nervous system 3adrugs 3aenergy expenditure 3aenergy intake 3aexercise 3afood intake 3agastrointestinal system 3ahormones 3ahunger 3alifestyle 3amalabsorption 3anutrients 3anutritional intervention 3aobesity 3apancreas 3apeptides 3apublic health 3asatiety 3asurgery 3aweight loss 0aAppetite regulation 0aobesity 0abariatric surgery 0aweight loss 0aenergy balance1 aNetto, Bárbara Dal Molin1 aBettini, Solange Cravo1 aDâmaso, Ana Raimunda1 ade Freitas, Alexandre Coutinho Teixeira0 tNutrition and health.g, v. 23, no. 3 p.131-146dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl34213x2047-945X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/02601060177193693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012700161300001800288500001900306520131700325592002801642650001001670650001201680650002101692650001701713650001501730650001701745650000901762650002601771650001201797650002001809700001701829700001901846700001801865700001701883700001701900700001701917700001901934700001701953700001801970700001801988700001602006700001902022773014102041856007402182852000902256655001202265IND60696588220221122004402.0200528e20200527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069658822DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb00508h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Chengqiang12aA fiber-shaped neural probe with alterable elastic moduli for direct implantation and stable electronic–brain interfaces  ap. 4387-4394.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResearchers developing implantable neural probes face a dilemma. Rigid neural probes facilitate direct implantation, but the brain tissue suffers from a vulnerable interface and a strong neuroinflammatory response due to mechanical mismatch between the probe and the brain tissue. Flexible neural probes offer stable interfaces and eliminate neuroinflammatory responses but require auxiliary implantation. Here, we have created a new kind of micro fiber-shaped neural probe with alterable elastic moduli before and after implantation. Carbon nanotube fibers and calcium crosslinked sodium alginate functioned as the core electrode and sheath layer, respectively. The response of calcium crosslinked sodium alginate to water will alter the probe elastic moduli from ∼10 GPa to ∼10 kPa post implantation, which is close to the elastic modulus of brain tissue. The micro fiber probes were directly implanted into mouse brains without any additional materials. After implantation, they became soft and offered dynamically adaptable interfaces with a reduced inflammatory response, benefiting long-term monitoring of neuron signals. Continuous four week monitoring of neuron signals was achieved. The simplicity of the strategy makes it suitable for versatile neuron techniques in neuron recording and modulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acalcium 3acarbon nanotubes 3acrosslinking 3aelectrodes 3ainflammation 3amice 3amodulus of elasticity 3aneurons 3asodium alginate1 aXie, Songlin1 aWang, Mengying1 aFeng, Jianyou1 aHan, Zhengqi1 aWu, Xiaoying1 aWang, Liyuan1 aChen, Chuanrui1 aWang, Jiajia1 aJiang, Liping1 aChen, Peining1 aSun, Xuemei1 aPeng, Huisheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 May 27, v. 8, no. 20 p.4387-4394dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb00508h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01262naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245006400209300001600273520031400289592002800603650002000631650001000651650002400661650003000685700002300715773009400738856008400832990002300916852000900939655001200948IND60094805820221122170339.0141104e20131028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009480582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.devcel.2013.10.0122doi7 aPMC39333572pmcid7 a241766392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yun Rose10aUnfolding the Mystery of Olfactory Receptor Gene Expression  ap. 128-129.  aReporting recently in Cell, Dalton et al.

Several concentrations of chitin or shrimp shells (grinded and ungrinded) were incubated in AFM1-contaminated phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at different incubation times. The stability of the formed adsorbent-AFM1 complex was also tested in milk at different incubation times and temperatures. The unbound AFM1 was quantified by HPLC. Thereby, the percentages of the initial bounded AFM1 varied between 14.29 and 94.74%. Interestingly, in milk, an increase in incubation time coupled with a decrease in temperature affected positively the amount of bounded AFM1 to chitin and negatively those bounded to ungrinded shells. Results also revealed a partial reversibility in the binding of AFM1 to these adsorbents. These findings provided strong evidence on ability of chitin or shrimp shells by-product to bind AFM1 in milk and in PBS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aaflatoxin M1 3abyproducts 3achitin 3adetoxification (processing) 3aheat treatment 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aliquids 3amilk 3ashrimp 3atemperature1 aEl Khoury, André1 aAtoui, Ali1 aLouka, Nicolas1 aChokr, Ali0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 Aug., v. 102, no. 15 p.6687-6697dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-9124-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02093naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009000171300001800261520098700279592002801266653002301294653002501317653001001342653001401352653002101366653001401387700002201401700002501423700002301448700002101471700002101492773013901513856008201652852000901734655001201743IND60556517120221118220812.0161102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055651712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.xphs.2016.06.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJansen, Patrick J.10aDetermination of the Degradation Chemistry of the Antitumor Agent Pemetrexed Disodium  ap. 3256-3268.  aStress-testing (forced degradation) studies have been conducted on pemetrexed disodium heptahydrate (1) (LY231514·2Na·7H2O) drug substance in order to identify its likely degradation products and establish its degradation pathways. Solid samples of the drug substance were stressed under various conditions of heat, humidity, and light, and solutions of the drug substance were stressed under various conditions of heat, light, oxidation, and over a wide pH range (1-13). The stressed samples were analyzed using a gradient elution reversed-phase HPLC method. The 7 major degradation products detected in the stress-testing studies were isolated, and the structures were elucidated via spectroscopic characterization. The structures of the degradation products and their proposed mechanisms of formation indicate that 1 degrades via 2 main pathways: oxidation and hydrolysis. Of the 7 identified degradation products, 6 are proposed to result from oxidation and 1 from hydrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 0achemical stability 0adegradation products 0aLC-MS 0aoxidation 0aphotodegradation 0astability1 aSmith, William K.1 aBaertschi, Steven W.1 aDorman, Douglas E.1 aKemp, Craig A.J.1 aMcCune, Karen A.0 tJournal of Pharmaceutical Sciences.g2016 Nov., v. 105 p.3256-3268dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Pharmacists Association®x0022-35497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2016.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03603naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245015600174300001400330520217400344592002802518650002302546650001702569650002102586650000902607650001602616650001602632650001502648650002502663650002402688650001402712650002002726650001602746650002302762651001002785653002602795653001002821653002502831653002302856700002102879700001902900700001702919773010602936856008203042852000903124655001203133IND60582486920221117020629.0190403e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058248692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2016.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Amit Kumar10aImpact of climatic variables on the spatial and temporal variability of crop yield and biomass gap in Sub-Saharan Africa- a case study in Central Ghana  ap. 33-46.  aWe investigated the impact of climate variables on yield and biomass gap variability in two humid topical regions, Brong-Ahafo and Ashanti region, of central Ghana using the crop model LINTUL5 embedded into a general modeling framework, SIMPLACE (Scientific Impact Assessment and Modelling Platform for Advanced Crop and Ecosystem Management). The simulations were run using a late maturity maize variety (Obatanpa) and historical weather data (1992–2007) across the 18 districts of the regions studied. The simulated maize yield and biomass production under water-limited conditions varied spatially which was significantly correlated with the solar radiation and precipitation in the crop growing period (R2=0.99; p<0.05), whereas, associated temporal variability in the simulated maize yield was significantly correlated with the radiation in the crop growing period (R2=0.96; p<0.05). The temporal variability in the simulated potential biomass production was significantly correlated with the solar radiation and average temperature in the crop growing period (R2=0.93; p<0.05), postulating that the solar radiation and the mean temperature are the limiting climatic factor in the study regions. Yield gaps and biomass gaps ranged between 8.8Mgha−1 to 10.0Mgha−1 and 14.8Mgha−1 to 17.1Mgha−1 respectively across the districts. Thus average farmer’s yield and biomass is only 17% and 13% of the simulated water-limited yield and biomass respectively. The spatial and temporal variability in yield gap was positively correlated with the radiation during the crop growing period. Associated spatial variability in biomass gap was positively correlated with radiation and negatively with the precipitation, whereas temporal variability in the biomass gap was positively correlated with the radiation during the crop growing period. Thus, under the current input intensities in humid, tropical Central Ghana, neither maize grain and biomass yields nor the potential water limited yields are significantly positively related to precipitation during the growing cycle. Closing the large yield gaps will require in the first place adequate supply of nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3acase studies 3aclimatic factors 3acorn 3acorrelation 3acrop models 3acrop yield 3aecosystem management 3ameteorological data 3anutrients 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3aGhana 0aYield and biomass gap 0aMaize 0aClimatic variability 0aSub-Saharan africa1 aMboh, Cho Miltin1 aGaiser, Thomas1 aEwert, Frank0 tField crops research.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 203 p.33-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2016.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01786naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245013000160300002000290520061200310592002800922650002300950650002300973650001200996650002201008650001301030650002401043700001401067700001401081700001501095700001401110700001501124700001501139700001601154700001901170773012101189856008101310852000901391655001201400IND60586450520221121235642.0171213e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058645052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b018392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jin10aOxidant and Transition-Metal-Free Photoinduced Direct Oxidative Annulation of 1-Aryl-2-(furan/thiophen-2-yl)butane-1,3-diones  ap. 12097-12105.  aA photoinduced direct oxidative annulation of 1-aryl-2-(furan/thiophen-2-yl)butane-1,3-diones and ethyl-2-(furan-2-yl)-3-oxo-3-(aryl-2-yl)propanoates in EtOH without the need for any transition metals and oxidants provided access to highly functionalized polyheterocyclic 1-(5-hydroxynaphtho[2,1-b]furan-4-yl)ethanones and 1-(5-hydroxyfuran/thieno/pyrrolo[3,2-e]benzofuran-4-yl)ethanones.

Moreover, the clinical application of general formulations is hampered by biological barriers and biological elimination. To tackle this challenge, we report a feasible approach for the assembly of polymer–covalent organic framework (COF) nanocomposites into 150 nm thin platelets as a drug delivery vehicle for enhanced retention in brain tumours. Using intravital imaging, we demonstrate that these polymer–COF nanocomposites are able to traverse the BBB in mice and achieve direct tumour accumulation in intracranial orthotopic models of brain metastasis from renal cancer (BMRC). These nanocomposites can target brain tumour cells and respond to tumour microenvironmental characteristics, including acidic and redox conditions. Intracranial tumour acidity triggers the breakdown of the nanoassemblies to polymer–COF nanocomposites due to the presence of borate bonds. Furthermore, in vivo studies on the nanocomposites showed enhanced brain tumour-targeting efficiency and therapeutic effects compared to those of free-drug dosing. Mice treated with drug-loaded polymer–COF nanocomposites also show protection from systemic drug toxicity and improved survival, demonstrating the preclinical potential of this nanoscale platform to deliver novel combination therapies to BMRC and other central nervous system (CNS) tumours.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3ablood-brain barrier 3aborates 3abrain 3abrain neoplasms 3adrug carriers 3adrug therapy 3adrug toxicity 3akidney neoplasms 3ametastasis 3ananocomposites1 aJiang, Bo1 aWu, Chunyong1 aLiu, Yanfeng1 aHe, Yidan1 aHuang, Xin1 aChen, Wei1 aXi, Kai1 aGuo, Hongqian1 aZhao, Xiaozhi1 aJia, Xudong0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 May 27, v. 8, no. 20 p.4475-4488dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb00724b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245010000153520183800253592002802091650002802119650001402147650001602161650002102177650002202198650001902220650001502239650001602254650001902270650002502289650001602314700001502330700001702345773011802362856007202480852000902552655001202561IND60653215620221119100722.0190714e20170427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065321562DNAL7 a10.3390/w90503072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Jian10aDynamics of Water Vapor Content around Isolated Sprinklers: Description and Validation of Model  aIrrigation consumes considerable water to satisfy the current food demand. An improvement in water use efficiency for irrigation is essential. Wind drift and evaporation losses reduce the water use efficiency of center pivot irrigation systems in arid and semi-arid areas. In this paper, a model of water vapor dynamics during and after overhead sprinkler irrigation was developed and validated by experimental data using a center pivot simulator and a water vapor measuring system. The model was represented as an exponential equation during irrigation and a logistic equation after irrigation. The water vapor dynamics measured next to and 2 m from the sprinkler were well-fitted with the developed model. Model performance was good according to evaluations of the Nash—Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, with values of 0.961 and 0.934 for estimations next to the sprinkler and 2 m from the sprinkler, respectively. Results showed that both modeled and observed water vapor dynamics increased rapidly as irrigation started, and then leveled off to maximum values. After irrigation, the water vapor dynamics started to decrease gradually, and eventually decreased rapidly. The decreasing rate stopped when the water vapor content was restored to the level of the surrounding atmosphere. The model parameters showed that the maximum increases in water vapor content were from 2.506 to 6.476 g m−3 for the area next to the sprinkler, and 1.277 to 3.380 g m−3 for the area 2 m from the sprinkler, under the influence of vapor pressure deficits. The increasing and decreasing rates of the dynamics during and after irrigation were influenced by temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficits, according to Pearson’s correlations. A period of 2.3 to 4.0 h was required to restore water vapor to the atmospheric level.  aPublisher supplied data 3acenter pivot irrigation 3aequations 3aevaporation 3amodel validation 3arelative humidity 3asemiarid zones 3asprinklers 3atemperature 3avapor pressure 3awater use efficiency 3awater vapor1 aSu, Derong1 aWang, Yadong0 tWater.g2017 Apr. 27, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w90503073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245006800164500002200232520148900254592002801743650001801771650001201789650001101801650001901812650002501831650001901856650002101875650001701896650001101913650001401924651001001938653001901948653002501967653001501992653001902007653002902026700001802055700001402073773009802087856008302185852000902268655001202277IND60612435720221116170310.0180914s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061243572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scib.2018.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Yitong10aFuture biomass carbon sequestration capacity of Chinese forests  aPre-press version  aChinese forests, characterized by relatively young stand age, represent a significant biomass carbon (C) sink over the past several decades. Nevertheless, it is unclear how forest biomass C sequestration capacity in China will evolve as forest age, climate and atmospheric CO2 concentration change continuously. Here, we present a semi-empirical model that incorporates forest age and climatic factors for each forest type to estimate the effects of forest age and climate change on total forest biomass, under three different scenarios based on the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). We estimate that age-related forest biomass C sequestration to be 6.69 Pg C (∼0.17 Pg C a⁻¹) from the 2000s to the 2040s. Climate change induces a rather weak increase in total forest biomass C sequestration (0.52–0.60 Pg C by the 2040s). We show that rising CO2 concentrations could further increase the total forest biomass C sequestration by 1.68–3.12 Pg C in the 2040s across all three scenarios. Overall, the total forest biomass in China would increase by 8.89–10.37 Pg C by the end of 2040s. Our findings highlight the benefits of Chinese afforestation programs, continued climate change and increasing CO2 concentration in sustaining the forest biomass C sink in the near future, and could therefore be useful for designing more realistic climate change mitigation policies such as continuous forestation programs and careful choice of tree species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aafforestation 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aforest types 3amodels 3astand age 3aChina 0aForest biomass 0aCarbon sequestration 0aForest age 0aClimate change 0aRising CO2 concentration1 aPiao, Shilong1 aWang, Tao0 tScience bulletin.g2018, dElsevier B.V.aScience China PresswJournal:12554x2095-92737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2018.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100007100146245008200217300001600299520165500315536012001970592002802090650002302118650001602141650001402157650001302171650002402184650002102208650001902229650001502248650002202263650001702285650001202302650002302314650001502337650001902352650002502371650001702396651001002413653001202423653001302435653001002448653001502458653001302473700001902486700005802505773010602563856008002669852000902749655001202758IND60624073920221121022133.0181130e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062407392DNAL7 a10.1177/02601060177229242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarteh, Eugene Kofuor Maafo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4689-889110aWhy are our children wasting: Determinants of wasting among under 5s in Ghana  ap. 159-166.  aWasting is one of the indicators of malnutrition known to contribute to the deaths occurring from childhood malnutrition. It is the measure of body mass in relation to body length used to explain recent nutritional status. This paper examines the determinants of wasting among under 5s in Ghana. Data were drawn from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey children’s records file to examine the determinants of wasting among children. A total of 2720 children under 5 years with valid anthropometric data were used. Data on wasting were collected by measuring the weight and height of all children under 5 years of age. Bi-variate and multi-variate statistics are used to examine the determinants of wasting. The bi-variate analysis showed significant differences (p < 0.001) in the prevalence of wasting among under 5s according to age of the child, region, and wealth status. On the other hand, the multi-variate analysis revealed that the odds of wasting were lower among children aged 24–35 months (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.37; p < 0.001), those from households of the middle wealth quintile (OR = 0.49, p < 0.05) and with health insurance (OR = 0.70; p < 0.10). Programmes and policies aimed at ensuring the survival of children during the first 24 months of life should be strengthened to reduce the risk of wasting among under 5s. Also, efforts should be made by the relevant government agencies and other stakeholders to strengthen the socio-economic status of mothers to enable them to provide adequate nutrition and improve access to health insurance for their children in order to reduce the incidence of wasting among these children.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3abivariate analysis 3abody length 3achildhood 3achildren 3agovernment agencies 3ahealth insurance 3ahealth surveys 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3amalnutrition 3amothers 3anutritional status 3aodds ratio 3arisk reduction 3asocioeconomic status 3astakeholders 3aGhana 0aWasting 0achildren 0aGhana 0apredictors 0aunder 5s1 aAcquah, Evelyn1 aDarteh, Florie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4689-88910 tNutrition and health.g, v. 23, no. 3 p.159-166dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl34213x2047-945X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/02601060177229243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013600162300001800298520099900316592002801315650002801343650001901371650001701390650001901407650002201426650001201448650001601460650001101476650001401487650001401501650003701515650001101552651001901563700001701582773009301599856008101692852000901773655001201782IND60438357620221120135208.0151023e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043835762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-006-0294-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Enmin10aAcute exposure to naphthalene reduces oxyregulating capacity of the brown shrimp, Penaeus aztecus, subjected to progressive hypoxia  ap. 1411-1415.  aThe brown shrimp, Penaeus aztecus, in the northern Gulf of Mexico is faced with dual stresses of environmental hypoxia, which occurs as a result of oxygen depletion from microbial decomposition of organic materials from algal blooms, and pollution from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from petroleum and gas production on the continental shelf of the northern Gulf of Mexico. This study investigated the effect of naphthalene, a PAH, on oxyregulating capacity of P. aztecus, when shrimps were subjected to progressive hypoxia. It was found that P. aztecus is an oxyregulator with a critical oxygen concentration of 2.53 mg/l at 19–21°C, below which the animal becomes an oxyconformer. Acute exposure to naphthalene at 2.0 mg/l significantly reduced the oxyregulating capacity by 112%. This is the first report on the alteration of an aquatic animal’s oxyregulating capacity by a PAH. Possible mechanism for the impaired oxyregulation in the presence of naphthalene was discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFarfantepenaeus aztecus 3aacute exposure 3aalgal blooms 3abiodegradation 3acontinental shelf 3ahypoxia 3anaphthalene 3aoxygen 3apetroleum 3apollution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3ashrimp 3aGulf of Mexico1 aStueben, Ben0 tMarine biology.g2006 Sept., v. 149, no. 6 p.1411-1415dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-006-0294-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01863naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245010900206300001200315520075200327592002801079596004401107650002801151650001001179650001701189650002701206650001401233650002501247650001301272700002601285700001901311773010301330856008301433852000901516655001201525IND60701860020221118040952.0220805e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070186002DNAL7 a10.1186/s13059-020-02089-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandes, Nadav1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0510-254610aPWAS: proteome-wide association study—linking genes and phenotypes by functional variation in proteins  ap. 173.  aWe introduce Proteome-Wide Association Study (PWAS), a new method for detecting gene-phenotype associations mediated by protein function alterations. PWAS aggregates the signal of all variants jointly affecting a protein-coding gene and assesses their overall impact on the protein’s function using machine learning and probabilistic models. Subsequently, it tests whether the gene exhibits functional variability between individuals that correlates with the phenotype of interest. PWAS can capture complex modes of heritability, including recessive inheritance. A comparison with GWAS and other existing methods proves its capacity to recover causal protein-coding genes and highlight new associations. PWAS is available as a command-line tool.  aPublisher supplied data  a339096cH2020 European Research Council 3aartificial intelligence 3agenes 3aheritability 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aphenotype 3aprobabilistic models 3aproteins1 aLinial, N.q(Nathan),1 aLinial, Michal0 tGenome biology.g2020 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.173-173dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-02089-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003700152245019900189500001900388520159800407592002802005650002002033650002702053650002202080650003502102650001402137650002602151650001202177651001102189653000702200653000802207653000802215653001102223653000802234653000902242653000902251653000802260653000902268653000902277653000702286653000702293653000902300653000902309653000902318653003002327653004202357653001502399653001002414653001402424700002502438700002302463700002602486700004302512773011202555856008702667852000902754655001202763IND60702593820221119064756.0200824e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070259382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2020.1139302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Isabel Cristina Schutz10aComparison of a direct immunofluorescence assay (Oxoid IMAGEN®) and a multiplex RT-PCR DNA microarray assay (CLART® PneumoVir) for the detection of respiratory viruses in hospitalized children  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objective of this study was to compare the positive detection rates obtained using the Oxoid IMAGEN® direct immunofluorescence assay (designated as IF) with those obtained using the CLART® PneumoVir multiplex RT-PCR DNA microarray assay (designated as RT-PCR) in the diagnosis of respiratory viruses in hospitalized children. This was a retrospective study of 62 individuals < 18 years old who had nasopharyngeal aspirates collected for virus identification in a tertiary university hospital in south Brazil between January 1st, 2014 and December 31st, 2014. All 62 nasopharingeal aspirates were analyzed using both assay methods. The main outcome to be measured was the difference in the proportion of test samples returning a positive virus detection result between the IF and the RT-PCR. The McNemar test was used for data analysis and the results showed that the RT-PCR and the IF methods produced 55 (88.7 %) and 17 (27.4 %) virus-positive samples, respectively (p < 0.001). The most prevalent virus was rhinovirus (45.5 % of the RT-PCR positive samples). The RT-PCR method increased the detection rates of human respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus and parainfluenza 3 virus. The RT-PCR and IF had concordant results in 19 samples (30.6 %) and discordant results in 43 samples (69.4 %). It is concluded that in comparison to the Oxoid IMAGEN® IF method, the CLART® PneumoVir multiplex RT-PCR method had a greater potential to contribute to the clinical management of hospitalized children due its greater ability in detecting respiratory viruses than the IF method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA microarrays 3aHuman orthopneumovirus 3aInfluenza A virus 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahospitals 3aretrospective studies 3aviruses 3aBrazil 0aIF 0aICU 0aARI 0aRT-PCR 0aNPA 0aHRSV 0aHPIV 0aFlu 0aHAdV 0aHMPV 0aEV 0aRV 0aHCoV 0aHBoV 0aLRTD 0aPolymerase chain reaction 0aRespiratory tract infections/virology 0aRhinovirus 0aChild 0aPreschool1 aAlegretti, Ana Paula1 aDe Paris, Fernanda1 aPaiva, Rodrigo Minuto1 aChakr, Valentina Coutinho Baldoto Gava0 tJournal of virological methods.g2020 Oct., v. 284 p.113930-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2020.1139303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001400138245009300152520180000245592002802045650001302073650001702086650001102103650002102114650001402135650002402149650001902173650001502192650000902207650001402216650001502230650001402245650001602259650001902275651001002294700001802304700002002322773011802342856007202460852000902532655001202541IND60653215820221119100406.0190714e20170428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065321582DNAL7 a10.3390/w90503102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Yao10aSustainable Measures for Mitigation of Flooding Hazards: A Case Study in Shanghai, China  aGlobal warming induces temperature variations and sea level changes for a long period of time. Many coastal cities around the world have experienced the harmful consequences of sea level changes and temperature variations. The city of Shanghai in China also suffers from the serious consequences of these two climatic factors. The geological and climatic conditions of Shanghai make it sensitive to flooding risks during heavy rainfall events. This paper analyses the conditions of sea level changes, temperature variations, and heavy rainfall events in Shanghai. Correspondingly, eustatic sea level change, tectonic movement of the continent, and land subsidence in Shanghai have effects on sea level changes. Correlation analysis indicates extraordinary short duration rainfall events have a relationship with temperature variations due to global warming. Moreover, the number of extraordinary torrential rainfall events also has a correlation with sea level changes. Pluvial flooding and potential damage to coastal structures are more likely to have serious effects as the number of flooding hazard events due to global warming and sea level changes increases. This study also established that to efficiently protect the environment, control economic losses, and prevent potential hazards, extra countermeasures including monitoring, forecasting, and engineering technology treatment should be adopted. Monitoring measurements combined with a database system on a website was found to be useful for forecasting and simulating flooding hazards. For systematic sustainable urban water system management, appropriate treatment technologies, such as sustainable urban water system, which can control and manage water quantity and quality, namely “the Sponge City”, should also be considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acase studies 3acities 3aclimatic factors 3adatabases 3afinancial economics 3aglobal warming 3amonitoring 3arain 3asea level 3asubsidence 3atectonics 3atemperature 3awater quantity 3aChina1 aXu, Ye-Shuang1 aArulrajah, Arul0 tWater.g2017 Apr. 28, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w90503103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007700150245011900227300001400346520140200360592002801762650001601790650001601806650000901822650001201831650001201843650002701855650001701882650000901899650001401908650001501922650002701937650002101964650001501985650000902000650001402009650001102023650002002034650001202054650001102066650001002077650000902087653001802096653002002114653003702134653002702171653002302198700007902221700006802300773009902368856008502467852000902552655001202561IND60615772820221120100259.0190411e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061577282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dendro.2018.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtega Rodriguez, Daigard Ricardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1937-680110aNutrient concentrations of 17- year-old Pinus taeda annual tree-rings analyzed by X-ray fluorescence microanalysis  ap. 67-79.  aTree-rings are sensitive indicators of soil chemical changes. X-ray fluorescence microanalysis (μ-XRF) can reveal the elemental distribution pattern along these rings. However, reports on quantitative μ-XRF methods targeted to wood analysis are scarce. This study aimed to analyze iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P) in annual tree-rings of wood cores cut from 24 trees of 17 year-old Pinus taeda planted in soil amended with six doses of composted pulp-mill sludge (CPMS). The nutrient concentrations were accessed using calibration curves built with spiked P. taeda wood pellets. Calcium and Mn content decreased from the pith to bark direction; K and S decreased from the pith up to 3rd tree-ring and, then, increased to the bark. Iron and P slight decreased from the pith up to the 13–14th tree-ring. Calcium, K and S presented strong and positive correlation with the rainier and hotter season (r > 0.4, p < 0.05). The CPMS increased the Ca, K, Fe and S and decreased Mn and P concentration in P. taeda wood in the 2nd–5th years. Furthermore, the P. taeda annual tree-ring molar ratios of Ca/Mn and K/Ca were good indicators of soil-pH and wood cambium activity. The μ-XRF methodology, as non-destructive method of nutrient concentration analysis in tree-rings, revealed potential uses in monitoring soil fertilizer treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus taeda 3aX-radiation 3abark 3acalcium 3acambium 3afertilizer application 3agrowth rings 3airon 3amanganese 3amonitoring 3anondestructive methods 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3apith 3apotassium 3asludge 3asoil amendments 3asoil pH 3asulfur 3atrees 3awood 0aLoblolly pine 0aDendrochemistry 0aX-ray fluorescence microanalysis 0aNon-destructive method 0aOrganic fertilizer1 aCarvalho, Hudson Wallace Pereira de1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0875-32611 aTomazello Filho, Mário,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9814-07780 tDendrochronologia.g2018 Dec., v. 52 p.67-79dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl71157x1125-78657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2018.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011000168500002200278500002200300520110000322592002801422650001101450650001301461650001301474650001901487650001101506650001901517650001301536650002201549650001101571653002301582653001501605653001601620653001301636653003501649653002401684700001501708700001601723700001501739700001701754700001901771773007701790856008301867852000901950655001201959IND60612435920221119182000.0180905s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061243592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scib.2018.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Chenglong10aHigh-temperature treatment induced carbon anode with ultrahigh Na storage capacity at low-voltage plateau  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aSodium-ion batteries (NIBs) show the great prospect on the energy storage application benefiting from their low cost and the abundant Na resources despite the expected lower energy density compared with lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). To further enhance the competitive advantage, especially in energy density, developing the high-capacity carbon anode materials can be one of the effective approaches to realize the goal. Herein, we report a novel carbon anode made from charcoal with a high capacity of ∼ 400 mAh g–¹, wherein about 85% (> 330 mAh g–¹) of its total capacity is derived from the long plateau region below ∼ 0.1 V, which differs from those of typical hard carbon materials (∼ 300 mAh g–¹) in NIBs but is similar to the graphite anode in LIBs. When coupled with air-stable Na0.9Cu0.22Fe0.30Mn0.48O2 oxide cathode, a high-energy density of ∼240 Wh kg–¹ is achieved with good rate capability and cycling stability. The discovery of this promising carbon anode is expected to further improve the energy density of NIBs towards large-scale electrical energy storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acathodes 3acharcoal 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3agraphene 3alithium batteries 3asodium 0aSodium-ion battery 0aNa storage 0aHard carbon 0aCharcoal 0aHigh-temperature carbonization 0aLow-voltage plateau1 aWang, Qidi1 aLu, Yaxiang1 aLi, Baohua1 aChen, Liquan1 aHu, Yong-Sheng0 tScience bulletin.g2018, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12554x2095-92737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2018.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245011500174300001200289520152400301592002801825596012801853596003601981650002002017650001602037650001602053650002002069650002402089650001902113650001402132650003202146650001102178650002302189650001702212650001702229650001902246650001502265650002302280650001802303650001702321650001702338650001002355700001802365700001702383700002002400700002102420700002102441700001902462700001802481700001702499700002602516700006002542700001702602700005802619773010502677856008302782852000902865655001202874IND60743499820221120125543.0220621e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074349982DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-021-03097-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrashāda, Muhammada,10aEvaluation of Jatropha curcas L. leaves mulching on wheat growth and biochemical attributes under water stress  ap. 303.  aBACKGROUND: Organic mulches are widely used in crop production systems. Due to their benefits in improving soil fertility, retention of soil moisture and weed control. Field experiments were conducted during wheat growing seasons of 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 to evaluate the effects of Jatropha leaves mulch on the growth of wheat varieties ‘Wadan-17’ (rainfed) and ‘Pirsabaq-2013’ (irrigated) under well irrigated and water stress conditions (non-irrigated maintaining 40% soil field capacity). Jatropha mulch was applied to the soil surface at 0, 1, 3 and 5 Mg ha⁻¹ before sowing grains in the field. Under conditions of water stress, Jatropha mulch significantly maintained the soil moisture content necessary for normal plant growth. RESULTS: We noted a decrease in plant height, shoot and root fresh/dry weight, leaf area, leaf relative water content (LRWC), chlorophyll, and carotenoid content due to water stress. However, water stress caused an increase in leaf and root phenolics content, leaf soluble sugars and electrolytes leakage. We observed that Jatropha mulch maintained LRWC, plant height, shoot and root fresh/dry weight, leaf area and chlorophyll content under water stress. Moreover, water stress adverse effects on leaf soluble sugar content and electrolyte leakage were reversed to normal by Jatropha mulch. CONCLUSION: Therefore, it may be concluded that Jatropha leaves mulch will minimize water stress adverse effects on wheat by maintaining soil moisture and plant water status.  aPublisher supplied data  aMZE-RO1721cThe research was funded by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic, institutional support MZE-RO1721.  aTURSP-2020/139cTaif University 3aJatropha curcas 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3acrop production 3aelectrolyte leakage 3afield capacity 3aleaf area 3aleaf relative water content 3aleaves 3aphenolic compounds 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3asoil fertility 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asugar content 3awater stress 3aweed control 3awheat1 aUllah, Faizan1 aShah, Fahad,1 aMehmood, Sultan1 aKhan, Asif Ullah1 aBrtnicky, Martin1 aKintl, Antonin1 aHolatko, Jiri1 aIrshad, Inam1 aEl-Sharnouby, Mohamed1 aEL Sabagh, Ayman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4241-192X1 aDatta, Rahul1 aDanish, Subhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6182-62070 tBMC plant biology.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.303-303dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-021-03097-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012400170300001800294520126900312592002801581653001801609653001901627653002301646653003401669653001501703653002201718700001801740700002301758700001901781700001601800773013901816856008201955852000902037655001202046IND60556517820221118221026.0161102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055651782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.xphs.2016.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPikal, Michael J.10aFreeze-Drying Process Development and Scale-Up: Scale-Up of Edge Vial Versus Center Vial Heat Transfer Coefficients, Kv  ap. 3333-3343.  aThis report presents calculations of the difference between the vial heat transfer coefficient of the “edge vial” and the “center vial” at all scales. The only scale-up adjustment for center vials is for the contribution of radiation from the shelf upon which the vial sits by replacing the emissivity of the laboratory dryer shelf with the emissivity of the production dryer shelf. With edge vials, scales-up adjustments are more complex. While convection is not important, heat transfer from the wall to the bands (surrounding the vial array) by radiation and directly from the band to the vials by both radiation and conduction is important; this radiation heat transfer depends on the emissivity of the vial and the bands and is nearly independent of the emissivity of the dryer walls. Differences in wall temperatures do impact the edge vial effect and scale-up, and estimates for wall temperatures are needed for both laboratory and manufacturing dryers. Auto-loading systems (no bands) may give different edge vial heat transfer coefficients than when operating with bands. Satisfactory agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental values of the edge vial effect indicate that results calculated from the theory are of useful accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 0afreeze drying 0alyophilization 0amathematical model 0aprocess analytical technology 0aprocessing 0aquality by design1 aBogner, Robin1 aMudhivarthi, Vamsi1 aSharma, Puneet1 aSane, Pooja0 tJournal of Pharmaceutical Sciences.g2016 Nov., v. 105 p.3333-3343dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Pharmacists Association®x0022-35497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2016.07.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012300167300002000290520138800310592002801698650001301726650000801739650001401747650002601761650000901787650003401796650001401830650001501844650002001859650002801879650002601907653002701933653002001960653003901980653002602019653003302045653002402078653002602102700002202128700001902150700001702169700005802186700005502244773014702299856008502446852000902531655001202540IND60752615820221122024049.0211004e20210921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075261582DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c048872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Kisuk10aCapturing Polar and Nonpolar Particles with an Electroadhesive Device Using Interfacial and Orientational Polarization  ap. 13367-13375.  aMany air filtration technologies have been used to solve the environmental issues of fine and ultrafine dust particles, which have been raised over the past decades. Many other filtration technologies have been developed, while high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) is widely used recently due to its high efficiency. However, the HEPA filter has some limitations, such as high pressure drop, nonrecyclability, and most importantly, short lifetime. Regarding other types of air filters, electrostatic filters require a two-stage process (i.e., charging and polarization) of particles before filtration, whereas electroadhesion air filters could capture both polar and nonpolar particles without a two-stage process. The dust-holding capacity allows the quantitative analysis of the areal adhesion amount to be conducted. In this study, three different kinds of particles of fine dust, microcrystalline cellulose, and Teflon were tested. A model equation of the areal adhesion amount was also developed as a function of boundary edge length, voltage, and the dielectric constant of each material and allowed the areal adhesion amount of fine dust particles to be maximized, which is well above those of the HEPA filter and electrostatic filter. The optical images clearly showed that the dielectric polarization of polar particles was stronger than that of nonpolar particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aair 3acellulose 3adielectric properties 3adust 3aelectric potential difference 3aequations 3afiltration 3agreen chemistry 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3aquantitative analysis 0aelectroadhesive device 0aelectroadhesion 0ainterfacial (induced) polarization 0aareal adhesion amount 0apolar and nonpolar particles 0afine dust particles 0adust-holding capacity1 aChung, June-Young1 aPark, In-Kyung1 aKim, Na-Yeon1 aSuhr, Jonghwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3491-57381 aNam, Jae-Do1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7682-79260 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Sept. 21, v. 9, no. 39 p.13367-13375dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c048873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001700167245009900184300001600283500000900299520097100308592002801279650002901307650002001336650001201356650001401368650001601382650001901398650000801417650001301425650002001438650001201458651002301470773012201493852000901615856009601624655001201720991599117670742620221121092141.0191122e197307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7391945772DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1973.00021962006500040025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, A.

According to the study results spore germination of P. italicum can be inhibited by both CMSC and C. laurentii treatment. Moreover, the growth of C. laurentii can be maintained by low CMCS concentration in vitro. The blue mold in grapefruit fruit inoculated with P. italicum was decreased in all treatments compared with the control fruit. The combination of CMSC and C. laurentii treatment resulted in a significantly synergistic effects in smallest lesion diameter and decay incidence. The defense enzyme activities, such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase and antifungal compounds like total phenolic related to disease resistance can be induced by combined treatment. Furthermore, the commercial quality parameters of the CMCS combined with C. laurentii treatment which were measured by ascorbic acid, titratable acidity, weight loss and total soluble solid, were better than those treated with treatments alone. According to the results, the combination of CMSC and C. laurentii treatment can maintain fruit quality and control postharvest decay more effectively than single treatment, and can be commercially used in grapefruit fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptococcus laurentii 3aPenicillium italicum 3aantifungal agents 3aantifungal properties 3aascorbic acid 3acatechol oxidase 3achitosan 3aenzyme activity 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agrapefruits 3amolds (fungi) 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3apolyphenols 3apostharvest diseases 3aspore germination 3asynergism 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3aweight loss 0aCarboxymethyl chitosan 0aCryptococcus laurentii 0aBlue mold 0aGrapefruit fruit 0aBiological control1 aDeng, Jia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2361-03411 aJiao, Junying1 aLu, Yanyuan1 aYang, Lei1 aShi, Zhengjun0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 July 27, v. 253 p.35-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.04.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008300156300001800239500002000257520144200277592002801719650002401747650001401771650001901785650003101804650000901835650001601844650002201860650001301882650001001895650001601905650002801921650001901949650001701968651001001985700001401995700001702009700001802026700001402044700001602058773013902074856007302213852000902286655001202295IND60651677720221121080820.0190712e20141023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065167772DNAL7 a10.3390/su61073342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Weihua10aAssessing Heat Health Risk for Sustainability in Beijing’s Urban Heat Island  ap. 7334-7357.  aJournal Article  aThis research is motivated by the increasing threat of urban heat waves that are likely worsened by pervasive global warming and urbanization. Different regions of the city including urban, borderland and rural area will experience different levels of heat health risk. In this paper, we propose an improved approach to quantitatively assess Beijing’s heat health risk based on three factors from hazard, vulnerability and especially environment which is considered as an independent factor because different land use/cover types have different influence on ambient air temperatures under the Urban Heat Island effect. The results show that the heat health risk of Beijing demonstrates a spatial-temporal pattern with higher risk in the urban area, lower risk in the borderland between urban and rural area, and lowest risk in the rural area, and the total risk fluctuated dramatically during 2008–2011. To be more specific, the heat health risk was clearly higher in 2009 and 2010 than in 2008 and 2011. Further analysis with the urban area at sub-district level signifies that the impervious surface (urban area such as buildings, roads, et al.) ratio is of high correlation with the heat health risk. The validation results show that the proposed method improved the accuracy of heat health risk assessment. We recommend that policy makers should develop efficient urban planning to accomplish Beijing’s sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abuildings 3aglobal warming 3ahealth effects assessments 3aheat 3aheat island 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3aroads 3arural areas 3asustainable development 3aurban planning 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aLiu, Zhao1 aZhang, Lijie1 aTang, Qiuhong1 aLiao, Hua1 aLi, Xian'en0 tSustainability.g2014 Oct. 23, v. 6, no. 10 p.7334-7357dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su61073343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245009400202300001600296500002000312520201400332592002802346596003002374650002602404650001102430650002402441650002502465650002902490650001402519650002202533650002102555650002302576650002202599650001902621650001102640650001402651650001002665650001102675650001202686650001602698651001302714700002002727700002102747700001702768700001902785773011702804856007302921852000902994655001203003IND60631131520221122004054.0190219e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063113152DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.132362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeeney, A.q(Alex),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0806-906410aStream invertebrate diversity reduces with invasion of river banks by non‐native plants  ap. 485-496.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInvasion of riparian zones by non‐native plants is a global issue and commonly perceived as a challenge for river and fishery managers, but the type and extent of ecological changes induced by such invasions remain poorly understood. Established effects on sediment delivery, allochthonous inputs, and channel shading could potentially alter aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages, with implications for in‐stream ecological quality. We assessed responses in the diversity, quality, and heterogeneity of stream macroinvertebrate communities to riparian invasion by non‐native plants. Macroinvertebrates were collected from 24 sites on low order streams in central and southern Scotland during spring and autumn. The effect of invasive non‐native plants (INNP) on macroinvertebrates was assessed relative to that of local physical and chemical factors. Invasive non‐native plants cover was associated with stronger effects than other factors on local diversity of macroinvertebrates (33% reduction at the highest INNP cover) but also increased macroinvertebrate abundance across sites. Invaded sites were also associated with lower macroinvertebrate biomonitoring scores. Community composition differed between invaded and uninvaded sites in autumn, but not in spring. However, INNP influence on macroinvertebrate composition was generally secondary to that of physicochemical variables (e.g. channel shade, substrate diversity). We demonstrate that the influence of INNP extends beyond well‐known impacts on plant communities to reductions mainly in stream macroinvertebrate diversity. Combined with the negative impact on pollution‐sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa this raises concerns over the ecological health of streams with heavily invaded riparian zones. Our findings suggest that efforts to improve low order streams by actively managing severe riparian invasions are merited, but the size and uncertainty of the likely ecological gains must also be evaluated against the effort involved.  aPublisher supplied data  cScottish Natural Heritage 3aaquatic invertebrates 3aautumn 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afisheries 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3amacroinvertebrates 3aplant communities 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3asediments 3ashade 3aspring 3astreams 3auncertainty 3aScotland1 aPattison, Zarah1 aWillby, Nigel J.1 aBoon, P.

LOCATION: More than 1000 linear kilometres of sub‐alpine tree line in the Catalan Pyrenees (north‐east Spain) METHODS: Using aerial photographs and supervised classification, we reclassified the images into a binary raster with ‘tree’ and ‘non‐tree’ values, and determined canopy cover in 1956 and 2006. We then determined the change in position of the tree line between 1956 and 2006 based on changes in forest cover. We used the distance from the position of the tree line in 1956 to the theoretical potential tree line – determined from interpretation of aerial photographs, identifying the highest old remnants of forest for homogeneous areas of the landscape in terms of bioclimatic conditions, bedrock, landform and exposure – as a surrogate of intensity of past land uses. RESULTS: Our analyses showed that the Pyrenean tree line has moved upwards on average almost 40 m (mean advance ± SE: 35.3 ± 0.5 m, P < 0.001), although in most cases it has remained unchanged (61.8%) or advanced moderately, i.e. between 25 and 100 m (23.7%); only 9.2% of the locations have advanced more than 100 m. Upward shifts of the tree line were significantly larger in locations heavily modified in the past by anthropogenic disturbance (mean advance 50.8 ± 1.1 m) compared with near natural tree line locations (19.7 ± 0.8 m, P < 0.001), where the mean displacement was much lower than expected and was not related to changes in temperature along the study period. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results stress the impact of the cessation of human activity in driving forest dynamics at the tree line in the Catalan Pyrenees, and reveal a very low or even negligible signal of climate change in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3aanthropogenic activities 3abedrock 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3aforests 3ahumans 3aland use 3alandforms 3alandscapes 3atemperature 3atreeline 3atrees 3aSpain1 aColl, Lluís,1 aBrotons, Lluís1 aNinot, Josep M.0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2016 Mar., v. 25, no. 3 p.263-273dBlackwell Sciencex1466-822X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.124073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05352naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008600174300001600260520307400276592002803350650001103378650003003389650002003419650002803439650001003467650001903477650002003496650001003516650001203526650001603538650002103554650000903575650001703584650002303601650001203624650001603636650001103652650001203663650001403675650001903689650001703708650001103725650000903736650000803745650000903753650004303762650000903805650001503814650001303829650002003842650001903862650000903881650002403890650002503914650001603939650001203955650002103967650001703988650001704005650002404022650001004046650001004056651001104066653002104077653004304098653001404141700002904155700004704184700002604231700002904257700002904286773011404315856008404429852000904513655001204522IND60133108920221122220529.0150518e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013310892DNAL7 a10.1080/07315724.2014.9261622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Pietro, Giuliano10aProfile Development of Noncommunicable Chronic Diseases in a Brazilian Rural Town  ap. 191-198.  aObjective: To assess the relationship between socioeconomic and anthropometric data, frequency of food consumption, and the development of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in patients from a small rural town in northeastern Brazil. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire study was performed on patients from the Lagarto City Hospital (n = 50) and from family health units (n = 370). Results: The 420 patients in the study had one or more NCDs such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. The mean age was 63.1 ± 8.7 years for both sexes. The typical patient was of mixed or black descent (66%), a farmer, and of low socioeconomic status and education; 100% of men and 84% of women were illiterate or had less than 4 years of schooling. Approximately 50% of women and 89% of men were married and most had never used tobacco or were ex-smokers. The body mass index (BMI) of the study population was 29.4 ± 5.5 kg/m ², where 70% of the patients were type 2 diabetic with waist circumferences of 99.8 ± 21.2 cm for men and 98.1 ± 13.9 cm for women. The correlation between BMI and waist circumference was r = 0.88. Even with the use of medication, total cholesterol levels of above 240 mg/dL were recorded in 10% of women and about 5% of men. Likewise, 10% of women and 100% of men had triglyceride levels above 200 mg/dL; glucose levels were 133.6 ± 47.4 mg/dL in men and 110.8 ± 38.8 mg/dL in women. Blood pressure values were high, even in patients using one or more antihypertensive drugs for at least 2 years (systolic pressure = 128.5 ± 18.2; diastolic pressure = 86.3 ± 8.9 mmHg). Indices considered above the limit recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) were obtained for 60% of women and 100% of men. Our research revealed that this population is characterized by a relatively low intake of fats and oils. Nevertheless, 100% of patients consumed meat every day, 57.6% never consumed processed foods such as candy or soft drinks, and 89% consumed coffee daily. Furthermore, the consumption of fruits was very low: 46.6% of respondents never ate fruit and 7.8% rarely consumed fruit. Likewise, 68.2% reported never eating milk and dairy products. Vegetables were consumed by only 51.4% of the population and 38.5% rarely or never consumed green vegetables. Products made from wheat, maize, cassava, beans, and rice were often consumed by 59.2% of the population. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the studied population is affected by nutritional transition, in which the greater access to carbohydrates and animal proteins is associated with high BMI, with the vast majority overweight and suffering from uncontrolled hypertension despite the use of medications. The high consumption of carbohydrates and animal protein, rapid urbanization, and sedentary lifestyle are the main factors responsible for the epidemic of noncommunicable diseases, especially among people with low income and education. Men are particularly affected, with increased visceral fat characterized by an increased waist circumference.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlacks 3aWorld Health Organization 3aanimal proteins 3aantihypertensive agents 3abeans 3ablood pressure 3abody mass index 3acandy 3acassava 3acholesterol 3achronic diseases 3acorn 3adrug therapy 3aeducational status 3afarmers 3afood intake 3afruits 3aglucose 3ahospitals 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypertension 3aincome 3ameat 3amen 3amilk 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoils 3aoverweight 3apatients 3aprocessed foods 3aquestionnaires 3arice 3asedentary lifestyle 3asocioeconomic status 3asoft drinks 3atobacco 3atriacylglycerols 3aurbanization 3avisceral fat 3awaist circumference 3awheat 3awomen 3aBrazil 0achronic diseases 0anutritional epidemiological transition 0alifestyle1 aCardoso, Damaris Santana1 ada Silva, Heloisa Mendonça Bernini Soares1 aSantos, Jessyca Costa1 ados Santos, Jordana Rosa1 aSimões, Rodrigo Almeida0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2015 May 4, v. 34, no. 3 p.191-198dRoutledgex1541-10877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2014.9261623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245013600210300001100346506007600357520216800433592002802601596003602629506003702665650001602702650001302718650001302731650001402744650001102758650001202769650001002781650001102791650002502802650001102827650002102838700002002859700002502879700002202904700002002926773014302946856008103089852000903170655001203179IND60637603920221207130946.0200104e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063760392DNAL7 a10.1186/s12970-019-0287-62doi7 aPMC64720672pmcid7 a309998972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBello, Marissa L.14aThe effects of TeaCrine® and caffeine on endurance and cognitive performance during a simulated match in high-level soccer players  ap. 20.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Theacrine (1,3,7,9-tetramethyluric-acid) is a pure alkaloid with a similar structure to caffeine and acts comparably as an adenosine receptor antagonist. Early studies have shown non-habituating effects, including increases in energy and focus in response to Teacrine®, the compound containing pure theacrine. The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the effects of Teacrine® and caffeine on cognitive performance and time-to-exhaustion during a simulated soccer game in high-level male and female athletes. METHODS: Male and female soccer players (N = 24; MAgₑ = 20.96 ± 2.05y, MMₐₗₑVO₂ₘₐₓ = 55.31 ± 3.39 mL/O₂/kg, MFₑₘₐₗₑVO₂ₘₐₓ = 50.97 ± 3.90 mL/O₂/kg) completed a 90-min simulated treadmill soccer match over four randomized sessions (TeaCrine®, caffeine, TeaCrine® + caffeine, placebo). Cognitive testing at halftime and end-of-game including simple reaction time (SRT), choice RT (CRT), and cognitive-load RT with distraction questions (COGRT/COGRTWᵣₒₙg) was performed, with a run time-to-exhaustion (TTE) at 85% VO₂ₘₐₓ following end-of-game cognitive testing. Session times and pre-exercise nutrition were controlled. RM-MANOVAs with univariate follow-ups were conducted and significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: TTE trended towards significance in TeaCrine® and TeaCrine® + caffeine conditions compared to placebo (P < 0.052). A condition main effect (P < 0.05) occurred with faster CRT in caffeine and TeaCrine® + caffeine compared to placebo. COGRTWᵣₒₙg showed a significant time main effect, with better accuracy at end-of-game compared to halftime (P < 0.05). A time x condition interaction in SRT (P < 0.05) showed placebo improved from halftime to end-of-game. CONCLUSIONS: The 27–38% improvements in TTE reflect increased performance capacity that may have important implications for overtime scenarios. These findings suggest TeaCrine® favorably impacts endurance and the combination with caffeine provides greater benefits on cognitive function than either supplement independently.  aPublisher supplied data  a103513cCompound Solutions Inc.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantagonists 3aathletes 3acaffeine 3acognition 3aenergy 3afemales 3amales 3aoxygen 3apurinergic receptors 3asports 3asports nutrition1 aWalker, Alan J.1 aMcFadden, Bridget A.1 aSanders, David J.1 aArent, Shawn M.0 tJournal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.20-20dBioMed CentralwJournal:21397x1550-27837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12970-019-0287-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03535naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002500191245008800216300001600304506007600320520179700396592002802193506003702221650001602258650002402274650003402298650001102332650001102343650001102354650001502365651001802380653001602398653001202414653001802426653001402444653003802458700001902496700002302515700002302538700002302561700002102584700002202605700002002627700001902647700002302666700002302689700002202712700002802734773011402762856008402876852000902960655001202969IND60133109020221207132728.0150518e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013310902DNAL7 a10.1080/07315724.2014.9312632doi7 aPMC47322672pmcid7 a257510192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacanowski, Carly R.10aDoes Measuring Body Weight Impact Subsequent Response to Eating Behavior Questions?  ap. 199-204.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aObjectives : If being weighed impacts perceptions of eating behavior, it is important that the order of questionnaires and weighing be considered in research and practice. A quasi-experimental study was performed to examine whether being weighed immediately prior to completing a questionnaire affects responses to eating behavior questions. It was hypothesized that being weighed would serve as a priming stimulus and increase measures of dietary restraint, disinhibition, and hunger. Methods : Trained researchers collected a sample of volunteers (n = 355) in 8 locations in the United States on two Saturdays in the summer of 2011. Half of the participants were weighed immediately prior to completing the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), with the remaining half weighed immediately after TFEQ completion. Results : A priori hypotheses were not supported despite replicating known relationships between weight, dietary restraint and disinhibition. Results indicated that being weighed first produced a difference in differences on disinhibition scores between low restraint score (95% CI = 4.65–6.02) and high restraint score (95% CI = 6.11–7.57) compared to being weighed after questionnaire completion (p = 0.003). However, this relationship was not significant when modeling restraint as a continuous variable, questioning the use of dichotomization. Conclusions : Being weighed is unlikely to be a strong enough prime to significantly change scores on eating behavior questionnaires for everyone, but may allow differences in restraint status to become more evident. Researchers assessing dietary restraint should be wary of the possibility of producing different results when treating restraint as continuous or dichotomous, which could lead to different interpretations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody weight 3adietary restriction 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ahunger 3amodels 3asummer 3avolunteers 3aUnited States 0abody weight 0apriming 0adisinhibition 0arestraint 0aThree-Factor Eating Questionnaire1 aSobal, Jeffery1 aLevitsky, David A.1 aSherwood, Nancy E.1 aKeeler, Chelsey L.1 aMiller, April M.1 aAcosta, Ashley R.1 aHansen, Natalie1 aWang, Peter L.1 aGuilbert, Sarah R.1 aParoly, Arianne L.1 aCommesso, Michael1 aVermeylen, Francoise M.0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2015 May 4, v. 34, no. 3 p.199-204dRoutledgex1541-10877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2014.9312633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009700174300001400271520139100285536009301676592002801769596009201797650002701889650001301916650001401929650001601943650001801959650002201977650001401999650002302013650002102036650002702057650002902084650001602113650001502129650002002144650001802164650003502182650003302217653001902250653001402269653002502283653002302308653001802331653003102349700001902380700001502399700002702414700002702441773009702468856008602565852000902651655001202660IND60693044920221122103545.0210111e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069304492DNAL7 a10.1080/17597269.2016.12045852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoseph, Manju Mary10aBiodiesel prospective of five diatom strains using growth parameters and fatty acid profiles  ap. 81-89.  aBiomass productivity, lipid content, lipid productivity and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles of three pelagic and two benthic diatom strains (Chaetoceros calcitrans, Thalassiosira sp., Skeletonema sp., Navicula sp., Nitzschia sp.) were evaluated to identify potent strains for biodiesel production. Navicula sp. and Thalassiosira sp. were found to be higher biomass producing strains, whereas Nitzschia sp. showed lower biomass productivity. Lipid content was higher for Thalassiosira sp. and lower for Skeletonema sp. Navicula sp. was found to be the most suitable biodiesel feedstock in terms of saturated (65.59%) and monounsaturated (27.92%) fatty acids. Cluster analysis of the strains based on growth parameters and FAME profiles revealed close resemblance between Chaetoceros calcitrans and Skeletonema sp. and also between Thalassiosira sp. and Navicula sp. But Nitzschia sp. was secerned from the other strains. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) provided a confirmation that lipid content alone cannot be a reliable criterion for evaluating suitable feedstock. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was successively utilized for strain selection, which identified Navicula sp. as the ideal biodiesel feedstock, followed by Thalassiosira sp. The study also found that Nitzschia sp. is inferior as a viable biodiesel feedstock.  aKerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment (IN) [33/WSD-BLS/2013/CSTE]  aPublisher supplied data  a33/WSD-BLS/2013/CSTEcKerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment (IN) 3aChaetoceros calcitrans 3aNavicula 3aNitzschia 3aSkeletonema 3aThalassiosira 3abenthic organisms 3abiodiesel 3abiomass production 3acluster analysis 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acid methyl esters 3afatty acids 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3alipid content 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aprincipal component analysis 0aDiatom strains 0abiodiesel 0abiomass productivity 0alipid productivity 0aFAME profiles 0aanalytic hierarchy process1 aRenjith, K.

Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations of TIP4P/ice water to study the changes in the connected regions of empty space within the liquid, which we investigate using the Voronoi-voids network. We observe two important features: supercooling enhances the fraction of nonspherical voids and different sizes of voids tend to cluster forming a percolating network. By examining order parameters such as the local structure index (LSI), tetrahedrality and topological defects, we show that water molecules near large void clusters tend to be slightly more tetrahedral than those near small voids, with a lower population of under- and overcoordinated defects. We show further that the distribution of closed rings of water molecules around small and large void clusters maintain a balance between 6 and 7 membered rings. Our results highlight the changes of the dual voids and water network as a structural hallmark of supercooling and provide insights into the molecular origins of cooperative effects underlying density fluctuations on the subnanometer and nanometer length scale. In addition, the percolation of the voids and the hydrogen bond network around the voids may serve as useful order parameters to investigate density fluctuations in supercooled water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglass transition temperature 3ahydrogen bonding 3aice 3aliquids 3amolecular dynamics 3asimulation models 3asupercooling 3atopology1 aOnat, Berk1 aSosso, Gabriele C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6156-73991 aHassanali, Ali0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Feb. 07, v. 124, no. 11 p.2180-2190dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b101443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245008200173300001600255520146100271592002801732650002801760650003101788650002201819650000901841650001601850650001901866650001901885650001101904650001701915650002801932650002001960650002501980650002602005650002102031650001902052650001402071650001002085650002202095650002102117650002902138650002602167650001002193700001802203700001802221773011002239856008102349852000902430655001202439IND50089132820221116165414.0160312e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008913282DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-014-2063-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbd El-Daim, Islam A.10aImproved heat stress tolerance of wheat seedlings by bacterial seed treatment  ap. 337-350.  aAIM: To investigate if rhizosphere bacteria can improve heat tolerance of wheat. METHODS: Wheat (Triticum aestivum) seeds of the cultivars Olivin and Sids1 were treated with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens UCMB5113 or Azospirillum brasilense NO40 and young seedlings tested for management of short term heat stress. RESULTS: Bacterial treatment improved heat stress management of wheat. Olivin showed higher heat tolerance than Sids1 both with non-inoculated and inoculated seeds. Heat increased transcript levels of several stress related genes in the leaves, while expression was lower in inoculated plants but elevated compared with the control. Enzymes of the ascorbate-glutathione redox cycle were activated in leaves after heat challenge but showed a lower response in inoculated plants. Metabolite profiling distinguished different treatments dependent on analysis technique with respect to primary and secondary metabolites. Analysis of some plant stress regulatory genes showed that bacterial treatment increased transcript levels while effects of heat treatment varied. CONCLUSIONS: The improvement of heat tolerance by bacteria seems associated with reduced generation of reactive oxygen species (and consequently less cell damage), small changes in the metabolome while preactivation of certain heat shock transcription factors seems important. Seed inoculation with beneficial bacteria seems a promising strategy to improve heat tolerance of wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzospirillum brasilense 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aTriticum aestivum 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aheat treatment 3aleaves 3aplant stress 3areactive oxygen species 3aregulator genes 3arhizosphere bacteria 3asecondary metabolites 3aseed inoculation 3aseed treatment 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3astress management 3astress tolerance 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3awheat1 aBejai, Sarosh1 aMeijer, Johan0 tPlant and soil.g2014 June, v. 379, no. 1-2 p.337-350dSpringer International Publishingx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2063-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03548naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100003500169245011400204300001600318520153600334592002801870650001801898650001501916650001301931650001601944650002801960650002401988650001202012650001702024650001702041650001402058650001602072650001402088650002802102650002702130650004402157650001002201650002302211650001902234650002102253650001602274650002802290650002102318650001202339650001102351650001102362650004702373650003402420650001002454650002702464650000902491650002102500650001602521700001802537700002302555700002602578700002402604700002602628700002302654773009202677856008402769852000902853655001202862IND50060346020221120151946.0141112e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006034602DNAL7 a232445402pmid7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2012.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaris, “Mo'ez Al-Islam” E.10aIntermittent fasting during Ramadan attenuates proinflammatory cytokines and immune cells in healthy subjects  ap. 947-955.  aIntermittent fasting and caloric restriction have been shown to extend life expectancy and reduce inflammation and cancer promotion in animal models. It was hypothesized that intermittent prolonged fasting practiced during the month of Ramadan (RIF) could positively affect the inflammatory state. To investigate this hypothesis, a cross-sectional study was designed to investigate the impact of RIF on selected inflammatory cytokines and immune biomarkers in healthy subjects. Fifty (21 men and 29 women) healthy volunteers who practiced Ramadan fasting were recruited for the investigation of circulating proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α), immune cells (total leukocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes), and anthropometric and dietary assessments. The investigations were conducted 1 week before Ramadan fasting, at the end of the third week of Ramadan, and 1 month after the cessation of Ramadan month. The proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α; systolic and diastolic blood pressures; body weight; and body fat percentage were significantly lower (P < .05) during Ramadan as compared with before Ramadan or after the cessation of Ramadan fasting. Immune cells significantly decreased during Ramadan but still remained within the reference ranges. These results indicate that RIF attenuates inflammatory status of the body by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine expression and decreasing body fat and circulating levels of leukocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abiomarkers 3abody fat 3abody weight 3across-sectional studies 3aexperimental design 3afasting 3agranulocytes 3ainterleukins 3alongevity 3alymphocytes 3amonocytes 3asystolic blood pressure 3atumor necrosis factors 2aAdipose Tissueximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aAdult 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBlood Pressure 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weight 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aCytokinesxblood 2aFasting 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInflammationxbloodxprevention & control. 2aInflammation Mediatorsxblood 2aIslam 2aLeukocytesxmetabolism 2aMale 2aReference Values 2aYoung Adult1 aKacimi, Safia1 aAl-Kurd, Ref'at A.1 aFararjeh, Mohammad A.1 aBustanji, Yasser K.1 aMohammad, Mohammad K.1 aSalem, Mohammad L.0 tNutrition research.g2012 Dec., v. 32, no. 12 p.947-955dElsevier Inc.x0271-53177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2012.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007100166300001600237520139800253592002801651650001601679650001101695650001201706650000901718650001601727773009501743856008101838852000901919655001201928IND60437482220221119193506.0151022e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043748222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-005-0038-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavenda, B. H.10aThermodynamics of an ideal generalized gas: II : Means of order α  ap. 523-531.  aThe property that power means are monotonically increasing functions of their order is shown to be the basis of the second laws not only for processes involving heat conduction, but also for processes involving deformations. This generalizes earlier work involving only pure heat conduction and underlines the incomparability of the internal energy and adiabatic potentials when expressed as powers of the adiabatic variable. In an L-potential equilibration, the final state will be one of maximum entropy, whereas in an entropy equilibration, the final state will be one of minimum L. Unlike classical equilibrium thermodynamic phase space, which lacks an intrinsic metric structure insofar as distances and other geometrical concepts do not have an intrinsic thermodynamic significance in such spaces, a metric space can be constructed for the power means: the distance between means of different order is related to the Carnot efficiency. In the ideal classical gas limit, the average change in the entropy is shown to be proportional to the difference between the Shannon and Rényi entropies for nonextensive systems that are multifractal in nature. The L potential, like the internal energy, is a Schur convex function of the empirical temperature, which satisfies Jensen's inequality, and serves as a measure of the tendency to uniformity in processes involving pure thermal conduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3aenergy 3aentropy 3aheat 3atemperature0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2005 Nov., v. 92, no. 11 p.523-531dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-005-0038-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005800138245012700196300001800323500002000341520198100361592002802342596003402370650002602404650001402430650001102444650002702455650001202482650001802494650001702512650001002529650001902539650001402558650001302572650002302585650001402608650001102622651001002633700005902643700006202702700005902764773012202823856007202945852000903017655001203026IND60626261720221118062144.0181220e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062626172DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.29402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnes, Alissa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5287-413810aDemographics and length and weight relationships of commercially important sharks along the north‐western coast of India  ap. 1374-1383.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBiological data including size, sex ratios, male maturity, and length and weight relationships for four commercially important shark species, including the milk shark (Rhizoprionodon acutus Rüppell, 1837), the grey sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon oligolinx Springer, 1964), the spadenose shark (Scoliodon laticaudus Muller & Henle, 1838), and the bigeye smoothhound shark (Iago omanensis Norman, 1939), landed in Porbandar, Gujarat, India, are provided. All four species were landed by trawlers and gill‐netters across three defined seasons, with seasonal differences. Higher proportions of mature R. acutus and S. laticaudus were observed in the pre‐monsoon season, with neonates caught throughout the year, whereas higher proportions of mature R. oligolinx and I. omanensis were recorded during the monsoon season, with neonates caught in post‐monsoon and pre‐monsoon, respectively, showing important species‐level differences. These small‐bodied shark species (less than 1 m in total length) showed positive allometry in their length and weight relationships. Unlike the other three species, I. omanensis showed high disparity in total lengths (LT) between the sexes, with females being larger than males, and with males maturing faster, with the smallest mature male of 33.58 cm LT. Females outnumbered males except in R. acutus, and pregnant females of all species were recorded at least once. Of the 971 males recorded across species, 55.1% were mature and 44.9% were immature. Results from this study indicate that there is substantial overlap between the distributions of these species and fishing activities, and show that most, if not all, life stages are susceptible to mortality as a result of fishing. This study provides managers with a better understanding of the life‐history traits of these commercially important species to support future quantitative population assessments, and provides a baseline of trends in fishing‐related mortality.  aPublisher supplied data  a282cSave Our Seas Foundation 3aRhizoprionodon acutus 3aallometry 3acoasts 3ademographic statistics 3afemales 3afishing boats 3alife history 3amales 3amonsoon season 3amortality 3aneonates 3aseasonal variation 3asex ratio 3asharks 3aIndia1 aSutaria, Dipani1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6186-09231 aHarry, Alastair V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9905-79091 aJabado, Rima W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6239-67230 tAquatic conservation.g2018 Dec., v. 28, no. 6 p.1374-1383dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.29403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010500171300001400276520150200290592002801792650001801820650001401838650001001852650001501862650002401877650001801901650001201919650001501931650002301946650001201969650001301981650002101994653002402015653004102039653001502080653002002095653001502115700001902130773012302149856008602272852000902358655001202367IND60765533620221121075403.0220130e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076553362DNAL7 a10.1080/13416979.2021.19652792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKimura, Akihiro10aGeographic pattern in the community structure of arboreal insects in beech forests in northern Japan  ap. 63-70.  aForest ecosystems have high biodiversity with ecologically diverse animals and plants. The forest canopy supports high biodiversity, and canopy insects are important components owing to their high species richness and abundance. Although many studies have investigated the vertical stratification of arboreal insects, the formation process of geographic patterns in the arboreal insect community structure is not well understood. We analyzed arboreal insect communities in Japanese beech forests in northern Japan to examine their formation process of geographic pattern with geographic distance. We set eight study sites and collected insects monthly from June to September 2015 and 2016. We collected 2070 individuals from 479 species in 14 orders. We tested for nested structure in communities by distance and examined the correlation between the geographic distance and the dissimilarity of community structure. The insect community structure was nested by distance. When we classified insects by order into herbivore or carnivore, we found a positive correlation in herbivorous Hemiptera, while we were not able to find any correlations in other taxa. We collected a number of arboreal insect species that also occur in southern Japan at some sites. These results suggest that the arboreal insect communities in northern Japan change with geographic distance because they include taxa with a poor dispersal ability and some species from the southern beech forest along with the mountain area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus crenata 3aHemiptera 3aJapan 3acarnivores 3acommunity structure 3aforest canopy 3aforests 3aherbivores 3ainsect communities 3ainsects 3aresearch 3aspecies richness 0aCommunity expansion 0adissimilarity of community structure 0afood habit 0aglacial refugia 0anestedness1 aIkeda, Hiroshi0 tJournal of forest research.g2022 Jan. 02, v. 27, no. 1 p.63-70dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13416979.2021.19652793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03471naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100001900172245018500191300001600376520170700392592002802099650001502127650001702142650001902159650001702178650002002195650002802215650001102243650001902254650001102273650001502284650003002299650001602329650001002345650002002355650001602375650001902391650003602410650001202446650001102458650002002469650001102489650000902500650001602509650003702525700002802562700001602590700002602606700002202632700002102654700002502675773008302700856008902783852000902872655001202881IND4466565120221120055300.0141110e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446656512DNAL7 a225466352pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.03.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRylander, Lars10aVery high correlations between fresh weight and lipid-adjusted PCB-153 serum concentrations: Irrespective of fasting status, age, body mass index, gender, or exposure distributions  ap. 828-831.  aBACKGROUND AND AIM: Persistent organochlorine pollutants (POPs) have in epidemiological studies been associated with health hazards. The exposure window might be crucial and it is, accordingly, important to analyze exposure concentrations in samples collected at the window of interest. This makes the use of stored blood samples extremely interesting. However, small blood volumes from stored samples in biobanks means that the researchers in epidemiological studies most often have to select a limited number of biomarkers representing the POP exposure and abstain from analyses of lipid concentrations. This raises the question of the necessity of lipid adjustment. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between fresh weight and lipid adjusted concentrations. METHODS: We included data from studies were we have used the PCB congener 2,2′,4,4′,5,5′-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153) as a biomarker for POP exposure and where fresh weight as well as lipid adjusted PCB-153 concentrations are known (n=1628). The variety of the cohort members in the different studies gave us the possibility to better understand how well these measures correlate. RESULTS: When all individuals were included in the analyses a correlation coefficient of 0.95 between fresh weight and lipid adjusted serum concentrations was obtained. Restricting the analyses to specific subgroups (based on gender, fasting status, age and BMI) gave correlation coefficients between 0.85 and 0.97. CONCLUSIONS: This study does strongly support the use of samples from biobanks in epidemiological studies for analyzing PCBs, at least regarding PCB-153, even though it is not possible to lipid adjust the results.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood lipids 3ablood sampling 3ablood volume 3abody mass index 3aepidemiological studies 3agender 3ahealth hazards 3alipids 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aresearchers 2aAdult 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weight 2aCohort Studies 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxblood 2aFasting 2aFemale 2aGender Identity 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxblood1 aBjörkdahl, Carl-Magnus1 aAxmon, Anna1 aGiwercman, Aleksander1 aJönsson, Bo A.G.1 aLindh, Christian1 aRignell-Hydbom, Anna0 tChemosphere.g2012 Aug., v. 88, no. 7 p.828-831dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.03.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009700164300001400261520119600275592002801471650002001499650001501519650002201534650001801556650001301574650000901587650003101596650002001627650002201647650001301669653001001682653001901692653001301711653002001724653001401744653001101758700001501769700002101784700001601805700001501821700005801836700001601894700001501910700001601925773013701941856008302078852000902161655001202170IND60774006920221121062631.0220921e20220806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077400692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.03.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xiaoyan10aRapid and sustained restoration of astrocytic functions by ketamine in depression model mice  ap. 89-94.  aMolecules with fast-acting antidepressant effects have potentials to become new antidepressants. Here we report the fast-acting (1hr) antidepressant effects of ketamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) in chronic adreno-cortico-tropic-hormone (ACTH)-induced and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression mouse models. These behavioral anti-depressant effects are associated with normalized expression of glutamate transporter-1(GLT-1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 phosphorylation (p-eEF2) in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PrL-PFC). Excitatory neurons in PrL also showed reduced ambient glutamate responses to synaptic stimulation, and reduced ambient NMDA receptor responses after ketamine injection. Interestingly, ketamine induced biochemical and electrophysiological changes still occurred with GLT-1 knockdown in PrL, suggesting that elevated GLT-1 level is not required for ketamine to exert its antidepressant effect. At the same time, ketamine did not elevate GLT-1 level in the isolated astrocytes, suggesting distinct contributions from neurons and astrocytes to ketamine-induced changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantidepressants 3aastrocytes 3aelectrophysiology 3aglutamic acid 3aketamine 3amice 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphosphorylation 3aprefrontal cortex 3aresearch 0aGLT-1 0aRapid reversal 0aKetamine 0aAnti-depressant 0aAstrocyte 0aNeuron1 aYang, Shuo1 aZhang, Zhaoxiang1 aLiu, Luping1 aShi, Wenli1 aYang, Sungchil1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3408-20191 aLi, Shupeng1 aCai, Xiang1 aZhou, Qiang0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2022 Aug. 06, v. 616 p.89-94dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.03.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245009300178300001400271520170100285536012601986592002802112596002502140650001102165650001102176650001202187650001202199650002402211650001702235650001302252650001202265650001602277653001902293653002002312653002302332653002102355700001902376700002402395700002702419773012302446856008602569852000902655655001202664IND60765533820221119014914.0220130e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076553382DNAL7 a10.1080/13416979.2021.19657002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Mohamad Hilmi10aImpacts of invasive Acacias on ion deposition in a coastal Bornean tropical heath forest  ap. 20-27.  aThe uncontrolled invasive spread of exotic Acacias is a growing concern for many tropical ecosystems, particularly due to their negative impact upon nutrient cycling. Studies investigating the effects of Acacia invasion on nutrient cycling have focused on litterfall and litter decomposition, although its impact on ion deposition in tropical ecosystems is less understood. We quantified and compared the rates of ion deposition (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, NH₄ ⁺, NO₃ ⁻) between Acacia-invaded and non-invaded tropical heath (Kerangas) forest sites in Brunei Darussalam, Southeast Asia. Ion exchange resin (IER) sampler, IER ring and IER bags were used to determine ion depositions via throughfall, in soils and in stream water respectively. Throughfall in Acacia-invaded heath forest sites recorded significantly higher NH₄ ⁺ and Ca²⁺ depositions but lower Mg²⁺ than non-invaded, intact sites. For ion deposition in soil, all depths recorded significantly higher Ca²⁺ (except for 0 cm depth), Mg²⁺ and NH₄ ⁺ depositions, but significantly lower NO₃ ⁻ depositions, in Acacia-invaded sites. Ion deposition in stream water showed significant monthly variations, with Acacia-invaded sites recording significantly higher Mg²⁺ depositions in June, August and September 2015 but lower NH₄ ⁺ depositions in June, July and September, lower NO₃ ⁻ and Ca²⁺ depositions in June and September than non-invaded heath forest sites. Overall, these findings demonstrate that ion deposition via throughfall, in soil and in stream water were all affected by Acacia invasion, thus confirming the influence of alien invasive Acacias on nutrient cycling of tropical heath forests.  aThis work was funded by the Brunei Research Council (UBD/BRC/11) and Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD/PNC2/2/RG/1(204)).  aPublisher supplied data  aUBD/PNC2/2/RG/1(204) 3aAcacia 3aBrunei 3acalcium 3aforests 3aion exchange resins 3aplant litter 3aresearch 3astreams 3athroughfall 0aAcacia mangium 0ainvasive plants 0aion exchange resin 0anutrient cycling1 aMetali, Faizah1 aU Tennakoon, Kushan1 aSukri, Rahayu Sukmaria0 tJournal of forest research.g2022 Jan. 02, v. 27, no. 1 p.20-27dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13416979.2021.19657003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013800166520141100304592002801715650002701743650001601770650002701786650002101813650002501834650000701859650002101866650001801887650001501905650001501920650002501935653002401960653001801984653001902002700001802021700001902039700001802058700001502076773011402091856008202205852000902287655001202296IND60741906520221117073220.0210708e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074190652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2021.1080952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiuling10aSimultaneous degradation of high concentration of citric acid coupled with electricity generation in dual-chamber microbial fuel cell  aCitric acid (CA) production wastewater has been attracting wide attention because of its potential threat to environment and public health. Microbial fuel cell (MFC) can satisfy the urgent demands of high efficiency, last sustainability and environmental-friendly wastewater treatment. In this work, the performance of MFC towards CA degradation and the corresponding power generation were both investigated. Four different contents of CA (5 mM, 10 mM, 25 mM, 40 mM) were selected for preparation of stimulated wastewater, and the maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and power density reached to 79.4% and 610 mW/m², respectively at the CA content of 25 mM. Besides, the decrease of influent pH from 7 to 4 can reduce the electrochemical properties of microorganisms, while negligible effect on electricity generation was observed with pH higher than 6. Besides, the addition of riboflavin as redox mediators enhanced power generation and COD removal rate simultaneously, which increased from 611 mW/m², 79.4% to 855.2 mW/m², 84.5% respectively. Significantly, anodic microorganisms can survive well in the presence of 40 mM citric acid and remain its electricity generation and degradation capability simultaneously by sequencing analysis. Therefore, it is anticipated that the MFC system seems to be a promising technology for organic wastewater treatment effectively and accessibly.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical oxygen demand 3acitric acid 3aelectricity generation 3aelectrochemistry 3amicrobial fuel cells 3apH 3apower generation 3apublic health 3ariboflavin 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aPower density 0aMicroorganisms1 aLiu, Yuanfeng1 aZheng, Linshan1 aZhang, Qichun1 aLi, Congju0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2021 Sept., v. 173 p.108095-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2021.1080953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03852naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245016800181300001400349520162300363592002801986650002802014650002302042650002702065650001202092650001702104650001802121650002302139650002102162650002502183650001102208650001102219650001502230650001902245650002002264650001902284650001702303650001702320653002902337653001902366653002202385653001702407653001802424653000602442653000702448653000802455653000802463653000802471653001002479653001002489653000802499653000602507653000802513653000702521653000702528653000702535653001002542653001002552653001602562653000702578653000902585653000802594653000802602653000702610653000902617653000702626653000802633653000702641653000802648653000702656653000802663653000802671653000802679700002602687700002102713700002402734773012202758856008502880852000902965655001202974IND60543306520221118092701.0190410e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054330652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2014.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Marciel Teixeira10aDifferent mechanisms drive the performance of native and invasive woody species in response to leaf phosphorus supply during periods of drought stress and recovery  ap. 66-75.  aThe effects of drought stress and leaf phosphorus (Pi) supply on photosynthetic metabolism in woody tropical species are not known, and given the recent global environmental change models that forecast lower precipitation rates and periods of prolonged drought in tropical areas, this type of study is increasingly important. The effects of controlled drought stress and Pi supply on potted young plants of two woody species, Anadenanthera colubrina (native) and Prosopis juliflora (invasive), were determined by analyzing leaf photosynthetic metabolism, biochemical properties and water potential. In the maximum stress, both species showed higher leaf water potential (Ψl) in the treatment drought +Pi when compared with the respective control −Pi. The native species showed higher gas exchange under drought +Pi than under drought –Pi conditions, while the invasive species showed the same values between drought +Pi and −Pi. Drought affected the photochemical part of photosynthetic machinery more in the invasive species than in the native species. The invasive species showed higher leaf amino acid content and a lower leaf total protein content in both Pi treatments with drought. The two species showed different responses to the leaf Pi supply under water stress for several variables measured. In addition, the strong resilience of leaf gas exchange in the invasive species compared to the native species during the recovery period may be the result of higher efficiency of Pi use. The implications of this behavior for the success of this invasive species in semiarid environments are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnadenanthera colubrina 3aProsopis juliflora 3aamino acid composition 3adrought 3agas exchange 3aglobal change 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3amodels 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein content 3asemiarid zones 3awater stress 3awoody plants 0aChlorophyll fluorescence 0aClimate change 0aDrought tolerance 0aGas exchange 0aWater deficit 0aA 0aAA 0aAPX 0aATP 0aCAT 0aChl a 0aChl b 0aCar 0aE 0aETR 0aFo 0aFm 0aFt 0aFm′ 0aFv/Fm 0aFv′/Fm′ 0ags 0aH2O2 0aMDA 0aNPQ 0aPi 0aPPFD 0aqP 0aROS 0aSC 0aSOD 0aTP 0aVPD 0aWUE 0aΨl1 aMedeiros, Camila Dias1 aFrosi, Gabriella1 aSantos, Mauro Guida0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2014 Sept., v. 82 p.66-75dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2014.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010200171300001600273520111700289592002801406650001401434650002201448650002101470650002701491650002201518650001401540650001201554650001801566650001101584650001901595650002301614650002501637650001001662650001801672650002101690653003101711653001701742653002201759653002601781653002301807700002301830700005801853700002001911700002001931700002301951700005801974700002602032700006102058773009602119856008502215852000902300655001202309IND60666175320221120125237.0201025e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066617532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2019.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmieri, Silvia10aPilot scale cellulose recovery from sewage sludge and reuse in building and construction material  ap. 208-218.  aThe recovery of cellulose in toilet paper from municipal wastewater is one of the most innovative actions in the circular economy context. In fact, fibres could address possible new uses in the building sector as reinforcing components in binder-based materials. In this paper, rotating belt filters were tested to enhance the recovery of sludge rich in cellulose fibres for possible valorisation in construction applications. Recovered cellulosic material reached value up to 26.6 gm⁻³ with maximum solids removal of 74%. Content of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin was found averagely equal to 87% of the total composition. Predictive equation of cellulosic material was further obtained. The addition of recovered cellulose fibres in mortars bring benefits in terms of lightness, microstructure and moisture buffering value (0.17 g/m²%UR). Concerning mechanical properties, flexural strength was improved with the addition of 20% of recovered cellulose fibres. In addition, a simplified economic assessment was reported for two possible pre-mixed blends with 5% and 20% of recovered fibres content.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3acircular economy 3aconstruction materials 3aeconomic analysis 3aequations 3afilters 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3amicrostructure 3amodulus of rupture 3amunicipal wastewater 3apaper 3asewage sludge 3awaste management 0aSewage wastes valorisation 0aToilet paper 0aCellulosic sludge 0aConstruction industry 0aRecovered material1 aCipolletta, Giulia1 aPastore, Carlo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9907-66161 aGiosuè, Chiara1 aAkyol, Çağrı1 aEusebi, Anna Laura1 aFrison, Nicola1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0266-65701 aTittarelli, Francesca1 aFatone, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0745-282X0 tWaste management.g2019 Dec., v. 100 p.208-218dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2019.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03837naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001800185245011900203300001100322506007600333520239300409592002802802506003702830650001602867650002702883650001402910650001502924650001002939650001702949650001102966650001902977650003102996650001803027650001903045700001703064700002403081700001403105700002703119773015803146856007803304852000903382655001203391IND60548039220221207115135.0160903e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054803922DNAL7 a10.1186/1479-5868-4-552doi7 aPMC22006602pmcid7 a179960872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaerens, Leen10aExplaining the effects of a 1-year intervention promoting a low fat diet in adolescent girls: a mediation analysis  ap. 55.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Although it is important to investigate how interventions work, no formal mediation analyses have been conducted to explain behavioral outcomes in school-based fat intake interventions in adolescents. The aim of the present study was to examine mediation effects of changes in psychosocial determinants of dietary fat intake (attitude, social support, self-efficacy, perceived benefits and barriers) on changes in fat intake in adolescent girls. METHODS: Data from a 1-year prospective intervention study were used. A random sample of 804 adolescent girls was included in the study. Girls in the intervention group (n = 415) were exposed to a multi-component school-based intervention program, combining environmental changes with a computer tailored fat intake intervention and parental support. Fat intake and psychosocial determinants of fat intake were measured with validated self-administered questionnaires. To assess mediating effects, a product-of-coefficient test, appropriate for cluster randomized controlled trials, was used. RESULTS: None of the examined psychosocial factors showed a reliable mediating effect on changes in fat intake. The single-mediator model revealed a statistically significant suppression effect of perceived barriers on changes in fat intake (p = 0.011). In the multiple-mediator model, this effect was no longer significant, which was most likely due to changes in perceived barriers being moderately related to changes in self-efficacy (-0.30) and attitude (-0.25). The overall mediated-suppressed effect of the examined psychosocial factors was virtually zero (total mediated effect = 0.001; SE = 7.22; p = 0.992). CONCLUSION: Given the lack of intervention effects on attitudes, social support, self-efficacy and perceived benefits and barriers, it is suggested that future interventions should focus on the identification of effective strategies for changing these theoretical mediators in the desired direction. Alternatively, it could be argued that these constructs need not be targeted in interventions aimed at adolescents, as they may not be responsible for the intervention effects on fat intake. To draw any conclusions regarding mediators of fat-intake change in adolescent' girls and regarding optimal future intervention strategies, more systematic research on the mediating properties of psychosocial variables is needed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3aattitudes and opinions 3acomputers 3afat intake 3agirls 3alow fat diet 3amodels 3aquestionnaires 3arandomized clinical trials 3aself-efficacy 3asocial support1 aCerin, Ester1 aDeforche, Benedicte1 aMaes, Lea1 aDe Bourdeaudhuij, Ilse0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2007 Dec., v. 4, no. 1 p.55-55dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-4-553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245018700164300001600351500002000367520172500387592002802112650000802140650001102148650002602159650002002185650002902205650001502234650001702249650001802266650000902284650001902293650001402312700002202326700001502348700002602363773013802389856007302527852000902600655001202609IND60685528920221119082156.0200304e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068552892DNAL7 a10.1111/jse.124932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCozzolino, Salvatore10aDifferent filtering strategies of genotyping‐by‐sequencing data provide complementary resolutions of species boundaries and relationships in a clade of sexually deceptive orchids  ap. 133-144.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOngoing hybridization and retained ancestral polymorphism in rapidly radiating lineages could mask recent cladogenetic events. This presents a challenge for the application of molecular phylogenetic methods to resolve differences between closely related taxa. We reanalyzed published genotyping‐by‐sequencing (GBS) data to infer the phylogeny of four species within the Ophrys sphegodes complex, a recently radiated clade of orchids. We used different data filtering approaches to detect different signals contained in the dataset generated by GBS and estimated their effects on maximum likelihood trees, global FST and bootstrap support values. We obtained a maximum likelihood tree with high bootstrap support, separating the species by using a large dataset based on loci shared by at least 30% of accessions. Bootstrap and FST values progressively decreased when filtering for loci shared by a higher number of accessions. However, when filtering more stringently to retain homozygous and organellar loci, we identified two main clades. These clades group individuals independently from their a priori species assignment, but were associated with two organellar haplotype clusters. We infer that a less stringent filtering preferentially selects for rapidly evolving lineage‐specific loci, which might better delimit lineages. In contrast, when using homozygous/organellar DNA loci the signature of a putative hybridization event in the lineage prevails over the most recent phylogenetic signal. These results show that using differing filtering strategies on GBS data could dissect the organellar and nuclear DNA phylogenetic signal and yield novel insights into relationships between closely related species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aOphrys 3abiological speciation 3adata collection 3agenotyping by sequencing 3ahaplotypes 3ahomozygosity 3ahybridization 3aloci 3anuclear genome 3aphylogeny1 aScopece, Giovanni1 aRoma, Luca1 aSchlüter, Philipp M.0 tJournal of systematics and evolution.g2020 Mar., v. 58, no. 2 p.133-144dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000114x1674-49187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jse.124933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245006400181300001800245520061600263536011200879592002800991596005401019650001201073650001301085650002201098650001401120653002401134653001101158653004001169700002801209700001801237700002001255700001801275700002001293700002101313700002501334700002301359700002401382700001701406700001901423773012401442856008501566852000901651655001201660IND60732624120221120212212.0210331e20210403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073262412DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2019.16445112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyễn, Trọng Tuấn,12aA new hopane derivative from the lichen Dirinaria applanata  ap. 1167-1171.  aChemical investigation of the lichen Dirinaria applanata led to isolate nine compounds including a new hopane derivative, 1β-acetoxy-21α-hopane-3β,22-diol (1) together with six phenolic compounds naming divaricatinic acid (2), methyl divaricatinate (3), methyl-β-orcinolcarboxylate (4), methyl haematommate (5), divarinol (6), ramalinic acid A (7), and two xanthones namely lichenxanthone (8), 4,5-dichlorolichenxanthone (9).

The objective of this research was to assess the effectiveness of adding different compost types to reduce both direct (soil–human) and indirect (soil–plant–human) exposure of Pb, As, and PAHs to humans. A field experiment was conducted in 2011 and 2012 at an urban garden site with elevated concentrations of Pb (475 mg kg⁻¹), As (95 mg kg⁻¹), and PAHs (23–50 mg kg⁻¹). Soil amendments were composted biosolids, noncomposted biosolids, mushroom compost, leaf compost, and a nonamended control. Collard greens, tomatoes, and carrots were then grown in the amended and nonamended soils and nonamended soils that received urea in 2011. At the beginning of the second season, N–P–K fertilizer was added to all plots. The potential for direct and indirect exposure was evaluated. Soil Pb bioaccessibility was 1 to 4.3%, and As bioaccessibility was 7.3 to 12.3%. Composted biosolids reduced the bioaccessibility of soil Pb by ∼17% compared with the control but temporarily increased the bioaccessibility of As by ∼ 69% compared with the control when soluble inorganic P concentration in soil was elevated by P fertilizer application in 2012. The bioaccessibility of soil Pb decreased by ∼38% in all treatments when soluble inorganic P concentration in soil was elevated by P fertilizer. Compost amendments reduced the concentrations of low molecular weight PAHs in soil. Regardless of the treatments, the concentrations of Pb, As, and PAHs measured in the vegetables were low or nondetectable, except for Pb in carrots. Consumption of vegetables grown at this site will cause insignificant transfer of Pb, As, and PAHs to humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNPK fertilizers 3aarsenic 3abioavailability 3abiosolids 3acarrots 3acollard greens 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3afood crops 3agardens 3ageophagia 3aindirect contact 3ainorganic phosphorus 3alead 3amolecular weight 3amushroom compost 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apotassium 3asoil amendments 3atomatoes 3aurban soils 3aurea 3ayard waste composts1 aHettiarachchi, Ganga M.1 aMartin, Sabine1 aPierzynski, Gary M.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2015 May, v. 44, no. 3 p.930-944dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2014.09.04003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009100164300001600255520119100271592002801462650002101490650004801511650001501559650002201574650001301596650001801609650001401627650001001641650001201651650001301663653001501676653001801691653002701709653001701736700001701753700001501770700001701785700001501802700001501817700005701832773013901889856008302028852000902111655001202120IND60774007220221120193714.0220517e20220625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077400722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.03.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Zhiyang10aColchicine prevents ventricular arrhythmias vulnerability in diet-induced obesity rats  ap. 127-132.  aThis study aimed to assess the role of colchicine in ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) induced by high fat diet (HFD)-fed rats. Male rats were divided into four groups: CTL, normal diet plus saline; CTC, normal diet plus colchicine; HFD, HFD plus saline; HFC: HFD plus colchicine. Metabolic parameters, ECG parameters, ventricular electrophysiological parameters, ventricular histology, Western blot and RT-qPCR were measured. Compared with the HFD group, colchicine treatment significantly improved metabolic parameters, reduced ventricular fibrosis, increased the expression of Cav1.2, Kv4.2, Nav1.5, and Cx43, reduced CaMKII, p-CaMKII, p-RyR2 (S2808), and p-RyR2 (S2814) expression in LV. Furthermore, colchicine inhibited the inflammatory responses, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period (ERP), reduced corrected QT interval (QTc) and Tpeak–Tend interval, so as to reduce the susceptibility to VAs in obesity rats. Colchicine could mitigate ventricular fibrosis, ventricular electrical remodeling, as well as the expression of ion channels, and inhibit obesity-induced inflammatory responses, which provides a new idea for colchicine to prevent VAs in obese individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3acalcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 3acolchicine 3aelectrophysiology 3afibrosis 3ahigh fat diet 3ahistology 3amales 3aobesity 3aresearch 0aColchicine 0aHigh fat diet 0aVentricular arrhythmia 0aInflammation1 aChen, Xiaodi1 aChen, Ping1 aLi, Qianyuan1 aGuo, Zhuli1 aLü, Qing,1 aDing, Shifang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8874-54180 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2022 June 25, v. 610 p.127-132dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.03.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245007700188300001600265520131200281592002801593650002301621650002101644650002401665650002301689650002601712650001201738650002001750650001101770650001201781650003301793650002801826650003101854650001201885651002001897700001801917773009401935852000902029856008102038930003302119946001102152655001202163IND60437485120221119193531.0151022e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043748512DNAL7 a172522412pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-007-0215-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristian, Nereda10aTo use or not to use torpor? Activity and body temperature as predictors  ap. 483-487.  aWhen food is limited and/or environmental conditions are unfavourable, many mammals reduce activity and use torpor to save energy. Nevertheless, reliable predictors for torpor occurrence, especially in the wild, are currently not available. Interrelations between torpor use and other energy conserving strategies are also poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that reductions in normothermic body temperature (T b) and the period of activity before torpor events could be used as predictors for torpor occurrence in sugar gliders, Petaurus breviceps (body mass, ~125 g), known to display daily torpor in the wild. Occurrence of torpor was preceded by significant (~10-25%) reductions of the duration of the activity phase. Moreover, the normothermic resting T b fell by an average of 1.2°C over 3 days before a torpor event, relative to individuals that did not display torpor. Our new findings suggest that before entering torpor, sugar gliders, which appear to use torpor as an emergency measure rather than a routine energy saving strategy, systematically reduce activity times and normothermic resting T bs to lower energy expenditure and perhaps to avoid employing torpor. Thus, reduced activity and normothermic T b may provide a predictive tool for the occurrence of daily torpor in the wild.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPetaurus breviceps 3abody temperature 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy expenditure 3aenvironmental factors 3amammals 3aresting periods 3asugars 2aAnimals 2aBody Temperaturexphysiology 2aMarsupialiaxphysiology 2aMotor Activityxphysiology 2aSeasons 0aNew South Wales1 aGeiser, Fritz0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2007 June, v. 94, no. 6 p.483-487dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-007-0215-53Available from publisher's site  a20070529b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02875naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008000169520144600249592002801695650002501723650001601748650001501764650001501779650001501794650002001809650002601829650001701855650001701872650002401889650002201913650001501935650001401950650001301964650002601977650001802003650001002021653002202031653002302053653003002076653002002106653000902126653002402135700001802159773011202177856008302289852000902372655001202381IND60666175620221120120642.0200103e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066617562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2019.1116242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, Isabel P.10aMicrofluidic smartphone quantitation of Escherichia coli in synthetic urine  aIn spite of the clinical need, there is a major gap in rapid diagnostics for identification and quantitation of E. coli and other pathogens, also regarded as the biggest bottleneck in the fight against the spread of antimicrobial resistant bacterial strains. This study reports for the first time an optical, smartphone-based microfluidic fluorescence sandwich immunoassay capable of quantifying E. coli in buffer and synthetic urine in less than 25 min without sample preparation nor concentration. A limit of detection (LoD) up to 240 CFU/mL, comensurate with cut-off for UTIs (10³–10⁵ CFUs/mL) was achieved. Replicas of full response curves performed with 10⁰–10⁷ CFUs/mL of E. coli K12 in synthetic urine yielded recovery values in the range 80–120%, assay reproducibility below 30% and precision below 20%, therefore similar to high-performance automated immunoassays. The unrivalled LoD was mainly linked to the ‘open fluidics’ nature of the 10-bore microfluidic strips used that enabled passing a large volume of sample through the microcapillaries coated with capture antibody. The new smartphone based test has the potential of being as a rapid, point-of-care test for rule-in of E. coli infections that are responsible for around 80% of UTIs, helping to stop the over-prescription of antibiotics and the monitoring of patients with other symptomatic communicable diseases caused by E. coli at global scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli K12 3aantibiotics 3aantibodies 3aautomation 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3afluorescence 3aimmunoassays 3ainfectious diseases 3amobile telephones 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3apatients 3apoint-of-care systems 3arapid methods 3aurine 0aE. coli detection 0aSmartphone readout 0aPoint-of-care diagnostics 0aSynthetic urine 0aUTIs 0aMicrocapillary Film1 aReis, Nuno M.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 145 p.111624-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2019.1116243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245010400207300001800311506007600329520153000405592002801935506003701963650002102000650002702021650003902048650002002087650001202107650002902119650001602148650001302164650001902177650001202196650001302208650002102221650001002242650001202252650001502264650001402279650001302293650002902306700001402335700002202349700002002371773012902391856007702520852000902597655001202606IND60132446120221207100250.0150505e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013244612DNAL7 a10.1128/mBio.00075-152doi7 aPMC44535742pmcid7 a257594992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltındiş, Emrah,10aSecretome Analysis of Vibrio cholerae Type VI Secretion System Reveals a New Effector-Immunity Pair  ap. e00075-15.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a dynamic macromolecular organelle that many Gram-negative bacteria use to inhibit or kill other prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. The toxic effectors of T6SS are delivered to the prey cells in a contact-dependent manner. In Vibrio cholerae , the etiologic agent of cholera, T6SS is active during intestinal infection. Here, we describe the use of comparative proteomics coupled with bioinformatics to identify a new T6SS effector-immunity pair. This analysis was able to identify all previously identified secreted substrates of T6SS except PAAR (proline, alanine, alanine, arginine) motif-containing proteins. Additionally, this approach led to the identification of a new secreted protein encoded by VCA0285 (TseH) that carries a predicted hydrolase domain. We confirmed that TseH is toxic when expressed in the periplasm of Escherichia coli and V. cholerae cells. The toxicity observed in V. cholerae was suppressed by coexpression of the protein encoded by VCA0286 (TsiH), indicating that this protein is the cognate immunity protein of TseH. Furthermore, exogenous addition of purified recombinant TseH to permeabilized E. coli cells caused cell lysis. Bioinformatics analysis of the TseH protein sequence suggest that it is a member of a new family of cell wall-degrading enzymes that include proteins belonging to the YD repeat and Rhs superfamilies and that orthologs of TseH are likely expressed by species belonging to phyla as diverse as Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aN-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase 3aVibrio cholerae 3aalanine 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aarginine 3abioinformatics 3acholera 3adiarrhea 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3aproline 3aproteomics 3asecretion 3atoxicity 3atype VI secretion system1 aDong, Tao1 aCatalano, Christy1 aMekalanos, John0 tmBio.g2015 May 1, v. 6, no. 2 p.e00075-15-e00075-15dAmerican Society for MicrobiologywJournal:J000001381x2150-75117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00075-153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009300160300001600253500002000269520132100289592002801610596005901638596005901697596006801756596005901824650001401883650001401897650002201911650001201933650001101945650002301956650000901979650001001988650001101998650002402009650002202033650001402055650001002069650001202079651001002091700001902101700002102120700002502141773013802166856007302304852000902377655001202386IND60685529220221119082230.0200304e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068552922DNAL7 a10.1111/jse.124852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Ying‐Ze10aEffective pollinia transfer by settling moths’ legs in an orchid Habenaria aitchisonii  ap. 174-181.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA great diversity of flower morphology in orchids has long been thought to be selected by diverse pollinators. Habenaria Willd. (Orchidaceae) species are generally characterized by long nectar spurs and pollinated by long‐tongued insects (Lepidoptera), the mechanical fit between the spur and pollinator proboscis length being supposedly caused by “arms race” reciprocal selection. Here, we report that flowers of Habenaria aitchisonii Rchb. f. with nectar spurs (approximately 9 mm) were pollinated by three species of settling noctuid moths whose proboscises varied in length from 10 to 16 mm. When a settling moth crawled on the spikes and probed the flowers for nectar, pollinia were placed on the moths’ legs rather than on other body parts. Our 5‐year survey of pollinia movement and 3‐year supplemental pollination experiments indicated that fruit and seed production in this orchid were not often pollen‐limited at flower level. In a natural population in Shangri‐La, Southwest China, the proportions of pollinia removal and deposition on stigmas by moth legs were 93.8% and 83.5%, respectively. This finding of efficient pollen transfer by the pollinators’ legs in H. aitchisonii adds a new example of diverse pollinia placement on pollinators (here settling moths) in the Orchidaceae.  aPublisher supplied data  aU1402267cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31730012cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016QNRC001cYoung Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST  a31700200cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aHabenaria 3aNoctuidae 3aflower morphology 3aflowers 3afruits 3ainsect pollination 3alegs 3amoths 3anectar 3apollinating insects 3apollinia (pollen) 3aproboscis 3aseeds 3asurveys 3aChina1 aJia, Li‐Bing1 aLiu, Chang‐Qiu1 aHuang, Shuang‐Quan0 tJournal of systematics and evolution.g2020 Mar., v. 58, no. 2 p.174-181dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000114x1674-49187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jse.124853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245009400189300001600283520144700299592002801746650003001774650001401804650002101818650000901839650001001848650001101858650001001869650003301879650001601912650001701928650001101945650001201956650002801968650001101996650003102007650002102038650002002059650002902079650001602108650003702124700002602161700001902187773009402206852000902300856008102309930003302390946001102423655001202434IND60437485820221119193410.0151022e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043748582DNAL7 a172522402pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-007-0216-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherry, Michael I.10aHost intra-clutch variation, cuckoo egg matching and egg rejection by great reed warblers  ap. 441-447.  aPrevailing theory predicts that lower levels of intra-clutch variation in host eggs facilitate the detection of brood parasitism. We assessed egg matching using both human vision and UV-VIS spectrophotometry and then followed the nest fate of great reed warblers naturally parasitised by European cuckoos. Rejection was predicted by the following three variables: matching between cuckoo and host eggs on the main chromatic variable defined by principal components analysis of the egg spectra (which has a strong loading in the UV); the number of host eggs in the nest; and human estimates of intra-clutch variation. The first variable is not correlated to human estimates of matching, which do not predict rejection. In line with another recent study, rejection rates were predicted by higher levels of intra-clutch variation in the host eggs, suggesting that higher rather than lower levels of intra-clutch variation can facilitate the discrimination of cuckoo eggs by hosts. We suggest that the importance of intra-clutch variation is context dependent, with intra-clutch variation being important when there is good matching between the host and the cuckoo eggs. Our results also suggest that both spectrometric and human visual assessments of egg matching and intra-clutch variation are prudent: the former provide the best method of estimating reflectance variation, whereas the latter include some assessment of patterns of maculation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrocephalus arundinaceus 3aCuculidae 3abrood parasitism 3aeggs 3ahosts 3ahumans 3anests 3aprincipal component analysis 3areflectance 3aspectroscopy 3avision 2aAnimals 2aClutch Sizexphysiology 2aFemale 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aNesting Behavior 2aNicotinic Acids 2aOrganometallic Compounds 2aOviposition 2aSongbirdsxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aBennett, Andrew T.

Wetlands are, however, currently grossly underrepresented in global environmental models. In this paper, we explore the required functionality of a generic model of the effects of climate and land-use changes on wetlands ecosystem services worldwide. We briefly review existing models to identify elements which can be combined to compile a generic wetland model.The proposed global wetland model should be integrated into and receive data from existing hydrology and climate models. Wetland delineation can be based on local hydrological and topographical conditions and verified with global wetland databases. We conclude that an integrated approach combining hydrology, biogeochemistry and vegetation for wetlands is not available yet, however, useful building blocks exist that can be combined.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiogeochemistry 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adatabases 3aecosystem services 3ahydrology 3aland use change 3avegetation 3awetlands1 aDam, Anne A. van,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5073-72411 aHes, Edwin M.A.1 ade Klein, Jeroen J.M.1 aFinlayson, C.

Soil treatment was conducted at pH 3 with 240 and 400 mg L–¹ iron additions and 120 000 mg L–¹ H₂O₂. Pentachlorophenol and trifluralin degradation rates decreased as a function of soil organic C content. However, soil organic C had no effect on the degradation rates of dieldrin and hexadecane. In addition, the four contaminants degraded at equal rates with soil containing organic C > 10 000 mg kg–¹. The ratio of first-order rate constants for contaminant degradation to hydrogen peroxide consumption (kcₒₙₜₐₘᵢₙₐₙₜ/kₕ₂O₂) was used as an empirical measure of treatment efficiency. These ratios were sensitive to both the soil organic C content and to the concentration of iron added during treatment. The efficiency ratios were highest for treatment with no iron addition; these data suggest that iron minerals and H₂O₂ provide a system in which Fenton-like oxidations are catalyzed. The ability of iron minerals and H₂O₂ to oxidize pentachlorophenol was evaluated in goethite-, hematite-, and magnetite-silica sand at pH 3. Pentachlorophenol was degraded in the mineral-silica sand systems, which was verified by the loss of organic C and the stoichiometric recovery of chloride.

Plants have developed diverse strategies to mitigate stress, for example, drought escape is a phenological strategy to avoid drought stress, while polyploidy was proposed as a genomic adaptation to stress. Polyploidy as an adaptation to aridity (an environmental parameter integrating temperature and precipitation) was previously documented in annual Brachypodium spp. (Poaceae) in the Western Mediterranean. Here, we examined whether polyploidy or phenology are associated with aridity in annual Brachypodium spp. along the aridity gradient in the Eastern Mediterranean. Using flow cytometry, we determined ploidy levels of plants from natural populations along the Israeli gradient, spanning ∼424 km from mesic Mediterranean to extreme desert climates. In a common garden we recorded time of seedling emergence, flowering and senescence. We tested whether the proportion of allotetraploids in the populations and phenological traits were associated with aridity. Contrary to a previous study in the Western Mediterranean, we found no effect of aridity on the proportion of allotetraploids and diploids within populations. Interestingly, phenology was associated with aridity: time of emergence was later, while flowering and senescence were earlier in desert plants. Our results indicate that in the Eastern Mediterranean, adaptation of Brachypodium to aridity is mediated mainly by phenology, rather than ploidy level. Therefore, we suggest that genome duplication is not the main driver of adaptation to environmental stress; rather, phenological change as a drought escape mechanism may be the major adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data  aLQ1601cCEITEC 2020 3aBrachypodium 3aallotetraploidy 3aarid zones 3adiploidy 3adrought 3adry environmental conditions 3aflow cytometry 3aflowering 3agenome 3agenomics 3anatural selection 3aphenology 3aseedling emergence 3atemperature 3awater stress 3axerophytes 3aIsrael1 aDror, Barak1 aAviezer, Iris1 aBar‐Lev, Yamit1 aSalman‐Minkov, Ayelet1 aMandakova, Terezie1 aŠmarda, Petr1 aMayrose, Itay1 aSapir, Yuval0 tJournal of systematics and evolution.g2020 Mar., v. 58, no. 2 p.189-199dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000114x1674-49187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jse.124893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002200185245008000207300001100287506007600298520194200374592002802316506003702344650001402381650001402395650002602409650001202435650001002447650001102457650001202468650001502480650002402495650001902519650002402538650001302562650001302575650001202588700001802600773015802618856007802776852000902854655001202863IND60548039620221207115118.0160903e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054803962DNAL7 a10.1186/1479-5868-6-122doi7 aPMC26674702pmcid7 a192679112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemieux, Mélanie10aHow well do cognitive and environmental variables predict active commuting?  ap. 12.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been growing interest in theoretical studies integrating cognitions and environmental variables in the prediction of behaviour related to the obesity epidemic. This is the approach adopted in the present study in reference to the theory of planned behaviour. More precisely, the aim of this study was to determine the contribution of cognitive and environmental variables in the prediction of active commuting to get to and from work or school. METHODS: A prospective study was carried out with 130 undergraduate and graduate students (93 females; 37 males). Environmental, cognitive and socio-demographic variables were evaluated at baseline by questionnaire. Two weeks later, active commuting (walking/bicycling) to get to and from work or school was self-reported by questionnaire. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to predict intention and behaviour. RESULTS: The model predicting behaviour based on cognitive variables explained more variance than the model based on environmental variables (37.4% versus 26.8%; Z = 3.86, p < 0.001). Combining cognitive and environmental variables with socio-demographic variables to predict behaviour yielded a final model explaining 41.1% (p < 0.001) of the variance. The significant determinants were intention, habit and age. Concerning intention, the same procedure yielded a final model explaining 78.2% (p < 0.001) of the variance, with perceived behavioural control, attitude and habit being the significant determinants. CONCLUSION: The results showed that cognitive variables play a more important role than environmental variables in predicting and explaining active commuting. When environmental variables were significant, they were mediated by cognitive variables. Therefore, individual cognitions should remain one of the main focuses of interventions promoting active commuting among undergraduate and graduate students.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abicycling 3acognition 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3amales 3amodels 3aobesity 3aprediction 3aprospective studies 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3astudents 3avariance 3awalking1 aGodin, Gaston0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2009 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.12-12dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-6-123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04034naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100001800155245019000173300001800363500001500381520152000396592002801916650001301944650000901957650001701966650000901983650002401992650001402016650001702030650001202047650001302059650002402072650001802096650001302114650001702127650002102144650001002165650004702175650001202222650006102234650004902295650003502344650002602379650005102405650006302456650003702519650004402556650005402600650003902654650000902693650005102702650002502753650003002778650003502808650002102843650003302864650002402897650001702921650005102938650000902989650001702998650004503015653002203060700001803082700002203100773010603122856003903228852000903267655001203276IND4469077620221120225649.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446907762DNAL7 a213948052pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.34402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, Vinod10aEmblica officinalis Corrects Functional, Biochemical and Molecular Deficits in Experimental Diabetic Neuropathy by Targeting the Oxido‐nitrosative Stress Mediated Inflammatory Cascade  ap. 1527-1536.  a2019-12-05  aDiabetic neuropathy is one of the most common microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus which affects more than 50% of diabetic patients. Diabetic neuropathic pain is amongst the most difficult types of pain to treat mainly due to the lack of understanding of its etiology and inadequate relief with available drug therapy. The present study targeted oxidative stress mediated nerve damage in diabetic rats using an aqueous extract of Emblica officinalis, a potent natural antioxidant. Diabetic rats exhibited significantly decreased tail‐flick latency in the tail‐immersion test (thermal hyperalgesia) and decreased paw withdrawal threshold in both Randall‐Selitto (mechanical hyperalgesia) and von‐Frey hair test (mechanical allodynia). A decrease in the nociceptive threshold was accompanied by significantly increased oxidative stress, nitrite levels and cytokines (TNF‐α, IL‐1β and TGF‐β1) both in the serum and sciatic nerve of diabetic rats. Treatment with the Emblica officinalis aqueous extract (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day) significantly attenuated all the behavioral, biochemical and molecular alterations in a dose‐dependent manner. The major finding of the study is that insulin alone corrected the hyperglycemia and partially reversed the pain response in diabetic rats. However, combination with Emblica officinalis extract not only attenuated the diabetic condition but also reversed neuropathic pain through modulation of oxidative–nitrosative stress in diabetic rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aetiology 3arats 3adrug therapy 3apain 3aPhyllanthus emblica 3acytokines 3anerve tissue 3ainsulin 3apatients 3adiabetic neuropathy 3ahyperglycemia 3anitrites 3aantioxidants 3aoxidative stress 3ahairs 2aAnalgesicsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aCytokinesxmetabolism 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxcomplications 2aDiabetic Neuropathiesxdrug therapyxetiologyxmetabolism. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHyperalgesiaxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aInflammationxdrug therapyxetiologyxmetabolism. 2aInflammation Mediatorsxmetabolism 2aMale 2aNeuralgiaxdrug therapyxetiologyxmetabolism. 2aNitritesxmetabolism 2aNitrosationxdrug effects 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPain Measurement 2aPain Thresholdxdrug effects 2aPhyllanthus emblica 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSciatic Nervexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 0adiabetes mellitus1 aKuhad, Anurag1 aChopra, Kanwaljit0 tPhytotherapy research.g2011 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.1527-1536dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.3440  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015100160300001800311520161700329592002801946650002901974650002502003650001502028650001502043650001702058650001502075650001902090650002802109650001602137650002202153700002202175773014102197856007402338852000902412655001202421IND60668820820221119202220.0190920e20121220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066882082DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ta00368f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHibino, Takashi13aAn intermediate-temperature alkaline fuel cell using an Sn₀.₉₂Sb₀.₀₈P₂O₇-based hydroxide-ion-conducting electrolyte and electrodes  ap. 1134-1140.  aAlthough various types of anion exchange membrane fuel cells have been developed, few alkaline fuel cells capable of operating at temperatures above 100 °C have been reported, due to low chemical and thermal stability of the polymer electrolytes. Sn₀.₉₂Sb₀.₀₈P₂O₇ is a hydroxide ion conductor that exhibits high conductivities ranging from 10⁻² to 10⁻¹ S cm⁻¹ at elevated temperatures. This report describes the development of an intermediate-temperature alkaline fuel cell using an Sn₀.₉₂Sb₀.₀₈P₂O₇-based electrolyte and electrodes. First, a dense and flexible composite membrane, composed of Sn₀.₉₂Sb₀.₀₈P₂O₇ and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), was synthesized and characterized. In the composite membrane, a homogeneous distribution of Sn₀.₉₂Sb₀.₀₈P₂O₇ particles was obtained at a thickness of 110 μm, yielding hydroxide ion conductivity of ∼10⁻² S cm⁻¹ in the temperature range between 75 and 200 °C. Next, the microstructure of the three-phase boundary in the electrode was established by incorporating Sn₀.₉₂Sb₀.₀₈P₂O₇ particles into the electrode. Consequently, polarization resistance was reduced dramatically compared to that of the unmodified electrode. Finally, fuel cell tests were conducted using the optimized electrolyte and electrode. The peak power density was 76 mW cm⁻² at 75 °C, 94 mW cm⁻² at 100 °C, 114 mW cm⁻² at 125 °C, 130 mW cm⁻² at 150 °C, 132 mW cm⁻² at 175 °C, and 147 mW cm⁻² at 200 °C. High durability of the present fuel cell was also confirmed at 200 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion-exchange membranes 3aasymmetric membranes 3adurability 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3amicrostructure 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aKobayashi, Kazuyo0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2012 Dec. 20, v. 1, no. 4 p.1134-1140dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ta00368f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245016000204300001600364500001900380500002000399520139100419592002801810596003701838596002701875596006401902650001201966650001801978650002401996650002302020650001302043650001702056650001102073700001702084700006202101700002002163700006202183773013102245856007902376852000902455655001202464IND60685529520221119082329.0200304e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068552952DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.128242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkshevsky, Mira1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6087-412X10aBiofilm formation by marine bacteria is impacted by concentration and surface functionalization of polystyrene nanoparticles in a species‐specific manner  ap. 203-213.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe world's oceans are becoming increasingly polluted by plastic waste. In the marine environment, larger plastic pieces may degrade into nanoscale (<100 nm in at least one dimension) plastic particles due to natural weathering effects. We observe that the presence of 20 nm plastic nanoparticles at concentrations below 200 ppm had no impact on planktonic growth of a panel of heterotrophic marine bacteria. However, the presence of plastic nanoparticles significantly impacted the formation of biofilms in a species‐specific manner. While carboxylated nanoparticles increased the amount of biofilm formed by several species, amidine‐functionalized nanoparticles decreased the amount of biofilm of many but not all bacteria. Further experiments suggested that the aggregation dynamics of bacteria and nanoparticles were strongly impacted by the surface properties of the nanoparticles. The community structure of an artificially constructed community of marine bacteria was significantly altered by exposure to plastic nanoparticles, with differently functionalized nanoparticles selecting for unique and reproducible community abundance patterns. These results suggest that surface properties and concentration of plastic nanoparticles, as well as species interactions, are important factors determining how plastic nanoparticles impact biofilm formation by marine bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data  cCanada Foundation for Innovation  cCanada Research Chairs  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3abiofilm 3acarboxylation 3acommunity structure 3amarine environment 3aplankton 3apolystyrenes 3awastes1 aGautier, Eva1 aFarner, Jeffrey M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0133-78711 aSchreiber, Lars1 aTufenkji, Nathalie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1546-34410 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2020 Apr., v. 12, no. 2 p.203-213dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.128243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245008700177300001600264520231800280592002802598650001202626650002302638650001302661650001202674650001302686650002202699650001902721650002402740650001502764650002402779650001002803651001102813653001402824653002502838653003302863653001102896653001202907700003102919700005702950700001803007773011603025856008503141852000903226655001203235IND60618426220221118055436.0210118e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061842622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThortveit, Erik Thomas10aSomatic symptoms and fatigue in a Norwegian population with high exposure to ticks  ap. 156-161.  aIt is heavily debated whether tick-borne infections cause chronic subjective health complaints. If the hypothesis of a major causal connection is true, one would expect to find more subjective health complaints in a population with high exposure to ticks than in a population with less exposure. In the current study we aimed to assess somatic symptoms and fatigue in a Norwegian population with high exposure to ticks, compare our findings to normative data, and assess predictors of somatic symptom load.All individuals aged 18–69 years with residential address in Søgne municipality in southern Norway were in the period June 2015 to June 2016 invited to participate in the study. Somatic symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) and fatigue by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). A multivariable regression analysis was performed to assess predictors of somatic symptom load.Out of 7424 invited individuals, 2971 (40.0%) returned the questionnaire. 85.1% of 2950 responders reported exposure to tick-bite. PHQ-15 mean sum score was 5.3, and 16.5% reported moderate to severe somatic symptom load (i.e. ≥ 10). FSS mean score was 3.2, and 29.8% scored above the cut-off value for fatigue (i.e. ≥ 4.0). All gender and age groups in our study population had equal or lower mean sum score on PHQ-15 than reported in Swedish normative data, and lower mean score on FSS than reported in Norwegian normative data. In multivariable regression the following factors were associated with higher somatic symptom load (listed in order of descending beta coefficient): Anxiety and depression, number of other diseases, female gender, younger age, recruitment when visiting general practitioner’s office, ≤ 6 years education after primary school, tick-bite earlier in life, erythema migrans earlier in life, less physical activity, and modern health worries.The study population reported high exposure to tick-bites, but less or equal level of somatic symptoms and less fatigue than found in normative data. There was a weak association between somatic symptom load and exposure to tick-bite and erythema migrans, possibly related to selection bias. Our findings do not support the hypothesis of a major causal connection between tick-borne infections and subjective health complaints.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3aelementary schools 3aerythema 3afemales 3apatients 3aphysical activity 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3atick bites 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3aNorway 0aTick-bite 0aTick-borne infection 0aSubjective health complaints 0aPHQ-15 0aFatigue1 aLorentzen, Åslaug Rudjord1 aLjøstad, Unn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7666-13961 aMygland, Åse0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2019 Jan., v. 10, no. 1 p.156-161dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010300155300001600258520099100274592002801265650003701293650002801330650001901358650001501377650001301392650001901405650002201424650000901446650000901455650001601464650001001480650001501490650001901505650003701524700001301561700001301574700001201587700001701599700001801616700001601634773013901650856007401789852000901863655001201872IND60668820920221119202340.0190920e20121213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066882092DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ta00371f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Ying10aGraphene oxide–iron complex: synthesis, characterization and visible-light-driven photocatalysis  ap. 644-650.  aGraphene as an important two-dimensional one-atom-thick nanosheet can be regarded as a solid and also a molecule.

The highest activity of the hydrolysates was reached when DH ranged from 15% to 18%. The peptide fractions which exhibited the highest activity were further purified using ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and RP-HPLC. The peptides were identified using nano-LC-ESI mass spectrometry. Finally, three immunomodulating peptides were obtained, and the amino acid sequences were Asn-Gly-Met-Thr-Tyr, Asn-Gly-Leu-Ala-Pro, and Trp-Thr, respectively. The lymphocyte proliferation rates were 35.92%, 32.96%, and 31.35% in the presence of 20μg/ml purified peptides, respectively. Therefore, the results demonstrated that the APF proteins hydrolysates prepared by trypsin could serve as a source of peptides with immunomodulating activity. It provided a scientific basis for the preparation of immunomodulating peptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aion exchange chromatography 3atrypsin 3ahydrolysates 3aimmunomodulators 3apeptides 3aamino acid sequences 3agels 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afiltration 3amass spectrometry 3alymphocyte proliferation 3aGadus chalcogrammus 3afish protein hydrolysate 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aChromatography 2aGadiformes 2aImmunologic Factorsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aLymphocytesxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptide Mapping 2aPeptidesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aProtein Hydrolysatesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aTrypsinxchemistry 0aAlaska 0aTheragra chalcogramma1 aFan, Yan1 aLi, Bafang1 aXue, Changhu1 aYu, Guangli1 aZhang, Zhaohui1 aZhao, Xue0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 134, no. 2 p.821-828dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.02.1863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007000170300001600240500001900256520105300275536009401328592002801422596005401450650002101504650003201525650001501557650001501572653001701587653002201604653003801626700002001664700002001684773013901704856008501843852000901928655001201937IND60732624820221117163957.0210331e20210304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073262482DNAL7 a10.1080/15428052.2020.17382992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogel, Douglas10aAnalysis of Competencies Models in Culinary Arts Higher Education  ap. 171-186.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCompetency models act as a competency management platform and consist of mapping knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Purpose: To analyze, qualitatively, the competencies assessment instruments in Culinary Arts higher education present in literature. Methods: The study consists of a systematic literature review from the EBSCO platform, identifying the competency models used in the culinary arts. The models were analyzed concerning their foundation, application, population, data treatment, and the main results obtained. Results: Two seminal models were identified for the study of competences: Tas and Sandwith’s competency dimension models. These models have been applied in five studies in four countries. Gersh identified methodological progress regarding the two models, realizing that both were complimentary to each other, so he presented a fusion between the two seminal models. The main findings in the studies are that the techniques, leadership, and interpersonal relationship are the most relevant competencies in the culinary arts.  aThis work was supported by the CAPES [Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de N].  aPublisher supplied data  aCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de N 3aculinary science 3ainterpersonal relationships 3aleadership 3atechnology 0aCompetencies 0acompetency models 0ahigher education in culinary arts1 aSohn, Ana Paula1 aGomes, Karolina0 tJournal of culinary science & technology.g2021 Mar. 04, v. 19, no. 2 p.171-186dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000102x1542-80447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15428052.2020.17382993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245005700159300001600216500001900232500001100251520102900262592002801291596006101319596004401380596004401424596005901468596005401527650001201581650001101593650001601604650001301620650001701633650001001650700002001660700001801680700001801698700005701716773013101773856007901904852000901983655001201992IND60685529820221119082213.0200304e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068552982DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.128162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Tao14aThe role of rhizodeposits in shaping rhizomicrobiome  ap. 160-172.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aRhizomicrobiome, the communities of microorganisms surrounding the root of the plant, plays a vital role in promoting plant growth and health. The composition of rhizomicrobiome is dynamic both temporally and spatially, and is influenced greatly by the plant host and environmental factors. One of the key influencing factors is rhizodeposits, composed of root‐released tissue cells, exudates, lysates, volatile compounds, etc. Rhizodeposits are rich in carbon and nitrogen elements, and able to select and fuel the growth of rhizomicrobiome. In this minireview, we overview the generation, composition and dynamics of rhizodeposits, and discuss recent work describing the general and specific impacts of rhizodeposits on rhizomicrobiome. We focus further on root exudates, the most dynamic component of rhizodeposits, and review recent progresses about the influence of specific root exudates in promoting bacterial root colonization, inducing biofilm development, acting as plant defence and shaping the rhizomicrobiome.  aPublisher supplied data  aMCB1651732cNational Science Foundation of United States  a201809120002cChina Scholarship Council  a1651732cUS National Science Foundation  a17YFZCNC00430cKey Technology R&D Program of Tianjin  a2017YFD0201101cNational Key R&D Program of China 3abiofilm 3acarbon 3ahost plants 3anitrogen 3aplant growth 3aroots1 aReverdy, Alicyn1 aShe, Qianxuan1 aSun, Bingbing1 aChai, Yunrong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5903-55290 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2020 Apr., v. 12, no. 2 p.160-172dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.128163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002700184245019700211300001800408506007600426520173500502592002802237506003702265650004002302650001702342650001602359650001402375650001402389650001002403650004502413650001702458650002002475650002002495650001302515650001802528650002102546650001202567650001302579650002302592650002202615650002702637650002202664650001202686700001902698700001902717700001902736700002502755773012902780856007702909852000902986655001202995IND60132446720221207112446.0150505e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013244672DNAL7 a10.1128/mBio.00105-152doi7 aPMC44535302pmcid7 a257595002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarquez-Jurado, Silvia10aIdentification of a Gamma Interferon-Activated Inhibitor of Translation-Like RNA Motif at the 3′ End of the Transmissible Gastroenteritis Coronavirus Genome Modulating Innate Immune Response  ap. e00105-15.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA 32-nucleotide (nt) RNA motif located at the 3′ end of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) genome was found to specifically interact with the host proteins glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) and arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RRS). This RNA motif has high homology in sequence and secondary structure with the gamma interferon-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) element, which is located at the 3′ end of several mRNAs encoding proinflammatory proteins. The GAIT element is involved in the translation silencing of these mRNAs through its interaction with the GAIT complex (EPRS, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q, ribosomal protein L13a, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) to favor the resolution of inflammation. Interestingly, we showed that the viral RNA motif bound the GAIT complex and inhibited the in vitro translation of a chimeric mRNA containing this RNA motif. To our knowledge, this is the first GAIT-like motif described in a positive RNA virus. To test the functional role of the GAIT-like RNA motif during TGEV infection, a recombinant coronavirus harboring mutations in this motif was engineered and characterized. Mutations of the GAIT-like RNA motif did not affect virus growth in cell cultures. However, an exacerbated innate immune response, mediated by the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) pathway, was observed in cells infected with the mutant virus compared with the response observed in cells infected with the parental virus. Furthermore, the mutant virus was more sensitive to beta interferon than the parental virus. All together, these data strongly suggested that the viral GAIT-like RNA motif modulates the host innate immune response.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTransmissible gastroenteritis virus 3acell culture 3acell growth 3achimerism 3acytokines 3agenes 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ainflammation 3ainnate immunity 3ainterferon-beta 3amelanoma 3amessenger RNA 3amicrobial growth 3amutants 3amutation 3aribonucleoproteins 3asequence homology 3atranslation (genetics) 3avirus replication 3aviruses1 aNogales, Aitor1 aZuñiga, Sonia1 aEnjuanes, Luis1 aAlmazñán, Fernando0 tmBio.g2015 May 1, v. 6, no. 2 p.e00105-15-e00105-15dAmerican Society for MicrobiologywJournal:J000001381x2150-75117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00105-153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03806naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012700170300001600297520195700313592002802270650002502298650002202323650001502345650001302360650001902373650002702392650001202419650001202431650001002443650001502453650001102468650001802479650002302497650002402520650001002544651001202554651001902566651001202585651001902597651001402616651001002630653001402640653001602654653001902670653002502689653001002714653000902724653001102733700002302744700001902767700002002786700002002806700001802826700002002844700002302864700005902887773011602946856008503062852000903147655001203156IND60618426520221118055416.0210118e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061842652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2018.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelder, Mark P.10aOccurrence and distribution of Ambylomma americanum as determined by passive surveillance in Ontario, Canada (1999–2016)  ap. 146-155.  aThe lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum, is spreading northward from its historical stronghold in the southeastern United States. As a vector and biting pest, public and veterinary health officials must remain vigilant of the lone star tick’s expanding range. We use ticks submitted to Public Health Ontario Laboratory (1999–2016) to describe the spatial and temporal dynamics of A. americanum in Ontario, Canada, as well as submitter demographics. We identified 847 A. americanum submissions during the surveillance period, with 773 (91.3%) non-travel-related and 74 (8.7%) travel-related submissions. Annual A. americanum submissions increased over the surveillance period. Approximately 91% of non-travel-related submissions were adult ticks and 9% were nymphs. The highest submission rates were from individuals living in the Eastern and South West regions of the province. Adult specimens were primarily submitted from May through July and nymphs from March through September. Higher numbers of submissions were from young children (<10 years) and older adults (55–74 years), with equal proportions of male and female submitters. The majority of travel-related submissions were from travellers returning from the southeastern United States (i.e., Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas). Amblyomma americanum distribution is scattered in Ontario and submissions are likely the consequence of ongoing detection of adventive specimens. Further tick dragging is required to confirm the presence of established lone star tick populations in the province. Given the relatively rapid expansion of blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, populations in Ontario, we expect climate change to facilitate the range of expansion of A. americanum into the province. We propose an algorithm for identifying A. americanum-risk areas, which will aid public and veterinary health officials when assessing the risks posed by lone star ticks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma americanum 3aIxodes scapularis 3aalgorithms 3achildren 3aclimate change 3ademographic statistics 3aelderly 3afemales 3amales 3amonitoring 3anymphs 3apublic health 3atemporal variation 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3aFlorida 3aNorth Carolina 3aOntario 3aSouth Carolina 3aTennessee 3aTexas 0aAdventive 0aEstablished 0aLone star tick 0aPassive surveillance 0aRange 0aRisk 0aVector1 aRussell, Curtis B.1 aClow, Katie M.1 aJohnson, Steven1 aWeese, J.

Nonetheless, molecular mechanism underlying biological effects of miRNAs such as pacemaker exosome-derived miR-127-5p in embryonic-like stem cells (ESCs) differentiation into pacemaker cell is yet to be clarified. Through real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or western blotting (WB) techniques, levels of miRNAs, miR-127-5p, and NKx2.5 expressions were quantitatively measured. Cellular differentiation (CD) was probed with flow cytometric (FC) and WB techniques. Prediction of miR-127-5p association with NKx2.5 was studied through bioinformatics tools before verification with luciferase assays. Promotion of ESCs differentiation to pacemaker through miR-127-5p was measured with qPCR and WB techniques. Through the same assaying methods, up-regulation of pace-making genes (Shox2, HCN4, Cx45, Tbx3 and Tbx18) expression was observed in Nkx2.5 knockdown group. However, Nkx2.5 expression was down-regulated during differentiation of pacemaker-like cells into ESCs. Furthermore, techniques (such as qPCR, WB, immunofluorescent staining and FC) were employed to demonstrate that overexpressed miR-127-5p could suppress NKx2.5 expression. Through NKx2.5 targeting, ESCs could be differentiated into pacemaker-like cells with miR-127-5p possibly serving as a crucial positive regulator. On the account of our findings, further researches are needed to unearth the possible underlying mechanism and role of exosome-derived miRNAs in cell signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3acell differentiation 3aflow cytometry 3aluciferase 3amicroRNA 3aprediction 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresearch 0amiR-127-5p 0aNKx2.5 0aDifferentiation 0aPacemaker cell1 aTang, Jun1 aYou, Jia1 aGu, Xiaojuan1 aXu, Chao1 aGu, Xiang0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2022 June 30, v. 611 p.68-77dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.04.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010500171300001600276520142400292592002801716650002101744650001501765650003101780650002801811650001501839650003801854650002401892650004301916650001101959650001701970650003701987650001702024650001702041650002002058650002702078650002402105650003202129700002002161700002302181700001802204700002102222700001602243773012602259856008202385852000902467655001202476IND60089388520221119110011.0141102e20110506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008938852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamawaki, Hideyuki10aOmentin, a novel adipocytokine inhibits TNF-induced vascular inflammation in human endothelial cells  ap. 339-343.  aOmentin is a recently identified adipocytokine with insulin-sensitizing effect. While lack of omentin may be related to the pathogenesis of obesity-related cardiovascular diseases, its effect in vasculature is largely unknown. We examined effects of omentin on vascular endothelial inflammatory states. Western blotting was performed to analyze inflammatory signal transduction in cultured vascular endothelia cells. The cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) content was measured using enzyme immunoassay. Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with omentin (300ng/ml, 20min) induced phosphorylation of 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Thr 172) and endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) (Ser 1177). Consistently, omentin increased the cGMP level. Pretreatment with omentin (300ng/ml, 30min) significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK as well as expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 by TNF-α (5ng/ml, 20min–24h). An inhibitor of JNK significantly inhibited the TNF-α-induced COX-2 expression. Inhibitory effect of omentin on TNF-α-induced COX-2 was reversed by a NOS inhibitor. The present results demonstrate for the first time that omentin plays an anti-inflammatory role by preventing the TNF-α-induced COX-2 expression in vascular endothelial cells. Omentin inhibits COX-2 induction via preventing the JNK activation presumably through activation of AMPK/eNOS/NO pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadipokines 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acardiovascular diseases 3acyclic GMP 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3aenzyme immunoassays 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anitric oxide 3apathogenesis 3aphosphorylation 3aprostaglandin synthase 3asignal transduction 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aKuramoto, Junji1 aKameshima, Satoshi1 aUsui, Tatsuya1 aOkada, Muneyoshi1 aHara, Yukio0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 May 6, v. 408, no. 2 p.339-343dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01418naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007600157300001400233520039100247592002800638650001600666650001400682650002500696650001400721650001700735700001800752700001200770700001300782700001900795700001700814700001700831773013700848856007400985852000901059655001201068IND60668821320221119202548.0190920e20121127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066882132DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ta00386d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Kezheng10aCellulose nanofiber–graphene all solid-state flexible supercapacitors  ap. 63-67.  aCellulose nanofibers are selected as nano-spacers, electrolyte nano-reservoirs and hierarchical nanostructure makers of CNF–RGO hybrid aerogel.

METHODS: In total, 236 adolescents (aged 12–18) and 301 adults (aged 22–40), completed the questionnaire and wore an accelerometer for two weeks. RESULTS: Adolescents reported exceptionally more time spent on MPA (mean difference 596 ± 704 min/wk) and VPA (mean difference 178 ± 315 min/wk) than was assessed objectively by the accelerometer. Based on the questionnaire, high educated adolescents spent more time on MPA (205 min/wk, p = 0.002) and VPA (120 min/wk, p = 0.01) than low educated adolescents, but according to the accelerometer they spent less time on MPA (149 min/wk, p = 0.001) and VPA (47 min/wk, p = 0.001). Among adults there was moderate agreement between self-reported time and objectively measured time spent on MPA, but in general the reported time spent on MPA (mean difference 107 ± 334 min/wk) and VPA (mean difference 169 ± 250 min/wk) exceeded the time measured with the accelerometer. Overweight adults reported significantly more VPA (57 min/wk, p = 0.04) than normal weight adults, but this was not confirmed by the accelerometer data. CONCLUSION: We observed large differences in time spent on MPA and VPA measured by questionnaire and accelerometer in adolescents but reasonably good agreement in adults. Differences between methods varied by gender, education and weight status. This finding raises serious questions about the use of questionnaires to quantify MPA and VPA in adolescents. There is a clear need in advanced valid assessments of PA in adolescents.

Among pathogens that are not often studied are helminth ova, including that of the Ascaris spp. Almost all of the knowledge about the persistence of Ascaris spp. ova in soils fertilized with biosolids is based on studies developed in North America, Europe, and Asia. These studies have almost always been conducted under temperate climate conditions, which may cause erroneous interpretations when the conclusions are extrapolated to tropical regions such as those found in Brazil. This team evaluated the persistence of viable Ascaris spp. ova in a sandy Quartzipsamment tropical soil, previously planted with Eucalyptus urophylla × Eucalyptus grandis hybrid (Eucalyptus urograndis) and fertilized with biosolids, over a 52‐wk period. During the reporting period, the average temperature of soil and biosolids fluctuated between 15 and 30°C, and the average moisture of biosolids fluctuated between 60 and 90%. The estimated persistence time of viable Ascaris spp. ova after land application was estimated at close to 7 wk, indicating that ova may not be viable for as long as it has been shown to be in studies of more temperate areas. The relationship of temperature with persistence of viable Ascaris spp. ova in a tropical soil was stronger than moisture content, suggesting that temperature substantially contributed to their nonviability over the course of the experiment. CORE IDEAS: Climate conditions, mainly temperature, influence the viability of Ascaris spp. ova. Viable Ascaris spp. ova were not found after 7 wk of study in tropical soil. Agricultural use may be the best practice for disposal of biosolids.  aPublisher supplied data  cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  cCompanhia Ambiental do Estado de São Paulo  cBiossolo Agricultura & Ambiente Ltda.  cSuzano Papel e Celulose S/A  cFaculdade de Ciências Agronômicas‐FCA/UNESP  cUSDA 3aAscaris 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aEucalyptus urophylla 3aQuartzipsamments 3abiosolids 3aclimatic factors 3ahelminths 3ahuman health 3ahybrids 3aland application 3aova 3apathogens 3arisk assessment 3asoil temperature 3atemperate zones 3atropical soils 3atropics 3awater content 3aBrazil1 aGuerrini, Iraê A.1 aOliveira, Fernando Corrêa,1 aSato, Maria Inês Z.1 aHachich, Elayse M.1 aPassos, José Raimundo S.1 aGoulart, Lívia M.

Fluidic shear stress has been proven to affect bone cell functions and remodelling. We have developed a microfluidic system which can generate four shear flows in one device as a means to study cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca²⁺]c) dynamics of osteoblasts. Four shear forces were achieved by having four cell culture chambers with different widths while resistance correction channels compensated for the overall resistance to allow equal flow distribution towards the chambers. Computational simulation of the local shear stress distribution highlighted the preferred section in the cell chamber to measure the calcium dynamics. Osteoblasts showed an [Ca²⁺]c increment proportional to the intensity of the shear stress from 0.03 to 0.30Pa. A delay in response was observed with an activation threshold between 0.03 and 0.06Pa. With computational modelling, our microfluidic device can offer controllable multishear stresses and perform quantitative comparisons of shear stress-induced intensity change of calcium in osteoblasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acell culture 3amodels 3aosteoblasts 3aquantitative analysis 3ashear stress1 aPan, Leiting1 avan Noort, Danny1 aMeng, Guixian1 aWu, Xian1 aSun, Haiying1 aXu, Jingjun1 aLee, Imshik0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 May 6, v. 408, no. 2 p.350-355dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013300172300001600305500001900321520108100340536030701421592002801728650001701756650001001773650002501783650002201808650002001830650001301850650001701863651001101880653003401891653002401925653004701949653003501996653006302031773012602094856008502220852000902305655001202314IND60732625320221120181343.0210331e20210304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073262532DNAL7 a10.1080/1747423X.2021.18825992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChilombo, Andrew10aQuestioning the narrative of land marginality in large-scale land acquisition deals: case study of Nansanga Farm Block in Zambia  ap. 188-204.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe concept of marginal land in large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) has become important to understand land for LSLA deals. Based on remotely gathered geospatial data, the biophysical dimension of the concept dominates the characterization of land for LSLA deals. Little attention is paid to the socio-cultural dimension that represents years of dynamic community–environment interactions as lived experiences that are well structured in traditional knowledge. Informed by participatory appraisal methods in Nansanga farm block, an LSLA deal in Zambia, this study aimed at providing socio-cultural evidence that questions the concept constructed within science-development policy and political spaces. Overall, based on socio-cultural evidence, the findings suggest that Nansanga cannot be discounted as marginal land. In contribution to improving our understanding of human-environment interaction in land-use science, the paper argues for a mix of process-oriented and pattern-based approaches to gain better insights into land use change at spatial and temporal scales.  aThis research was part of my PhD for which I received the 2016 University of Edinburgh Southern African PhD Research Scholarship.

This was to assess the potential risks of the heavy metals on human due to exposure among local residents (children and adults) of the area. Forty (40) soil samples were collected over the entire dumpsite at 0–20 cm depth. The elemental concentrations of Pb, Cr, Cd, Zn, Cu, and Ni were measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) technique. The contamination load was estimated by employing index of geoaccumulation (Igₑₒ) and potential human health risks due to multiple exposure pathways (inhalation, dermal absorption, and ingestion) were estimated using the risk-based equations and exposure parameters developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The average concentrations (± standard deviation) of Pb, Cr, Cu, Mn, Cd, Ni, and Zn were 3.79 ± 2.16, 8.36 ± 3.90, 7.77 ± 2.70, 7.75 ± 3.10, 4.31 ± 0.82, 3.09 ± 2.29, and 3.07 ± 1.74 μg/g, respectively. The mean values of Igₑₒ follow the order of Mn < Cr < Pb = Ni < Zn < Cu < Cd. The dermal contact with the heavy metals appeared to be the major route of exposure to children followed by inhalation and ingestion. Inhalation is the main route of exposure for the adults. The hazard quotients (HQ) of all the heavy metals are lower than 1, implying that the adverse health impact on the children and adult exposed to heavy metals from the dumpsite was relatively moderate. The hazard index (HI) values of Cd were 2.0 and 1.2 for exposed adults and children, respectively. The carcinogen risks for inhalation exposure ranged from 2.3 × 10⁻⁶ to 6.4 × 10⁻⁶, which falls within the acceptable limit of 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻⁶. There is concern over the potential health risk of the local residents, most especially the children living in the vicinity of the dumpsite due to the possibility of dispersal of heavy metals to the entire community, leading to long-life exposure and residents’ detrimental health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aadults 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abatteries 3abreathing 3acadmium 3acarcinogens 3achildren 3achromium 3acopper 3adermal exposure 3aequations 3ahealth effects assessments 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3aindustrial wastes 3aingestion 3ainhalation exposure 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3arisk 3asoil sampling 3astandard deviation 3azinc 3aNigeria1 aAdejoro, Isaiah A.1 aAyeku, Patric O.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2019 May, v. 191, no. 5 p.290-290dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7454-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245012900167300001400296520202900310592002802339650001302367650001802380650001902398650002302417650002802440650001202468650001402480650002502494650001402519650001002533650002202543650002202565650003502587650001202622651001402634700002702648700002302675700002702698773008602725856004802811852000902859655001202868IND4468237920221121061125.0120416e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446823792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-011-0879-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSperling, Erik A.14aThe complete mitochondrial genome of the verongid sponge Aplysina cauliformis: implications for DNA barcoding in demosponges  ap. 61-69.  aDNA “barcoding,” the determination of taxon-specific genetic variation typically within a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (cox1) gene, has emerged as a useful complement to morphological studies, and is routinely used by expert taxonomists to identify cryptic species and by non-experts to better identify samples collected during field surveys. The rate of molecular evolution in the mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) of nonbilaterian animals (sponges, cnidarians, and placozoans) is much slower than in bilaterian animals for which DNA barcoding strategies were developed. If sequence divergence among nonbilaterian mtDNA and specifically cox1 is too slow to generate diagnostic variation, alternative genes for DNA barcoding and species-level phylogenies should be considered. Previous study across the Aplysinidae (Demospongiae, Verongida) family of sponges demonstrated no nucleotide substitutions in the traditional cox1 barcoding fragment among the Caribbean species of Aplysina. As the mitochondrial genome of Aplysina fulva has previously been sequenced, we are now able to make the first comparisons between complete mtDNA of congeneric demosponges to assess whether potentially informative variation exists in genes other than cox1. In this article, we present the complete mitochondrial genome of Aplysina cauliformis, a circular molecule 19620 bp in size. The mitochondrial genome of A. cauliformis is the same length as is A. fulva and shows six confirmed nucleotide differences and an additional 11 potential SNPs. Of the six confirmed SNPs, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (nad5) and nad2 each contain two, and in nad2 both yield amino acid substitutions, suggesting balancing selection may act on this gene. Thus, while the low nucleotide diversity in Caribbean aplysinid cox1 extends to the entire mitochondrial genome, some genes do display variation. If these represent interspecific differences, then they may be useful alternative markers for studies in recently diverged sponge clades.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCnidaria 3aDNA barcoding 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADH dehydrogenase 3aamino acid substitution 3aanimals 3abarcoding 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3amitochondrial DNA 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asurveys 3aCaribbean1 aRosengarten, Rafael D.1 aMoreno, María A.,1 aDellaporta, Stephen L.0 tHydrobiologia.g2012 May, v. 687, no. 1 p.61-69dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0879-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245014300204300001200347520166100359592002802020596005902048596005902107596005402166596008002220650001502300650001502315650001102330650002302341650001502364650001702379651001002396700001802406700001802424700003302442700001602475700001702491700001702508700001402525773015002539856008202689852000902771655001202780IND60637600820221120063124.0200425e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063760082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-019-7451-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Yongjiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8772-721810aUrban expansion simulation and scenario prediction using cellular automata: comparison between individual and multiple influencing factors  ap. 291.  aQuantifying the contribution of driving factors is crucial to urban expansion modeling based on cellular automata (CA). The objective of this study is to compare individual-factor-based (IFB) models and multi-factor-based (MFB) models as well as examine the impacts of each factor on future urban scenarios. We quantified the contribution of driving factors using a generalized additive model (GAM), and calibrated six IFB-DE-CA models and fifteen MFB-DE-CA models using a differential evolution (DE) algorithm. The six IFB-DE-CA models and five MFB-DE-CA models were selected to simulate the 2005–2015 urban expansion of Hangzhou, China, and all IFB-DE-CA models were applied to project future urban scenarios out to the year 2030. Our results show that terrain (DEM) and population density (POP) are the two most influential factors affecting urban expansion of Hangzhou, indicating the dominance of biophysical and demographic drivers. All DE-CA models produced defensible simulations for 2015, with overall accuracy exceeding 89%. The IFB-DE-CA models based on DEM and POP outperformed some MFB-DE-CA models, suggesting that multiple factors are not necessarily more effective than a single factor in simulating present urban patterns. The future scenarios produced by the IFB-DE-CA models are substantially shaped by the corresponding factors. These scenarios can inform urban modelers and policy-makers as to how Hangzhou city will evolve if the corresponding factors are individually focused. This study improves our understanding of the effects of driving factors on urban expansion and future scenarios when incorporating the factors separately.  aPublisher supplied data  a41771414cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41631178cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018YFB0505400cNational Key R&D Program of China  a2018YFB0505402cGuangdong Province Introduction of Innovative R&D Team (CN) 3aalgorithms 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apopulation density 3aprediction 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aWang, Jiafeng1 aTong, Xiaohua1 aShafizadeh-Moghadam, Hossein1 aCai, Zongbo1 aChen, Shurui1 aLei, Zhenkun1 aGao, Chen0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2019 May, v. 191, no. 5 p.291-291dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7451-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245010000182500001900282520165800301592002801959650001601987650001202003650002102015650000902036650001102045650001602056650004302072651001302115651001102128653001702139653001502156653002202171653003102193653001502224653001302239700001802252700002602270700002502296773011902321856008802440852000902528655001202537IND60713195720221122040210.0210312e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071319572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSátyro, Zayra Christine14aThe relative and joint effect of rivers and urban area on a squall line in the Central Amazonia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the Amazon, large cities are typically bordered by rivers and dense forest areas, which influence and are influenced by mesoscale convective systems. In the Amazon, the growth and establishment of cities is strongly dependent on the presence of the rivers; thus, understanding the influence of the river-city system on mesoscale systems is relevant. In this work, we used the WRF model to assess the impact of the presence of both the river and the urban area on the development of a Squall Line (SL) that reached the city of Manaus (Brazil). Seven microphysical schemes were evaluated, aiming to verify the performance of the model to represent general characteristics of the SL. After evaluating WRF skill, sensitivity experiments, using four ensembles perturbing the initial conditions, about the effect of changes in the surface were conducted. Results showed the regional effect of the river influences the arrival of the SL at Manaus. The urban presence also favored the intensification of SL near Manaus. Furthermore, the absence of the river produced a weaker SL, which arrived earlier with maximum intensity after passing through Manaus. In turn, the river influences the accumulated rainfall over the urban area. Without the city, the accumulated rainfall reduced by 8.85%; without the river, the reduction reached 49%; and without both, a decrease of about 59.5% was observed. The effect of the river on the accumulated rainfall over the city depends on the urban structure itself. Therefore, this study reveals that the presence of the river intensifies the SL over the city, but the urban structure dictates the intensity of this effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3aforests 3amodel validation 3arain 3arivers 3aurban areas 3aweather research and forecasting model 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aUrbanization 0aTopography 0aWeather anomalies 0aWater surface assimilation 0aWRF skills 0aEnsemble1 aFarias, Carla1 aCandido, Luiz Antonio1 aVeiga, José Augusto0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 755 p.142178-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245019800205300001800403520104300421592002801464650002301492650001201515650001001527650001501537650002601552650003101578650002201609650001101631650002601642650001801668650001001686650001301696650001001709650002501719653003901744653003201783653003301815653000901848653002501857653001201882653002801894700001801922700002101940700006601961700001802027700002102045700003102066700003402097700002402131773014702155856008002302852000902382655001202391IND60645987920190725000000.0190605e20190508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064598792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b009492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmedbol, Élise1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9483-566010aGlyphosate and Aminomethylphosphonic Acid Content in Glyphosate-Resistant Soybean Leaves, Stems, and Roots and Associated Phytotoxicity Following a Single Glyphosate-Based Herbicide Application  ap. 6133-6142.  aGlyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) applications were reported to induce physiological damages to glyphosate-resistant (GR) soybean, which were mainly attributed to aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA). In order to study glyphosate and AMPA dynamics in plants and associated phytotoxic effects, a greenhouse experiment was set where GR soybeans were exposed to GBH (0.7 to 4.5 kg glyphosate ha–¹) and sampled over time (2, 7, 14, and 28 days after treatment (DAT)). Hydrogen peroxide content increased 2 DAT, while a decrease was observed for the effective quantum yield (2, 7, 14 DAT), stomatal conductance (2 DAT), and biomass (14 DAT). Glyphosate content was higher in leaves, followed by stems, and then roots. AMPA content tended to increase with time, especially in roots, and the amount of AMPA in roots was negatively correlated to mostly all phytotoxicity indicators. This finding is important since AMPA residues are measured in agricultural soils several months after GBH applications, which could impact productivity in GR crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3abiomass 3acrops 3aglyphosate 3aglyphosate resistance 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3apesticide application 3aphytotoxicity 3aroots 3asoybeans 3astems 3astomatal conductance 0aglyphosate and AMPA toxicokinetics 0aglyphosate-based herbicides 0aglyphosate-resistant soybean 0aH2O2 0astomatal conductance 0abiomass 0aeffective quantum yield1 aLucotte, Marc1 aMaccario, Sophie1 aGomes, Marcelo Pedrosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9406-98151 aPaquet, Serge1 aMoingt, Matthieu1 aMercier, Lila Lucero Celis1 aSobarzo, Millaray Rayen Perez1 aBlouin, Marc-André0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 May 08, v. 67, no. 22 p.6133-6142dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b009493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013100173300001600304520199000320592002802310650000802338650002202346650001602368650001402384650002002398650001502418650001902433650001402452650000902466650001702475650001302492650001302505650002002518653003002538653001302568700001902581700002602600773009902626856008502725852000902810655001202819IND60693042020221122064314.0200504e20171102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069304202DNAL7 a10.1080/17597269.2016.11740172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, R.

Among the various alternative fuels, hydrogen is a long term renewable and less polluting fuel. Overcoming diesel engine emissions, especially NOx, requires investigation of new systems which can potentially steer the automobile industry towards further emissions reduction. Addition of hydrogen (H₂) and nitrogen (N₂) with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) can lead to a new generation of low polluting compression ignition (CI) engines. In this experiment the H₂, N₂ and exhaust gas were inducted into the inlet manifold with inlet air. The experiments were conducted on a four-stroke, single-cylinder, water-cooled, direct injection (DI) diesel engine at a speed of 1500 rpm. The H₂ and N₂ were stored in a high pressure cylinder and supplied to the inlet manifold through water and air based flame arrestor at 2 bar pressure. The EGR valve is used to control the EGR to the inlet of the engine. Initially the engine was run for different H₂ flow rate and optimized for maximum BTE. Then this (maximum BTE) flow rate of H₂ was taken to optimize the EGR rate for 5%, 10% and 20%. The engine was run by different flow rates of N₂ namely 2%, 3% and 4% with optimized EGR and H₂ flow rate. The engine performance, emission and combustion parameters were analyzed at this condition which gives low NOx emission. The fuel used was a blend of 20% biodiesel and 80% diesel called B20. The experimental results show that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) increased due hydrogen addition but the addition of EGR and N₂ decreased the BTE. NOx emission decreased due to addition of EGR and N₂. While the induction of H₂ tended to decrease the emission of HC and CO, the addition of N₂ and EGR with H₂ tended to increase the above emissions. The heat release rate and cylinder pressure slightly decreased due to addition of N₂ with H₂ and EGR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalternative fuels 3aautomobiles 3abiodiesel 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3aemissions 3aheat 3ahydrocarbons 3ahydrogen 3anitrogen 3anitrogen oxides 0aexhaust gas recirculation 0aemission1 aLoganathan, M.1 aGunasekaran, E.

It is the latter analytical operation that generates a discord as no common sample preparation approach has been yet accepted. To resolve this challenge, we compared different modes of acidic sample digestion (in open and closed systems, applying in the latter case conventional or microwave heating) using a lake sediment reference sample. It was shown that the sample treatment in an autoclave with resistance heating provides the best fit (relative deviation < 7%) to certified values for metals generally used as diagenetic proxies (U, Sm, Nd, Th, La, Sc, Sr, etc.). Furthermore, the thermally convective pressure digestion appears to be more cost-efficient than microwave-assisted digestion (because of lower reagent consumption and cheaper removable PFE liners), an important asset for systematic geochemical mapping. In order to prove the applicability of the developed digestion procedure for different sediments, a marine sample from the East Siberian Sea was analyzed independently in two laboratories and across all representative metals the results acquired were found in good agreement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoclaves 3aclosed loop systems 3acost effectiveness 3aheat 3alakes 3amicrowave treatment 3asediments 3astrontium 0aICP-MS 0aSediments 0aSample preparation 0aInorganic elements 0aDiagenesis1 aBurmii, Zh.P.1 aOrlova, T.V.1 aSevastyanov, V.S.1 aTimerbaev, A.R.0 tTalanta.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 200 p.468-471dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100002200162245010600184300001800290520164300308592002801951650001301979650001001992650001702002650002802019650001002047650001102057650001402068650001702082650001402099650001102113650001702124650002202141650001402163650001502177650001002192650001002202650003302212650002402245650003102269650002102300650002802321650000902349650001302358650001102371650002202382650001002404650004102414650001102455650001502466650003502481650002802516650001602544650001702560650001202577650001502589651001902604651001802623700002302641700002402664700002302688773013802711856004602849852000902895655001202904IND4470573920221120200639.0120423e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447057392DNAL7 a224566552pmid7 a10.3945/ajcn.111.0216002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLernon, David J10aDo lifestyle choices explain the effect of alcohol on bone mineral density in women around menopause?  ap. 1261-1269.  aBACKGROUND: Moderate alcohol consumption has been shown to be positively associated with increased bone mineral density (BMD). However, other lifestyle choices have also been shown to have an effect on bone health. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the association between alcohol intake and BMD in women around menopause in the United Kingdom and to determine whether any association is independent of other lifestyle choices. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study design was used to examine the relation between alcohol intake and BMD in a cohort of 3218 women aged 50–62 y from the Aberdeen Prospective Osteoporosis Screening Study. Women were grouped into clusters according to their lifestyle choices. ANCOVA was used to examine the effect of categorized alcohol intake on BMD adjusted for cluster of lifestyle and other baseline covariates. The ANCOVA was repeated for different types of alcoholic beverage (eg, beer, liquor, and wine) separately. RESULTS: Three lifestyle clusters were identified and were based on different levels of the following 3 factors: smoking pack-years, fruit and vegetable intakes, and physical activity. In the lifestyle-adjusted models, women who consumed >1 drink/d of alcohol had a significantly greater femoral neck BMD (P = 0.008) and lumbar spine BMD (P = 0.007) than did those who never consumed alcohol. For separate alcoholic drinks, only beer had a positive significant effect on lumbar spine BMD after adjustment for lifestyle (P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Moderate alcohol intake appears to be positively associated with BMD independently of the type of lifestyle led by women around menopause.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3abeers 3abone density 3across-sectional studies 3afemur 3afruits 3alifestyle 3alumbar spine 3amenopause 3amodels 3aosteoporosis 3aphysical activity 3ascreening 3avegetables 3awines 3awomen 2aAlcohol Drinkingxmetabolism 2aAlcoholic Beverages 2aBone Densityxdrug effects 2aCluster Analysis 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aFruit 2aHormone Replacement Therapyxmethods 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aLumbar Vertebraexdrug effects 2aMenopausexdrug effects 2aMiddle Aged 2aRisk Factors 2aSmoking 2aVegetables 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain1 aPowell, Jonathan J1 aJugdaohsingh, Ravin1 aMacdonald, Helen M0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2012 May, v. 95, no. 5 p.1261-1269dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.111.021600  aDNAL 7aarticle01968naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001900185245004100204506007600245520083100321592002801152506003701180650001401217650001701231650002101248650001401269650001701283650001401300650002001314650001801334650001201352700002401364773011901388856007801507852000901585655001201594IND60648647520221207132637.0190701e20190511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064864752DNAL7 a10.3390/biology80200292doi7 aPMC66276612pmcid7 a310835402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStout, Roisin 10aMitochondria’s Role in Skin Ageing  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSkin ageing is the result of a loss of cellular function, which can be further accelerated by external factors. Mitochondria have important roles in skin function, and mitochondrial damage has been found to accumulate with age in skin cells, but also in response to solar light and pollution. There is increasing evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are key features in all ageing tissues, including skin. This is directly linked to skin ageing phenotypes: wrinkle formation, hair greying and loss, uneven pigmentation and decreased wound healing. The loss of barrier function during skin ageing increases susceptibility to infection and affects wound healing. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms involved is important clinically and also for the development of antiageing skin care products.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acosmetics 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotype 3apigmentation 3apollution 3asolar radiation 3atissue repair 3atissues1 aBirch-Machin, Mark 0 tBiology.g2019 May 11, v. 8, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology80200293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014300163300001400306520110300320592002801423650002001451650000901471650001201480650001101492650001301503650001901516650001901535650002101554650003501575650004101610650001601651650001401667650001901681650001301700650002501713650001401738650001801752650002201770650003001792700001401822700001601836773010701852856008101959852000902040655001202049IND60637601120221120041729.0190419e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063760112DNAL7 a10.1134/S002626171901003X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDwivedi, A.10aProduction and Characterization of Biosurfactant from Corynebacterium Species and Its Effect on the Growth of Petroleum Degrading Bacteria  ap. 87-93.  aPresent study was carried out to isolate the effective bacterial strains for the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons and biosurfactant production. The bacterial strains were screened for production of biosurfactant by CTAB methylene blue agar assay, hemolytic activity assay and drop collapse assay. The selected strain was identified as Corynebacterium species by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Biosurfactant was characterized using thin layer chromatographic analysis revealed that the biosurfactant may be glycolipids which have different functional groups viz: alkenes, carboxylic acids and aliphatic amines. GC-MS analysis confirmed that the biosurfactant was 13-docosenamide (z). Biosurfactant also induces the growth of petroleum degrading bacteria i.e. Corynebacterium species. The results proved that the maximum growth was found at 96 h with biosurfactant (13-docosenamide (z)) and 144 h without biosurfactant. The study reflected the potential use of this biosurfactant for petroleum degradation and its application for in situ bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons contaminated sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium 3aagar 3aalkenes 3aamines 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3abiosurfactants 3acarboxylic acids 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglycolipids 3ahemolysis 3amethylene blue 3amoieties 3anucleotide sequences 3apetroleum 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3athin layer chromatography1 aKumar, A.1 aBhat, J.

The honey from Montenegro has not been previously studied in such detail. Differentiation between samples, such as honeydew honey and polyfloral honey, was based on electrical conductivity, which was higher than 0.8 mS cm⁻¹ for honeydew honey, as was expected. Other investigated physicochemical parameters (water content, free acids, diastase activity, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) content and sugar content) have shown great similarity for all honey samples. The main interest of this study was the identification and quantification of phenolic compounds using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) with mass spectrometry detection. The results show that honey samples are very rich in phenolic compounds, especially quercetin. Among the 31 quantified phenolic compounds, the most dominant were phenolic acids. The highlight was based on p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid and ferulic acid. Considering polyphenolic compounds and sugar content, a high nutritional value can be observed in all samples, with an emphasis on polyfloral honeys, as was confirmed with principal component analysis (PCA). In addition, all honey samples were tested for total phenolic content (TPC) and radical scavenging activity (RSA). The results indicate the higher antioxidant ability of honeys from Montenegro in comparison to some honey samples from other countries in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-hydroxybenzoic acid 3aamylases 3aantioxidant activity 3acaffeic acid 3aelectrical conductivity 3aferulic acid 3ahoneydew honey 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3amass spectrometry 3anutritive value 3ap-coumaric acid 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquercetin 3asugar content 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3awater content 3aMontenegro1 aGašić, Uroš1 aTosti, Tomislav1 aTrifković, Jelena1 aBaošić, Rada1 aBlagojević, Stevan1 aIgnjatović, Ljubiša1 aTešić, Živoslav0 tRSC advances.g2020 Jan. 14, v. 10, no. 5 p.2462-2471dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra08783d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01874naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245014600164300001800310520083800328592002801166650001501194650002101209650001901230650001801249700002001267700002301287700002201310700002301332773012201355856007401477852000901551655001201560IND60681909420221119133403.0200121e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068190942DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra08893h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHooshyari, Khadijeh10aFabrication and performance evaluation of new nanocomposite membranes based on sulfonated poly(phthalazinone ether ketone) for PEM fuel cells  ap. 2709-2721.  aThe purpose of this work is to enhance the proton conductivity and fuel cell performance of sulfonated poly(phthalazinone ether ketone) (SPPEK) as a proton exchange membrane through the application of SrTiO₃ perovskite nanoparticles. Nanocomposite membranes based on SPPEK and SrTiO₃ perovskite nanoparticles were prepared via a casting method. The highest proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes obtained was 120 mS cm⁻¹ at 90 °C and 95% RH. These enhancements could be related to the hygroscopic structure of SrTiO₃ perovskite nanoparticles and the formation of hydrogen bonds between nanoparticles and water molecules. The satisfactory power density, 0.41 W cm⁻² at 0.5 V and 85 °C, of the nanocomposite membrane (5 wt% content of nanoparticles) confirms their potential for application in the PEM fuel cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen bonding 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles1 aHeydari, Samira1 aJavanbakht, Mehran1 aBeydaghi, Hossein1 aEnhessari, Morteza0 tRSC advances.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 10, no. 5 p.2709-2721dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra08893h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002100185245005000206506007600256520087700332592002801209506003701237650002701274650002401301650001501325650001301340650002501353650001701378650002201395650001301417650001201430650003001442650002801472650001101500650001701511650001701528773011901545856007801664852000901742655001201751IND60648647720221207131327.0190701e20190511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064864772DNAL7 a10.3390/biology80200312doi7 aPMC66273982pmcid7 a310835492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEells, Janis  T.10aMitochondrial Dysfunction in the Aging Retina  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMitochondria are central in retinal cell function and survival and they perform functions that are critical to cell function. Retinal neurons have high energy requirements, since large amounts of ATP are needed to generate membrane potentials and power membrane pumps. Mitochondria over the course of aging undergo a number of changes. Aged mitochondria exhibit decreased rates of oxidative phosphorylation, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and increased numbers of mtDNA mutations. Mitochondria in the neural retina and the retinal pigment epithelium are particularly susceptible to oxidative damage with aging. Many age-related retinal diseases, including glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration, have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, mitochondria are a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of retinal disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aenergy requirements 3aepithelium 3aglaucoma 3amacular degeneration 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amutation 3aneurons 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3areactive oxygen species 3aretina 3atherapeutics 3atransporters0 tBiology.g2019 May 11, v. 8, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology80200313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011800170300001600288520158800304592002801892650002701920650001201947650001501959650002001974650002201994650001502016650001502031650003302046650002102079650000902100650001302109651001102122651001202133651001002145651001302155651001902168653002102187653002002208653002002228653003302248653001602281700002402297773010102321856008402422852000902506655001202515IND60133106620221121014129.0150518e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013310662DNAL7 a10.1080/17550874.2013.8634072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagy, Ana-Maria10aPopulation genetics of Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera): comparison of native and introduced populations  ap. 317-321.  aBackground: Invasive species can interfere in the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Better understanding of the evolution of such species will be useful when planning their management and eradication. Aims: We aimed to compare patterns of genetic variability in Impatiens glandulifera in native and introduced regions. Methods: We used native samples from India and Pakistan, and non-native samples from Canada, Finland and the UK. Genetic analyses included genotyping using 10 microsatellite markers and sequencing of the nuclear ITS region. Results: Mean allele numbers from native and introduced samples were even, 8.8 and 8.5, respectively, while expected heterozygosities were higher in native samples (mean 0.738) than in non-native samples (mean 0.477). Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium testing indicated significant heterozygote deficiencies at 70% of the loci. Inbreeding coefficients were high in both native and introduced regions (range 0.201–0.726). STRUCTURE analyses showed that native samples from India and Pakistan possessed similar clustering patterns while non-native samples from the UK and Canada resembled each other. One of the four Finnish populations had a similar pattern with the UK and Canadian populations, while the rest showed similarly unique genetic compositions. ITS sequencing indicated in Pakistani samples two polymorphic sites not found in Indian samples but present in some samples from Canada, Finland and the UK. Conclusions: Distinct population genetic patterns indicate that human-mediated dispersal is important in I. glandulifera .  aPublisher supplied data 3aImpatiens glandulifera 3aalleles 3aecosystems 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3ainbreeding 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3ainvasive species 3aloci 3aplanning 3aCanada 3aFinland 3aIndia 3aPakistan 3aUnited Kingdom 0aHimalayan balsam 0ainvasive plants 0amicrosatellites 0apopulation genetic structure 0aSNP markers1 aKorpelainen, Helena0 tPlant ecology & diversity.g2015 May 4, v. 8, no. 3 p.317-321dTaylor & Francisx1755-16687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17550874.2013.8634073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245015900161300001400320520131700334592002801651650002001679650002401699650002501723650002401748650002401772650002501796650002501821650001301846650002101859650001001880650001601890650001001906650001301916650001601929650001201945650001201957650001401969650001201983650001401995650002002009650001302029650002602042650001202068650001102080650000902091653001202100653001402112653001402126653002002140700001502160700001802175773012702193856008102320852000902401655001202410IND60652395020221118004006.0190712e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065239502DNAL7 a10.1017/S14792621180003332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLebot, V.10aDevelopment of HP-TLC method for rapid quantification of sugars, catechins, phenolic acids and saponins to assess Yam (Dioscorea spp.) tuber flour quality  ap. 62-72.  aEight yam species (Dioscorea spp.) represented by 522 accessions (landraces and hybrids) were analysed for the individual sugars, catechins, phenolic acids and saponins contents of their tuber flours. Maltose, sucrose, glucose and fructose were quantified. Reducing sugars mean values were highly variable within species and ranged from 0.16%dry weight (DW) (SD ± 0.12) in D. dumetorum to 3.15%DW (±2.49) in D. esculenta. Maltose was detected only in D. esculenta. Chlorogenic acid, gallic acid and other phenolic acids ranged from 4.33 mg/g DW in D. bulbifera to 4.87 mg/g in D. alata and 9.55 mg/g in D. nummularia but were not detected in other species. Catechins (epicatechin and catechin) were highest in D. bulbifera bulbils (25.18 mg/g) and tubers (6.96 mg/g), and lowest in D. esculenta (0.32 mg/g). Their content is significantly correlated with dark flour colour and they most likely contribute to the oxidation of tuber flesh. Saponins (dioscin and gracillin) were quantified in only two species: D. cayenensis (5.94 mg/g, SD ± 3.78) and D. esculenta (3.74 mg/g, SD ± 3.72). Varietal selection may tend to reduce sugars levels and increase secondary metabolites with bioactive properties. HP-TLC is a suitable technique for the rapid quantification of compounds related to yam tuber flour quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea alata 3aDioscorea bulbifera 3aDioscorea cayenensis 3aDioscorea dumetorum 3aDioscorea esculenta 3aDioscorea nummularia 3abioactive properties 3acatechin 3achlorogenic acid 3acolor 3aepicatechin 3aflour 3afructose 3agallic acid 3aglucose 3ahybrids 3alandraces 3amaltose 3aoxidation 3areducing sugars 3asaponins 3asecondary metabolites 3asucrose 3atubers 3ayams 0adioscin 0aDioscorea 0agracillin 0atuber oxidation1 aMalapa, R.1 aMolisalé, T.0 tPlant genetic resources.g2019 Feb., v. 17, no. 1 p.62-72dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl4078550x1479-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14792621180003333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015100155300002000306520133700326592002801663650001601691650001601707650002301723650002201746650001101768650002001779650002401799650002201823650001401845650001501859700001601874700001901890700001301909700001601922700001201938700001701950773012501967856007402092852000902166655001202175IND60669070720221116200410.0190920e20151020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066907072DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra11290g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Jing10aChemiluminescence determination of human serum albumin based on Co²⁺-catalyzed 2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-4,5-di(2-furyl) imidazole/H₂O₂ system  ap. 89569-89576.  aIn this paper, the chemiluminescence (CL) reaction of 2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-4,5-di(2-furyl) imidazole (t-BDFI) and H₂O₂ was investigated in alkaline medium. The H₂O₂ could directly oxidize t-BDFI to produce CL emission. The effects of some metal ions on CL of the t-BDFI/H₂O₂ system were examined. The results indicated that the addition of Co²⁺ into the t-BDFI/H₂O₂ CL system could induce significant enhancement of the CL signal. A CL system of t-BDFI/H₂O₂/Co²⁺ was developed. The experiment on the effect of human serum albumin (HSA) on the t-BDFI/H₂O₂/Co²⁺ CL system was carried out, and the result indicated that HSA could effectively inhibit the CL signal of this reaction. The inhibited CL intensity is linearly related to the logarithm of concentration of HSA. The linear range of the calibration curve is 5.0 × 10⁻⁸ to 1.0 × 10⁻⁶ mol L⁻¹, and the corresponding detection limit (3σ) is 2.1 × 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹. Based on this study, a novel CL method has been developed for the determination of HSA with high sensitivity and good selectivity. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the determination of HSA in human serum samples. This may intrigue researchers into gaining a new interest in investigating the CL property of heterocyclic imidazole derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acalibration 3acatalytic activity 3achemiluminescence 3acobalt 3adetection limit 3ahuman serum albumin 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimidazole 3ametal ions1 aShen, Jimin1 aChen, Zhonglin1 aNan, Jun1 aHuang, Xiao1 aHan, Lu1 aHao, Weiping0 tRSC advances.g2015 Oct. 20, v. 5, no. 109 p.89569-89576dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra11290g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01521naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245009400172300001600266520047800282592002800760650001800788650001300806650002800819650001900847650002300866650001300889650001600902651002000918651002000938651001300958700001800971773011600989856005701105852000901162655001201171IND4479071020221120055846.0120524e198004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447907102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1440-6055.1979.tb00862.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStarý, Petr,10aTwo new species of aphidius nees (hymenoptera: ichneumonoidea: aphidiidae) from australia  ap. 337-341.  aTwo new, probably exotic, species of aphidiid parasites of aphids are described: Aphidius pelargonii, parasitic in Acyrthosiphon mahae (Mosley) on Pelargonium spp. in New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia; and Aphidius similis, parasitic in Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), R. nymphaeae (L.), Sitobion miscanthi (Takahashi) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer), and known from all the mainland states.

Vegetation type, spatial distance, and environmental variability represent the three main factors shaping the structure of Glomeromycotinan communities. We present here one of the most comprehensive reports on Glomeromycotinan community structure in forest ecosystems, covering five ecosystem types. We explored the extent to which the latitudinal gradient in Glomeromycotinan diversity is confounded by the respective latitudinal gradient of host plants and how Glomeromycotinan communities diverge with spatial distance and environmental variability. We show that latitudinal differences in Glomeromycotinan α‐ and β‐diversity are largely shaped by the zonation patterns of ecosystem types and that differences among Glomeromycotinan communities occurring in different ecosystems are considerably larger than those occurring within the same ecosystem type. In contrast, we could observe little to no differences in phylogenetic community structure across samples, irrespective of their origin. In conclusion, several community assembly rules for Glomeromycotina in the woody systems, such as phylogenetic relationships, differed from those in grassland systems. Synthesis. We provide strong evidence that the latitudinal gradient in Glomeromycotinan diversity in woody systems is mainly driven by latitudinal differences in forest habitat types. Further exploring the causes of these differences across habitat types would probably reveal underexplored facets of the ecology of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFC0500702cNational Key Research and Development Program of China, Ministry of Science and Technology, P.R.

Some Chlorococcum species, together with the type species C. infusionum, formed a true clade Chlorococcum within the macroclade Moewusinia. Its members were characterized by extremely long ITS2 regions with unusual secondary structure. Other species were found to belong to the Stephanosphaerinia macroclade, and should be reclassified accordingly. The research of authentic strains resulted in revised and enhanced morphological descriptions of N. gelatinosum, C. diplobionticum, C. isabeliense, and C. sphacosum. Proposals on taxonomic revision are based on morphological similarity, 18S rRNA distances, presence of compensatory base changes in ITS2 conserved regions, differences in the secondary structure of the spacer, and differences of the helix III conserved motif.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorococcum 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicroalgae 3amolecular systematics 3apolyphyly 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3ataxonomic revisions1 aMoslalenko, S.

In this paper, chitosan was impregnated with magnetite nanoparticles through a chemical co-precipitation method to fabricate hybrid adsorbents of Fe₃O₄–chitosan. The physicochemical and structural properties of the adsorbent were characterized, and then the performance of the adsorbent was evaluated for fluoride removal from water. The operational factors affecting the adsorption process, including pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage, initial fluoride concentration, and temperature, were studied. Various isotherm and kinetic models were also used to evaluate the fit of the experimental data with the modeled results. The equilibrium data were well described by the Freundlich model. The kinetics of the adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order model. Recycling results suggested that the Fe₃O₄–chitosan particles maintain a great reusability potential for five consecutive cycles. Findings also showed that the Fe₃O₄–chitosan can be easily regenerated via acid treatment. The results of the present work highlighted the potential of using the Fe₃O₄–chitosan magnetic composite for the removal of fluoride from water. In conclusion, Fe₃O₄–chitosan can be considered as an appropriate adsorbent for fluoride removal from water, because it can be separated both quickly and easily, it has high efficiency, and it does not lead to secondary pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid treatment 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abiosorption 3achitosan 3acoprecipitation 3adrinking water 3afluorides 3akinetics 3amagnetite 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apollutants 3apollution 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature1 aKakavandi, Babak1 aKalantary, Roshanak Rezaei1 aĀz̲arī, ʻAlī,1 aKeramati, Azam0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 28, v. 5, no. 89 p.73279-73289dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra11294j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011900160300001800279500002000297520163200317592002801949650001701977650001901994650002102013650002202034650001102056650003302067650001302100650000902113650001602122650001702138650001502155650001102170650002502181650001502206650001202221700001902233700002002252700001602272700002002288773013902308856007302447852000902520655001202529IND60651675820221121080819.0190712e20141010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065167582DNAL7 a10.3390/su61070132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmbrosini, Dario10aEvaluating Mitigation Effects of Urban Heat Islands in a Historical Small Center with the ENVI-Met® Climate Model  ap. 7013-7029.  aJournal Article  aUrban morphology and increasing building density play a key role in the overall use of energy and promotion of environmental sustainability. The urban environment causes a local increase of temperature, a phenomenon known as Urban Heat Island (UHI). The purpose of this work is the study of the possible formation of an UHI and the evaluation of its magnitude, in the context of a small city, carried out with the ENVI-met® software. For this purpose, a simulation was needed, and this simulation is preparatory for a monitoring campaign on site, which will be held in the immediate future. ENVI-met® simulates the temporal evolution of several thermodynamics parameters on a micro-scale range, creating a 3D, non-hydrostatic model of the interactions between building-atmosphere-vegetation. The weather conditions applied simulate a typical Italian summer heat wave. Three different case-studies have been analyzed: Base Case, Cool Case and Green Case. Analysis of the actual state in the Base Case shows how even in an area with average building density, such as the old town center of a small city, fully developed UHI may rise with strong thermal gradients between built areas and open zones with plenty of vegetation. These gradients arise in a really tiny space (few hundreds of meters), showing that the influence of urban geometry can be decisive in the characterization of local microclimate. Simulations, carried out considering the application of green or cool roofs, showed small relevant effects as they become evident only in large areas heavily built up (metropolis) subject to more intense climate conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate models 3aclimatic factors 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3aenvironmental sustainability 3ageometry 3aheat 3aheat island 3amicroclimate 3amonitoring 3asummer 3atemperature profiles 3avegetation 3aweather1 aGalli, Giorgio1 aMancini, Biagio1 aNardi, Iole1 aSfarra, Stefano0 tSustainability.g2014 Oct. 10, v. 6, no. 10 p.7013-7029dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su61070133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245015000175300001600325520146400341592002801805650001201833650001701845650002101862650002001883650001201903650001301915650002201928650001501950650001601965650001301981650001101994650001502005650001602020651001102036653003102047653001102078653001902089653001602108653001902124653001202143653001902155700002902174700002402203700003002227773010102257856008402358852000902442655001202451IND60133106920221120222503.0150518e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013310692DNAL7 a10.1080/17550874.2014.9049512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiedrzyński, Marcin10aRegional climate and geology affecting habitat availability for a relict plant in a plain landscape: the case of Festuca amethystina L. in Poland  ap. 331-341.  aBackground: The distribution of refugial habitats is the main factor affecting the existence of cold-adapted species in the lowlands. In addition, regional climatic conditions could have an influence on relicts. Aims: Co-occurrence of environmental factors in the determination of the distribution of the glacial relict Festuca amethystina was examined in Poland. Methods: Climatic data, habitat indicator species, parent material of soils and range of glaciations were analysed, using ecological niche modelling. Prediction of Festuca amethystina occurrence for different sets of data – only climatic, only habitat and all data – was modelled. Results: The distribution of Festuca amethystina was related to the presence of oak forests (Potentillo albae-Quercetum), to moderate subcontinental climate, but not to the distribution of loess soils. In addition, variables related to temperature and precipitation in the driest quarter of the year, isothermality and a mean diurnal range had the strongest influence on the occurrence of F. amethystina within the Potentillo-Quercetum range. Conclusions: Climate acts as a regional filter and habitat availability as a local filter for distribution of the species. Therefore, the habitat can act as microrefugium in some parts of its range. In a flat landscape, relicts can persist where environmental conditions are simultaneously favourable for the persistence of refugial vegetation and relict populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca 3abiogeography 3aclimatic factors 3adata collection 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aindicator species 3alandscapes 3aloess soils 3alowlands 3amodels 3aprediction 3atemperature 3aPoland 0aecological niche modelling 0aMaxent 0amountain plant 0aoak forests 0aprediction map 0arefugia 0arelict species1 aZielińska, Katarzyna M.1 aKiedrzyńska, Edyta1 aJakubowska-Gabara, Janina0 tPlant ecology & diversity.g2015 May 4, v. 8, no. 3 p.331-341dTaylor & Francisx1755-16687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17550874.2014.9049513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010200172300001600274520151600290592002801806650002301834650001801857650002001875650001201895650001201907650002601919650001901945650001701964650001901981650001102000650001102011650001302022650001602035650001002051650001702061651001402078653001402092653002202106653000802128653001202136653001402148700002702162700002502189700002002214773010102234856008402335852000902419655001202428IND60133107020221121070107.0150518e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013310702DNAL7 a10.1080/17550874.2014.9803502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadad, Martín A.10aAge effects on the climatic signal in Araucaria araucana from xeric sites in Patagonia, Argentina  ap. 343-351.  aBackground: At different cambial ages, trees experience changes in their structure and interactions with environmental conditions. Reciprocal mechanisms between tree age and physical resources, photosynthetic rates, and xylem production may influence hydraulic resistance and plant water stress. However, it is yet uncertain how these mechanisms are associated with changes in growth sensitivity to biophysical drivers, especially climate. Aim: To establish age-associated climate – growth relationships in growth rings of Araucaria araucana trees from the temperate xeric zones of northern Patagonia, Argentina. Methods: We analysed the growth in 211 A. araucana trees from four sampling sites, in three age classes: young (≤120 years), mature (121–275 years), and old (≥276 years). We explored the correlations between the signal strength of tree growth and climate, based on comparisons between each age-class chronology and monthly mean surface air temperature, total precipitation, and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index. Results: The young trees showed higher correlations when their growth was compared with precipitation, air temperature, and the SAM index during austral spring and summer months of the same year. In contrast, growth in mature and old trees showed higher correlations with summer temperatures of the previous growing season. Conclusions: The sensitivity of the radial-growth response of A. araucana to climate varies with age and is strongest in the rings of young trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraucaria araucana 3aage structure 3aair temperature 3acambium 3aclimate 3aenvironmental factors 3agrowing season 3agrowth rings 3aphotosynthesis 3aspring 3asummer 3atree age 3atree growth 3atrees 3awater stress 3aArgentina 0aage class 0adendroclimatology 0aSAM 0apehuén 0atree-ring1 aRoig Juñent, Fidel A.1 aBoninsegna, José A.1 aPatón, Daniel,0 tPlant ecology & diversity.g2015 May 4, v. 8, no. 3 p.343-351dTaylor & Francisx1755-16687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17550874.2014.9803503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009000156300002000246520087200266592002801138650002001166650002801186650002701214650001801241650002001259650001001279650001301289650001301302650001901315650002201334650001301356650001301369650001101382700001401393700001401407700001601421700001201437700001701449700001701466700001701483700001601500773012501516856007401641852000901715655001201724IND60669071120221116200232.0190920e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066907112DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra11297d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Qiang10aBiodegradable polymer–platinum drug conjugates to overcome platinum drug resistance  ap. 83343-83349.  aDrug resistance and severe dose-dependent side effects are the major obstacles to the further use of platinum agents. Two well-acknowledged mechanisms of resistance are the decreased intracellular accumulation and the increased sulfur-binding-detoxification of platinum agents. The polymer–drug conjugate approach can remarkably enhance the uptake of substances by cancer cells, therefore can achieve better anticancer effects with lower dosage, and thus reduce the dose-dependent side effects. Here we synthesized a biodegradable polymer containing pendant 1,2-bidentate carboxyl groups to chelate platinum without introducing sulfur atoms to potentially detoxify the platinum drugs. The polymer–platinum conjugate formed nanomicelles showed significantly increased intracellular accumulation and could partially overcome drug resistance in ovarian cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantineoplastic activity 3abiodegradable products 3adose response 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3amicelles 3amoieties 3aneoplasm cells 3aovarian neoplasms 3aplatinum 3apolymers 3asulfur1 aQi, Ruogu1 aCai, Jing1 aKang, Xiang1 aSun, Si1 aXiao, Haihua1 aJing, Xiabin1 aLi, Wenliang1 aWang, Zehua0 tRSC advances.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 5, no. 101 p.83343-83349dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra11297d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03709naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111024002000148040001800168072000900186100002000195245017600215300001800391500002400409520175300433650002302186650002402209650001902233650001902252650001502271650002602286650001902312650002702331650001302358650001602371650000802387650001102395650001402406650001202420650002302432650002402455650002902479650002802508650001702536650001002553650000902563650001602572650001602588650001702604653002502621700002002646773012602666852000902792856011102801856008702912930003302999945002503032946001303057961001303070655001203083IND4375149820221116193710.0051012e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437514982DNAL7 a161565612pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-98.4.11162doi7 a10113/15342hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8511 aArmstrong, J.W.10aEffects of methyl bromide concentration, fumigation time, and fumigation temperature on Mediterranean and oriental fruit fly (Diptera: Tephritidae) egg and larval survival  ap. 1116-1125.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of methyl bromide (MB) concentration (16, 32, 48, or 64 g/m3), fumigation temperature (15, 20, 25, or 30 degrees C), and fumigation time interactions on the survival of Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), and oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae), eggs and first and third instars were recorded. Increasing the fumigation temperature from 15 to 20 degrees C or from 20 to 25 degrees C resulted in a significant reduction in fumigation time required for equivalent egg and larval mortalities at all studied MB concentrations; no further reductions in fumigation time resulted from increasing the temperature from 25 to 30 degrees C. Conversely, increasing temperature and time allowed for a reduction in MB concentration to obtain equivalent mortality. Thus, the optimum fumigation temperature for Mediterranean and oriental fruit fly eggs and larvae was 25 degrees C. Reducing MB concentrations required for phytosanitary fumigations would save time and expense, and reduce the amount of MB released into the atmosphere during aeration. Mediterranean fruit fly was as or more tolerant to MB than oriental fruit fly in MB tolerance for eggs and first instars. The egg stage was generally more tolerant to MB regardless of concentration. However, Mediterranean fruit fly eggs showed similar tolerance to first instars at 25 degrees C for the three highest concentrations and to third instars at 25 and 30 degrees C for the highest concentration, with no significant difference between them. Therefore, eggs alone can be used to obtain MB fumigation efficacy and quarantine security data at fumigation temperatures between 15 and 30 degrees C for Mediterranean and oriental fruit fly. 3aCeratitis capitata 3aBactrocera dorsalis 3ainsect control 3adisinfestation 3afumigation 3afumigant insecticides 3amethyl bromide 3achemical concentration 3aduration 3atemperature 3aova 3alarvae 3amortality 2aAnimals 2aCeratitis capitata 2aFumigationxmethods 2aHydrocarbons, Brominated 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aInsecticides 2aLarva 2aOvum 2aTemperature 2aTephritidae 2aTime Factors 0afumigation tolerance1 aWhitehand, L.C.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2005 Aug., v.  98, no.  4 p.1116-1125dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/15343Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-98.4.11163Available from publisher's Web site  a20070731b20070902c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/11/10  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02490naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245007900165300001800244520106300262592002801325650001701353650001701370650001301387650001201400650001001412650001501422650001601437650001601453650001001469653002501479653001301504653001701517653001801534653001301552653001801565653001601583653003001599653001401629700002301643700006101666700005701727773014701784856008001931852000902011655001202020IND60645988620221118054646.0190605e20190514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064598862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b013152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmitt, Sarah10aHemisynthesis of Anthocyanin Phase II Metabolites by Porcine Liver Enzymes  ap. 6177-6189.  aThe aim of this work was to obtain phase II metabolites of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and its aglycone using porcine liver enzymes. For this purpose, anthocyanins extracted from blackberry concentrate and containing mostly cyanidin-3-O-glucoside were incubated with the S9, microsomal, and cytosolic fractions of porcine liver. The reactions were targeted to the direction of the respective phase II transformation by the addition of activated cofactors. LC-MSⁿ and LC-IMS-QTOF-MS analyses showed that one methylated, three glucuronidated and three sulfated metabolites of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside were generated. The aglycone, cyanidin, was sulfated and glucuronidated by the liver enzymes. In addition, both were glucuronidated and methylated simultaneously. The detected compounds and the generated data like exact masses, mass spectra, and CCS values may serve as a basis in the search for metabolites formed in vivo. As their effects are largely unexplored, the described synthesis may contribute to a better understanding of the metabolism of anthocyanins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3ablackberries 3acyanidin 3aenzymes 3aliver 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amethylation 3aswine 0aphase II metabolites 0acyanidin 0aanthocyanins 0aporcine liver 0ain vitro 0ahemisynthesis 0apolyphenols 0aion mobility spectrometry 0aCCS value1 aTratzka, Sebastian1 aSchieber, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1082-95471 aPasson, Maike1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0002-29420 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 May 14, v. 67, no. 22 p.6177-6189dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b013153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01554naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013300162300001800295500001900313520026500332592002800597650001900625650001600644650001600660650001200676650001400688700002100702700001800723700001500741700002000756700001900776700001900795700002000814700002100834700002800855700002200883700002200905773012200927856007401049852000901123655001201132IND60681909920221119133714.0200121e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068190992DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra09133e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Lamiaa M.

For this reason cereal breeders, are constantly searching for new genetic sources of minerals that are essential in human nutrition. Triticum polonicum, which is grown on a small scale in Spain, southern Italy, Algeria, Ethiopia and warm regions of Asia, deserves special attention in this context. The micronutrient and macronutrient content of T. polonicum versus T. durum and T. aestivum was compared in this study. Polish wheat grain was characterized by the significantly highest content of phosphorus (4.55 g/kg), sulphur (1.82 g/kg), magnesium (1.42 g/kg), zinc (49.5 mg/kg), iron (39.1 mg/kg) and boron (0.56 mg/kg) as well as a low content of aluminium (only 1.04 mg/kg). The macronutrient profile of most T. polonicum lines differed completely from that of common wheat and durum wheat. The principal component analysis supported discrimination of seven Polish wheat lines with a particularly beneficial micronutrient profile (P2, P3, P5, P7, P9, P22 and P25). These lines were characterized by the highest content of copper, iron and zinc, as well as the lowest concentrations of strontium, aluminium and barium which are undesirable in food products. The above lines can be potentially applied as source materials for breeding new wheat varieties. The results of this study indicate that Polish wheat could be used in genetic biofortification of durum wheat and common wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3aaluminum 3abarium 3abiofortification 3aboron 3abreeding 3acopper 3acultivars 3adurum wheat 3afoods 3ahuman nutrition 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amineral content 3aminerals 3aphosphorus 3aprincipal component analysis 3aselenium 3astrontium 3asulfur 3azinc 3aAlgeria 3aAsia 3aEthiopia 3aItaly 3aSpain 0amicroelements 0amultivariate analysis 0aPolish wheat1 aSuchowilska, Elżbieta1 aKandler, Wolfgang1 aKrska, R.q(Rudolf),1 aWiwart, Marian0 tPlant genetic resources.g2019 June, v. 17, no. 3 p.213-220dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl4078550x1479-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14792621180003943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245018400178300001600362520159100378592002801969650002301997650001902020650001202039650002302051650001202074650001202086650001302098650001102111650001502122650001102137650000902148650000902157650001102166650001402177650001402191650001102205650001302216650001902229650000902248650001002257650002902267650001002296650001902306650000902325700002002334700002302354700002802377700002002405773011002425856008102535852000902616655001202625IND50089132620221116165550.0160312e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008913262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-014-2058-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVondráčková, Stanislava10aSoil chemical properties affect the concentration of elements (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and their distribution between organs of Rumex obtusifolius  ap. 231-245.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: The ionome (elemental composition) of grassland species has rarely been studied at the level of individual organs and little is known about effects of soil chemical properties on the ionome. Using the model oxalate plant Rumex obtusifolius, we asked how its biomass production and the distribution of elements between its organs is affected by soil chemical properties. METHODS: We established a pot experiment with R. obtusifolius planted in acidic non-contaminated control and in slightly acidic and alkaline soils anthropogenically contaminated by the risk elements As, Cd, Pb, and Zn. Both contaminated soils were untreated and treated by lime and superphosphate. We determined biomass production and the concentrations of elements in its organs. RESULTS: Biomass production was negatively related to the mobility of micro- and risk elements. Restricted transport of micro- and risk elements from belowground organs into leaves was recorded in untreated contaminated soils. In both lime-treated soils and in superphosphate-treated alkaline soil, elevated transport of micro- and risk elements from belowground organs into leaves was recorded in comparison to untreated contaminated soils. The lowest concentrations of micro- and risk elements were recorded in stems and seeds, followed by belowground organs and leaves. CONCLUSIONS: R. obtusifolius is an As-, Cd-, Pb-, and Zn-excluder and is sensitive to high availability of micro- and risk elements in the soil. Soil chemical properties affect the distribution of essential elements within the plant greatly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRumex obtusifolius 3aalkaline soils 3aarsenic 3abiomass production 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achromium 3acopper 3agrasslands 3aionome 3airon 3alead 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anickel 3aplanting 3apolluted soils 3arisk 3aseeds 3asoil chemical properties 3astems 3asuperphosphate 3azinc1 aHejcman, Michal1 aSzáková, Jiřina1 aMüllerová, Vladimíra1 aTlustoš, Pavel0 tPlant and soil.g2014 June, v. 379, no. 1-2 p.231-245dSpringer International Publishingx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2058-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011400166300001600280520122000296592002801516650002701544650001401571650002001585650001901605650001401624650002001638650001701658650002001675650001301695650001501708650002401723650001401747650001801761650001301779653001401792653001301806653001301819653001501832700001901847700001801866700001701884700002001901773009901921856008502020852000902105655001202114IND60693042820221122103548.0200504e20190504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069304282DNAL7 a10.1080/17597269.2016.11875432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinesh, K.10aBiodiesel production using Calophyllum inophyllum (Tamanu) seed oil and its compatibility test in a CI engine  ap. 347-353.  aTamanu-based biodiesel can be used as a non-conventional fuel blended with conventional fuel in a compression ignition engine without any need for modification in engine design. The three main processes involved in production of biodiesel are removal of OH group by H₂SO₄ (acid) and KOH (base), and removal of soapy water. The molar ratios tried in this process were 4:1 to 10:1 and the yield was maximum at 6:1 (86.15%). In this present study, production of biodiesel from Tamanu oilseeds, its performance analysis and emission characteristics in a CI engine were extensively studied. Prepared Tamanu-based biodiesel was used in a four-stroke CI engine and performance analysis was done. The blend proportions used in the diesel engine were 10–40 wt.% biodiesel (B10, B20, B30 and B40). Analysis of emissions such as NOX, CO, and HC from a CI engine has shown that the biodiesel blends produced fewer emissions than that of commercial diesel. Results revealed that there is a substantial reduction of emissions and an increase in performance of the biodiesel blends tested. Moreover, the amounts of toxic pollutants emitted from the biodiesel blends are significantly less when compared to commercial diesel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalophyllum inophyllum 3abiodiesel 3acarbon monoxide 3adiesel engines 3aemissions 3afuel production 3ahydrocarbons 3anitrogen oxides 3aoilseeds 3apollutants 3apotassium hydroxide 3aseed oils 3asulfuric acid 3atoxicity 0aCI engine 0aemission 0aglycerol 0aTamanu oil1 aTamilvanan, A.1 aVaishnavi, S.1 aGopinath, M.1 aMohan, K.S.

Aim: We tested whether rock outcrops of southern temperate latitudes could act as local refugia for a cold-adapted flora in the face of global warming. Methods: We related species composition of 50 outcrops and that of their surrounding vegetation to climatic data at local and regional scales to establish whether species distributions reflected differences that could indicate the existence of climatic refugia. Results: While at a regional scale, species composition of the outcrops across the study area was related to mean annual precipitation and mean annual maximum temperature, locally, southern faces of outcrops had different species and lower maximum temperatures than insolated north faces and surrounding vegetation plots. Conclusions: South faces of outcrops by providing cool microhabitats, and currently harbouring species not found in the surrounding zonal vegetation matrix, could serve as local refugia for heat-intolerant plants and other microthermic organism. The degree of ‘stability’ of these refugia will depend on the degree of future change in climate. Therefore, it is important to plan protected area networks that maximise local environmental heterogeneity, including the protection of rock outcrops both as refugia for cold-adapted species and as potential stepping stones that would allow dispersal of these species between supportive environments through unfavourable ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aflora 3aglobal warming 3alatitude 3amicrohabitats 3aplanning 3arefuge habitats 3aspecies dispersal 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3avegetation 3aArgentina 0aclimate change 0amicroclimate 0arefugia 0arock outcrops 0aspecies composition1 aEzcurra, Cecilia0 tPlant ecology & diversity.g2015 May 4, v. 8, no. 3 p.353-361dTaylor & Francisx1755-16687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17550874.2014.9832003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245010400164300001600268520111400284592002801398650001201426650001001438650000901448650001101457650001101468650002401479650002001503650002401523650001701547650001101564653002201575653001101597653001401608653002401622700002701646700001901673700002101692700001901713773012401732856007901856852000901935655001201944IND60558030020221117231539.0161106e20160918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055803002DNAL7 a10.1515/pjfns-2016-00072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadivec, Mirta10aModelling the Colour of Strawberry Spread During Storage, Including Effects of Technical Variations  ap. 271-276.  aThe colour of freshly processed strawberry spread changes relatively rapidly from a bright red to a dull red, which then makes its appearance generally less acceptable for consumers. The colours of strawberry spreads following several processing conditions were measured under different storage conditions. Additional sugar and colorant had only slight effects on the colour decay, while exclusion of oxygen and daylight did not affect this process. The only condition that clearly maintained the freshly processed appearance was storage at 4°C. Hexagonal bottles were filled with the strawberry spreads and their colour was repeatedly measured at the six sides of the bottles, using a Minolta chroma meter. Data were analysed using non-linear indexed regression analysis based on a logistic function for the three colour aspect of a*, b* and L*. This technology allowed the determination of the variation in these data in terms of improved reliability (R²ₐdⱼ, >90%). It also allowed better interpretation of the processes involved. All variations in the data could be attributed to technical variation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottles 3acolor 3adyes 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aregression analysis 3asolar radiation 3astorage temperature 3astrawberries 3asugars 0astrawberry spread 0acolour 0amodelling 0atechnical variation1 aTijskens, Leopold M.M.1 aKopjar, Mirela1 aSimčič, Marjan1 aPožrl, Tomaž0 tPolish journal of food and nutrition sciences.g2016 Sept. 18, v. 66, no. 4 p.271-276dDe Gruyter Openx2083-60077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pjfns-2016-00073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245019700168300002000365520152000385592002801905650004401933650001501977650001501992650002902007650002202036650002002058650001502078650002002093650001702113650002402130650001502154650006602169650001702235650004202252650001502294650001702309650002402326650003702350650002102387700001602408773012502424856007402549852000902623655001202632IND60669071420221116200328.0190920e20150909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066907142DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra11301f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdelhamid, Hani Nasser10aSynthesis and characterization of quantum dots for application in laser soft desorption/ionization mass spectrometry to detect labile metal–drug interactions and their antibacterial activity  ap. 76107-76115.  aSynthesis and characterization of quantum dot modified mercaptopropionic acid (CdS@MPA) and its application in laser soft desorption/ionization for labile metal–drug interactions is reported. CdS@MPA was synthesised via a hydrothermal method and characterized using TEM, UV-vis absorption, fluorescence, and FTIR spectroscopy. These tiny nanocrystals (<5 nm) provide a large surface area and a UV-vis absorption that is a good match with the N₂ laser (337 nm) of matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Thus, they softly desorb/ionize labile metallodrugs without destroying the weak noncovalent bonds between the drug and the heavy transition metals (HTMs). Because of the UV absorption at 337 nm and large surface area, the present technique is coined as quantum enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (QELDI-MS). Detection of the interactions of HTMs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in aqueous solution is critical because these coordinations are weak and labile in the acid solution of conventional matrices. QELDI-MS presented a high performance and low limit of detection (0.5 μL, 0.1–0.5 mM) for metallodrug detection in aqueous solution. The antibacterial activities of the metallodrugs against pathogenic bacteria were investigated using optical density (OD₆₀₀), cell counting and proteomics analysis. Simple detection of the metallodrug in aqueous solution is promising for environmental, biological and analytical concerns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3aantibacterial properties 3aaqueous solutions 3acadmium sulfide 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3ahot water treatment 3aionization 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3ananocrystals 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3aproteomics 3aquantum dots 3atransition elements 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3avirulent strains1 aWu, Hui-Fen0 tRSC advances.g2015 Sept. 09, v. 5, no. 93 p.76107-76115dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra11301f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011500161300001800276500001900294520135900313592002801672650001501700650002301715650001501738650002101753650002101774650001801795700002101813700001801834700001901852773012201871856007401993852000902067655001202076IND60681910220221121065106.0200121e20200114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068191022DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra09243a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoosefian, Mehdi10aUltra-low concentration protein detection based on phenylalanine–Pd/SWCNT as a high sensitivity nanoreceptor  ap. 2650-2660.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPd doped single-walled carbon nanotubes as an enhanced physical transducer with phenylalanine amino acid can be efficiently used as a biocompatible nanoreceptor to detect proteins. DFT/B3LYP was used to calculate the optimized geometries, energies and electron density parameters to determine the stability and reactivity of the nanoreceptor. Among different adsorbed configurations of phenylalanine, the amine and carboxylic acid sites have higher adsorption energies and more stable complexes. With direct strong chemical adsorption of phenylalanine amino acid onto the Pd doped single-walled carbon nanotube, the free active carboxylic acid group of the amino acid can react with free amine groups on the surface of the proteins. More over the π–π stacking interaction between the free aromatic ring of adsorbed phenylalanine amino acid onto the functionalized single-walled carbon nanotube and the aromatic rings of the proteins also contributes to the intelligent detection of proteins. Frontier molecular orbital and molecular electrostatic potential (MPE) surface studies have been employed to investigate the active sites of the nanoreceptor. The effects of different solvents on the structural and electronic properties were investigated. Finally, in order to investigate biological function of the biosensor, docking studies were performed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaromatic compounds 3abiosensors 3acarbon nanotubes 3acarboxylic acids 3aphenylalanine1 aEtminan, Nazanin1 aJuan, Alfredo1 aMirhaji, Elnaz0 tRSC advances.g2020 Jan. 14, v. 10, no. 5 p.2650-2660dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra09243a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002000188245013300208300001100341506007600352520139000428592002801818596011701846506003701963650001702000650001602017650001202033650001202045650002202057650001802079650001202097650002502109650001402134650001002148650001402158650001202172650000902184650001202193700001802205700002002223700001402243700001902257700001402276773010802290856008202398852000902480655001202489IND60585159620221207074051.0220112e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058515962DNAL7 a291188172pmid7 aPMC56674582pmcid7 a10.1186/s12986-017-0222-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yan-Hong10aMaternal high-fat diet impairs glucose metabolism, β-cell function and proliferation in the second generation of offspring rats  ap. 67.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the impact of perinatal high-fat (HF) diet in female Sprague-Dawley rats (F0) on glucose metabolism and islet function in their early life of second-generation of offspring (F2). METHODS: F0 rats were fed with a standard chow (SC) or HF diet for 8 weeks before mating, up to termination of lactation for their first-generation of offspring (F1-SC and F1-HF). F1 females were mated with normal males at the age of week 11, and producing F2 offspring (F2-SC, F2-HF). All the offspring were fed SC diet after weaning for 3 weeks. The glucose level and islet function of F2 offspring were assessed at the age of week 3 and 12. RESULTS: The F2-HF offspring had a high birth weight and maintained a higher body mass at the age of week 3 and 12, along with an impaired glucose tolerance and lower serum insulin levels compared with the F2-SC. β-cell proliferation was also impaired in the islets of F2-HF rats at the age of week 3 and 12. The pancreatic and duodenal homeobox factor-1 (Pdx1) and Neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD1) expressions were decreased in the islet of F2-HF rats at the age of week 12. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal HF diet during pre-gestation, gestation, and lactation in rats could result in the increased body weight and glucose intolerance in their early life of F2 offspring due to impaired β-cell function and proliferation.  aPublisher supplied data  a11XJ21037cThis research was supported by Science Foundation of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abirth weight 3ablood serum 3afemales 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ahigh fat diet 3ainsulin 3aislets of Langerhans 3alactation 3amales 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3arats 3aweaning1 aYe, Ting-Ting1 aLiu, Chong-Xiao1 aWang, Lei1 aChen, Yuan-Wen1 aDong, Yan0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2017 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.67-67dBioMed CentralwJournal:2211x1743-70757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12986-017-0222-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012200170300001800292520135100310592002801661650002201689650002301711650001501734650002301749650001301772650001501785650003701800650001001837650001301847650001201860650001401872650001501886650003301901650001601934700005801950700001602008700001802024700001802042773011902060856008702179852000902266655001202275IND60686832020221120225907.0200319e20200221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068683202DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b044712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Zhenzhe10aEffect of Sludge-Based Additive on Ash Characteristic and Potassium Fixation during the Rice Straw Combustion Process  ap. 3367-3375.  aThe effects of a sludge-based additive (mainly composed of calcium phosphate) on the retention of potassium in bottom ash and ash melting characteristics during rice straw (RS) combustion were studied with a bench-scale tube furnace reactor at the reaction temperatures of 600, 700, 800, and 900 °C. The potassium content in bottom ash and ash composition characteristics were analyzed using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). The results showed that the addition of sludge-based additive into rice straw at a mass fraction of 2.5–7.5% could effectively improve the potassium fixation rate and retain potassium in the bottom ash during combustion process by the formation of potassium aluminosilicates and K–Ca–P compounds. The ash melting characteristic was enhanced and the sintering of bottom ash was prevented by the addition of sludge-based additive. For instance, the soft temperature (ST) of RS was enhanced by 238 °C for the case of addition of 5.0% sludge-based additive into RS. In general, addition of sludge-based additive into RS with high potassium and chlorine contents was predicted to significantly increase the retention capacity of potassium as well as improve the melting characteristics of bottom ash.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaluminum silicates 3abottom ash 3acalcium phosphates 3achlorine 3acombustion 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afuels 3afurnaces 3amelting 3apotassium 3arice straw 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature1 aZhang, Shuping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7484-20301 aLiu, Xinzhi1 aZhang, Houlei1 aZhu, Shuguang0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Feb. 21, v. 34, no. 3 p.3367-3375dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b044713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245008300170300001600253520194100269592002802210650002202238650001202260650001702272650001502289650001202304650001402316650002202330650002602352650001302378650001902391650002002410650001202430650001102442650001002453650001702463650002502480700001902505700002002524700002002544773009602564856004802660852000902708655001202717IND4476227220221120191001.0121003e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447622722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-011-0280-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabel, Jan Christian10aLandscape genetics of a recent population extirpation in a burnet moth species  ap. 247-255.  aThe intensification of agricultural land use over wide parts of Europe has led to the decline of semi-natural habitats, such as extensively used meadows, with those that remain often being small and isolated. These rapid changes in land use during recent decades have strongly affected populations inhabiting these ecosystems. Increasing habitat deterioration and declining permeability of the surrounding landscape matrix disrupt the gene flow within metapopulations. The burnet moth species Zygaena loti has suffered strongly from recent habitat fragmentation, as reflected by its declining abundance. We have studied its population genetic structure and found a high level of genetic diversity in some of the populations analysed, while others display low genetic diversity and a lack of heterozygosity. Zygaena loti was formerly highly abundant in meadows and along the skirts of forests. However, the species is currently restricted to isolated habitat remnants, which is reflected by the high genetic divergence among populations (F ST: 0.136). Species distribution modelling as well as the spatial examination of panmictic clusters within the study area strongly support a scattered population structure for this species. We suggest that populations with a high level of genetic diversity still represent the former genetic structure of interconnected populations, while populations with low numbers of alleles, high F IS values, and a lack of heterozygosity display the negative effects of reduced interconnectivity. A continuous exchange of individuals is necessary to maintain high genetic variability. Based on these results, we draw the general conclusion that more common taxa with originally large population networks and high genetic diversity suffer stronger from sudden habitat fragmentation than highly specialised species with lower genetic diversity which have persisted in isolated patches for long periods of time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aalleles 3abiogeography 3aecosystems 3aforests 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3aheterozygosity 3aland use change 3ameadows 3amodels 3amoths 3apermeability 3apopulation structure1 aEngler, Jan O.1 aRödder, Dennis1 aSchmitt, Thomas0 tConservation genetics.g2012 Feb., v. 13, no. 1 p.247-255dSpringer-Verlagx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-011-0280-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245014200162300001800304520112200322592002801444650002301472650001701495650001201512650001001524650002401534650002101558650001901579650002801598650001801626650001701644650003001661650001201691650001601703650000901719650003101728650002701759650001501786650002801801650001201829650001901841653002701860653002501887653001901912653001601931653001001947700001701957700001601974700001701990700001902007700001702026700001202043700001302055700001502068700001402083700002002097700001702117700005402134773014702188856008002335852000902415655001202424IND60645988920221118054737.0190605e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064598892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b014362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Yuan,10aApoE-Dependent Protective Effects of Sesamol on High-Fat Diet-Induced Behavioral Disorders: Regulation of the Microbiome-Gut–Brain Axis  ap. 6190-6201.  aSesamol, an antioxidant lignan from sesame oil, possesses neuroprotective bioactivities. The present work was aimed to elucidate the systemic protective effects of sesamol on cognitive deficits and to determine the possible link between gut and brain. Wildtype and ApoE–/– mice were treated with a high-fat diet and sesamol (0.05%, w/v, in drinking water) for 10 weeks. Behavioral tests including Morris-water maze, Y-maze, and elevated plus maze tests indicated that sesamol could only improve cognitive deficits and anxiety behaviors in wildtype. Consistently, sesamol improved synapse ultrastructure and inhibited Aβ accumulation in an ApoE-dependent manner. Moreover, sesamol prevented dietary-induced gut barrier damages and systemic inflammation. Sesamol also reshaped gut microbiome and improved the generation of microbial metabolites short-chain fatty acids. To summarize, this study revealed that the possible mechanism of neuroprotective effects of sesamol might be ApoE-dependent, and its beneficial effects on gut microbiota/metabolites could be translated into neurodegenerative diseases treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption barrier 3aantioxidants 3aanxiety 3abrain 3acognitive disorders 3adigestive system 3adrinking water 3aelevated plus-maze test 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alignans 3ametabolites 3amice 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneuroprotective effect 3asesame oil 3ashort chain fatty acids 3asynapse 3aultrastructure 0aAlzheimer’s diseases 0apostsynaptic density 0agut microbiota 0aLactococcus 0aSCFAs1 aChu, Chuanqi1 aShi, Rubing1 aCui, Tianlin1 aZhang, Xinglin1 aZhao, Yihang1 aShi, Xu1 aHui, Yan1 aPan, Junru1 aQian, Rui1 aDai, Xiaoshuang1 aLiu, Zhigang1 aLiu, Xuebo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6370-28680 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 May 22, v. 67, no. 22 p.6190-6201dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b014363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245013300168300001800301520148100319592002801800650002001828650002201848650003701870650002301907650001401930650000901944650001801953650001801971650002001989650001202009650002302021650003702044700003402081700001602115700002402131700001702155700001902172773012202191856007402313852000902387655001202396IND60681910320221121065022.0200121e20200114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068191032DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra09244g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGopiraman, Mayakrishnan10aReducing-agent-free facile preparation of Rh-nanoparticles uniformly anchored on onion-like fullerene for catalytic applications  ap. 2545-2559.  aHerein we report a very simple ‘mix and heat’ synthesis of a very fine Rh-nanoparticle loaded carbon fullerene-C60 nanocatalyst (Rh(0)NPs/Fullerene-C60) for the very first time. The preparation method used no reducing agent and capping agent to control the morphology of the nanocatalyst. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results confirmed the uniform decoration of small Rh-nanoparticles on the surface of fullerene-C60. The Rh-content in Rh(0)NPs/Fullerene-C60 was found to be 2.89 wt%. The crystalline properties of Rh(0)NPs/Fullerene-C60 were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The metallic state of Rh-nanoparticles in Rh(0)NPs/Fullerene-C60 was confirmed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). Raman results depicted good interaction between Rh-nanoparticles and fullerene-C60. To our delight, the present Rh(0)NPs/Fullerene-C60 showed excellent catalytic activity in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol with NaBH₄ in water. Very high kₐₚₚ, k′ and TOF values of 82.14 × 10⁻³ min⁻¹, 4107 × 10⁻³ min⁻¹ and 138 min⁻¹, respectively, were calculated for the Rh(0)NPs/Fullerene-C60 catalyzed reduction of 4-nitrophenol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most efficient fullerene-based nanocatalyst for the rapid reduction of 4-nitrophenol reported to date. Moreover, the catalytic activity of Rh(0)NPs/Fullerene-C60 was also tested towards Suzuki cross-coupling reactions. Reusability of the Rh(0)NPs/Fullerene-C60 was also tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuzuki reaction 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acatalytic activity 3afullerene 3aheat 3ananocatalysts 3ap-nitrophenol 3areducing agents 3arhodium 3asodium borohydride 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aSaravanamoorthy, Somasundaram1 aUllah, Sana1 aIlangovan, Andivelu1 aKim, Ick Soo1 aChung, Ill Min0 tRSC advances.g2020 Jan. 14, v. 10, no. 5 p.2545-2559dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra09244g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02267naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009200165300001200257500001900269520102500288592002801313650002301341650001701364650001701381650003301398650001201431650001501443650001701458650001801475700002101493700001801514700001501532700001901547700001601566700002101582700002101603700001801624773011301642856008101755852000901836655001201845IND60637602320221120053913.0190419e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063760232DNAL7 a10.3103/S00954527190100802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoshla, O.

Considerable efforts are invested into understanding all the physiological and genetic aspects of secondary metabolism of J1074 in order to maximize the expression of heterologous BGCs. It has to be noted that the J1074 genome itself is home to numerous (>20) BGCs, whose expression varies widely. Therefore, the identification of the factors limiting the expression of J1074 BGCs might help improve this strain for heterologous expression purposes. As first steps towards this goal, herein we describe the secondary metabolome of J1074 in liquid medium SG2, previously shown by us to support the production of antibacterial and antifungal compounds. We compare the results of metabolomic studies with the transcriptome of J1074 in SG2 after 60 h of growth. Results of our studies are discussed in the context of current knowledge on the J1074 transcriptome and metabolome data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces albus 3abiosynthesis 3acell biology 3aheterologous gene expression 3aliquids 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3atranscriptome1 aRokytskyy, I.

Although their double-membrane structure and primary role as &lsquo;powerhouses of the cell&rsquo; have essentially remained the same for ~2 billion years, they have evolved to regulate other cell functions that contribute to the aging process, such as reactive oxygen species generation, inflammation, senescence, and apoptosis. Biological aging is characterized by buildup of intracellular debris (e.g., oxidative damage, protein aggregates, and lipofuscin), which fuels a &lsquo;vicious cycle&rsquo; of cell/DNA danger response activation (CDR and DDR, respectively), chronic inflammation (&lsquo;inflammaging&rsquo;), and progressive cell deterioration. Therapeutic options that coordinately mitigate age-related declines in mitochondria and organelles involved in quality control, repair, and recycling are therefore highly desirable. Rejuvenation by exercise is a non-pharmacological approach that targets all the major hallmarks of aging and extends both health- and lifespan in modern humans.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aaerobiosis 3aapoptosis 3adeath 3aeukaryotic cells 3aexercise 3ainflammation 3alongevity 3amitochondria 3aprotein aggregates 3aquality control 3areactive oxygen species 3atherapeutics1 aTarnopolsky, Mark  A0 tBiology.g2019 May 11, v. 8, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology80200403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03651naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245012200210300001100332506007600343520219600419592002802615506003702643650003002680650001902710650001202729650002102741650001202762650002002774650001502794650001202809650001202821650001502833650002402848650001602872650001002888651001302898700001802911700001702929700001802946773012702964856008103091852000903172655001203181IND60585159820221207074046.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058515982DNAL7 a10.1186/s13006-017-0137-62doi7 aPMC56690242pmcid7 a291425862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdugna, Bethlihem10aDeterminants of exclusive breastfeeding in infants less than six months of age in Hawassa, an urban setting, Ethiopia  ap. 45.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for the first six months of life. However, the proportion of EBF in Ethiopia is 58%. The EBF practice and factors affecting it have not been studied in Hawassa, Southern Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and determinants of EBF practice among infants less than six months age in Hawassa city, Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 529 mothers with infants aged 0–6 months were involved in this study between November 2015 and January 2016. Trained interviewers collected data from the mothers of the infants. Exclusive breastfeeding was assessed based on infant feeding practice in the prior 24 h. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Infants aged 0–5.9 months were studied with comparable gender composition (51.4% females). The exclusive breastfeeding prevalence was 60.9% (95% CI 56.6, 65.1). Mothers with infants aged 0–1.9 months and 2–3.9 months practiced EBF more likely than mothers with infants aged 4–6 months (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.59; 95% CI 2.07, 6.2) and (AOR 2.08; 95% CI 1.23, 3.5), respectively. Married mothers practiced EBF more likely than singles (AOR 2.04; 95% CI 1.03, 4.06). Housewives practiced EBF more likely than employed mothers (AOR 2.57; 95% CI 1.34, 4.9). Mothers who had a vaginal birth were more likely to practice EBF than mothers who gave birth via Cesarean section (AOR 2.8; 95% CI 1.7, 4.6). Mothers who gave birth at a healthcare facility were more likely to practice EBF than mothers who gave birth at home (AOR 8.8; 95% CI 5.04, 15.4). Mothers without a breast complication practiced exclusive breastfeeding more than mothers with breast complications (AOR 2.05; 95% CI 1.5, 4.1). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a low prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding. Younger infants, babies born to married women, who are housewives, having a vaginal birth in a health facility, and whose mother’s breasts were healthy, were predictors for EBF. The promotion of an institutional delivery, optimal breastfeeding practices, and designing strategies to better support employed mothers are recommended.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWorld Health Organization 3abreast feeding 3abreasts 3acesarean section 3afemales 3ahealth services 3ahomemakers 3ainfants 3amothers 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3aurban areas 3awomen 3aEthiopia1 aTadele, Henok1 aReta, Fekadu1 aBerhan, Yifru0 tInternational breastfeeding journal.g2017 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.45-45dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001833x1746-43587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13006-017-0137-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245012000211300001800331520134200349592002801691650002201719650001501741650002201756650001201778650001201790650001801802650001401820650000901834650001701843650001901860650002901879650002001908650001701928650001601945650002101961700001901982700001702001700001902018700005802037700001802095700002102113700001702134700001802151773011902169856008702288852000902375655001202384IND60686832220221120225929.0200319e20200204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068683222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b044952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei-Hsin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5009-396010aNovel Renewable Double-Energy System for Activated Biochar Production and Thermoelectric Generation from Waste Heat  ap. 3383-3393.  aIn this study, a novel renewable double-energy system, coupling activated biochar production and thermoelectric generation, is conducted and demonstrated. In the installed 13 thermoelectric modules (TEMs), they are partitioned into three groups of 3, 4, and 6 TEMs. The temperature difference across the TEMs depends upon the number of TEMs and is ranked as 3 TEMs > 4 TEMs > 6 TEMs. By harvesting the waste heat from the carbonization of water chestnuts, the greatest mean output power of single TEMs is 14.1 W and the mean output power of the installed 13 TEMs at the carbonization time of 10–30 min is 8.8 W. The higher heating value of produced activated biochar is 28.17 MJ kg–¹, accounting for 42.7% improvement in the calorific value when compared to its untreated counterpart. The analysis also suggests that heavy metals contained in this coal-like renewable solid fuel are fairly low. The activated biochar possesses high hydrophilicity and specific surface area (430 m² g–¹), and a large portion of pore sizes is smaller than 2 nm. The analyses of attenuated total reflectance spectrometry, X-ray diffractometry, and thermogravimetry also clearly indicate the impact of carbonization on the biomass structure. Overall, the produced activated biochar is suitable for an alternative fuel, absorbent, and soil amendment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorbents 3aalternative fuels 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acarbonization 3achestnuts 3aheat 3aheavy metals 3ahydrophilicity 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asoil amendments 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry1 aLee, Kuan-Ting1 aChih, Yi-Kai1 aEng, Chun-Fong1 aLin, Hong-Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9021-31461 aChiou, Yi-Bin1 aCheng, Ching-Lin1 aLin, Yi-Xian1 aChang, Jo-Shu0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Feb. 04, v. 34, no. 3 p.3383-3393dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b044953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245005400166300001600220520170600236592002801942650003701970650002002007650001802027650001902045650001802064650001502082650001702097650001302114650002102127650001002148650001502158650001802173650002102191650002402212650002202236650002302258650001902281650001702300650001402317650002902331650001802360650002002378651001902398653000902417653002202426653001302448653001302461700002202474700002002496700001602516700001402532700001502546773012902561856008102690852000902771655001202780IND60652395920221118004031.0190712e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065239592DNAL7 a10.1017/S14792621180004482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreston, J. M.10aGenetic analysis of a heritage variety collection  ap. 232-244.  aLandraces (including heritage varieties) are an important agrobiodiversity resource offering considerable value as a buffer against crop failures, as a crop for niche markets, and as a source of diversity for crop genetic improvement activities underpinning future food security. Home gardens are reservoirs of landrace diversity, but some of the accessions held in them are vulnerable or threatened with extinction. Those associated with seed saving networks have added security, for example, ca. 800 varieties are stored in the Heritage Seed Library (HSL) of Garden Organic, UK. In this study, Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms-based genetic analysis of accessions held in the HSL was used to (a) demonstrate the range of diversity in the collection, (b) characterize accessions to aid collection management and (c) promote broader use of the collection. In total, 171 accessions were included from six crops: Vicia faba L., Pisum sativum L., Daucus carota L., Cucumis sativus L., Lactuca sativa L. and Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala (DC.) Metzq. Average expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.18 to 0.28 in D. carota; 0.02–0.18 in P. sativum; 0.05–0.18 in L. sativa; 0.15–0.26 in B. oleracea var. acephala; 0.15–0.37 in C. sativus and 0.07–0.36 in V. faba. Genetic diversity and Fₛₜ values generally reflected the breeding system and cultivation history of the different crops. Comparisons of the diversity found in heritage varieties with that found in commercial varieties did not show a consistent pattern. Principal coordinates analysis and Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean cluster analysis were used to identify four potential duplicate accession pairs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea var. sabellica 3aCucumis sativus 3aDaucus carota 3aLactuca sativa 3aPisum sativum 3aVicia faba 3abiodiversity 3abreeding 3acluster analysis 3acrops 3aextinction 3afood security 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3aheirloom varieties 3aheterozygosity 3ahome gardens 3alandraces 3amultidimensional scaling 3aniche markets 3aseed collecting 3aUnited Kingdom 0aAFLP 0agenetic diversity 0aheritage 0alandrace1 aFord-Lloyd, B.

The data for 387 species are grouped by decades from the first one (1751–1760) to the 26th decade (2001–2010). Two peaks of discovery of new species are shown in the first and the 13th (1871–1880) decades. For almost 60%, the type specimens are of Russian origin; others were discovered outside of the discussed area and were found in it later. With consideration of the obtained dynamics, the probability of finding of new species is prognosticated, especially in the families Salmonidae and Gobiidae. A complete list of the discovered fish species is presented by decades, and descriptions are indicated from four prominent Russian reviews. The necessity of unifying of Latin and Russian vertebrate names is emphasized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGobiidae 3aPetromyzontiformes 3aSalmonidae 3afreshwater fish 3anew species 3aprobability 3atype collections 3aRussia 3aUSSR1 aPavlov, D.

In this paper, we carry out a detailed review of data acquired over 2011–2017 in Japanese cedar and cypress plantations, focusing on aerial tree organs, soil layers and tree-to-soil depuration fluxes. To enable comparison and reinforce the consistency between sites, radiological measurements were normalized by the deposit and interpolated onto the same spatio-temporal frame. Despite some (poorly explained) residual variability, we derived a “mean” pattern by log-averaging data among sites. These “mean” results were analysed with the help of a simple mass-balance approach and discussed in the light of post-Fukushima literature. We demonstrated that the activity levels and dynamics in all compartments were consistent and generally well reproduced by the mass balance approach, for values of the interception fraction between 0.7 and 0.85. The analysis indicated that about 5% of the initial deposit remained in the aerial vegetation after 6 years, more than two thirds of intercepted ¹³⁷Cs being transferred to the soil due to throughfall. The simulations indicated that foliar uptake might have contributed between 40% and 100% to the activity transferred to stem wood. The activity concentration in canopy organs rapidly decreased in the first few months then more slowly, according to an effective half-life of about 1.6 years. The activity level in the organic layer peaked in summer 2011 then decreased according to an effective half-life of 2.2 years. After a rapid increase in 2011, the contamination of mineral horizons continued to increase more slowly, 85% of ¹³⁷Cs incoming through the organic layer being retained in the 0–5 cm layer according to a mean residence time longer than in the upper layer (7 against 1.5 years).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptomeria japonica 3aJapan 3aaccidents 3acanopy 3acesium radioisotopes 3adepuration 3aenvironment 3afoliar uptake 3ahalf life 3ameta-analysis 3asoil 3astemwood 3asummer 3athroughfall 3atrees 0aCesium 0aFukushima forests 0aData review 0aDynamic model1 aCalmon, P.1 aHurtevent, P.1 aCoppin, F.0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 750 p.142311-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1423113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04092naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011000173520233100283592002802614650002002642650001702662650002102679650001502700650002502715650001502740650002502755650002002780650001102800650002002811650003002831650002502861650001902886651001902905653003702924653001902961653002402980653002303004653003103027700002303058700001803081700002203099700001303121700002303134700001803157700002303175700002603198700002103224700002503245700002403270700002103294773010503315856008503420852000903505655001203514IND60700068220221121231739.0201025e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070006822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2020.1023932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLitzow, Michael A.10aEvaluating ecosystem change as Gulf of Alaska temperature exceeds the limits of preindustrial variability  aThe Gulf of Alaska experienced extreme temperatures during 2014–2019, including the four warmest years ever observed. The goal of this study is to evaluate the ecological consequences of that warming event, across multiple trophic levels and taxa. We tested for evidence that observed sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies were outside the envelope of natural climate variability in order to evaluate the risk of novel ecosystem configurations. We also tested for state changes in shared trends of climate (n = 11) and biology (n = 48) time series, using a Bayesian implementation of Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA). And we tested for evidence of novel ecological relationships during 2014–2019. We found that 3-year running mean SST anomalies during 2014–2019 were outside the range of anomalies from preindustrial simulations in CMIP5 models, indicating that the combined magnitude and duration of the warming event was outside the range of natural variability. A DFA model of climate variability also returned a shared trend in climate time series that was at unprecedented levels during 2014–2019. However, DFA models fit to biology data did not show shared trends of variability at unprecedented levels, and Hidden Markov Models fit to shared trends from the climate and biology models failed to find evidence of shifts to a new ecosystem state during 2014–2019. Conversely, we did find preliminary indications that community responses to SST variability strengthened during 2014–2019 after decades of a mostly neutral relationship. Tests for nonstationary patterns of shared variability suggest that covariance between SST and other ecologically-important climate variables remained weaker than during the 1970s Pacific Decadal Oscillation shift, suggesting the potential for muted ecological responses to the 2014–2019 event. Finally, we found that recent patterns of community variability appear to be highly dissimilar to those associated with the 1970s event, suggesting the potential for novel community states with continued warming. In summary, we find no evidence for wholesale ecosystem reorganization during 2014–2019, though nonstationary relationships among climate and community variables suggest the ongoing possibility of novel patterns of ecosystem functioning with continued warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3aclimatic factors 3acovariance 3aecological footprint 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3afactor analysis 3amodels 3arisk assessment 3asurface water temperature 3atime series analysis 3atrophic levels 3aGulf of Alaska 0aBayesian Dynamic Factor Analysis 0aClimate change 0aClimate variability 0aEcosystem response 0aNonstationary relationship1 aHunsicker, Mary E.1 aWard, Eric J.1 aAnderson, Sean C.1 aGao, Jin1 aZador, Stephani G.1 aBatten, Sonia1 aDressel, Sherri C.1 aDuffy-Anderson, Janet1 aFergusson, Emily1 aHopcroft, Russell R.1 aLaurel, Benjamin J.1 aO'Malley, Robert0 tProgress in oceanography.g2020 July, v. 186 p.102393-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2020.1023933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01599naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245008800162300001400250500002900264520062300293592002800916650001600944650002000960650001000980651001000990653001401000653001901014653001301033700001601046700001501062773009401077856008101171852000901252655001201261IND60698844520221120212152.0210116e20141119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069884452DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.455.65572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosa, Paolo13aAn annotated checklist of the chrysidid wasps (Hymenoptera, Chrysididae) from China  ap. 1-128.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aAn annotated checklist of the Chinese Chrysididae is provided.

Women’s contribution could markedly promote accomplishment of MSW management strategies, which has been neglected in many developing countries. A cross-sectional study was conducted in two stages: first, a random sample of 384 respondent women was selected from the 22 urban districts of Tehran, then 64 of them were randomly selected and trained face-to-face. The second phase was aimed at determining the effectiveness of face-to-face training and its impact on women’s performance in waste management. In both stages, data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire containing 21 questions in four categories. Chi square (χ²) and Pearson correlation tests were applied to identify the association among variables. Results indicated that 69.6% and 72.9% of the women had adequate knowledge and attitude, respectively, while only 46.0% performed moderate practice on MSW management. Overall, significant association between education level, occupation, and marital status of the women with KAP towards reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery of MSW were yielded (p < 0.05). Adequate knowledge and positive attitude did not necessarily lead to the proper practice in this study. However, face-to-face training positively affected women’s practice in solid waste recycling and source separation. Conducting training programs and motivation of women by municipalities and decision-makers to elevate women’s environmental performance could substantially promote MSW management strategies in developing nations.  aPublisher supplied data 3across-sectional studies 3adecision making 3aeducational status 3aenvironmental performance 3amarital status 3amotivation 3amunicipal solid waste 3aoccupations 3aquestionnaires 3aIran1 aHeir, Azar Vaezi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8541-85151 aTabrizi, Alireza Mikaeili0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 July, v. 192, no. 7 p.481-481dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08445-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245017700165300001600342520169100358592002802049650001202077650001702089650001102106650001902117650001202136650001702148650001302165650001502178650001102193650002402204650000902228650001002237650001002247650002802257650001702285650001102302651001002313653001902323653001602342653002402358653003902382653003902421700001702460700001902477700001402496700001702510773011302527856008602640852000902726655001202735IND60566522820221119183432.0180831e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056652282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.1942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Zhen10aMaterial metabolism and lifecycle impact assessment towards sustainable resource management: A case study of the highway infrastructural system in Shandong Peninsula, China  ap. 195-208.  aThe accelerated construction of general infrastructure with global urbanization necessitates the massive input of materials. The huge material input and waste output throughout the infrastructure's lifecycle have led to severe resource depletion and the accumulation of potential environmental risks. The systematic evaluation of typical infrastructure stocks is very important to study regional resource availability and explore sustainable development modes under intensive human activities. In this study, we build a material stock model for a highway system that is based on the theory of material metabolism. We analysed the scale and structures of the stock and its lifecycle effects in the Shandong Peninsula. The following results are shown: 1) the total material stock in the entire highway system was 1933.57 Mt in 2013, and the six materials with the largest inputs were stones, fly ash, lime, cement, mineral powder and asphalt, which together comprised 99.8% of the stocks; 2) the material-driven impacts mainly originated from production and construction stages, of which the main damage types were fossil fuels, inhalable inorganics, climate change and land use; 3) the end products for highway construction were mainly supplied by Shandong itself. The average transport distance for different materials ranged from 25 to 174 km. Steel, stone and asphalt had a longer transport distance than others; and 4) the top three parameters that largely affected the stocks were the road length, roadway structure, and cross-sectional subgrade structure. The inputs could be largely reduced by appropriately adjusting the structures of roadways and subgrades in low-class roads.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3acase studies 3acement 3aclimate change 3afly ash 3afossil fuels 3aland use 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aresource management 3arisk 3aroads 3asteel 3asustainable development 3aurbanization 3awastes 3aChina 0aHighway system 0aStock study 0aMaterial metabolism 0aLifecycle impact assessment (LCIA) 0aInfrastructure resource management1 aShi, Honghua1 aZhang, Peidong1 aJi, Yuan,1 aFeng, Aiping0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 June 01, v. 153 p.195-208dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.1943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010100164520123500265592002801500650001001528650002301538650001901561650001901580650002201599650001101621650001601632650003201648650001601680651001001696653003101706653004701737653003501784700001901819700005201838700001901890700001601909700001701925773011601942856008502058852000902143655001202152IND60759658520221117062419.0220118e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075965852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1199472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Hong10aClimate-sensitive diameter distribution models of larch plantations in north and northeast China  aTree diameter distribution models are important tools for forest management decision making. Climate change will affect tree growth and thus diameter distribution. However, there is lack of diameter distribution models describing the effects of climate. The paper developed a climate-sensitive diameter distribution model based on 193 sample plots of larch plantations in north and northeast China. Weibull distribution model was modified by a compatible simultaneous system and the percentile-based parameter recovery method with the inclusion of climate variables. The results showed that showed BIO10 (mean temperature of warmest quarter) andBIO14 (precipitation of driest month) are key climatic factors which shape the diameter distribution of Larch plantations. Compared with parameter estimation models without climate variables, the adjusted R² was improved (5.03% for β, and 3.32 % for γ), RMSE (73.12% for β, and 2.89 % for γ)and TRE (92.16% for β, and 5.57% for γ) decreased. The models with climate factors are significantly different from that without climate factors by F test. The models with climate factors are improved and could be applied for diameter distribution projection under future climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarix 3aWeibull statistics 3aclimate change 3aforest ecology 3aforest management 3amodels 3atemperature 3atree and stand measurements 3atree growth 3aChina 0aWeibull distribution model 0aPercentile-based parameter recovery method 0aSeemingly unrelated regression1 aLei, Xiangdong1 aYou, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2697-57761 aZeng, Weisheng1 aLang, Pumei1 aLei, Yuancai0 tForest ecology and management.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 506 p.119947-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1199473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03466naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245009600176520159200272592002801864650002701892650002401919650001301943650002001956650001601976650001101992650001402003650001102017650000902028650001502037650001002052650001002062650001402072650002602086650002302112650001902135650001002154650001602164650001202180650001502192650001302207651001302220653001602233653002202249653001702271653003102288700002302319700005702342700006102399700002202460700001902482700006202501700002502563700006302588773010702651856008502758852000902843655001202852IND60759658620221117062436.0220207e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075965862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.1092982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNemanichvili, Nikoloz10aInfluenza D binding properties vary amongst the two major virus clades and wildlife species  aThe influenza D virus (IDV) uses a trimeric hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein (HEF) for attachment to 9-O-acetylated sialic acid receptors on the cell surface of host species. So far research has revealed that farm animals such as cattle, domestic pigs, goats, sheep and horses contain the necessary receptors on the epithelial surface of the respiratory tract to accommodate binding of the IDV HEF protein of both worldwide clades D/Oklahoma (D/OK) and D/Oklahoma/660 (D/660). More recently, seroprevalence studies have identified IDV-seropositive wildlife such as wild boar, deer, dromedaries, and small ruminants. However, no research has thus far been conducted in wildlife to reveal the distribution of acetylated sialic acid receptors that accommodate binding of IDV. Using our previously developed tissue microarray (TMA) system, we developed TMAs containing respiratory tissues of various wild and domestic species including wild boar, deer, dromedary, springbok, water buffalo, tiger, hedgehog, and Asian elephant. Protein histochemical staining of these TMAs with HEF proteins showed no receptor binding for wild Suidae, Cervidae and tiger. However, receptors were present in dromedary, springbok, water buffalo, Asian elephant, and hedgehog. In contrast to previously tested farm animals, a difference in host tropism was observed between the D/OK and D/660 clade HEF proteins in Asian elephant, and water buffalo. These results show that IDV can attach to the respiratory tract of wildlife which might facilitate transmission of IDV between wildlife and domestic animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAntidorcas marsupialis 3aCamelus dromedarius 3aCervidae 3aElephas maximus 3aErinaceidae 3aSuidae 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3adeer 3aepithelium 3afarms 3ahosts 3ainfluenza 3amicroarray technology 3arespiratory system 3aseroprevalence 3asheep 3asialic acid 3aviruses 3awild boars 3awildlife 3aOklahoma 0aInfluenza D 0aTissue microarray 0aHost tropism 0a9-O-acetylated sialic acid1 aBerends, Alinda J.1 aTomris, Ilhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8523-01361 aBarnard, Karen N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6283-45431 aParrish, Colin R.1 aGröne, Andrea1 aRijks, Jolianne M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1168-97341 aVerheije, Monique H.1 ade Vries, Robert P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1586-44640 tVeterinary microbiology.g2022 Jan., v. 264 p.109298-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.1092983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001200189245007800201300001600279506007600295520140900371592002801780506003701808650003001845650001601875650002001891650003801911650002301949650001901972650000901991650001302000650001302013650003402026650002002060650002602080650001702106653000902123653000802132653000802140653000902148653000902157653000902166653001602175653002002191653002602211700001702237700001702254700002002271700002102291773012102312856008202433852000902515655001202524IND60089805720221207064152.0160728e20131004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008980572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.09.0282doi7 aPMC38224322pmcid7 a240416882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jie10aTargeting SHP2 for EGFR inhibitor resistant non-small cell lung carcinoma  ap. 586-590.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTargeted therapy with inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has produced a noticeable benefit to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients whose tumors carry activating mutations (e.g. L858R) in EGFR. Unfortunately, these patients develop drug resistance after treatment, due to acquired secondary gatekeeper mutations in EGFR (e.g. T790M). Given the critical role of SHP2 in growth factor receptor signaling, we sought to determine whether targeting SHP2 could have therapeutic value for EGFR inhibitor resistant NSCLC. We show that SHP2 is required for EGF-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and proliferation in EGFR inhibitor resistant NSCLC cell line H1975, which harbors the EGFR T790M/L858R double-mutant. We demonstrate that treatment of H1975 cells with II-B08, a specific SHP2 inhibitor, phenocopies the observed growth inhibition and reduced ERK1/2 activation seen in cells treated with SHP2 siRNA. Importantly, we also find that II-B08 exhibits marked anti-tumor activity in H1975 xenograft mice. Finally, we observe that combined inhibition of SHP2 and PI3K impairs both the ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling axes and produces significantly greater effects on repressing H1975 cell growth than inhibition of either protein individually. Collectively, these results suggest that targeting SHP2 may represent an effective strategy for treatment of EGFR inhibitor resistant NSCLCs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3acell growth 3adrug resistance 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3agrowth retardation 3alung neoplasms 3amice 3amutation 3apatients 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3asmall interfering RNA 3atherapeutics 0aSHP2 0aERK 0aPTP 0aEGFR 0aSHP2 0aEGFR 0aLung cancer 0aDrug resistance 0aPhosphatase inhibitor1 aZeng, Li-Fan1 aShen, Weihua1 aTurchi, John J.1 aZhang, Zhong-Yin0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Oct. 04, v. 439 p.586-590dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.09.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010000166300001200266520160700278592002801885650001101913650001101924650001601935650002101951650002601972650001201998650002302010650001602033650002602049650001102075650001202086650001602098650001502114650000902129650001402138650002402152650001002176700002302186700001702209700001702226700001802243700001802261773012502279856008102404852000902485655001202494IND60440088220221119160905.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044008822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2501-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Son G.10aImpacts of Initial Fertilizers and Irrigation Systems on Paddy Methanogens and Methane Emission  ap. 309.  aMethane production by methanogenic microbes under anaerobic condition is affected by the types of fertilizers, which determine carbon availability, used in rice fields. In addition, irrigation management controls oxygen availability in soil. Thus, irrigation management and types of fertilizers are major driving forces for methane emission in rice fields. While these factors affect paddy microbial communities over the course of cultivation, little is known about the effects of fertilizers and irrigation conditions on initial paddy microbial communities. In this study, we investigated the initial impacts of fertilizers and irrigation systems on paddy microbial communities and methane emission. At early stages of rice cultivation (2 weeks after transplanting 15-day-old rice seedlings), a high amount of methane was emitted from rice fertilized with swine manure. In addition, pre-transplantation flooding increased methane emission by 30 %. Although these conditions did not affect the overall paddy soil microbial communities, 126 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were found to be significantly more abundant in paddy soils fertilized with swine manure. These OTUs included archaeal methanogenic species and bacterial substrate providers for biomethane production. Shared-OTU analysis with swine fecal microbial communities indicated swine manure as the origin of key methane-producing microbes. In conclusion, the applications of swine manure and permanent flooding irrigation introduce active methane producers and enhance methane emission, respectively, and should therefore be avoided.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3acarbon 3afertilizers 3aflood irrigation 3airrigation management 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3aoxygen 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3apig manure 3arice 3aseedlings 3asoil microorganisms 3aswine1 aGuevarra, Robin B.1 aKim, Jungman1 aHo, Cuong T.1 aTrinh, Mai V.1 aUnno, Tatsuya0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2015 Sept., v. 226, no. 9 p.309-309dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-015-2501-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02041naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010200161300002000263520095400283592002801237650001101265650003601276650003001312650001301342650002101355650001301376650001301389700002501402700001601427700002001443700002101463773012401484856007401608852000901682655001201691IND60664149820221121044324.0190910e20121022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066414982DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra21446f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Osamu10aImportance of the CH/π hydrogen bond in the enhancement of CD amplitude of exomethylene steroids  ap. 10891-10898.  aIntroduction of an axial methyl group to a bridgehead carbon has been known to enhance the circular dichroism (CD) amplitude of exomethylene steroids such as 4- and 6-methylene-5α-estrane, at ca. 200 nm (π/π* transition). To investigate the effect of a methyl group on the rotational strength of these steroids, time-dependent density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out at the M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p)//MP2/6-31G(d,p) level. It has been shown that the replacement of the bridgehead hydrogen atom at position 10 of these steroids by a methyl group influenced the CD amplitude at the π/π* transition. Analysis of natural bonding orbital (NBO) charges of relevant atoms has provided data consistent with this finding. In view of this, we suggest that the enhancement of the CD amplitude by methyl substitution β to the carbon-carbon double bond originates from the CH/π hydrogen bond occurring between CH groups and the π-system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adensity functional theory 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3amoieties 3asteroids1 aYamasaki, Katsuyoshi1 aKohno, Yuji1 aUeda, Kazuyoshi1 aNishio, Motohiro0 tRSC advances.g2012 Oct. 22, v. 2, no. 29 p.10891-10898dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra21446f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01980naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009800168300001400266520109800280592002801378650002601406650001101432650001901443650002801462700002201490773009701512856008401609852000901693655001201702IND60123172620221121031520.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012317262DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2013.8706742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Zhiyong10aConstrained nonnegative matrix factorization and hyperspectral image dimensionality reduction  ap. 46-54.  aThis letter presents a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based method for hyperspectral image dimensionality reduction. The proposed method combines the NMF and Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE). It overcomes the drawback that NMF does not consider the intrinsic geometric structure of the data space. In LE framework, an affinity graph is constructed to encode the geometrical information. The proposed technique seeks a matrix factorization which considers the graph structure. We also use the smoothness constraint and the sparsity constraint on the lower dimensional matrices. The gradient descent approach is used to find solution of the proposed model. In order to evaluate the developed method, we use the support vector machine and the k -nearest neighbourhood (KNN) approach for hyperspectral image classification. Experiments are done on a hyperspectral image. The results are compared with those obtained using other hyperspectal image dimensionality reduction methods. The classification accuracy using the proposed method is higher than that of the alternative approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahyperspectral imagery 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asupport vector machines1 aBourennane, Salah0 tRemote sensing letters.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 5, no. 1 p.46-54dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2013.8706743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010300160300001800263520106300281592002801344650002301372650002201395650001301417650001301430650001901443650001401462650002101476650001301497650001101510700002301521700001801544700002701562700001601589700001701605700001801622700002101640700002101661773012301682856007401805852000901879655001201888IND60664149920221121044353.0190910e20120924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066414992DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra21447d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBotas, Cristina10aTailored graphene materials by chemical reduction of graphene oxides of different atomic structure  ap. 9643-9650.  aGraphene materials with different characteristics in terms of sheet size and defects (structural and/or functional groups) were obtained by the reduction with hydrazine of two graphene oxides with similar oxygen content, but with functional groups of different type and location. The oxides were prepared from two synthetic graphites with distinct crystalline structure. Our research has obtained experimental evidence of a greater reactivity of the oxygen functional groups located in the interior of the aromatic domains on the basal planes (mainly epoxy) and a lower reactivity of oxygen functional groups located at the edges (mainly carboxyl and OH). Furthermore, these edge-located groups were found to be responsible for hydrogen bonding lateral interactions between sheets (these occur through the residual OH groups), which cause a substantial increase in the size of the reduced graphene oxide with respect to that of the parent graphene oxide. These results offer a way to tailor the characteristics of graphene materials for diverse applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reduction 3acrystal structure 3aepoxides 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrazine 3ahydrogen bonding 3amoieties 3aoxygen1 aÁlvarez, Patricia1 aBlanco, Clara1 aGutiérrez, M.

This involved 48 Poll Dorset × Merino ewe lambs, 12 per treatment, managed for 28 days within individual pens. Consumer sensory panel scores showed ‘good eating quality’ for all samples irrespective of diet, a conclusion supported by the shear force, cooking loss, particle size, and intramuscular fat results. Drip loss was affected by a significant interaction between diet and muscle. The ultimate pH of meat from lambs fed annual wheat was highest. Comparable colour stability and purge results suggested that diet did not impact on lamb retail-potential. Sodium, sulphur and zinc concentrations were higher in the meat from lambs fed annual wheat, compared to perennial wheat. Overall, these outcomes support the use of perennial wheat as a forage for lamb production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerino 3aalfalfa 3acolor 3adiet 3adrip loss 3aewes 3aforage 3aintramuscular fat 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat 3ameat science 3amineral content 3apH 3aparticle size 3asemimembranosus muscle 3asensory evaluation 3asodium 3asulfur 3awheat 3azinc 0aSheep meat 0aGrazing cereals 0aPerennial and annual 0aForage 0aAlfalfa 0aSensory quality attributes 0aMineral content 0aLoin 0aTopside1 aHayes, Richard C.1 aNewell, Matthew T.1 aRefshauge, Gordon1 aMcGrath, Shawn R.1 aFowler, Stephanie M.1 aShanley, Alexandra R.1 aHopkins, David L.0 tMeat science.g2021 Oct., v. 180 p.108564-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2021.1085643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245009800173300001200271500001900283520120900302592002801511596004101539650002801580650002301608650002201631650001101653650001901664650000901683650001101692650001301703651001101716700002101727700002401748700007201772700001801844700002601862773015101888856008302039852000902122655001202131IND60700700020221118050950.0201127e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070070002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-020-08438-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKazienko, Aleksandra10aTrace elements in Athyrium distentifolium from alpine vegetation in the Karkonosze, SW Poland  ap. 485.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Karkonosze National Park is affected by long-distance metal air transport of anthropogenic contamination as well as by tourist activity. Therefore, concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were evaluated in soil as well as in vital and non-vital fronds of Athyrium distentifolium Opiz collected in the middle of the growing season from glacial cirques in the Karkonosze. Additionally, fronds of the same species turning brown in autumn were collected from the same sampling sites. The health of ferns was impacted by the contents of Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in fronds, which may indicate that A. distentifolium uses elements accumulated in its tissues as defence against pathogens. Individuals from higher altitudes contained higher concentrations of Cd, Cu, Ni, Fe and Pb than those from lower altitudes. Autumn fronds of A. distentifolium contained a significantly higher concentration of Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn and Pb than vital summer fronds, which may indicate sequestration of these elements in senescing fronds probably to remove potentially harmful metals. Non-vital ferns were a better accumulator of Pb than vital ones, while both types of ferns accumulated Mn in a similar way.  aPublisher supplied data  a0420/2579/18cUniversity of Wrocław 3aAthyrium distentifolium 3aair transportation 3aalpine vegetation 3aautumn 3anational parks 3asoil 3asummer 3atourists 3aPoland1 aTorzewski, Karol1 aWojtuń, Bronisław1 aSamecka-Cymerman, Aleksandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5421-00921 aMróz, Lucyna1 aKempers, Alexander J.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 Aug., v. 192, no. 8 p.485-485dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08438-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014100163300001200304520198800316592002802304650002502332650001102357650002202368650001302390650002102403650001302424650002102437650001302458650001302471650001402484650001502498650001102513650002302524650001102547650001102558650001502569651001902584651001402603700001502617773012502632856008102757852000902838655001202847IND60440088420221119161141.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044008842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2580-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Songjie10aThree Decadal Inputs of Nitrogen and Phosphorus from Four Major Coastal Rivers to the Summer Hypoxic Zone of the Northern Gulf of Mexico  ap. 311.  aNutrient enrichment is considered one of the most important causes for summer hypoxic conditions in the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) off the Louisiana coast. While many studies on nutrient inputs from the large Mississippi-Atchafalaya River System have been conducted, little is known about nutrient inputs from other coastal rivers in Louisiana. In this study, we utilized long-term (1980–2009) records on river discharge and nutrient concentrations of four major Louisiana coastal rivers—the Sabine, Calcasieu, Mermentau, and Vermilion—to estimate daily, monthly, and annual inflows of nitrate and nitrite nitrogen (NO₃ + NO₂), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and total phosphorus (TP) into the NGOM. The three-decade-long nutrient inflows from these rivers were analyzed for their seasonal fluctuations, interannual variabilities, and decadal trends. Fluxes of NO₃ + NO₂, TKN, and TP for these river basins were estimated to assess land use effects on riverine nutrients. Our study found that the four coastal rivers discharged each year a considerably large amount of NO₃ + NO₂ (total of 1755 t), TKN (12,208 t), and TP (1833 t) into the NGOM, with a peak input of nitrogen during the spring. The Mermentau and Vermilion Rivers, which drain intensive agriculture areas, had significantly higher NO₃ + NO₂, TKN, and TP concentrations when compared with the Sabine and Calcasieu Rivers, which drain forest-pasture-dominated lands. The fluxes of NO₃ + NO₂, TKN, and TP from the Mermentau River Basin (156 kg km⁻² year⁻¹ NO₃ + NO₂, 942 kg km⁻² year⁻¹ TKN, and 206 kg km⁻² year⁻¹ TP) and the Vermilion River Basin (374, 1078, and 360) were much higher than those combined from the Sabine and Calcasieu River Basins (66, 710, and 62). These findings fill a major knowledge gap concerning the quantity and characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus transport from coastal watersheds to North America’s largest hypoxic zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3acoasts 3aintensive farming 3aland use 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrite nitrogen 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3awatersheds 3aGulf of Mexico 3aLouisiana1 aXu, Y.

Despite their abundance and diversity in Paleozoic rocks, the presence, and criteria for the recognition of primary, biogenic skeletal structures is highly controversial. The aim of this study is a multilevel analysis of the diverse morphological elements that form well-preserved specimens of the Carboniferous Multithecopora tabulate coral skeleton. Results indicate that samples are minimally altered by diagenesis, but most importantly that skeletal structures are biogenic in nature, and similar to those of modern and fossil carbonate-producing organisms. Nano- and microcrystals form a complex framework of different domains of crystal morphologies that comprise the bulk of the skeleton in Multithecopora. These domains are thought to be the possible phenotypic response of the genotype of these corals, and had a structural importance during the life of the organism. Overall, this study sheds light for a better understanding on the controversy that exists about the biogenic or abiogenic origin of the Paleozoic coral microstructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorals 3afossils 3agenotype 3amicrostructure 3apaleoecology 3aphenotype 3arocks 0aMultithecopora 0aBiomineralization 0aMicrostructure 0aNanocrystal 0aPennsylvanian and Spain1 aPérez-Huerta, Alberto1 aRodriguez, Sergio,0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 386 p.286-299dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.05.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245016400170300001600334520103700350592002801387650001201415650001401427650001901441650001201460650000901472650002601481650001201507650001801519650002501537650001201562650001001574650001301584650001001597653002401607653003401631653001501665700001601680700001801696700001801714700001801732700001701750700001101767773013201778856008701910852000901997655001202006IND60581476020221116170557.0200503e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058147602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Chengtuo10aComparative analysis of the effect of protein Z4 from barley malt and recombinant Pichia pastoris on beer foam stability: Role of N-glycosylation and glycation  ap. 241-247.  aThis study aimed to elaborate the effect of N-glycosylation and glycation of protein Z₄ from barley malt and recombinant Pichia pastoris on beer foam stability. The malt protein Z₄ and recombinant protein Z₄ showed similar N-glycosylation patterns while recombinant protein Z₄ was glycosylated at a higher degree. In the simulated mashing and boiling, malt protein Z₄ and deglycosylated malt protein Z₄ preferred to glycate with glucose and maltose while recombinant protein Z₄ and deglycosylated recombinant protein Z₄ showed preference towards fructose. The addition of protein Z₄ and protein Z₄-saccharide complexes in finished beer showed that the addition of glycosylated protein Z₄ only slightly enhanced the beer foam stability while the addition of glycated protein Z₄ and protein Z₄ with both glycation and glycosylation could significantly increase the beer foam stability. Therefore, glycation instead of N-glycosylation of protein Z₄ played important roles in maintaining beer foam stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboiling 3aglycation 3amalting barley 3amashing 3amalt 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aglucose 3aglycosylation 3arecombinant proteins 3amaltose 3afoams 3afructose 3abeers 0aBeer foam stability 0aGlycation and N-glycosylation 0aProtein Z41 aHan, Yupeng1 aWang, Jinjing1 aZheng, Feiyun1 aLiu, Chunfeng1 aLi, Yongxian1 aLi, Qi0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Jan., v. 106 p.241-247dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04034naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001400167245010700181300001600288520252100304592002802825650002702853650001602880650001302896650002102909650001402930650002202944650001102966650001602977650002202993650001603015650002303031650002803054650003103082650003003113650002503143650002203168650001403190650002203204650003103226700001703257700002103274700001503295700002003310700001503330773008003345856008203425852000903507655001203516IND60098904020221116151620.0141105e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009890402DNAL7 a211561982pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2010.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Shen10aGenome-wide comparison of cyanobacterial transposable elements, potential genetic diversity indicators  ap. 139-149.  aTransposable elements are widely distributed in archaea, bacteria and eukarya domains. Considerable discrepancies of transposable elements in eukaryotes have been reported, however, the studies focusing on the diversity of transposable element systems in prokaryotes were scarce. Understanding the transposable element system in cyanobacteria by the genome-wide analysis will greatly improve the knowledge of cyanobacterial diversity. In this study, the transposable elements of seventeen cyanobacterial genomes were analyzed. The abundance of insertion sequence (IS) elements differs significantly among the cyanobacterial genomes examined. In particular, water bloom forming Microcystis aeruginosa NIES843 was shown to have the highest abundance of IS elements reaching 10.85% of the genome. IS family is a widely acceptable IS classification unit, and IS subfamily, based on probe sequences, was firstly proposed as the basic classification unit for IS element system，therefore both IS family and IS subfamily were suggested as the two hierarchical units for evaluating the IS element system diversity. In total, 1980 predicted IS elements, within 21 IS families and 132 subfamilies, were identified in the examined cyanobacterial genomes. Families IS4, IS5, IS630 and IS200-605 are widely distributed, and therefore supposed to be the ancestral IS families. Analysis on the intactness of IS elements showed that the percentage of the intact IS differs largely among these cyanobacterial strains. Higher percentage of the intact IS detected in the two hot spring cyanobacterial strains implied that the intactness of IS elements may be related to the genomic stabilization of cyanobacteria inhabiting in the extreme environments. The frequencies between IS elements and miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) were shown to have a linear positive correlation. The transposable element system in cyanobacterial genomes is of hypervariabilty. With characterization of easy definition and stability, IS subfamily is considered as a reliable lower classification unit in IS element system. The abundance of intact IS, the composition of IS families and subfamilies, the sequence diversity of IS element nucleotide and transposase amino acid are informative and suitable as the indicators for studies on cyanobacterial diversity. Practically, the transposable system may provide us a new perspective to realize the diversity and evolution of populations of water bloom forming cyanobacterial species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3aeukaryotic cells 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3ahot springs 3aprokaryotic cells 3atransposons 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCyanobacteriaxgenetics 2aDNA Copy Number Variations 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Variation 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis 2aSequence Analysis, Protein1 aHaas, Stefan1 aZemojtel, Tomasz1 aXiao, Peng1 aVingron, Martin1 aLi, Renhui0 tGene.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 473, no. 2 p.139-149dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2010.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001800094024003100112040001800143100001800161245009000179300001800269520145600287592002801743650000801771650000801779650001501787650001001802650001401812650001901826650001101845650001801856650001401874650001701888650003001905650001501935650002901950650002501979650002202004650001102026650004602037650003902083650002202122650001102144650003202155650001402187700001502201700002502216700001802241700001702259700001702276700001502293700001902308773009802327856007702425852000902502655001202511IND50088810020221121034755.0150214e199807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008881002DNAL7 a97393372pmid7 a10.1007/s0070500504012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRienzo, A. M.10aVirological and molecular parameters of HIV-1 infection of human embryonic astrocytes  ap. 1599-1615.  aTwo different strains of HIV-1, the lymphotropic HIV-IIIB and the monocytotropic HIV-Ba-L, were able to infect tertiary cultures of astrocytes established from the human embryonic brain. The infection did not require contact with infected cells, as astrocytes were exposed to infectious cell-free supernatants. Except for an early transient peak of p24 consistently observed after infection with HIV-Ba-L, the infection of astrocytes appeared to be nonproductive. However, viral production was always observed when infected astrocytes were cocultured with permissive cells (CEM-SS or monocytes). To exclude the possibility that undetectable levels of virus are chronically produced by astrocytes, we exposed permissive cells to p24 negative supernatants taken from infected cultures. In such conditions permissive cells were never infected. Infection of astrocytes by HIV-1 was further supported by the finding that provirus persisted in these cells. Indeed, by a nested PCR, we detected HIV-1 DNA even one month after infection. Moreover, at the transcriptional level we observed expression of the multiply spliced RNA (tat) and nef primers). Noteworthy, this pattern of HIV-1 expression did not change appreciably when astrocytes were pretreated and cultivated in the presence of IL-1β. Altogether, our data support the concept that astrocytes may play a role in the spread of HIV-1 infection within the brain and in the pathogenesis of neuro-AIDS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aastrocytes 3abrain 3acoculture 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-1 3amonocytes 3apathogenesis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aproviruses 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAstrocytesxvirology 2aEmbryo, Mammalian 2aFemale 2aGlial Fibrillary Acidic Proteinxanalysis 2aHIV Core Protein p24xbiosynthesis 2aHIV-1xphysiology 2aHumans 2aInterleukin-1xpharmacology 2aPregnancy1 aAloisi, F.1 aSantarcangelo, A.

However, previous reports on the association between AD and food intake in adolescents are scarce. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between AD and specific food consumption frequency in adolescents. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis using data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey 2017 was performed. The frequency of food consumption in the recent-diagnosed AD group (AD diagnosed within 12 months) compared to those in the previous-diagnosed AD (AD diagnosed more than 12 months ago) or control group were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 53,373 participants were eligible for this study. The weighted prevalence of the recent-diagnosed AD and the previous-diagnosed AD was 7.39% and 18.00%, respectively. When compared with subjects with the previous-diagnosed AD, those with the recent-diagnosed AD were significantly more likely to frequently consume fast foods (odds ratio OR 1.405; 95% CI 1.150–1.717), energy drinks (OR 1.457; 95% CI 1.175–1.807), or convenience food (OR 1.304; 95% CI 1.138–1.495). Patients of the recent-diagnosed AD were significantly more likely to frequently consume fast foods (OR 1.374; 95% CI 1.155–1.634) than the control group. The differences in the frequency of specific food consumption among groups were more pronounced in high school students than in middle school students. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent intake of fast foods, energy drinks, and convenience food was related to the recent-diagnosed AD in adolescents. Prospective cohort and interventional studies are needed to identify causal relationships.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aatopic dermatitis 3across-sectional studies 3aenergy 3afood allergies 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3aodds ratio 3aprepared foods 3arisk behavior 3asurveys 3ayouth 3aKorean Peninsula1 aLee, Hanjae1 aLee, Dong-Hun,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2925-30741 aKim, Kyu-han,0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2020 Oct., v. 59, no. 7 p.3171-3182dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-019-02157-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024004000132024001100172040001800183100002000201245007400221300001600295506017300311520164700484592002802131650003002159650000902189650001402198650001302212650001602225650001502241650001502256650002102271650001102292650001202303651001802315653001602333653001202349653001202361653002102373653001302394700002302407773010602430856008702536856011202623956015502735961001302890852000902903655001202912IND50066585520221214230856.0190409e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006658552DNAL7 a2883492aris7 a10113/565122hdl7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2013.03.0282doi8 ans1923  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVadas, Peter A.10aProduction costs of potential corn stover harvest and storage systems  ap. 133-139.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aCorn stover has potential as a bioenergy feedstock in North America. We simulated production costs for stover harvest (three-pass and two-pass with baling or chopping, and single-pass with baling or chopping) and on-farm storage (outdoor and indoor bales, outdoor wrapped bales, and chopped stover in bags, bunks, or piles). For three- and two-pass harvest, chopping was 33–45% more expensive than baling. For baling and chopping, two-pass harvest was 25% cheaper than three-pass. Single-pass chopping harvests were on average 42% cheaper than three-pass or two-pass chopping. Single-pass baling was cheaper (4–31%) than multi-pass baling at low rates of stover collection, but more expensive (1–39%) at high rates of collection. For bales, outdoor storage of wrapped bales was cheapest. Outdoor, unwrapped bale storage, even with 12% dry matter loss, was cheaper than indoor storage. For chopped stover, storage in bags was always cheapest, followed by piles, and then bunkers. With harvest and storage together, there were four least cost systems: single-pass, ear-snap baling with wrapped bale storage; single-pass chopping with silage bag storage; and two-pass baling with wrapped-bale storage. A second group of harvest/storage systems was 25% more expensive, including single-pass, whole-plant baling with wrapped-bale storage; two-pass chopping with silage-bag storage; and three-pass baling with wrapped-bale storage. The three-pass chop harvest with silage bag storage was most expensive. Our analysis suggests all harvest and farm storage systems have tradeoffs and several systems can be economically and logistically viable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFarms and Farming Systems 3abags 3abioenergy 3achopping 3acorn stover 3afeedstocks 3aharvesting 3aproduction costs 3asilage 3astorage 3aNorth America 0aCorn stover 0aHarvest 0aStorage 0aProduction costs 0aModeling1 aDigman, Matthew F.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2013 July, v. 54 p.133-139dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2013.03.0283Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/565123Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Production%20costs%20of%20potential%20corn%20stover%20harvest%20and%20storage.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100005600158245016400214300001600378520142000394592002801814650002401842650001601866650002301882650001101905650003801916650001401954650001001968650001001978650001601988650001602004650001302020650001702033650001302050650001202063650001102075650001702086650001502103653002502118653002502143653001702168653001702185653002302202700001502225700002102240700002102261700002502282773009702307856009302404852000902497655001202506IND60592190620221120165529.0190318e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059219062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDerar, Derar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6081-762710aErectile dysfunction in male dromedary camels: Clinical findings and changes in the nitric oxide metabolite, cardiac troponin I and testosterone concentrations  ap. 201-205.  aThis study aimed to clarify the phenomenon of erectile dysfunction (ED) in male camels and monitor the associated changes in nitric oxide metabolite (NOM), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and testosterone concentrations. A total 18 camels with ED and 10 controls were included in this study. The breeding history was recorded and a thorough breeding soundness examination was performed. Total nitrates and nitrites were determined in sera using the Griess assay. Serum cTnI and testosterone were assessed using ELISA. A complete blood count was also carried out. The results showed that 13/18 male camels with ED had no detectable pathologic lesions in the genital tract (ED-N), while 5/18 males showed pathology in the penis, prepuce, and testicles (ED-P). The ED-P group exhibited higher concentrations of NOMs (P = 0.003), white blood cells (P = 0.0001), and neutrophils (P = 0.001) than the ED-N and control groups. The ED-P and ED-N groups had higher concentrations of cTnI than the control group (P = 0.0001). Testosterone concentration did not differ among the groups. In conclusion, the ED in the camels was associated with a rise in cTnI, probably due to myositic damage. Most of the ED cases in the camels had apparently normal genital organs. In the cases of ED in male camels with detectable pathologic lesions on their genital organs, a rise in NOMs, white blood cells, and neutrophils was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelus dromedarius 3ablood serum 3abreeding soundness 3acamels 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenitalia 3aheart 3amales 3ametabolites 3aneutrophils 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anitrites 3aprepuce 3atestes 3atestosterone 3atroponin I 0aMale dromedary camel 0aErectile dysfunction 0aNitric oxide 0aTestosterone 0aCardiac troponin I1 aAli, Ahmed1 aTharwat, Mohamed1 aAl-Sobayil, Fahd1 aZeitoun, Moustafa M.0 tTheriogenology.g2017 Feb., v. 89 p.201-205dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012800169300001600297520103200313592002801345650002101373650001601394650001001410650001601420650001501436650002201451650001901473650001801492650001401510650001501524650001501539653003801554653002001592653001701612653002401629653002601653700001801679700001701697700002201714773007701736856008501813852000901898655001201907IND60581476320221116170220.0171005e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058147632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.05.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayat, Akhtar10aColorimetric cholesterol sensor based on peroxidase like activity of zinc oxide nanoparticles incorporated carbon nanotubes  ap. 157-161.  aA sensitive and selective colorimetric method based on the incorporation of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was shown to posses synergistic peroxidase like activity for the detection of cholesterol. The proposed nanocomposite catalyzed the oxidation of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce a green colored product which can be monitored at 405nm. H2O2 is the oxidative product of cholesterol in the presence of cholesterol oxidase. Therefore, the oxidation of cholesterol can be quantitatively related to the colorimetric response by combining these two reactions. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the colorimetric response was proportional to the concentration of cholesterol in the range of 0.5–500nmol/L, with a detection limit of 0.2nmol/L. The applicability of the proposed assays was demonstrated for the determination of cholesterol in milk powder samples with good recovery results.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acholesterol 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adried milk 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3azinc oxide 0aZnO incorporated carbon nanotubes 0aSynergic effect 0aEnzyme mimic 0aColorimetric assays 0aCholesterol detection1 aHaider, Waqar1 aRaza, Yousuf1 aMarty, Jean Louis0 tTalanta.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 143 p.157-161dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.05.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01929naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245014400175300001600319500001900335500002000354520083800374592002801212650002601240650001501266650001701281650001501298650001101313650001701324650001501341650001801356773011801374856009001492852000901582655001201591IND60734294020221118023417.0210417e198612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073429402DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1986.tb00661.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWALTERS, D.

DFMO was sprayed onto leaves at 0.025, 0.1 and 0.4 mM before and after inoculation. DFMO was also applied to leaf halves in order to examine the possible translocation of the inhibitor to untreated leaf halves (systemic treatment). DFMO gave good control of rust infection, irrespective of the treatment. DFMO applied after inoculation was more effective than a pre‐inoculatory treatment when used in non‐systemic tests. When used as a systemic treatment on leaf halves, pre‐inoculatory application of DFMO was more effective. DFMO did not affect plant growth or endogenous concentrations of poly amines. The possible use of DFMO in the control of a range of plant diseases is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUromyces viciae-fabae 3aVicia faba 3abiosynthesis 3afaba beans 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3apolyamines 3arust diseases0 tnew phytologist.g1986 Dec., v. 104, no. 4 p.613-619dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1986.tb00661.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245007900169520106400248592002801312650001301340650001101353650002301364650001701387650002301404650001001427650001201437650002401449650001101473650002101484650002901505700002301534700001801557700001601575773011901591856007701710852000901787655001201796IND60707851720221121101311.0200821e20200804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070785172DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110808862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnthony, Christin  C.10aNuclear Regulation of Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling: It’s a Complex Situation  aWnt signaling is an evolutionarily conserved metazoan cell communication pathway required for proper animal development. Of the myriad of signaling events that have been ascribed to cellular activation by Wnt ligands, the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway has been the most studied and best understood. Misregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated in developmental defects in the embryo and major diseases in the adult. Despite the latter, no drugs that inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin pathway have been approved by the FDA. In this review, we explore the least understood step in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway—nuclear regulation of Wnt target gene transcription. We initially describe our current understanding of the importation of β-catenin into the nucleus. We then focus on the mechanism of action of the major nuclear proteins implicated in driving gene transcription. Finally, we explore the concept of a nuclear Wnt enhanceosome and propose a modified model that describes the necessary components for the transcription of Wnt target genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnimalia 3aadults 3aanimal development 3abeta catenin 3acell communication 3agenes 3aligands 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3anuclear proteins 3atranscription (genetics)1 aRobbins, David J.,1 aAhmed, Yashi 1 aLee, Ethan 0 tGenes.g2020 Aug. 04, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110808863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245005800153300001800211520135400229592002801583650001901611650002001630650002201650650001201672650002101684650002301705700002001728700002101748773012101769856007501890852000901965655001201974IND60558807820221118171041.0161117e20130411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055880782DNAL7 a10.1021/jp312238d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhan, Anh10aLiquid Ethanol Simulated on Crystalline Alpha Alumina  ap. 3829-3840.  aEquilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the structural properties of interfacial liquid ethanol on two alumina surfacesthe (0001) and the (11̅02) terminations of α-Al₂O₃both described using the CLAYFF force field. The resultant atomic density profiles show that ethanol molecules in the first monolayer are well ordered and that their distribution depends on the surface OH groups. A pronounced dipolar orientation is found for the ethanol molecules in the first layer and also, although to a smaller extent, among the ethanol molecules in the second molecular layer. The orientational distribution predicted for the methyl group of ethanol on α-Al₂O₃ (11̅02) is consistent with that observed experimentally by Shen and co-workers. The orientation of molecules in the second layer is opposite compared to that found in the first adsorbed molecular layer. Our simulations show long residence times and slowly decaying reorientation autocorrelation functions for ethanol molecules in the first adsorbed layer, suggesting that within the first adsorbed layer ethanol molecules are strongly coordinated with both α-Al₂O₃ (0001) and α-Al₂O₃ (11̅02) surfaces. Analysis of the hydrogen bond network confirms that preferential surface–ethanol interactions are responsible for such observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aautocorrelation 3achemical elements 3aethanol 3ahydrogen bonding 3amolecular dynamics1 aCole, David R.,1 aStriolo, Alberto0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Apr. 11, v. 117, no. 14 p.3829-3840dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp312238d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009600167500002200263520125300285592002801538650002601566650002501592650001301617650001001630650002201640650002301662650002101685653001301706653002801719653002401747653002401771700001301795700001801808700001501826700002001841700001501861700001601876700001801892773009601910856008602006852000902092655001202101IND60581476420221116170558.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058147642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.09.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuan, Fang14aThe evaluation of antioxidant and antifungal properties of 6-amino-6-deoxychitosan in vitro  aPre-press version  aWe synthesized 6-amino-6-deoxychitosan (NCS) through a series of reactions from chitosan (CS). The antioxidant ability of CS and NCS were investigated in vitro, including that of DPPH-radical and hydrogen peroxide, reducing power, chelating abilities and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. As expected, after the introduction of amino groups, antioxidant ability had improved significantly. Especially, scavenging effect against DPPH-radical and hydrogen peroxide of NCS were 97% and 92% at 1.6mg/mL, respectively. Moreover, inhibition of lipid peroxidation was 57% at 0.1mg/mL. And the reducing power of NCS was 0.68 at 0.8mg/mL. Meanwhile, inhibitory effects against four fungi were also tested. Antifungal activity of NCS were better than those of CS and antifungal activity had improved more than 20% at 0.5mg/mL against these four kinds of plant pathogens. Based on the above results, it was reasonable to speculate that the obtained antioxidant ability and antifungal activity of NCS might benefit from amino groups on chitosan backbone. These in vitro results suggest the possibility that NCS as antioxidant compound could be effectively alleviate oxidative stress and thus inhibit the oxidative mechanisms that lead to degenerative diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantifungal properties 3aantioxidant activity 3achitosan 3afungi 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stress 0achitosan 0a6-amino-6-deoxychitosan 0aantioxidant ability 0aantifungal activity1 aLi, Qing1 aTan, Wenqiang1 aWei, Lijie1 aZhang, Jingjing1 aDong, Fang1 aGu, Guodong1 aGuo, Zhanyong0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.09.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007900169300001800248520118500266592002801451650001901479650001301498650001501511650001501526650001001541650001501551650001301566650002601579650002201605650001601627650002101643650001601664650000801680650002101688650001101709650001301720700002001733700002501753700002201778700002201800700002001822773015501842856008601997852000902083655001202092IND60549822420221120091819.0160909e20150626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054982242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b002412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsen, Lesley10aSweet Poisons: Honeys Contaminated with Glycosides of the Neurotoxin Tutin  ap. 1363-1369.  aPoisonings due to consumption of honeys containing plant toxins have been reported widely. One cause is the neurotoxin tutin, an oxygenated sesquiterpene picrotoxane, traced back to honeybees (Apis mellifera) collecting honeydew produced by passionvine hoppers (Scolypopa australis) feeding on sap of the poisonous shrub tutu (Coriaria spp.). However, a pharmacokinetic study suggested that unidentified conjugates of tutin were also present in such honeys. We now report the discovery, using ion trap LC-MS, of two tutin glycosides and their purification and structure determination as 2-(β-d-glucopyranosyl)tutin (4) and 2-[6′-(α-d-glucopyranosyl)-β-d-glucopyranosyl]tutin (5). These compounds were used to develop a quantitative triple quadrupole LC-MS method for honey analysis, which showed the presence of tutin (3.6 ± 0.1 μg/g honey), hyenanchin (19.3 ± 0.5), tutin glycoside (4) (4.9 ± 0.4), and tutin diglycoside (5) (4.9 ± 0.1) in one toxic honey. The ratios of 4 and 5 to tutin varied widely in other tutin-containing honeys. The glycosidation of tutin may represent detoxification by one or both of the insects involved in the food chain from plant to honey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aCoriaria 3afood chain 3aglycosides 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3ahoneydew 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aneurotoxins 3apharmacokinetics 3aphytotoxins 3asap 3asesquiterpenoids 3ashrubs 3atoxicity1 aJoyce, Nigel

Death-feigning is thought as one of anti-predator behaviors to escape from predation by temporarily stopping movement and appearing to be dead. Previous studies have shown that the duration and frequency of death-feigning varies with temperature. Body color may also affect those parameters through thermal adaptation, as body color would have a significant relationship with temperature adaptation. A ladybug, Harmonia axyridis, shows a polymorphism in elytral color, which is controlled by 12 alleles on a single locus. The elytral color can be divided into 1) red with black spots (Red type; R) and 2) black with red spots (Black type; B). Here, we show that the duration of death-feigning in B was correlated positively with temperature whereas that in R was correlated negatively with temperature. The evolutionary reasons for this difference require further study in terms of the trade-off between the opportunity cost associated with death-feigning and the benefit of the duration of death-feigning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHarmonia axyridis 3aantipredatory behavior 3acolor 3ainsect behavior 3aloci 3aopportunity costs 3apredation 3aselection pressure 3atemperature 3atonic immobility1 aHasegawa, Eisuke0 tJournal of insect behavior.g2022 May, v. 35, no. 1-3 p.11-16dSpringer USwJournal:jnl43293x0892-75537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10905-022-09795-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100006000185245010500245300001800350506002800368506006400396520156500460592002802025596004502053596007102098596007102169596006202240506003702302650001202339650002202351650001002373650001102383650001502394650002602409650002202435650000902457650002002466650001302486650002402499650003702523650001502560700001802575773011202593856008102705903002202786852000902808655001202817IND60620183120221207091247.0181106e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062018312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-018-9577-22doi7 a10.1007/s11119-018-9577-22chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarbi, Peter Ako1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8512-748610aTime series analysis of soybean response to varying atmospheric conditions for precision agriculture  ap. 1113-1126.  aResource is Open Access  aSpringer Science and Business Media LLC License Information  aFour time-lapse cameras, Bushnell Nature View HD Camera (Bushnell, Overland Park, KS, USA) were installed in a soybean field to track the response of soybean plants to changing weather conditions. The purpose was to confirm if visible spectroscopy can provide useful data for tracking the condition of crops and, if so, whether game and trail time-lapse cameras can serve as reliable crop sensing and monitoring devices. Using the installed cameras, images were taken at 30-min intervals between July 22 and August 1, 2015. Using the RGBExcel software application developed in-house, image data from the R (red), G (green), and B (blue) bands were exported to Microsoft Excel for further processing and analysis. Daytime adjusted green red index data for the plant, based on the R and G data, were plotted against time of image acquisition and also regressed with selected weather parameters. The former showed a rise-and-fall trend with daily peaks around 13:00, while the latter showed a decreasing order of correlation with weather variables as follows: log of solar radiation > log of soil surface temperature > log of air temperature > log of soil temperature at 50-mm depth > log of relative humidity. Despite some low correlations, the potential for using game and trail cameras with time-lapse capability to track changes in crop vegetation response under varying conditions is established. The resulting data can be used to develop models that can aid precision agriculture applications. This can be further explored in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  aNLGCA Project No. 2015-70001-23439cU.S. Department of Agriculture  aNLGCA Project No. 2015-70001-23439cU.S. Department of Agriculture  aHatch Project No. 1005836cU.S. Department of Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acameras 3acomputer software 3acrops 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprecision agriculture 3arelative humidity 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3asoybeans 3asurface temperature 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3avegetation1 aGreen, Steven0 tPrecision agriculture.g2018 Dec., v. 19, no. 6 p.1113-1126dSpringer USwJournal:jnl58474x1385-22567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11119-018-9577-23Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245009100175520196000266592002802226650002802254650002002282650003302302650002202335650001002357650002302367650001002390650001402400650001502414650001902429650001402448650001102462650002902473650001202502653002802514653002602542653001402568653002802582653002702610700007902637700001802716700006502734700002202799773010802821856008402929852000903013655001203022IND60770316320221118125041.0220517e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077031632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsase.2022.1007122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmarasingam, Narmilan12aA review of UAV platforms, sensors, and applications for monitoring of sugarcane crops  aRecent advancements in the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based remote sensing (RS) in precision agricultural practices have been critical in enhancing crop health and management. UAV-based RS and advanced computational algorithms including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), are progressively being applied to make predictions, solve decisions to optimize the production and operation processes in many farming industries such as sugarcane. UAVs with various advanced sensors, including RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, LIDAR, and thermal cameras, have been used for crop RS applications as they can provide new approaches and research opportunities in precision sugarcane production. This review focuses on the use of UAVs in the sugarcane industry for pest and disease management, yield estimation, phenotypic measurement, soil moisture assessment, and nutritional status evaluation to improve the productivity and environmental sustainability. The goals of this review were to: (1) assemble information on the application of UAVs in the sugarcane industry; and (2) discuss their benefits and limitations in a variety of applications in UAV-based sugarcane cultivation. A literature review was conducted utilizing three bibliographic databases, including Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, and 179 research articles that are relevant to UAV applications in sugarcane and other general information about UAV and sensors collected from the databases mentioned earlier. The study concluded that UAV-based crop RS can be an effective method for sugarcane monitoring and management to improve yield and quality and significantly benefits on social, economic, and environmental aspects. However, UAV-based RS should also consider some of the challenges in sugar industries include technological adaptations, high initial cost, inclement weather, communication failures, policy, and regulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3adisease control 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aissues and policy 3alidar 3anutritional status 3apests 3aphenotype 3asoil water 3asugar industry 3asugarcane 3asugars 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3aweather 0aArtificial intelligence 0aPrecision agriculture 0aSugarcane 0aUnmanned aerial vehicle 0aUnmanned aerial system1 aAshan Salgadoe, Arachchige Surantha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9962-95081 aPowell, Kevin1 aGonzalez, Luis Felipe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4342-36821 aNatarajan, Sijesh0 tRemote sensing applications.g2022 Apr., v. 26 p.100712-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.1007123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03880naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100003100167245008600198300001400284520180600298592002802104650001502132650002102147650002802168650002102196650001402217650001702231650002402248650002802272650001802300650001302318650002002331650001002351650002202361650001802383650001502401650001502416650002602431650001902457650001502476650001602491650001002507650002402517650001202541650001802553650002102571650002102592650001802613650005902631650003602690650003402726650002502760650002802785650002702813650001402840650002102854650003702875700001602912700002602928700002102954700002302975773008102998856008203079852000903161655001203170IND60098904520221116151602.0141105e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009890452DNAL7 a211344242pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2010.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwinghammer, Margaret A.12aA novel gene from the takeout family involved in termite trail-following behavior  ap. 12-21.  aThis study investigated physiological and behavioral functions of a novel gene identified from the termite Reticulitermes flavipes. The gene, named deviate, encodes an apparent ligand binding protein from the takeout-homologous family. Initial studies were conducted to investigate deviate mRNA expression among termite castes and body regions, and changes in response to light–dark conditions, starvation, temperature, and juvenile hormone (JH). Deviate has ubiquitous caste and tissue expression, including antennal expression. Consistent with characteristics of other takeout family members, deviate expression is responsive to photophase conditions (p<0.1), and feeding, temperature, and JH (p<0.05). Using RNA-interference (RNAi) techniques, short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) homologous to the deviate gene were synthesized and injected into worker termites, which were then subjected to bioassays designed to (1) induce caste differentiation or (2) measure various behavioral aspects of foraging and trail following. No impacts on JH-dependent caste differentiation were observable. However, trail following accuracy was significantly reduced in termites that received deviate siRNA injections, and this pattern generally mirrored deviate mRNA attenuation and recovery after RNAi. In a subsequent distance foraging bioassay, deviate-silenced termites exhibited equal feeding levels to controls, suggesting the deviate gene is not linked to general vigor or the ability/motivation of termites to move and forage. These findings are among the first linking the expression of a termite gene with eusocial behavior; they illustrate the connection between deviate expression and trailing behavior, which is a key evolutionary adaptation vital to subterranean social insects such as termites and ants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3aRNA interference 3aReticulitermes flavipes 3abinding proteins 3abioassays 3abody regions 3acaste determination 3aevolutionary adaptation 3afeeding level 3aforaging 3agene expression 3agenes 3ajuvenile hormones 3amessenger RNA 3amotivation 3aphotophase 3asmall interfering RNA 3asocial insects 3astarvation 3atemperature 3avigor 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBehavior, Animal 2aFeeding Behavior 2aGenes, Insect 2aInsect Proteinsxclassificationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aIsopteraxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aJuvenile Hormonesxmetabolism 2aLocomotionxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPheromonesxphysiology 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Small Interferingxgenetics1 aZhou, Xuguo1 aKambhampati, Srinivas1 aBennett, Gary W.1 aScharf, Michael E.0 tGene.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 474, no. 1-2 p.12-21dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2010.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01867naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014200173300001800315520046800333592002800801650001900829650001700848650001100865650004400876650001600920700002600936700002500962700003600987700002701023700002401050700002501074700002301099700002701122700002101149700001301170700002401183773015501207856008601362852000901448655001201457IND60549822620221120101732.0160909e20150626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054982262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b002562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShubina, Larisa

Homologues of this gene were also identified in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. We set out to explore the mobile elements involved in the acquisition and spread of this gene in publicly available and complete genomes of Pseudomonas spp. All Pseudomonas complete genomes were downloaded from NCBI’s Refseq library and were inspected for the presence of the crpP gene. The mobile elements carrying this gene were further characterized. The crpP gene was identified only in P. aeruginosa, in more than half of the complete chromosomes (61.9%, n = 133/215) belonging to 52 sequence types, of which the high-risk clone ST111 was the most frequent. We identified 136 crpP-harboring integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), with 93.4% belonging to the mating-pair formation G (MPFG) family. The ICEs were integrated at the end of a tRNAᴸʸˢ gene and were all flanked by highly conserved 45-bp direct repeats. The crpP-carrying ICEs contain 26 core genes (2.2% of all 1193 genes found in all the ICEs together), which are present in 99% or more of the crpP-harboring ICEs. The most frequently encoded traits on these ICEs include replication, transcription, intracellular trafficking and cell motility. Our work suggests that ICEs are the main vectors promoting the dissemination of the ciprofloxacin-modifying crpP gene in P. aeruginosa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter baumannii 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3acell movement 3achromosomes 3agenes 3aphysiological transport 3aplasmids1 aGrosso, Filipa 1 aPeixe, Luísa 0 tGenes.g2020 Aug. 04, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110808893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245012200202300001700324520086100341592002801202650001201230650001101242650002001253650001001273650001001283650001901293650001101312650001401323650001101337650001401348650001801362650001201380650001801392651001601410651001401426700002101440773011101461856008101572852000901653655001201662IND60620183320221119224627.0181106e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062018332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-018-9568-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsare, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5554-241110aAdoption and extent of adoption of georeferenced grid soil sampling technology by cotton producers in the southern US  ap. 992-1010.  aThis study investigates the producer/farm characteristics that influence the adoption and extent of adoption of georeferenced grid soil sampling technology, using the two-part model, among cotton producers in the southern U.S. The extent of adoption is the number of acres grid soil sampled.

The study identified producers’ awareness of a cost-share reimbursement program, percentage of income from cotton production, the use of yield map, ownership of livestock, land acreage devoted to other crops, and cotton production in Mississippi and Tennessee as important variables that influence the extent of adoption of georeferenced soil sampling technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacreage 3acotton 3acrop production 3acrops 3afarms 3ageoreferencing 3aincome 3alivestock 3amodels 3aownership 3asoil sampling 3asurveys 3ayield mapping 3aMississippi 3aTennessee1 aSegarra, Eduardo0 tPrecision agriculture.g2018 Dec., v. 19, no. 6 p.992-1010dSpringer USwJournal:jnl58474x1385-22567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11119-018-9568-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014200170300001600312520182000328592002802148650001502176650001402191650001602205650002302221650002002244650001102264650001702275650001102292650003302303650002402336650001002360653002902370653004302399653001602442653001502458653001902473700001402492700001602506700001502522700001402537773007702551856008502628852000902713655001202722IND60581476720221116170633.0171005e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058147672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.05.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Chunjing10aHairpin assembly circuit-based fluorescence cooperative amplification strategy for enzyme-free and label-free detection of small molecule  ap. 101-106.  aHere, we developed an enzyme-free, label-free, and sensitive fluorescence cooperative amplification strategy based on a hairpin assembly circuit which coupled catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) with hybridization chain reaction (HCR) for small molecule adenosine. A double-strand DNA probe with aptamer-catalysis strand (Apt-C) and inhibit strand (Inh) was designed for adenosine recognition and signal transduction which was named as Apt-C/Inh. Hairpins H1 and H2 were employed for constructing the CHA, and hairpins H3 and H4 for the HCR. Through the binding of adenosine and the Apt-C, the Inh was released from the Apt-C/Inh. Then the free Apt-C initiated the CHA through successively opening H1 and H2, generating H1/H2 complex and recyclable Apt-C. Next, the released Apt-C entered another CHA cycle, and the H1/H2 complex further initiated the HCR of H3 and H4 which induced the formation of the concatemers of H3/H4 complex. Such a process brought the two ends of hairpins H3 into close proximity, yielding numerous integrated G-quadruplexes which were initially sequestered in the stem and two terminals of H3. Finally, N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) was added to generate an enhanced fluorescence signal. In the proposed strategy, driven only by the energy from hybridization, one target could trigger multiple HCR events via CHA-based target-cycle, leading to a remarkable enzyme-free amplification for adenosine. The detection limit could achieve as low as 9.7 × 10−7molL−1. Furthermore, G-quadruplexes were applied to construct label-free hairpin assembly circuit, which made it more simple and cost-effective. The satisfactory recoveries were obtained when detecting adenosine in spiked human serum and urine samples, demonstrating the feasibility of this detection strategy in biological samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA probes 3aadenosine 3ablood serum 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3ahybridization chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3aurine 0aHairpin assembly circuit 0aFluorescence cooperative amplification 0aEnzyme-free 0aLabel-free 0aSmall molecule1 aZhu, Jing1 aSun, Jiewei1 aJiang, Wei1 aWang, Lei0 tTalanta.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 143 p.101-106dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.05.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245016100207506011700368506007600485520143000561592002801991506003702019650001402056650000902070650002502079650001502104651001302119653003002132653002202162653001902184653003802203653002502241653001002266700002002276700001902296773010102315856008302416852000902499655001202508IND60750987420221207053000.0220802e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075098742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.1009152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarka, Arus Edo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0117-219X10aSpatial-temporal rainfall trend and variability assessment in the Upper Wabe Shebelle River Basin, Ethiopia: Application of innovative trend analysis method  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUpper Wabe Shebelle River Basin (UWSRB), Ethiopia. This study investigated the spatio-temporal patterns or trends and spatial distribution and variability of rainfall in seasonal and annual time-series. The rainfall variability was evaluated by the coefﬁcient of variation (CV), precipitation concentration index (PCI), and standardized anomaly index (SAI). The spatio-temporal trends were also analyzed using the Mann–Kendall test (MK), Sen's slope estimators (SSE), and the latest technique of innovative trend analysis (ITA) method was used for analyzing the low, medium and high rainfall clusters. In most of the rainfall stations, high amount of annual rainfall happened in the Kiremt (wet) season, and high rainfall variability was during the Bega (dry) season. During the annual rainfall, the MK test and SSE were statistically non-significant in some stations, and heavy rainfall was detected in the Kiremt and Belg (transition) seasons. For the Kiremt and annual period, most rainfall stations showed high rainfall cluster and increasing trends, while low rainfall was observed in Bega season which exhibited decreasing trends. The outcomes of comparison revealed that the ITA method is more robust and surpassed the MK test as it could detect monotonic and non-monotonic trends that cannot be observed by the MK method. The result of this study is helpful for water resources planning and management in UWSRB.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahydrology 3arain 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 3aEthiopia 0aInnovative trend analysis 0aRainfall clusters 0aMann–Kendall 0aMonotonic and non-Monotonic trend 0aRainfall variability 0aUWSRB1 aJilo, Nura Boru1 aBehulu, Fiseha0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Oct., v. 37 p.100915-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.1009153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009400169300001800263520205700281592002802338650002402366650002302390650001402413650000902427650001002436650001202446650002602458650001402484650001902498650001602517650001102533650001302544650004302557650001902600650001502619650002002634650001602654650001702670650001502687651001402702700001802716700006102734773011202795856008102907852000902988655001202997IND60620183420221119224450.0181106e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062018342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-018-9570-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarrell, Mauricio10aSpectral indices from aerial images and their relationship with properties of a corn crop  ap. 1127-1137.  aIdentification of areas with similar restrictions to crop productivity could improve the efficiency to manage agricultural systems, guarantee stable yields, and reduce the effect of droughts in rainfed systems. The ability of any vegetation index to discriminate N and moisture-related changes in leaf reflectance would present an important advantage over the present diagnostic system which involves soil-testing for moisture and available N. The purpose of the study was to calibrate different vegetation indices regarding their capacity to identify water and nitrogen availability for rainfed corn crops in the semiarid Pampas of Argentina. A field experiment with corn with a control without fertilization (N0), and fertilized with 120 kg ha⁻¹ of nitrogen (N120) was used. Two sites, Low (L) and High (H), were identified within the field, according to their altimetry, a multi-spectral aerial photography was taken from a manned airplane during flowering stage of the corn crop, and four spectral indices were calculated (NDVI, green NDVI, NGRDI, (NIR/GREEN)-1). At six georeferenced points at each site soil texture, organic matter, available phosphorus, nitrogen and moisture contents as well as corn aerial biomass and grain yield were determined. The two sites differed in most of the evaluated soil properties, crop biomass and grain yield. The spectral information obtained at crop flowering showed clear differences between sites H and L for all four indices, indicating that any of these would be able to detect the differences in soil moisture and fertility among these environments. Both (NIR/GREEN)-1 and green NDVI had the best correlation with crop yield determined in the field, and therefore could be considered most appropriate for estimating corn yields from images taken at flowering. For estimation of N requirements, green NDVI differentiated best between fertilized and non-fertilized crop in the moisture limited environment (H), while (NIR/GREEN)-1 performed better in the site where soil moisture was non-limiting (L).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aaerial photography 3aaltimetry 3acorn 3acrops 3adrought 3afield experimentation 3aflowering 3ageoreferencing 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3arainfed farming 3areflectance 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3aArgentina1 aGili, Adriana1 aNoellemeyer, Elke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6229-59380 tPrecision agriculture.g2018 Dec., v. 19, no. 6 p.1127-1137dSpringer USwJournal:jnl58474x1385-22567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11119-018-9570-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245017300170500002200343520151300365592002801878650001501906650001501921650001401936650002701950650002001977650002001997650004302017650001102060650001702071650001402088650001902102650001302121650001602134650002302150653004902173653002102222653003502243653002502278653001702303700002002320700002402340700002302364773009602387856008602483852000902569655001202578IND60581476820221116170810.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058147682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Zhao-Hong10aFabrication of ofloxacin imprinted polymer on the surface of magnetic carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals for highly selective adsorption of fluoroquinolones from water  aPre-press version  aA novel adsorbent with high selectivity for fluoroquinolone (FQ) compounds was developed, based on the surface functionalization of magnetic carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals (M-CCNs) with molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) comprising amine moieties. The imprinting was achieved by a radical polymerization technique, which uses glycidyl methacrylate, tetraethylenepentamine, ofloxacin, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, and azobisisobutyronitrile as the functional monomer, active groups provider, template molecule, crosslinking agent, and initiator, respectively. The developed material (M-CCNs@MIP) was comprehensively characterized and shown to exhibit high adsorption capacity and selectivity with rapid equilibration time. Moreover, the adsorption isotherms could be well-fitted with the Freundlich model, and the adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order model. The maximum adsorption capacities for M-CCNs@MIP after 2 and 20min were 34.09 and 40.65mgg−1, respectively, compared to 9.98 and 15.28mgg−1 observed for the unimprinted polymer (M-CCNs@NIP). By coupling the M-CCNs@MIP adsorbent with high-performance liquid chromatography, an approach was established to enhance the selective adsorption of seven structurally similar FQ compounds in river water samples. The recoveries of the seven FQs ranged from 81.2 to 93.7%, and the limits of detection were between 5.4 and 12.0ngmL−1. The M-CCNs@MIP adsorbent also retained good performance after seven consecutive cycles of reuse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acellulose 3across-linking reagents 3adetection limit 3aethylene glycol 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3aofloxacin 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3ariver water 3asorption isotherms 0aMagnetic carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals 0aFluoroquinolones 0aMolecularly imprinted polymers 0aSelective adsorption 0aRegeneration1 aWang, Yan–Fei1 aOmer, Ahmed Mohamed1 aOuyang, Xiao–kun0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013900158520151700297592002801814650001501842650002901857650001001886650001201896650002201908650002101930650001501951650001101966650001201977650001701989651001602006700001602022700002102038700002002059773012302079856007302202852000902275655001202284IND60647881020221119214530.0190623e20180704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064788102DNAL7 a10.3390/d100300552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhelps, Kendra10aAssemblage and Species Threshold Responses to Environmental and Disturbance Gradients Shape Bat Diversity in Disturbed Cave Landscapes  aEcological thresholds represent a critical tipping point along an environmental gradient that, once breached, can have irreversible consequences for species persistence and assemblage structure. Thresholds can also be used to identify species with the greatest sensitivity to environmental changes. Bats are keystone species yet are under pressure from human disturbances, specifically landscape and cave disturbances (i.e., reduced forest cover, urbanization, hunting, tourism). We compared bat assemblages across environmental and disturbance gradients measured at 56 caves in the Philippines to identify species-specific thresholds and assess congruence among species responses. All species exhibited significant responses to one or more gradients, with 84% responding to more than one gradient. Yet mixed responses of sensitivity to some gradients but tolerance to others hindered identification of assemblage thresholds to all gradients except landscape disturbance. However, we identified credible indicator species that exhibit distinct thresholds to specific gradients and tested for differences in ecological and morphological traits between species groups with shared responses (i.e., negative or positive). Few traits were useful for discriminating the direction of a species response, with some exceptions. Species that responded positively to increased landscape disturbance and hunting had greater body mass, whereas species that responded negatively to mining emitted higher peak call frequencies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aanthropogenic activities 3acaves 3aforests 3aindicator species 3akeystone species 3alandscapes 3amining 3atourism 3aurbanization 3aPhilippines1 aJose, Reizl1 aLabonite, Marina1 aKingston, Tigga0 tDiversity.g2018 July 04, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d100300553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008600165300001400251520118200265592002801447596011001475650001501585650002701600650003001627650001801657650001401675650001201689650002201701650002001723650001401743650001601757650001001773650001001783700001301793700001601806700002001822700001301842700002101855700001701876773011401893856008302007852000902090655001202099IND60782884120221123031106.0220714e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078288412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10905-022-09799-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Sheng10aInfluence of Parasitoid States on the Propensity to Enter and the Stay in a Patch  ap. 56-64.  aPatch exploitation strategies have received considerable attention since the development of the marginal value theorem. As an excellent biological research object, parasitoids have been extensively studied in regard to patch exploitation, including the effect of parasitoid states. Longevity and fecundity are state-dependent traits that may affect foraging decisions, oviposition behavior and patch residence time. We investigated the impact of Trichopria drosophilae (Hymenoptera: Diapriidae) states on patch exploitation. As an important endoparasitic wasp in the Drosophila pupal stage, T. drosophilae has potential as a biological control agent. Our results demonstrate that female age, food availability and mating state modulated the patch residence time of T. drosophilae. In addition, the time taken for females to enter a patch was changed by oviposition experience, age, and food availability. Our results are consistent with models that predict that the patch exploitation strategy must be fundamentally dynamic in parasitoids. Differences between patch foraging behavior in wasps with different internal state can be explained by the maximum fitness they achieved.  aPublisher supplied data  a31672351, 31172145cinnovative research group project of the national natural science foundation of china 3aDrosophila 3aTrichopria drosophilae 3abiological control agents 3aendoparasites 3afecundity 3afemales 3afood availability 3ainsect behavior 3alongevity 3aoviposition 3apupae 3awasps1 aQian, Bo1 aIlyas, Amna1 aGong, Xiao-meng1 aXu, Jing1 aLiu, Peng-Cheng,1 aHu, Hao-yuan0 tJournal of insect behavior.g2022 May, v. 35, no. 1-3 p.56-64dSpringer USwJournal:jnl43293x0892-75537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10905-022-09799-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245017900172300001400351520117300365536042701538592002801965650001401993650002102007650001802028650000902046650001502055650002202070650001102092650001702103650000902120650001302129650002502142653002602167653001602193653003502209653001602244653001702260700002702277700001802304773011202322856008002434852000902514655001202523IND60623881220221117220529.0181129e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062388122DNAL7 a10.1177/08987564166572322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnyder, Lindsey B.

Results of this study demonstrate that the addition of buprenorphrine may enhance the analgesic duration of effect for bupivacaine regional nerve blocks. In addition, the use of bupivacaine alone may have analgesia that exceeds 24 hours in many cases. Although not statistically significant based on sample size, 50% of dogs receiving the bupivacaine/buprenorphine regional anesthetic block demonstrated a decreased anesthetic requirement 48 hours postadministration when compared to 25% of dogs receiving the bupivacaine anesthetic. No adverse cardiorespiratory effects were noted secondary to either local anesthetic treatment. Use of bupivacaine may have analgesic effects extending greater than 24 hours (24-72) when used in regional anesthetic blocks in veterinary dental patients with acute dental pain. The addition of buprenorphine to bupivacaine may extend the duration of analgesia (48-96 h). The limited sample size, in addition to patient variability in response to medications, may account for the fact that no differences were detected between the treatments administered.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by a grant provided by the Academy of Veterinary Dentistry.

The addition of a single neutron to a protium atom results in the near doubling of its mass, which gives rise to deuterium’s characteristic isotope effects. Since the incorporation of deuterium into organic substrates is known to alter enzyme/protein–substrate interactions, we tested the extent to which deuterium enrichment would modify fungal secondary metabolite production. Several fungal cultures were tested, and in all cases their secondary metabolomes were marked by changes in natural product production. Workup of one Aspergillus sp. grown under deuterium-enrichment conditions resulted in the production of several secondary metabolites not previously detected from the fungus. Bioassay testing revealed that in comparison to the inactive crude fungal extract derived from growing the fungus under non-deuterium-enriched conditions, an extract derived from the same isolate cultured in a deuterium-enriched medium inhibited methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Using an assortment of NMR and mass spectrometry experiments, we were able to identify the bacterial inhibitor as an isotope-labeled version of pigmentosin A (6). Five additional isotopically labeled metabolites were also obtained from the fungus including brevianamide F (1), stephacidin A (2), notoamide D (3), notoamide L (4), and notoamide C (5). Given the assorted changes observed in the secondary metabolite profiles of this and other fungi grown in deuterium-enriched environments, as well as the fact that 1 and 3–6 had not been previously observed from the Aspergillus sp. isolate used in this study, we propose that deuterium enrichment might offer an effective method for further expanding a fungus’s chemical diversity potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aantibiotic resistance 3abioassays 3adeuterium 3afungi 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolome 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asecondary metabolites 3astable isotopes1 aPark, Elizabeth M.1 aKing, Jarrod

The studies describing the molecular basis of fish growth and development, as well as studies on genetic variation underlying the ecological and evolutionary adaptations of the genus Oncorhynchus, are evaluated. Systemic changes in small, long, and circular noncoding RNAs profiles that occur in fish transcriptomes in response to different effects are characterized. The identified signaling cascades, which play key roles in the development of economically valuable traits, can be used as targets for selective fish breeding within the framework of targeted commercial traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus 3aanimal growth 3aaquaculture 3afish 3agenetic variation 3agrowth and development 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aShitova, M.

However, coverage and reliability of satellite data products depend on atmospheric conditions and surface concentrations have to be retrieved from AOD. This study investigates the potential to produce reliable maps of PM₂.₅ surface concentrations for Germany and parts of the surrounding countries using AOD based on observations by three different satellite sensors. For the first time, AOD retrievals from the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) onboard Sentinel-3A are used together with those from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the two NASA platforms Terra and Aqua. We investigate the differences and similarities of the three different satellite products in terms of coverage, resolution and algorithmic performances. Based on this analysis we examine the suitability and advantage of a combination of these data sets. We can substantiate an increase in mean daily coverage from a maximum of 10.2% for the individual products to 16.7% for the ensemble product. Using a semi-empirical linear regression model, we derive surface-level PM₂.₅ concentrations and attain an overall correlation of 0.76 between satellite-derived and in-situ measured PM₂.₅ concentrations. By considering surface measurements, the systematic error (bias) and the root mean square error (RMSE) can be significantly reduced. The general model performance is evaluated by a 5-fold cross validation and the relative prediction error (RPE).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaerosols 3amodel validation 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asurface temperature 3atroposphere 3aGermany 0aAerosol optical depth (AOD) 0aFine particulate matter (PM2.5) 0aMODIS 0aSLSTR 0aGermany1 aErbertseder, Thilo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4888-10651 aSchaap, Martijn1 aBaier, Frank0 tRemote sensing applications.g2022 Apr., v. 26 p.100716-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.1007163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013100170300001800301520149500319592002801814650001501842650001601857650000901873650001101882650001201893650001001905650001201915650001101927650001201938650001601950650001601966650001201982650001101994700002602005700002602031700002302057773012602080856008102206852000902287655001202296IND60616497020221122124102.0181017e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061649702DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-018-1538-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinger, Rodrigo B.10aFound again: the extremely rare Codonorchis canisioi (Orchidaceae: Codonorchideae) reappears after being missing for 78 years  ap. 1157-1163.  aTo date, the endangered terrestrial orchid Codonorchis canisioi was only known from two collections at its type locality. This plant has not been collected since 1935 and is currently considered as Critically Endangered in the Brazilian list of threatened flora. We recently found two small populations about 174 km from the type locality. We thus seized the opportunity to make a complete record of morphological traits, aiming to fill the gaps of the short and non-illustrated protologue. Plant, flower (including details of column and pollinarium) and fruit features are here illustrated and discussed in detail. Overall, plant and flower features are similar to those of the widespread Patagonian C. lessonii. Yet, both species can be separated by a number of vegetative and floral features. Female Augochlorine Halictidae bees were recorded as pollinators. Fruits mature quickly (15–19 days after pollination). Plants wither by middle October, resting underground as very small (3–5 mm diameter) roundish tubers. The two newly found populations are in privately owned areas and prone to both fire and cattle grazing. Due to the small size of each population (estimated in less than 200 individuals), it is likely that this species would still be considered as CR (Critically Endangered) when formally and properly surveyed under the IUCN criteria. Since plants are small and strongly seasonal, more field surveys are necessary to locate other potentially overlooked populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalictidae 3aOrchidaceae 3abees 3acattle 3afemales 3aflora 3aflowers 3afruits 3agrazing 3apollination 3apollinators 3asurveys 3atubers1 aBuzatto, Cristiano R.1 aSanguinetti, Agustín1 aNervo, Michelle H.0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2018 Nov., v. 304, no. 9 p.1157-1163dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6813x0378-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-018-1538-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245007100178300001400249500001900263500002000282520141700302592002801719650001901747650001901766650001101785650001701796650001101813650001501824650002501839650001101864650001101875650002101886650002501907650001101932650001601943700002001959700001801979773011601997856009002113852000902203655001202212IND60734294720221118023622.0210417e198701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073429472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1987.tb00111.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDOWNTON, W.

The onset of the decline in photosynthesis occurred earlier in the day for vines without fruit. Decreases in photosynthesis were approximately proportional to changes in stomatal conductance. Despite the accompanying large changes in stomatal conductance, changes in intercellular CO₂ concentration were small and mathematical analysis showed that stomatal changes accounted for only 20 to 40% of the change in assimilation rate. The CO₂ compensation point, oxygen enhancement of photosynthesis, light and temperature responses of the leaf did not vary throughout the day. Stimulation of photorespiration was therefore not responsible for the non‐stomatal inhibition of photosynthesis. No obvious correlation existed between the decline in leaf photosynthesis and daily changes in leaf water potential. A field study of Colombard grape vines revealed that frequently watered vines which had received irrigation 2 d prior to measurement showed little change in photosynthetic rate over the day compared with vines subjected to a more usual watering cycle, which had last been irrigated 18 d prior to measurement. Possible non‐stomatal factors responsible for the reduction in photosynthesis during the day are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3acarbon dioxide 3afruits 3agas exchange 3agrapes 3airrigation 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3aoxygen 3aphotorespiration 3astomatal conductance 3asugars 3atemperature1 aGRANT, W.

Although several hypotheses have been formulated, the molecular basis of such enzymatic regiospecificity is unclear. We have here combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations with molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the peroxidation mechanism using a complete rabbit 15-LO-1/LA solvated model. C₉ and C₁₃ being equivalent for planarity and spin density, the QM/MM potential energy profiles of the O₂ addition to those two atoms were calculated. The difference in the potential energy barrier heights is clear enough to justify that O₂ selectively attacks C₁₃ giving 13-(S)-HPODE. Oxygenation at C₉ is hindered by two steric-shielding residues (Leu597 and Gln548). The calculated free energy profile at 300 K for the O₂ addition to C₁₃ confirms that the peroxidation on C₁₃ is a reversible viable process in agreement with experiments. Thus, the subsequent reduction of the peroxyl radical to give the final hydroperoxidated product is expected to give the irreversibility character to the overall process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aenergy 3alinoleic acid 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxygen 3aperoxidation 3aquantum mechanics 3arabbits1 aMasgrau, Laura1 aLluch, José

This process enhances patient comfort levels while simultaneously reducing pain caused by dead tissue. The purpose of this study was to investigate the in vivo toxicity of a dual hydrogel consisting of type I atelocollagen cross-linked with sodium hyaluronate hydrogel used for wound dressing. Porcine type I atelocollagen was cross-linked with sodium hyaluronate to form the hydrogel. For subcutaneous implantation, 0.5 ml of dual hydrogel was injected into two different sites of twenty rats per group. High density polyethylene rods were implanted subcutaneously to serve as a control material. Hematological assessment, blood biochemistry, histopathological, and histological evaluations were scored and graded after 4 weeks. A bioreactivity rating was used for evaluation of subacute toxicity. Differences observed in blood chemical analysis and hematological analysis between control and test groups were within normal variations and considered unrelated to the test article implantation. No significant implantation-related lesions were observed in any of the major organs of all test animals. The overall histopathological index of the test article implantation sites was evaluated as 0. The bioreactivity rating was evaluated as non-irritant after 4-week subcutaneous implantation. Overall, these results indicate that the dual hydrogel of type I atelocollagen and sodium hyaluronate is biologically and chemically safe for clinical application as a wound dressing.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood chemistry 3acrosslinking 3ahematologic tests 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrogels 3apain 3apatients 3apolyethylene 3arats 3asubacute toxicity 3aswine 3atoxicology 0aToxicity 0aCollagen 0aHyaluronate 0aHydrogel1 aKoo, Tae-Hoon1 aChen, Bide,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6922-19821 aD’Lima, Darryl D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8707-14550 tToxicology reports.g2021, v. 8 p.1651-1656dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006800167300001600235520090400251592002801155650001701183650000901200650001001209700002001219700002901239700002001268700002001288700001801308700002001326700002001346773012601366856008201492852000901574655001201583IND60782884920221123031242.0220714e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078288492DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954220700432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChernykh, V.

The frequency and spectrum of AZFc region (locus Yq11.223) deletions in Russian fertile men (n = 436) were studied. Complete AZFc (b2/b4) deletions were not detected in the studied sample; partial AZFс deletions were found in 77 (17.7%) individuals. The most frequent types of them were b2/b3 and gr/gr deletions, which were revealed in 64 (14.7%) and 10 (2.3%) patients and accounted for 72.8 and 23.3% of all detected Y chromosome microdeletions, respectively. Other (rare) types of partial AZFс deletions were detected in three (0.7%) men.

We extend Tobolsky and Eisenberg’s model of bulk sulfur polymerization to nanopores accounting for the confinement entropy of the chains and ring using scaling reported in literature. The model quantitatively captures literature data from Yannopoulos and co-workers for the extent of polymerization versus temperature for bulk sulfur polymerization and for polymerization in 20, 7.5, and 2.5 nm diameter Gelsil nanopores, assuming that the change of entropy of nanoconfined chains scales with molecular size to the second power and with nanopore diameter to either the −3.0 or −3.8 power, the former of which fits slightly better. The scaling, which is valid for strong confinement in spherical pores, predicts that the propagation equilibrium constant will depend on both nanopore size and chain length, such that the average chain length decreases significantly upon confinement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aentropy 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3ananopores 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymerization 3asulfur 3atemperature1 aSarker, Rakibul

Huge desalination capacities are installed on the western margin of the Arabian Gulf contributing to increased salinity off the coast. This paper presents long term salinity observation made near outfall of Az Zour Power and Desalination Plant in South Kuwait. The salinity values peak at around 50 ppt at observation station located in open gulf around 5 km from the outfall of the power and desalination plant. The observation highlights the stress on the local marine environment continued incremental salinity can impair the marine biodiversity in the area. The study suggests that a stringent post construction and operational offshore water quality assessment can help in early detection of potentially complex environmental issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesalination 3amarine environment 3apower plants 3asaline water 3asalinity 3awater quality 3awater supply 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aSalinity 2aSeawaterxchemistry 2aSodium Chloridexanalysis 2aWater Purification 3aBahrain 3aKuwait 3aPersian Gulf 3aQatar 3aSaudi Arabia 3aUnited Arab Emirates 0aIndian Ocean 0aKuwait1 aAl Ghadban, Abdul Nabi1 aKhabbaz, Ahmed0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2011 Oct., v. 181, no. 1-4 p.587-594dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-010-1853-1  aDNAL 7aarticle01975naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013200171300001800303520063000321592002800951650002600979650002201005650001801027650002501045650003201070650002001102650002101122650002201143700002401165700002401189700002601213700002301239700002601262700001901288700002001307773015501327856008601482852000901568655001201577IND60549823020221120143221.0160909e20150626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054982302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b003542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Andrew

In this study, hyperspectral reflectance of symptomatic and asymptomatic rice leaves infected by Pyricularia grisea Sacc, Bipolaris oryzae Shoem, Aphelenchoides besseyi Christie and Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guen was measured in a laboratory within the 350–2 500 nm spectral region. Principal component analysis was performed to obtain the principal component spectra (PCs) of different transformations of the original spectra, including original (R), common logarithm of reciprocal (lg (1/R)), and the first derivative of original and common logarithm of reciprocal spectra (R′ and (lg (1/R))′). A probabilistic neural network classifier was applied to discriminate the symptomatic rice leaves from asymptomatic ones with the front PCs. For identifying symptomatic and asymptomatic rice leaves, the mean overall discrimination accuracies for R, lg (1/R), R′ and (lg (1/R))′ were 91.3, 93.1, 92.3 and 92%, and the mean Kappa coefficients were 0.771, 0.835, 0.829 and 0.82, respectively. To discriminate between disease and insect damage, the overall accuracies for R, lg (1/R), R′ and (lg (1/R))′ were 97.7, 98.1, 100 and 100%, and the Kappa coefficients were 0.962, 0.97, 1 and 1, respectively. These results demonstrated that hyperspectral remote sensing can discriminate between multiple diseases and the insect damage of rice leaves under laboratory conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  a41301483cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a41671437cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a31371935cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a41201365cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a2010CB126200cthe National Basic Research Program (973) of China  a200903051cthe Agro-Industry R&D Special Fund of China  a201408330029cthe China Scholarship Council Foundation 3aAphelenchoides besseyi 3aBipolaris oryzae 3aCnaphalocrocis medinalis 3aMagnaporthe grisea 3adisease control 3afungal diseases of plants 3ahealth status 3ainsects 3alaboratory experimentation 3aleaves 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aprincipal component analysis 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3arice1 aQi, Jia-Guo1 aWang, Nan-Nan1 aZhu, Zeng-Rong1 aLuo, Ju1 aLiu, Li-Juan1 aTang, Jian1 aCheng, Jia-An0 tPrecision agriculture.g2018 Dec., v. 19, no. 6 p.973-991dSpringer USwJournal:jnl58474x1385-22567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11119-018-9567-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011400172300001800286520098700304592002801291650002801319650001301347650002501360650001401385650001701399650001301416650002101429650003201450650003301482650002201515650003001537700002301567700002001590700002001610700002101630700001701651700002201668773015501690856008601845852000901931655001201940IND60549823120221120152741.0160909e20150626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054982312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b003752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdjul, Delfly

The structures of 1–3 were assigned on the basis of their spectroscopic data and their comparison with those of the literature. Compounds 3 and 5–11 inhibited the growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis with inhibition zones of 10, 14, 15, 18, 14, 20, 12, and 12 mm at 20 μg/disc, respectively. All compounds were inactive (IC₅₀ > 10 μM) against Huh-7 (hepatoma) and EJ-1 (bladder carcinoma) human cancer cell lines. Three 2-oxo derivatives (1, 2, and 4) exhibited markedly reduced biological activity against M. smegmatis.

In this context, appropriate methodological tools, which can provide a biased estimation of desertification, are critical for learning from past failures and local successes in orienting desertification towards sustainable land use. This paper proposes a locally adaptive multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) algorithm to extract the rocky desertification information from medium resolution images at subpixel level and applies it to the case of Danjiangkou reservoir region (DRR), China. Quantitative comparisons show that the locally adaptive MESMA has achieved more accurate and reliable estimations of rocky desertification information in DRR than the traditional MESMA. An inversed U-shaped trend is observed for desertified land with different severity levels from 1987 and 2013 in DRR. In particular, the inflection point roughly emerged in period 2000–2005. Casual mechanism-based regressions demonstrate that such dynamics of rocky desertification are closely coupled with socioeconomic, biophysical, and policy factors. More specifically, we identify a significantly positive role of land conservation policy in combating and relieving rocky desertification in DRR. Positive effects are observed particularly through afforestation, investment, and professionals input. Based on the conclusions and lessons of DRR, I finally make relevant recommendations for formulating policies and strategies that attempt to orient desertification towards sustainable land use. The proposed locally adaptive MESMA can act as an advanced remote sensing tool to guide the conservation policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aafforestation 3aalgorithms 3adesertification 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3aprofessionals 3aremote sensing 3aChina 0aLand desertification 0aRocky desertification monitoring 0aSustainable land use management 0aSub-pixel mapping 0aSpectral unmixing 0aEcological restoration project 0aLand conservation policy0 tLand use policy.g2017 Feb., v. 61 p.171-184dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02287naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010400163300001600267520115700283592002801440650004401468650001101512650002301523650001901546650001301565650001101578650001801589650001801607650003301625650001601658650002701674700001701701700001801718773012001736856004801856852000901904655001201913IND50064199720221120115502.0130327e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006419972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-012-2186-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Qiuyue10aOptimization of Enzymatic Synthesis of Tricaprylin in Ionic Liquids by Response Surface Methodology  ap. 501-509.  aTen 1,3-dialkylimidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) have been investigated as media for the enzymatic synthesis of tricaprylin, in comparison with the conventional organic solvent hexane. The results suggested that the esterification activity of Novozym 435 was higher than Lypozyme RM IM in all the ILs assayed. Novozym 435 showed higher catalytic activity in ILs with anions Tf₂N⁻ and PF₆ ⁻ than in BF₄ ⁻ and hexane. FTIR analysis of the secondary structure of the lipase indicated that a smaller decrease of the α-helix was observed in [C₄MIM] Tf₂N and [C₄MIM] PF₆ than [C₄MIM] BF₄ and hexane, indicating that the anions of ILs might be a key factor for the activity of lipase in ILs. Process parameters (amount of lipase, caprylic acid/glycerol molar ratio, temperature and their interactive effects) were optimized in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C₄MIM]PF₆) using Novozym 435 by response surface methodology. When the reactions were performed with the lipase amount of 6.1 % substrate mass at a caprylic acid/glycerol molar ratio of 4.5:1 and 66.7 °C, a higher yield was reached up to 92.4 %.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aanions 3acatalytic activity 3aesterification 3aglycerol 3ahexane 3aionic liquids 3aoctanoic acid 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerol lipase1 aYang, Liping1 aMeng, Xianghe0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2013 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.501-509dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-012-2186-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245015300203300001800356520180100374592002802175650001202203650002002215650001802235650003402253650001602287650001702303650001802320650000902338650002102347650002402368650003702392650001002429651001202439700001702451700006002468700002602528700001802554700005602572773013702628856008302765852000902848655001202857IND60711257320221119154550.0220312e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071125732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-019-02166-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaja, Farah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8861-349810aFood insecurity is associated with lower adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern among Lebanese adolescents: a cross-sectional national study  ap. 3281-3292.  aPURPOSE: To derive dietary patterns (DPs) of Lebanese adolescents (10–18 years) and evaluate associations between identified DPs and household food insecurity (HFI). METHODS: Data on adolescents (n = 693) were drawn from a national survey conducted in 2015 on a representative sample of Lebanese households with children. In addition to a sociodemographic questionnaire, data collection included the validated Arabic-version of the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale, used to evaluate HFI. Dietary intake was assessed using a 187-item validated food frequency questionnaire. Associations between HFI scores and DPs were examined using multiple linear regressions. RESULTS: HFI was observed in 55.2% of the study sample. Two DPs were derived among adolescents: Western and Lebanese-Mediterranean (LM). The Western DP was characterized by higher consumption of sweetened beverages, fast foods, sweets, and refined grains, whereas the LM DP was characterized by higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and whole grains. Scores of the Western DP were negatively associated with fiber, calcium, iron, and vitamins A and D, while the LM DP scores were positively correlated with fiber, proteins, iron, calcium, and vitamins A and D (p < 0.01). LM DP scores were also negatively correlated with total fat, saturated and polyunsaturated fats, p < 0.05. After adjustment for sociodemographics, multiple linear regression showed that higher HFI scores were associated with lower adherence to LM DP among adolescents (β = − 0.026, 95% CI − 0.046, − 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: HFI was associated with lower adherence to the Mediterranean pattern among Lebanese adolescents. Preventive strategies are needed to promote better diet quality among food-insecure youth.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3adata collection 3aeating habits 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3afood quality 3afood security 3airon 3anational surveys 3aregression analysis 3asociodemographic characteristics 3ayouth 3aLebanon1 aItani, Leila1 aKharroubi, Samer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2355-27191 aDiab El Harake, Marwa1 aHwalla, Nahla1 aJomaa, Lamis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3046-45810 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2020 Oct., v. 59, no. 7 p.3281-3292dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-019-02166-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002100167245007300188300001400261520186700275592002802142650001602170650001502186650001602201650001002217650001302227650001102240650001202251650001402263650002902277650001202306650006402318650001402382650002802396650003202424650006202456650003702518650006202555700002002617700002802637773007802665856008202743852000902825655001202834IND60098905120221116151534.0141105e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009890512DNAL7 a211951422pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2010.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Faou, Perrine14aThe zebrafish genes encoding the Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) 1  ap. 10-21.  aPolycomb repression controls regulation of hundreds of genes involved in development, signalling or cancer and is mediated by essentially two classes of chromatin-associated protein complexes, the Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). PRC2 trimethylates histone H3 at Lysine 27 and this H3K27me3 epigenetic mark serves as a docking site for the PRC1 protein complex. Drosophila core PRC1 is composed of four subunits, Polycomb (Pc), Posterior sex combs (Psc), Polyhomeotic (Ph), and Sex combs extra (Sce). Each of these proteins has multiple orthologs in vertebrates. In particular, mammalian genomes encode five Pc family members (CBX2, 4, 6, 7 and 8), six Psc family members (BMI1, PCGF1, 2, 3, 5, and 6), three Ph family members (PHC1, 2 and 3) and two Sce family members (RING1 and RNF2) generating an enormous scope for potential combinatorial diversity. In order to identify the corresponding PRC1 genes in zebrafish, homology searches were undertaken and allowed the identification of a total of 19 genes. Using phylogenetic, gene organization and gene location analyses, these genes were classified. The zebrafish genes encoding the PRC1 protein complex include 8 Pc orthologs (cbx2, cbx4, cbx6a, cbx6b, cbx7a, cbx7b, cbx8a and cbx8b), 6 Psc orthologs (bmi1a, bmi1b, pcgf1, pcgf5a, pcgf5b and pcgf6), 4 Ph orthologs (phc1, phc2a, phc2b and phc3) and a single Sce ortholog (rnf2). Our results indicate that the potentially high number of distinct PRC1 protein complexes generated by the components combinatorial appeared early in the vertebrate evolution. In addition to conserved gene organization and syntenies, transcript analyses revealed that transcriptional regulation leading to various isoforms syntheses is also conserved at genes encoding the PRC1 components, highlighting a possible important biological role of these isoforms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aDrosophila 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3ahistones 3alysine 3amammals 3aphylogeny 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aPolycomb-Group Proteins 2aProtein Interaction Mapping 2aRepressor Proteinsxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aZebrafishxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aZebrafish Proteinsxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aVölkel, Pamela1 aAngrand, Pierre-Olivier0 tGene.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 475, no. 1 p.10-21dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2010.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245009800208520125600306592002801562650001901590650002401609650001701633650001801650650002301668650001801691650001701709650001801726650001701744650001501761650001801776650001601794653006901810653003401879653002501913653002701938653001701965653002801982700005802010700001802068700002002086773008302106856008202189852000902271655001202280IND60750988220221122055158.0220214s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075098822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mex.2021.1015142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJalālī, ʻAlī,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5533-220010aIntegrative programming for simulation of packaging headspace and shelf life of fresh produce  aFresh horticultural products are exposed to different environmental conditions from farm to fork.

Resistance to thiophanate-methyl and diethofencarb was observed in all isolates. Resistance to all the three fungicides, thiophanate-methyl, diethofencarb, and procymidone was detected at a frequency of 6.0%. The F167Y single mutation in the β-tubulin gene was found to be associated with resistance to thiophanate-methyl,but no mutation was found in the coiled-coil region of the histidine kinase-encoding gene OS1, a fungal gene for dicarboximide resistance. Procymidone applied at the rate of 20 mg l⁻¹ inhibited spot lesion formation on tobacco leaves with an efficacy of 51.7% for the low resistance (LR) isolates and 74.2% for the procymidone-sensitive isolates. Thiophanate-methyl applied at 100 mg l⁻¹, however, slightly promoted the expansion of disease lesions with an efficacy of −7.7%. Azoxystrobin applied at 10 and 20 mg l⁻¹ provided efficacies of 91.1 and 100%, respectively, regardless of whether the isolates were thiophanate-methyl resistant or procymidone-LR. Further studies suggested that azoxystrobin exhibited excellent protective activity and good curative activity against A. alternata in plants. The baseline sensitivity to azoxystrobin was then determined. In the presence SHAM, the mean EC₅₀ values for conidial germination inhibition were 0.49 ± 0.22 (Mean ± SD) mg l⁻¹. Interestingly, no resistance was recovered through UV irradiation or Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated mutagenesis. This research indicated widespread resistance to thiophanate-methyl and diethofencarb, low frequency of (6.0%) resistance to procymidone in A. alternata populations from tobacco, and suggested that azoxystrobin could potentially constitute a good alternative for the management of tobacco brown spot disease.  aPublisher supplied data  a31360448cNSFC 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aAlternaria alternata 3aazoxystrobin 3abenzimidazole 3aconidia 3adiethofencarb 3afungi 3agenes 3agermination 3ahistidine 3aleaves 3amedian effective concentration 3amutagenesis 3aprocymidone 3athiophanate-methyl 3atobacco 3atubulin 3aultraviolet radiation 3aChina1 aZhang, C.

Growing resistant cultivars is the most effective approach to control the disease. To determine inheritance of stripe rust resistance and map the resistance gene in a common wheat line D31, developed from Triticum sphaerococcum Perc. (accession number AS348), F1, F2, and BC1 progenies derived from the Taichung 29 × D31 cross were firstly inoculated with Chinese PST race CYR32 during whole growth stages under the field conditions. Genetic analysis indicated that the resistance to CYR32 in the line D31 was conferred by one recessive gene, temporarily designated as YrSph. A total of 400 simple sequence repeat (SSR), 315 pairs of sequence-related amplified polymorphism and 42 pairs of target region amplified polymorphism markers were screened, and four SSR markers and three TRAP markers were found to be polymorphic between the resistant and susceptible DNA bulks as well as their parents. Genetic linkage was tested on segregating F2 population and indicated that all of the ten markers were linked to the resistance gene, two of which flanked the locus at 8.5 and 6.9 cM, respectively. The SSR markers mapped the resistance gene on chromosome arm 2AS. The results of chromosome location and pedigree analysis indicate that YrSph was probably a novel stripe rust resistance gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPuccinia striiformis 3aTriticum aestivum 3acultivars 3adevelopmental stages 3adisease control 3afoliar diseases 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparents 3apedigree 3araces 3arecessive genes 3atritium 3awheat1 aChen, Guo-Yue1 aChen, Hua1 aWei, Yuming,1 aLi, Wei1 aLiu, Ya-Xi1 aLiu, Deng-Cai1 aLan, Xiu-Jin1 aZheng, You-Liang0 tEuphytica.g2012 May, v. 185, no. 1 p.19-26dSpringer-Verlagx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-011-0593-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014800166520199500314592002802309650001902337650001302356650003302369650001002402650001402412650002002426650001702446650002002463650004302483650002202526650002902548650002002577653001202597653000802609653001102617653002002628700001602648700001602664700001902680773008802699856008302787852000902870655001202879IND60759655820221117062811.0220110e20220220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075965582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2021.1460972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Shuixin10aWT1 suppresses follicle-stimulating hormone-induced progesterone secretion by regulating ERK1/2 pathway in chicken preovulatory granulosa cells  aMultiple Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1) splicing variants are expressed in mammals, and these variants regulate tumorigenesis and mediate the development of multiple tissues and organs, including gonads. However, WT1 splicing variants (+KTS or -KTS) are expressed in only two nonmammalian vertebrates, and unexpectedly, their functions in chicken ovaries remain elusive. Progesterone (P4) secreted by chicken granulosa cells (GCs) participates in various physiological processes and plays an important role in maintaining reproductive performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of WT1(+KTS) and WT1(-KTS) on chicken P4 secretion in preovulatory GCs. First, we detected WT1 mRNA expression in GCs from follicles of different developmental stages by Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and found that WT1 mRNA expression was considerably increased in preovulatory GCs compared with prehierarchical GCs. Primary cells collected from preovulatory follicles were treated with WT1(+KTS) or WT1(-KTS) overexpression vectors and subsequently cultured in the absence or presence of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). The mRNA levels of FSH-receptor (FSHR) and steroidogenesis genes were determined by RT-qPCR, and the P4 levels in the cell supernatants were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Both WT1(+KTS) and WT1(-KTS) significantly decreased P4 secretion due to a reduction in FSHR, STAR and CYP11A1 mRNA levels. Western blotting revealed that ERK1/2 and BRAF phosphorylation levels were suppressed after overexpression of WT1(+KTS) or WT1(-KTS), whereas total protein and mRNA levels were not significantly changed. In addition, CREB protein and phosphorylation levels were inhibited after overexpression of WT1(+KTS) or WT1(-KTS). In conclusion, WT1(+KTS) and WT1(-KTS) inhibited CREB protein activity and significantly reduced FSHR, STAR and CYP11A1 mRNA levels, which subsequently suppressed FSH-induced P4 secretion in preovulatory GCs by modulating ERK1/2 signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3achickens 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3agenes 3aneoplasms 3aphosphorylation 3aprogesterone 3aprotein content 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aradioimmunoassays 3areproductive performance 3asteroidogenesis 0aChicken 0aWT1 0aERK1/2 0aGranulosa cells1 aLi, Xuelian1 aWu, Xiaohui1 aGong, Yanzhang0 tGene.g2022 Feb. 20, v. 812 p.146097-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2021.1460973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245015500163300001600318500001400334520121600348592002801564650002701592650002501619650001801644650001501662650001001677650002101687650001701708650001301725650001501738650001701753650001501770650001101785650002001796650002501816650001301841653001901854653001901873653001801892653001401910653002001924773011501944856007802059852000902137655001202146IND60700696720221119170641.0210108e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070069672DNAL7 a10.2478/jas-2020-00032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlavan, Gordana10aHistochemical Staining of Acetylcholinesterase in Carnolian Honeybee (Apis mellifera carnica) Brain after Chronic Exposure to Organophosphate Diazinon  ap. 123-130.  aNAL-light  aOrganophosphate insecticides are known to inhibit the activity of enzyme acetylcholinesterase. They affect olfactory learning and memory formation in honeybees. These insecticides cause mushroom body inactivation in honeybees, but their influence on other brain regions involved in olfactory perception and memory is unknown. The goal of this study was to study the effects of organophosphate insecticide diazinon on carnolian honeybee (Apis mellifera carnica) acetylcholinesterase activity in the olfactory brain regions of antennal lobe, mushroom body and lateral procerebrum (lateral horn). The lamina, medulla and lobula of optic lobes were also analyzed. The level of acetylcholinesterase activity was visualized using the histochemical staining method. Densitometric analysis of histochemical signals indicated that diazinon inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity only in the lip of calyces of mushroom body, but not in other analyzed olfactory regions, antennal lobe and lateral procerebrum. The visual brain system optic lobes were also unaffected. This is in accordance with the literature reporting that mushroom body is the main brain center for olfactory learning and memory formation in honeybees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera carnica 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aantennal lobe 3aapiculture 3acalyx 3achronic exposure 3adensitometry 3adiazinon 3ahoney bees 3ainactivation 3aliterature 3amemory 3amushroom bodies 3aolfactory perception 3astaining 0ahoneybee brain 0ahistochemistry 0amushroom body 0aolfactory 0aorganophosphate0 tJournal of apicultural science.g2020 July 02, v. 64, no. 1 p.123-130dSciendowJournal:23086x2299-48317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jas-2020-00033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013100169300001200300520112200312592002801434650002101462650001401483650001201497650001201509650001501521650002201536650001401558650001101572650001501583650002501598650001701623700002701640700001901667773012401686856008101810852000901891655001201900IND60440085420221119161223.0160903e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044008542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2503-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarks, Evan A.

We describe a statistical approach to separate somatic length classes of Folsomia candida juveniles as an endpoint for the assessment of changes in population structure. Reproduction-survival bioassays were carried out with five different biochars applied at increasing concentrations. Multi-Gaussian models parameterized juvenile size class cohorts, and the biomass of each size class cohort was estimated. Population structure was modified by both material type as well as concentration. Both biomass and population structure were sensitive to effects not reflected in juvenile number, the classic endpoint. Treatments with more size classes and larger individuals were taken to represent favorable conditions, and less size classes and smaller individuals indicated less favorable conditions. This extension of the standardized test provided additional information about the demography of the population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFolsomia candida 3abioassays 3abiochar 3abiomass 3ademography 3aindicator species 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3apopulation 3apopulation structure 3asoil quality1 aMolowny-Horas, Roberto1 aDomene, Xavier0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2015 Aug., v. 226, no. 8 p.237-237dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-015-2503-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010700168300001600275520134600291592002801637650002401665650001101689650003701700650001901737650002401756650001201780650003001792653002101822653006401843653005201907653003701959653002401996700001802020700002002038700001802058700002302076700001902099700001902118700001902137700002102156773012202177856008202299852000902381655001202390IND60089803020221123022329.0160728e20130927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008980302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Feng-Jung10aStructure of native oligomeric Sprouty2 by electron microscopy and its property of electroconductivity  ap. 351-356.  aReceptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) regulate many cellular processes, and Sprouty2 (Spry2) is known as an important regulator of RTK signaling pathways. Therefore, it is worth investigating the properties of Spry2 in more detail. In this study, we found that Spry2 is able to self-assemble into oligomers with a high-affinity KD value of approximately 16nM, as determined through BIAcore surface plasmon resonance analysis. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of Spry2 was resolved using an electron microscopy (EM) single-particle reconstruction approach, which revealed that Spry2 is donut-shaped with two lip-cover domains. Furthermore, the method of energy dispersive spectrum obtained through EM was analyzed to determine the elements carried by Spry2, and the results demonstrated that Spry2 is a silicon- and iron-containing protein. The silicon may contribute to the electroconductivity of Spry2, and this property exhibits a concentration-dependent feature. This study provides the first report of a silicon- and iron-containing protein, and its 3D structure may allow us (1) to study the potential mechanism through the signal transduction is controlled by switching the electronic transfer on or off and (2) to develop a new type of conductor or even semiconductor using biological or half-biological hybrid materials in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy 3areceptor protein-tyrosine kinase 3asemiconductors 3asignal transduction 3asilicon 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aSprouty2 (Spry2) 0aElectron microscopy single particle reconstruction (EM SPR) 0aBIAcore surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore SPR) 0aEnergy dispersive spectrum (EDS) 0aElectroconductivity1 aLee, Kuan-Wei1 aLai, Chun-Chieh1 aLee, Sue-Ping1 aShen, Hsiao-Hsuian1 aTsai, Shu-Ping1 aLiu, Bang-Hung1 aWang, Ling-Mei1 aLiou, Gunn-Guang0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Sept. 27, v. 439 p.351-356dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01675naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010500172300001800277520058100295592002800876650001300904650001500917650002000932650001400952650002300966650001100989650002001000650001201020700001801032700002201050700002201072700001901094773010601113856008501219852000901304655001201313IND60579151220180316000000.0170816e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057915122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b016472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMastalir, Matthias10aCo(II) PCP Pincer Complexes as Catalysts for the Alkylation of Aromatic Amines with Primary Alcohols  ap. 3462-3465.  aEfficient alkylations of amines by alcohols catalyzed by well-defined Co(II) complexes are described that are stabilized by a PCP ligand (N,N′-bis(diisopropylphosphino)-N,N′-dimethyl-1,3-diaminobenzene) based on the 1,3-diaminobenzene scaffold.

A simulated bioremediation of a marine offshore oil spill was carried out to determine the contribution of chemical dispersants and biosurfactants on bioremediation of Haierzhan crude oil. Compared to chemical dispersants, biosurfactants were more effective at bioremediation of oil-contaminated marine environment. Rhamnolipids did enhance the bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon compounds with a coefficient of 9.02 using the RSM equation, which is much higher than a coefficient of 4.42 observed with the commercial chemical dispersants GM-2. There was a synergistic effect between Dioctyl Sodium Sulfosuccinate (DOSS) and GM-2 on the bioremediation of crude oil, with the coefficient for the two factors being 16.58, while, the contribution of rhamnolipid with GM-2 resulted in a negative effect on crude oil biodegradation, with a coefficient −7.72. The strain LSH-7′ grew very well when the medium were amended with biosurfactants as the sole carbon source, indicating that the biosurfactants have no toxic effect on the hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3abiosurfactants 3acarbon 3aequations 3ahuman health 3ahydrocarbons 3amarine environment 3amicroorganisms 3aoil spills 3apetroleum 3aresearchers 3arhamnolipids 3asodium 3asynergism 3atoxicity 0aChemical dispersant 0aBiosurfactant 0aBioremediation 0aCrude oil 0aResponse surface methodology1 aBao, Mutai1 aLiu, Yuanqiang1 aLu, Taiyu1 aHe, Rui0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 June 01, v. 153 p.74-82dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.1203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245005300153300001600206520123200222592002801454650000801482650001501490650001501505650001601520650001501536650001701551650002101568650001601589650001801605650002101623650000701644650001501651650001601666650002101682700001601703773009601719856007501815852000901890655001201899IND60577209120221123011801.0170807e20150113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057720912DNAL7 a10.1021/la503917j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Biwu10aDNA Adsorption by Indium Tin Oxide Nanoparticles  ap. 371-377.  aThe high conductivity and optical transparency of indium tin oxide (ITO) has made it a popular material in the electronic industry. Recently, its application in biosensors is also explored. To understand its biointerface chemistry, we herein investigate its interaction with fluorescently labeled single-stranded oligonucleotides using ITO nanoparticles (NPs). The fluorescence of DNA is efficiently quenched after adsorption, and the interaction between DNA and ITO NPs is strongly dependent on the surface charge of ITO. At low pH, the ITO surface is positively charged to afford a high DNA adsorption capacity. Adsorption is also influenced by the sequence and length of DNA. For its components, In₂O₃ adsorbs DNA more strongly while SnO₂ repels DNA at neutral pH. The DNA adsorption property of ITO is an averaging result from both components. DNA adsorption is confirmed to be mainly by the phosphate backbone via displacement experiments using free phosphate or DNA bases. Last, DNA-induced DNA desorption by forming duplex DNA is demonstrated on ITO, while the same reaction is more difficult to achieve on other metal oxides including CeO₂, TiO₂, and Fe₃O₄ because these particles adsorb DNA more tightly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadsorption 3abiosensors 3aceric oxide 3adesorption 3afluorescence 3aindium tin oxide 3airon oxides 3ananoparticles 3aoligonucleotides 3apH 3aphosphates 3atin dioxide 3atitanium dioxide1 aLiu, Juewen0 tLangmuir.g2015 Jan. 13, v. 31, no. 1 p.371-377dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla503917j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012400167300001600291520103100307592002801338650001901366650002301385650002001408650003801428650002601466650002201492650001401514650001001528653002001538653001301558653001701571653001501588653001001603700001501613700001701628700001701645700001701662700001701679700001401696773009501710856008401805852000901889655001201898IND60480044020221121032128.0160125e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048004402DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.43.2014.2.152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTölgyesi, Á.12aA LC-MS/MS confirmatory method for determination of chloramphenicol in real samples screened by competitive immunoassay  ap. 306-314.  aA new liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method was developed to confirm chloramphenicol (CAP) residues in foods of animal origin and in urine samples, which were earlier found positive under the screening analysis, performed by competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) technique.

The decision limit of the confirmatory method was determined as 0.02 μg kg<sup>−1</sup> for CAP in each validated matrix, while the detection capability of the screening test was 0.15 μg kg<sup>−1</sup>.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aanimal-based foods 3achloramphenicol 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ascreening 3aurine 0achloramphenicol 0aLC-MS/MS 0aconfirmation 0avalidation 0aELISA1 aFekete, J.1 aSharma, V.K.1 aPálffi, É.1 aBékési, K.1 aLukonics, D.1 aPleva, G.0 tActa alimentaria.g2014 June 1, v. 43, no. 2 p.306-314dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.43.2014.2.153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245016100164300001600325500001500341520175400356592002802110650001402138650001602152650003002168650002202198650002702220650002102247650001102268650001502279650001902294650001702313650002102330653000702351653001202358653000702370653001102377653000902388653001402397653000802411653001702419653000802436700002002444700002202464700002102486700001902507700002102526700001902547700002202566700002202588773012202610856008202732852000902814655001202823IND60089803120221123033009.0160728e20130927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008980312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeki, Kaori10aOxidative stress potentially enhances FcεRI-mediated leukotriene C4 release dependent on the late-phase increase of intracellular glutathione in mast cells  ap. 357-362.  a2019-12-06  aCysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs), which include leukotriene C4 (LTC4), are the predominant class of LTs synthesized by mast cells. CysLTs can induce many of the abnormalities seen in asthma. LTC4 is generated by the conjugation of LTA4 with reduced glutathione (GSH) by LTC4 synthase. During screening of the effects of prostanoids on high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI)-mediated LTC4 release from mast cells, we realized that some prostanoids, including ONO-AE1-259-01 and ONO-AE-248, inhibited LTC4 release, which was associated with a decrease in the amount of intracellular total GSH. We ascertained that l-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO), a selective inhibitor of glutamate-cysteine ligase, inhibited LTC4 release. In addition, cell-permeable GSH, the glutathione reduced form ethyl ester (GSH-OEt), enhanced LTC4 release in accordance with the change in intracellular total GSH. Depletion of intracellular total GSH induced by ONO-AE-248 or BSO enhanced FcεRI-mediated LTB4 release in contrast to LTC4. Oxidative stress contributes to many pathological conditions including asthma. GSH is a major soluble antioxidant and a cofactor for several detoxifying enzymes including GSH peroxidase. Exposure of mast cells to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or diamide to mimic oxidative stress unexpectedly increased rather than decreased the intracellular reduced GSH content as well as total GSH in the late phase (i.e., 24 or 48h after exposure), which was accompanied by an increase in LTC4 release. In conclusion, FcεRI-mediated LTC4 release from mast cells is mainly regulated by the amount of intracellular GSH. In some cases, oxidative stress may induce a late-phase increase in intracellular GSH, resulting in enhanced LTC4 release from mast cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3ascreening 3aglutathione 3aglutamate-cysteine ligase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aasthma 3amast cells 3aprostaglandins 3aleukotrienes 3aoxidative stress 0aLT 0aGSH-OEt 0aEP 0aFcεRI 0aGSSG 0aMast cell 0aBSO 0aantioxidants 0aGSH1 aHisada, Takeshi1 aKawata, Tadayoshi1 aKamide, Yōsuke,1 aDobashi, Kunio1 aYamada, Masanobu1 aMori, Masatomo1 aOkajima, Fumikazu1 aIshizuka, Tamotsu0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Sept. 27, v. 439 p.357-362dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245016300168300001200331520172500343592002802068650001402096650001302110650001902123650001302142650001902155650001202174650001902186650001102205650001402216650001202230650001002242650004302252650001702295650001802312650002102330700002602351700001602377700002002393700002302413700003002436773012402466856008102590852000902671655001202680IND60440085520221119161130.0160903e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044008552DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2505-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerrón, Luis M.10aDecolorization of Textile Reactive Dyes and Effluents by Biofilms of Trametes polyzona LMB-TM5 and Ceriporia sp. LMB-TM1 Isolated from the Peruvian Rainforest  ap. 235.  aThe textile industry creates environmental problems due to the release of highly polluting effluents containing substances from different stages of dyeing that are resistant to light, water, and various chemicals, and most of them are difficult to decolorize because of its synthetic origin. The biological degradation of dyes is an economical and environmentally friendly alternative. The aim of this work was to use biofilms of basidiomycete fungi isolated from the Peruvian rainforest for the decolorization of synthetic reactive dyes, considering the advantages of these systems which include better contact with the surrounding medium, resistance to chemical and physical stress, and higher metabolic activity. Among several isolates, two were selected for their capacity of rapid decolorization of several dyes and their biofilm-forming ability. These strains were molecularly identified as Trametes polyzona LMB-TM5 and Ceriporia sp. LMB-TM1 and used in biofilm cultivation for the decolorization of six reactive dyes and textile effluents. Azo dyes were moderately decolorized by both strains, but Remazol Brilliant Blue R (anthraquinone) and Synozol Turquoise Blue HF-G (phthalocyanine) were highly decolorized (97 and 80 %, respectively) by T. polyzona LMB-TM5. Degradation products were found by HPLC analysis. Simulated effluents made of a mixture of six dyes were moderately decolorized by both strains, but a real textile effluent was highly (93 %) decolorized by T. polyzona LMB-TM5. In summary, T. polyzona LMB-TM5 was more efficient than Ceriporia sp. LMB-TM1 for the decolorization of textile dyes and effluents at high initial rates enabling the development of in-plant continuous biofilm processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeriporia 3aTrametes 3aanthraquinones 3aazo dyes 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3adecolorization 3adyeing 3aeffluents 3afabrics 3afungi 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3arain forests 3areactive dyes 3atextile industry1 aRomero-Suárez, David1 aVera, Nadia1 aLudeña, Yvette1 aVillena, Gretty K.1 aGutiérrez-Correa, Marcel0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2015 Aug., v. 226, no. 8 p.235-235dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-015-2505-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245013700179520110600316592002801422650002201450650000901472650002401481650001601505650000901521650001701530650002301547650001401570650001501584650001201599650001201611653001301623653001701636653002001653700002601673773009901699856009001798852000901888655001201897IND60700065820221122004715.0210909e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070006582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7356262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYangthong, Monsuang10aFeed intake stimulation of juvenile spotted scat (Scatophagus argus Linnaeus, 1766) using dietary seaweed supplementation (Ulva sp.)  aThis study appraised the growth performance of juvenile spotted scat when fed diets supplemented with Ulva sp. Seven isonitrogeneous and isocaloric diets with different levels of supplementation with Ulva sp. at 0 (control), 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30% were fed to 420 fish, weighing 0.49 ± 0.11 g. The diets were fed to triplicate groups of fish twice a day to apparent satiation for 10 weeks. The results showed that fish fed the diets with 5 and 10% seaweed demonstrated the highest mean WG and SGR (P < .05), whereas there were no significant differences in the FCR and PER of fish fed the control diet, and 5 and 10% seaweed (P > .05). Fish fed the control diet and that containing 5% Ulva sp. showed a lower rate of FI than fish fed diets containing 10–30% (P < .05). Moreover, dietary supplementation with seaweed at levels of 5–25% had no significant effect (P > .05) FCE although it was higher for those diets than for the fish fed the control diet and that supplemented with 30% Ulva sp. (P < .05). Therefore, 10% Ulva sp. in diet should be applied for spotted scat rearing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScatophagus argus 3aUlva 3adietary supplements 3afeed intake 3afish 3afish feeding 3agrowth performance 3ajuveniles 3amacroalgae 3arearing 3asatiety 0aUlva sp. 0aSpotted scat 0aFeed supplement1 aRuensirikul, Jirayuth0 tAquaculture.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 529 p.735626-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7356263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01450naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011700168300001800285520046700303592002800770650001200798650002300810650002300833650002100856700002400877700002400901700002300925773010600948856008501054852000901139655001201148IND60579151420180316000000.0170816e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057915142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b016652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoang, Tung T.10aSix-Step Synthesis of Alcyopterosin A, a Bioactive Illudalane Sesquiterpene with a gem-Dimethylcyclopentane Ring  ap. 3470-3473.  aStrategic pairing of ring openings and cycloisomerization provides rapid and efficient “open and shut” entry into sparsely functionalized illudalanes, as exemplified here in the context of a six-step synthesis of alcyopterosin A.

Through the construction of a measurement index system, this paper evaluates the level of regional eco-innovation in 30 Chinese provinces from 2000 to 2014. This paper also employs panel data analysis to study the factors that influence Chinese regional eco-innovation. The results show that, during the observation period, the levels of eco-innovation increased significantly overall. However, the regional comparison of the eco-innovation index revealed an obvious, gradually decreasing distribution pattern from east to west. Factors such as technology push, market pull, and environmental regulation pull have positive but differentiated influences on the eco-innovation throughout China and among the eastern, central and western regions. Based on these heterogeneous influences and the targets of ecological civilization construction, promoting the regional synergy of technology push, market pull, and environmental regulation pull is necessary to improve the level of eco-innovation in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental law 3amarkets 3asustainable technology 3aChina 0aRegional eco-innovation 0aEco-innovation index 0aInfluencing factors 0aRegional differences1 aCheng, Jinhua1 aDai, Sheng0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 June 01, v. 153 p.1-14dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.1413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245005400163300001600217520103800233592002801271650002401299650000901323650001701332650001201349650002201361650002001383650001301403650001301416650001001429650001401439650001401453650001101467650001401478653002201492653001401514653002901528653001901557700002601576773009501602856008301697852000901780655001201789IND60480044220221121032146.0160125e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048004422DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.43.2014.2.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiowksz, A.10aStimulation of gluten-free sourdough fermentation  ap. 225-231.  aImplementation of sourdough technology would increase nutritional value and attractiveness of gluten-free bread. However, fermentation process requires stimulation. The course of fermentation of gluten-free sourdoughs prepared from maize and soy flours and maize and potato starches, enriched in glucose and casein hydrolysate or soy sprouted seeds used as fermentation enhancers was evaluated. The clearest effect of the supplementation was observed in the case of sourdough prepared from starches only. The addition of glucose in the amounts as low as 0.5% has proved to be enough to enhance fermentation effectively. Supplementation of the sourdoughs with peptides was not very effective; however, when used together with glucose, a synergistic effect could be detected. The addition of sprouted seeds allowed to shorten the fermentation process with up to several hours. These studies have demonstrated possibility to simplify and shorten the process of gluten-free sourdough fermentation by modification of mixtures composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3acasein hydrolysates 3acorn 3afermentation 3aglucose 3agluten-free foods 3anutritive value 3apeptides 3apotatoes 3aseeds 3asourdough 3asoy flour 3astarch 3asynergism 0agluten-free bread 0asourdough 0alactic acid fermentation 0aceliac disease1 aKordialik-Bogacka, E.0 tActa alimentaria.g2014 June 1, v. 43, no. 2 p.225-231dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.43.2014.2.53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010200168300001600270520142400286592002801710650002201738650002101760650001701781650001601798650002201814650002201836650002301858650001501881650002401896650002501920650002301945650001601968650002401984650001802008653002202026653001902048653003102067653003202098773012002130856005102250852000902301655001202310IND50086920920221119081223.0140412e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008692092DNAL7 a10.1080/17480272.2012.7539502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinha, Arijit10aThermal degradation modeling of flexural strength of wood after exposure to elevated temperatures  ap. 111-118.  aWood is being used heavily in single-family residential dwellings. Therefore, it is important to categorize their response when exposed to elevated temperatures for a sustained period of time. An important aspect of structural fire design is to assess postfire residual strength of existing structures. This study addresses this issue by developing models to predict strength degradation of wood after exposure to elevated temperature. The objectives were to (a) study the effect of exposure time on bending strength [Modulus of Rupture (MOR)] of wood at elevated temperatures, (b) interpret any relationships between different temperature and time of exposure using kinetics and a statistical approach, and (c) compare the two approaches. Two hundred thirty-two samples in total were tested in flexure as a function of exposure time and several temperatures. MOR of wood decreased as a function of temperature and exposure time. Rate of degradation was higher at higher temperatures. These results were fit to a simple kinetics model, based on the assumption of degradation kinetics following an Arrhenius activation energy model with apparent activation energy of 37.4 kJ/mol. A regression-based statistical model was also developed. The kinetics-based model fit the data better with one less parameter and predictions consistently matched the observed values, making the model preferred over the regression approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3abending strength 3adecayed wood 3aengineering 3aexposure duration 3amaterials science 3amodulus of rupture 3aprediction 3aresidential housing 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3awood strength 0aActivation energy 0akinetics model 0amultiple linear regression 0athermal degradation of wood0 tWood material science and engineering.g2013 June 1, v. 8, no. 2 p.111-118dTaylor & Francis Groupx1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2012.753950  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015200172500002200324520119200346592002801538650001201566650001301578650001301591650002001604650001101624650002401635650000901659650001101668650002601679650002001705650001901725650004501744650001601789650001001805650001301815650001601828650001601844653002401860653001601884653002601900700002501926700002001951700002201971773008101993856008502074852000902159655001202168IND60666228720221117173932.0190916e20190910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066622872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rhisph.2019.1001692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahrous, Nahed N.10aChanges in microbial community structure and increased metal bioavailability in a metal-contaminated soil and in the rhizosphere of corn (Zea mays)  aPre-press version  aMetal-contaminated soils are common in many urban areas and are potentially toxic to plants and microorganisms. This study investigated metal bioavailability as well as the microbial (i.e., Bacteria and Archaea) functional and structural diversity in the bulk soil and rhizosphere of corn, Zea mays, grown in two metal-contaminated urban soils. The concentrations of bioavailable metals varied between the two soils and increased over time in bulk soil and in the rhizosphere of Zea mays. The microbial communities in bulk and rhizospheric soils metabolized nearly all of the carbon sources on the Ecoplates™ (including amino acids and amines, carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and polymeric compounds), indicating broad degradative capabilities. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis indicated that the two soils contained very different microbial communities and that at day 30 microbial diversity increased in the rhizosphere of both soils. While the presence of Zea mays roots enhanced microbial community diversity in most cases, the physiological potential of the community in the rhizosphere decreased over time in one of the metal-contaminated soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aZea mays 3abacteria 3abioavailability 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3acorn 3ametals 3amicrobial communities 3aplants (botany) 3apolluted soils 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3atoxicity 3aurban areas 3aurban soils 0aMicrobial community 0aEcoplate™ 0aMetal bioavailability1 aColumbus, Melanie P.1 aSoutham, Gordon1 aMacfie, Sheila M.0 tRhizosphere.g2019 Sept. 10, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23357x2452-21987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2019.1001693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008800162300001600250520125100266592002801517650001701545650001001562650001701572650001101589650001601600650001401616650001401630650002301644650001701667650001501684650001101699653002401710653002101734700002301755700001601778700001401794773009501808856008301903852000901986655001201995IND60480044320221121032303.0160125e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048004432DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.43.2014.2.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeskó, A.14aThe effect of yeast on the anthocyanin characteristics of fermented model solutions  ap. 232-238.  aThe sensory quality of red wines is basically determined by the colour, which depends on the amount and on the evolution of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds extracting from the berries into the wine during wine-making. The anthocyanin-monomers are responsible for the development of the red colour, and their acylated derivatives provide stability for the colour of the wines. The anthocyanin profile of wines is affected by several factors: the grape variety, the conditions during wine-making, and also the yeast culture used for the fermentation. In our experiments a self-compiled model solution was fermented by spontaneous fermentation, as well as by four commercial yeasts under laboratory conditions. After fermentation total polyphenolics, anthocyanins, anthocyanin monomer profile, colour intensity, hue, and the ratio of polymeric anthocyanins were studied. Our results show that the spontaneous yeast fermentation resulted in a higher anthocyanin concentration in the fermented model solution, but the commercial yeast strains provided a more advantageous colour characteristic compared to the spontaneous fermentation. After the spontaneous fermentation less sediment was left than in the commercial yeast fermented samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3acolor 3afermentation 3agrapes 3apolyphenols 3ared wines 3asediments 3asensory properties 3asmall fruits 3awinemaking 3ayeasts 0aanthocyanin profile 0acommercial yeast1 aNyitrai-Sárdy, D.1 aKállay, M.1 aBalga, I.0 tActa alimentaria.g2014 June 1, v. 43, no. 2 p.232-238dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.43.2014.2.63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245006900173300001600242520110700258592002801365650001701393650001101410650001301421650001301434650001601447650001301463650001901476650002601495650001301521650003301534650001601567650001201583650000901595653001701604653001701621653003001638653002201668700002301690700002001713773012001733856005101853852000901904655001201913IND50086921020221119081115.0140412e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008692102DNAL7 a10.1080/17480272.2013.7694632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsmaeeli, Mohammad10aFormation of carbon–carbon composite using wood as a precursor  ap. 152-158.  aThe use of wood as structure-giving material may be an effective approach to reduce some barriers for producing high temperature ceramic especially carbon composites. The objective of this study was to develop a simple process for producing carbon–carbon (C–C) composite through porous template result from pyrolysing of wood. Walnut, known to be relatively permeable, was being heat treated under controlled atmosphere. The carbon-template formed was infiltrated with coal tar pitch. Morphological characterization of the resulting composite was carried out by scanning electron microscopy morphology and physical properties of sample were evaluated with determination of bulk density and open porosity. In addition mechanical properties of products were analysed with three-point bending test and Vickers micro hardness. Results showed that bulk density had an uprising trend with increasing the number of densification cycles and subsequently open porosity decreased. Moreover, from mechanical property's point of view, results had a good compatibility with increase in the densification cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3acarbon 3aceramics 3acoal tar 3aengineering 3ahardness 3aheat treatment 3amechanical properties 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3awalnuts 3awood 0aWood ceramic 0ainfiltration 0acarbon–carbon composite 0acellular template1 aMirhabibi, Alireza1 aBodaghi, Masoud0 tWood material science and engineering.g2013 June 1, v. 8, no. 2 p.152-158dTaylor & Francis Groupx1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2013.769463  aDNAL 7aarticle01456naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245008300168300001800251520044500269592002800714650002200742650002300764650002300787650001100810650001400821700002200835700001800857700002900875700002600904773010600930856008501036852000901121655001201130IND60579151620180316000000.0170816e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057915162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b016722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeutsch, Amrei10aOne-Pot Synthesis of Substituted Trifluoromethylated 2,3-Dihydro-1H-imidazoles  ap. 3474-3477.  aAn operationally simple one-pot reaction for the preparation of a novel class of racemic trifluoromethylated 2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazoles derived from electron-poor N,O-acetals and aryl Grignard reagents is described.

The compositions explored were 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), in the liquid-disordered (Ld) phase, sphingomyelin (SM), in the gel phase, and binary mixtures of these phospholipids with 30 mol % cholesterol (chol), resulting in bilayers in the Ld and liquid-ordered (Lo) phases, respectively. We show that the phospholipid bilayers are completely soluble in TX-100, but optical microscopy reveals that whereas fluid POPC is gradually solubilized by TX-100, gel SM is first shattered in bilayer fragments. Incorporation of TX-100 in the membrane leads to increase in GUV area, which was quantified and expressed as bound detergent-to-lipid molar ratio. The partition of TX-100 in POPC is very high, decreases in POPC/chol, and is negligible in SM/chol. Fluorescence microscopy shows that TX-100 induces Lo/Ld phase separation in previously homogeneous POPC/chol GUVs, and insoluble bilayer fragments/vesicles are detected with optical microscopy and light scattering. Vesicles of SM/chol, in the Lo phase, are virtually insoluble in TX-100. Taken together, our results show that the presence of cholesterol is the origin of membrane resistance to solubilization, which depending on the specific lipid mixture can result in either partially (POPC/chol) or completely (SM/chol) insoluble mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholesterol 3adetergents 3afluorescence microscopy 3agels 3alight microscopy 3alight scattering 3alipid bilayers 3aoctoxynol 3aphospholipids 3aseparation 3asolubilization 3asphingomyelins1 aFrança, Ana D.

However, to date, the mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study, we used chronic exposure to a scream as a novel form of sound stress to explore the influence of the chronic stress burden on colon cancer progression, and changes in the immune system were observed. Chronic exposure to scream sound stress induced freezing behavior in the mice and decreased the bodyweight gain. It also caused changes in the adrenal gland and increased serum corticosterone and norepinephrine levels. Cytokine microarray analysis showed changes in the levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. The chronic scream sound stress caused a shift from the Th1 to the Th2 response both in the circulation and in tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes, and it promoted colon cancer progression significantly. Taken together, chronic scream sound stress can be conveniently used as a novel chronic stress model. Chronic stress contributes to colon cancer progression and induces a Th1/Th2 imbalance in the mouse immune system, which is considered critical during cancer progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadrenal glands 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3achronic exposure 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acorticosterone 3acytokines 3afreezing 3alymphocytes 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3anorepinephrine 3apsychosocial factors 0aColon cancer 0aChronic stress 0aTh1 cytokine 0aTh2 cytokine1 aZhang, Xin1 aZhao, Lingyu1 aZhao, Xiaoge1 aLi, Zongfang1 aSong, Tusheng1 aHuang, Chen0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Oct. 04, v. 439 p.471-476dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245010400174300001600278500001500294520115400309592002801463650002401491650001901515650001801534650001101552650001501563650002501578650002501603650001701628650001601645653001601661700002001677700001901697700002601716700002901742700001501771700002201786773009801808856008101906990002301987852000902010655001202019IND60093106920221118052936.0141103e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009310692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan der Weeën, Pieter10aModeling the photocatalytic degradation of moxifloxacin by means of a stochastic cellular automaton  ap. 181-190.  a2019-12-06  aFluoroquinolones are a family of synthetic broad-spectrum, antibacterial compounds, with ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin being two of the most important members. Although very efficient and active, they are incompletely metabolized during human therapy and traditional wastewater treatment plants cannot remove them completely, so that they accumulate in the environment. Research is therefore directed towards novel methods, such as TiO₂-assisted photocatalysis, to achieve complete mineralization of organic contaminants. Despite the great potential of photocatalysis and the ongoing research in this field, the reaction mechanism behind photocatalysis is still not completely elucidated and the oxide surfaces of the TiO₂ photocatalyst are more complex than anticipated, which hampers the development of a mathematical model for describing photocatalytic degradation. In this paper, a stochastic cellular automata based model is proposed to simulate the mechanism behind photocatalysis. The model is validated and evaluated through sensitivity analysis. Subsequently, it is parameterized using experimental data from a lab-scale batch reactor.  aPublisher supplied data 3amathematical models 3amineralization 3aciprofloxacin 3ahumans 3aphotolysis 3awastewater treatment 3achemical engineering 3atherapeutics 3amethodology 0anew methods1 aBaetens, Jan M.1 aVerwaeren, Jan1 aVan Doorslaer, Xander1 aHeynderickx, Philippe M.1 aDewulf, Jo1 aDe Baets, Bernard0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 188 p.181-190dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.02.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245012200191300001600313520130200329592002801631650002101659650001501680650003901695650002301734650002101757650001901778650001501797650002401812650001401836650001701850650002301867650001301890650003501903650005301938651001201991700002502003700001802028700002202046773008802068856008402156852000902240655001202249IND60088247220221119224344.0141102e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008824722DNAL7 a221338402pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2011.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Shrawan K.10aEquilibrium and intra-particle diffusion of stabilized landfill leachate onto micro- and meso-porous activated carbon  ap. 491-499.  aStabilized landfill leachate has previously been treated with activated carbon (AC); however, information on the selectivity of AC depending upon the pore size is minimal. Isotherm and kinetic experiments were conducted using three commercially available AC products, one micro-porous and two meso-porous. Equilibrium adsorption and intra-particle diffusion of organic matter from stabilized leachate was studied. Isotherm experimental data were fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich, and Redlich–Peterson isotherm models in non-linear forms. Of the three isotherm models, the Redlich–Peterson model provided the best fit to the experimental data and showed a similar organic matter adsorption capacity (approximately 0.2 g total organic carbon (TOC) g⁻¹ AC) for both micro-porous and meso-porous AC. The organic matter effective intra-particle diffusion coefficients (Dₑ) in both AC types were on the order of 10⁻¹⁰ m² s⁻¹ for AC particle sizes greater than 0.5 mm. Meso-porous ACs showed slightly higher Dₑ compared to micro-porous AC. Rapid small-scale tests showed a maximum of 80% TOC removal from leachate by each AC investigated. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed a preferential adsorption of fulvic-type organic matter with an increase in empty bed contact time by each AC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3alandfill leachates 3anonlinear models 3aorganic matter 2aAdsorption 2aCharcoalxchemistry 2aDiffusion 2aFluorescence 2aModels, Biological 2aPorosity 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 0aFlorida1 aTownsend, Timothy G.1 aMazyck, David1 aBoyer, Treavor H.0 tWater research.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 46, no. 2 p.491-499dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2011.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012700155300001800282520132700300592002801627650002301655650002101678650002001699700001601719700001901735700001601754700001701770700002001787700001701807773013101824856007501955852000902030655001202039IND60540944420221118041516.0160820e20140219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054094442DNAL7 a10.1021/ja410424g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarek, Ilan10aAll-Carbon Quaternary Stereogenic Centers in Acyclic Systems through the Creation of Several C–C Bonds per Chemical Step  ap. 2682-2694.  aIn the past few decades, it has become clear that asymmetric catalysis is one of the most powerful methods for the construction of carbon–carbon as well as carbon–heteroatom bonds in a stereoselective manner. However, when structural complexity increases (i.e., all-carbon quaternary stereogenic center), the difficulty in reaching the desired adducts through asymmetric catalytic reactions leads to a single carbon–carbon bond-forming event per chemical step between two components. Issues of efficiency and convergence should therefore be addressed to avoid extraneous chemical steps. In this Perspective, we present approaches that tackle the stimulating problem of efficiency while answering interesting synthetic challenges. Ideally, if one could create all-carbon quaternary stereogenic centers via the creation of several new carbon–carbon bonds in an acyclic system and in a single-pot operation from simple precursors, it would certainly open new horizons toward solving the synthetic problems. Even more important for any further design, the presence of polyreactive intermediates in synthesis (bismetalated, carbenoid, and oxenoids species) becomes now an indispensable tool, as it creates consecutively the same number of carbon–carbon bonds as in a multi-step process, but in a single-pot operation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3astereochemistry1 aMinko, Yury1 aPasco, Morgane1 aMejuch, Tom1 aGilboa, Noga1 aChechik, Helena1 aDas, Jaya P.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Feb. 19, v. 136, no. 7 p.2682-2694dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja410424g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012000168300001600288520122800304592002801532650001001560650001201570650002501582650002401607650001401631650001001645650001801655650001601673650002201689650002201711650000901733650001001742651001101752653001401763653000901777653002001786653003701806653002001843700001401863700001901877773012101896856005102017852000902068655001202077IND50086921320221119081235.0140412e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008692132DNAL7 a10.1080/17480272.2013.7766312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCsiha, Csilla14aThe feature of color alteration of bleached oak, beech, and black locust surfaces during artificial xenon radiation  ap. 212-218.  aIn Europe, large quantities of oak wood are available and industrial partners showed interest in bleached oak as oak's reinterpretation in order to reintroduce it on the design furniture market. In the present work besides oak two further wood species beech and black locust were also examined in comparison. Bleaching of beech has a relative well-established technique and can be done with good results with H₂O₂, contrary to oak where bleaching with the same agent results in a spotty discoloration of the surface with high-greenish incrust. A second substance is suggested to be used, to achieve the same significant bleaching effect for oak and black locust as for beech. As bleached wood surfaces are also subject to color changes due to sun radiation, bleached samples of the three wood species were exposed to artificial xenon radiation and their behavior was investigated, with focus on the influence of the type of application. Expecting industrial-scale application the possible influence of application type on the measure of total color change was also investigated. The feature of color development was described as exponential function of time for all three wood species and all three application methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aQuercus 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3aapplication methods 3ableaching 3acolor 3adiscoloration 3aengineering 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amaterials science 3awood 3axenon 3aEurope 0aBleaching 0aH2O2 0axenon radiation 0adifferent application techniques 0acolor stability1 aPapp, Eva1 aValent, Jozsef0 tWood material science and engineering.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 8, no. 3 p.212-218dTaylor & Francis Groupx1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2013.776631  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013500163300001600298520160200314592002801916650000801944650002501952650001001977700001201987700001801999700001702017700001502034700002402049700002602073773009802099856008102197990002302278852000902301655001202310IND60093107020221118053123.0141103e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009310702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.02.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Li-na10aOn the measurement of gas holdup distribution near the region of impeller in a gas–liquid stirred Rushton tank by means of γ-CT  ap. 191-198.  aThree flow patterns of flooding, loading and complete recirculation in a gas–liquid stirred Rushton tank were identified based on experimental observation. The gas–liquid system was composed of air and water. Under different operating conditions of gas flow rate and impeller rotating speed, the distribution of gas holdup near the region of impeller was measured using a γ-CT scan method. Both quantitative digital distribution curves of gas holdup and their qualitative color CT images were obtained. At the region of impeller, there was a convex characteristic peak of gas holdup distribution both in radial and in axial directions, and with the region being gradually away from the impeller, the distribution of gas holdup became flatter. The values of gas holdup in S33 regime were a little higher than those in L33 regime. Higher impeller rotating speed had some effect on the increasing of gas holdup at the region of higher axial height. The experimental measurement results were basically consistent with those previously published by Bombač. The hole number and diameter of sparger had little influence on the distribution of gas holdup, while the sparger's installed height had significant influence on them. When the sparger was installed close to the bottom of Rushton tank, a comparatively smoother distribution of gas holdup above the space of impeller could be obtained. The research results in this paper were useful for better understanding of gas holdup distribution near the region of impeller of Rushton tank, and could also provide experimental data for CFD simulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3achemical engineering 3acolor1 aLi, Wei1 aHan, Lu-chang1 aLiu, Yue-jin1 aLuo, He-an1 aAl Dahhan, Muthanna1 aDudukovic, Milorad P.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 188 p.191-198dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.02.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013400170300001600304520118900320592002801509650001601537650002101553650002401574650001301598650001601611650001101627650001901638650002201657650000901679650000901688653001601697653001101713653001601724653002101740653001201761700002301773700001701796773012101813856005101934852000901985655001201994IND50086921420221119081213.0140412e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008692142DNAL7 a10.1080/17480272.2013.7895512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandberg, Karin10aEffect of lamellas annual-ring orientation on cracking of glulam beams investigated with computer tomography and image processing  ap. 166-174.  aCracks in glulam beams can reduce their strength, depending on the crack's depth, length, and location and can also be a passage for the accumulation of water and dirt. To avoid cracks, the relationship between cracks (area of cracks, mm²) and annual-ring orientation in glulam beams of spruce (Picea abies), and pine (Pinus sylvestris) with different dimensions and surface treatments was investigated using RGB images of the surface and tomography images of the cross-sections. Image processing was used to measure characteristics visible in the photos such as crack area and lamella position in the beam. Combination of lamellas in lay up was measured from computer tomography images. Four types of combinations were defined; type 1 (pith side facing outward), types 2 and 3 (pith to the same side), and type 4 (pith sides meet pith side). It was found that the area close to the glue line in the lamellas in combination type 4 is the most subject to cracking, whereas combinations of type 1 show the highest resistance to cracking. This means that type 4 should not be used in glulam beams, because the lamellas shrink apart from each other causing stresses and resulting cracks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3acomputed tomography 3acracking 3aengineering 3aglulam 3aimage analysis 3amaterials science 3apith 3awood 0aCT scanning 0acracks 0aglulam beam 0aimage processing 0alay ups1 aMostolygin, Kirill1 aHagman, Olle0 tWood material science and engineering.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 8, no. 3 p.166-174dTaylor & Francis Groupx1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2013.789551  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012700160300001600287520223500303592002802538650004402566650003702610650002502647650001402672650001002686650003302696650001902729650001702748650001302765650001502778650003302793650002102826650002102847650003702868700001902905773009802924856008103022990002303103852000903126655001203135IND60093107120221118053136.0141103e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009310712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.01.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Yi10aStructural and transport properties of BTDA-TDI/MDI co-polyimide (P84)–silica nanocomposite membranes for gas separation  ap. 199-209.  aFumed nano-SiO₂ particles were modified with a silane coupling agent (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane and they were subsequently incorporated into P84 polymer matrix to form nanocomposite membranes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to determine the effectiveness of binding the (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane onto the surfaces of the SiO₂ particles. Physical properties including the membrane density, the stress modulus, the tensile strength and the glass transition temperature of the resulting nanocomposite membranes were obtained. The morphology of the membranes was observed using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The composite membranes based on the modified SiO₂ showed better bonding morphology at the polymer/particle interfaces, higher stress modulus and tensile strength, and significantly higher glass transition temperature as compared with those of the composite membranes based on the pristine SiO₂ particles. The effects of the SiO₂ surface modification and the SiO₂ loadings on the gas separation capability of the resulting composite membranes were investigated. The permeability of all gases (CO₂, O₂, N₂ and He) increased with increasing volume fraction of the inorganic filler. The composite membranes with less than 0.14 volume fraction of the modified SiO₂ had comparable selectivity as that of the pure P84 membrane and significantly higher tensile modulus and stress than the latter. A decrease in selectivity was observed with increasing modified SiO₂ volume fraction. With the same weight percentage of the inorganic filler, the composite membranes based on the modified SiO₂ had higher selectivity than that of the composite membranes based on the pristine SiO₂. The permeability of the composite membranes was compared with the theoretical predictions based on the Maxwell equation and the free volume theory. The Maxwell equation predicted lower values than the experimental data whilst the free volume theory produced acceptable predictions except for a large discrepancy in the permeability value for the P84/25%SiO₂ composite membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3achemical engineering 3aequations 3agases 3aglass transition temperature 3ananocomposites 3apermeability 3apolymers 3aprediction 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atensile strength 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLua, Aik Chong0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 188 p.199-209dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.01.0433Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245009200173300001400265520089900279592002801178650002901206650001501235650001501250650002401265650001801289650001901307650001701326650002001343653002801363653002501391653002501416653002501441653002401466653003701490700002801527773012801555856008401683852000901767655001201776IND60666229220221119155258.0210121e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066622922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.coesh.2019.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz-González, M.10aDecentralized analysis of water contaminants using compact (bio)electroanalytical tools  ap. 47-56.  aUncontrolled anthropogenic activities carried out for many years are behind the spillage into our water bodies of a high number of chemicals of environmental concern. Even though framework directives on water policies describing monitoring programs for controlling water contaminants have been released and amended during the last few decades, it appears not to have been fully materialized. There is an urgent need for searching for deployable analytical tools that initially help in the strict detection of priority pollutants and could perform as alert systems too. Electrochemical sensor approaches have been identified as suitable candidates in this scenario. With this short review, we aim to provide an overview on recent advances in the fabrication of compact electroanalytical tools with the potential for being readily applied in decentralized studies of water contamination events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3amonitoring 3apollutants 3asensors (equipment) 3asurface water 3awater analysis 3awater policy 3awater pollution 0aElectroanalytical tools 0aMicrofluidic devices 0aMicrobial fuel cells 0aSelf-powered devices 0aPaper microfluidics 0aSmartphone analytical approaches1 aFernández-Sánchez, C.0 tCurrent opinion in environmental science & health.g2019 Aug., v. 10 p.47-56dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26761x2468-58447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coesh.2019.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01623naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007700168300001800245520081600263592002801079650001901107650001901126650002901145773010201174856008401276852000901360655001201369IND60123170620221120184122.0150325e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012317062DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2013.8372282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wen-Qin10aTwo-dimensional imaging of targets by stationary frequency diverse array  ap. 1067-1076.  aTwo-dimensional imaging plays an important role in microwave remote sensing. The most representative technique is the synthetic aperture radar (SAR), but it requires a moving platform and consequently requires complex motion compensation sensors. This letter proposes a simple two-dimensional imaging of targets by frequency diverse array (FDA). FDA provides a range-dependent beampattern, but it has an inherent range-angle ambiguity. We divide the FDA elements into two subarrays, each employing a different frequency increment. The two subarrays allow to be overlapped. Two-dimensional imaging of the targets can then be obtained from this stationary radar platform, without employing a moving radar platform like the SAR technique. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3aremote sensing 3asynthetic aperture radar0 tRemote sensing letters.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 4, no. 11 p.1067-1076dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2013.8372283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02272naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014600170300001600316520102200332592002801354650002101382650002001403650001601423650002201439650002201461650001801483650000901501653001001510653001201520653001001532653001301542653001601555653003901571653001001610653000901620700002101629700001901650773012101669856005101790852000901841655001201850IND50086921620221116151427.0140412e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008692162DNAL7 a10.1080/17480272.2013.8035012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlomqvist, Lars10aShape stability of laminated veneer products – An experimental study of the influence on distortion of some material and process parameters  ap. 198-211.  aA shortcoming of the laminated bending process is that the products may become distorted after moulding and during use. In this study, we have examined the influence of different UF-adhesive systems, adhesive distribution, and veneer properties such as species, moisture content, and fibre orientation. Two different species were studied: beech (Fagus silvatica L.) and birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.). Distortion was determined directly after moulding and after storage in a changing relative humidity. The aim of the work was to study how the above-mentioned material and process parameters influence the distortion. The results show that the material and process parameters and the storage in a changing relative humidity had a clear impact on distortion. Fibre orientation, differences in moisture content between veneers, and the moisture gradient in the final product are identified in this study as being the most important parameters influencing the distortion and shape stability of laminated veneer products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pubescens 3aFagus sylvatica 3aengineering 3amaterials science 3arelative humidity 3awater content 3awood 0aBeech 0abending 0abirch 0amoulding 0aspring-back 0athermo-hydro-mechanical processing 0atwist 0awood1 aJohansson, Jimmy1 aSandberg, Dick0 tWood material science and engineering.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 8, no. 3 p.198-211dTaylor & Francis Groupx1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2013.803501  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011500174300001800289520108600307592002801393650001501421650001601436650001501452650001601467650001501483650001401498650001501512650001401527650001201541650001601553653002501569653001501594653001501609653002101624653002001645653002101665700002001686700003501706700002301741773011501764856008601879852000901965655001201974IND60566520520221119184544.0201216e20180120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056652052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.1552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZorpas, Antonis A.10aMonitoring and evaluation of prevention activities regarding household organics waste from insular communities  ap. 3567-3577.  aA key component of waste materials, organic fractions such as food waste and green waste generating from households, can produce a high quality natural fertilizer for in-situ home use. Using a compositional analysis technique, it was indicated that 20% w/w where edible and inedible food wastes and 26% w/w were green, yard waste.

The approach starts by segmenting water bodies from an image, which are then categorized using shape-based classification. Segmentation uses combination of multispectral bands and is based on the active contours without edges technique. The segmentation is robust to noise and can detect objects with weak boundaries, which is important for the extraction of troughs. Classification of the regions is accomplished by utilizing distance transform and regional structural characteristics. The approach is evaluated using 0.6 m resolution WorldView-2 satellite image of ice-wedge polygonal tundra. The segmentation user’s and producer’s accuracies are approximately 92% and 97%, respectively. Visual inspection of the classification results has demonstrated qualitatively accurate object categorization.  aPublisher supplied data 3alakes 3alandscapes 3aponds 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asurface water 3atundra 3aArctic region1 aGangodagamage, Chandana1 aRowland, Joel C.1 aWilson, Cathy J.0 tRemote sensing letters.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 4, no. 11 p.1077-1086dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2013.8404043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245007500173300001200248520114700260592002801407650001401435650002001449650000901469650001101478650001501489650001901504650001601523650001101539700002501550700002201575700002101597700002101618700002401639773012501663856008101788852000901869655001201878IND60440086420221119160721.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044008642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2569-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontenegro, Andrea C.10aCopper Speciation in Soil: Time Evolution and Effect of Clay Amendment  ap. 293.  aCopper bioavailability, specially to plants, is strongly dependent on its chemical form, as for most metals. Copper-contaminated soil can be treated in situ by the addition of minerals such as Na-bentonite, which mixed with surface soil, can transform this pollutant to non-bioavailable forms. In this work, shelter experiments were conducted to study the time evolution of Cu speciation, in pristine soil as well as in amended one. A selective sequential extraction method was employed to determine the metal speciation in the samples. The results show that the major metal fraction is the organic matter-bound one, whereas the exchangeable fraction is very low, even the first day after Cu addition. The time evolution shows a slow decrease of the organic-bound Cu and a corresponding increase of the most stable mineral fractions. With the addition of Na-bentonite to copper-contaminated soil, the most stable mineral fractions increase whereas the organic-bound one decreases, showing essentially similar time dependence of the several metal fractions.

Pest flies can harbor this pathogen and may disseminate it to produce. We determined the occurrence of E. coli O157:H7–positive flies in leafy greens planted up to 180 m from a cattle feedlot and assessed their relative risk to transmit this pathogen to leafy greens. The primary fly groups captured on sticky traps at the feedlot and leafy greens plots included house flies (Musca domestica L.), face flies (Musca autumnalis L.), stable flies (Stomoxys calcitrans L.), flesh flies (family Sarcophagidae), and blow flies (family Calliphoridae). E. coli O157:H7 carriage rates of house, face, flesh, and blow flies were similar (P > 0.05), ranging from 22.3 to 29.0 flies per 1,000 flies. In contrast, the carriage rate of stable flies was lower at 1.1 flies per 1,000 flies (P < 0.05). Differences in carriage rates are likely due to the uses of fresh bovine feces and manure by these different pest fly groups. E. coli O157:H7 carriage rates of total flies did not differ (P > 0.05) by distance (ranging from 0 to 180 m) from the feedlot. Most fly isolates were the same predominant pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types found in feedlot surface manure and leafy greens, suggesting a possible role for flies in transmitting E. coli O157:H7 to the leafy greens. However, further research is needed to clarify this role and to determine set-back distances between cattle production facilities and produce crops that will reduce the risk for pathogen contamination by challenging mechanisms like flies. 3aCalliphoridae 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aMusca autumnalis 3aMusca domestica 3aSarcophagidae 3aStomoxys calcitrans 3abeef cattle 3acattle production 3acrops 3adisease transmission 3afeces 3afeedlots 3afoodborne illness 3agreen leafy vegetables 3ainsect pests 3apathogens 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3arelative risk 3arisk reduction 3asticky traps1 aWells, James E.1 aDurso, Lisa M.1 aFriesen, Kristina M.1 aBono, James L.1 aSuslow, Trevor V.0 tJournal of food protection.g2019 Aug., v. 82, no. 8 p.1300-1307dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/66623043Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-6013Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/356937-Berry-Leafy%20greens_0.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle
