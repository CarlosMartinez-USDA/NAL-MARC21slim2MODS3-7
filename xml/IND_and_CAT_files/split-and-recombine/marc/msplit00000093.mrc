In the two‐step approach, first the copolymers of benzodioxinone containing monomer, namely, 4‐oxo‐2,2‐diphenyl‐4H‐benzo[d][1,3]dioxin‐7‐yl methacrylate (BDMA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) in different feed ratios were prepared by RAFT polymerization. In the subsequent step, dichloromethane solutions of these copolymers (PMMA‐co‐PBDMA) were irradiated at λ = 300 nm in the presence of independently prepared hydroxyl functional polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol) (MeO‐PEG‐OH) and poly(ɛ‐caprolactone) (PCL‐OH). Side‐chain esterification reaction between photochemically generated ketene groups and hydroxyl functionalities resulted in the formation graft copolymers. The intermediates and final graft copolymers were characterized by ¹H NMR, UV, IR, fluorescence, and GPC measurements. The success of the process was also confirmed by a model reaction using pyrene methanol. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

(1996) J. Clin. Invest.98, 1650â1658]. Although NCX expression was found to be significantly lower in the atria compared to the septum, no significant differences were found between atrial and ventricular tissue. NCX has been located in the general sarcolemma and tâtubules of ventricular muscle and as tâtubules are sparse in atrial tissue compared to ventricular tissue, it is surprising that NCX expression was found to be similar in both atria and ventricles [Wang et al. (1996)]. To reinvestigate this, we have used SDS/PAGE and a quantitative Western blotting technique to determine the pattern of expression of NCX in guineaâpig heart in tissue samples from left atrium, right atrium, septum, left ventricle and right ventricle. NCX protein expression was 17.5âÂ±â3.9âpmolÂ·mgâ1 of protein in the left atrium and 29.2âÂ±â6.1âpmolÂ·mgâ1 of protein in the right atrium, which were both significantly lower (Pâ<â0.05) than NCX expression in the septum, left ventricle and right ventricle (64.7âÂ±â15.2, 76.8âÂ±â19.5 and 69.4âÂ±â14.1âpmolÂ·mgâ1 of protein, respectively,nâ=â7). These differences in NCX expression may reflect variations in the cellular location of NCX protein in these regions. To study this, we used confocal immunofluorescence of single isolated myocytes to examine differences in the proportion of fluorescent staining on the general surface membrane compared with the interior of the cell (which presumably reflects a tâtubular location). We found that the general membrane staining was 79.0âÂ±â1.2% in cells from the atria which was significantly higher (Pâ<â0.001) than that seen in cells from the septum, left ventricle and right ventricle, with 48.1âÂ±â1.1%, 48.2âÂ±â1.8% and 45.6âÂ±â1.3%, respectively (nâ=â20). These results illustrate a similar pattern of NCX expression in guineaâpig and human, with expression in atrial tissue significantly lower than in ventricular tissue. However, the cellular location of NCX differs regionally; in atrial tissue, the majority of the NCX protein is located in the general sarcolemma whereas in ventricular and septal tissue, approximately 50% of NCX protein is located within the cell (presumably at the level of the tâtubules).  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3afluorescence 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aguinea pigs 3aheart 3ahumans 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amuscles 3amyocytes 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative analysis1 aColyer, John1 aHarrison, Simon M.0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2000 Aug., v. 267, no. 16 p.5142-5148dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01579.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245016600163520201500329592002802344650001702372650001502389650001402404650002002418650000902438650001902447650000902466650001302475650001602488650001402504650002902518650001802547700001802565700002302583700002202606700002202628773012002650856007902770852000902849655001202858IND60768489320221121160445.0220225e20220212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076848932DNAL7 a10.3390/plants110405012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNahar, Lutfun 10aImpact of Single and Combined Salinity and High-Temperature Stresses on Agro-Physiological, Biochemical, and Transcriptional Responses in Rice and Stress-Release  aHere, for the first time, we aimed to identify in rice the key mechanisms and processes underlying tolerance to high-temperature (HT) or salt stress (SS) alone, the co-occurrence of both stresses, and recovery using physiological and biochemical measurements and gene expression analysis. We also investigated whether recovery from the two stressors depended on the relative intensities/relief of each stressor. Wild type (‘Yukinkomai’) rice plants were found to be more susceptible to salinity or heat applied individually. SS leads to a depletion of cellular water content, higher accumulation of Na⁺, and alterations in photosynthetic pigments. The stress-tolerant cultivar ‘YNU31-2-4’ (YNU) displayed a lower Na⁺/K⁺ ratio, higher water content in cells and improved photosynthetic traits, antioxidant system, and expression of defence genes. Strikingly, the SS + HT combination provided a significant level of protection to rice plants from the effects of SS alone. The expression pattern of a selected set of genes showed a specific response and dedicated pathways in plants subjected to each of the different stresses, while other genes were explicitly activated when the stresses were combined. Aquaporin genes were activated by SS, while stress-related (P5CS, MSD1, HSPs, and ions transporters) genes were shaped by HT. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analyses showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to the combined stresses and identified heat as a mitigating factor, clearly separating heat + salt-stressed from salt-non-heat-stressed plants. Furthermore, seedling recovery was far more dependent on the relative intensities of stressors and cultivars, demonstrating the influence of one stressor over another upon stress-release. Taken together, our data show the uniqueness and complexity of the physiological and molecular network modules used by rice plants to respond to single and combined stresses and recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aaquaporins 3acultivars 3agene expression 3aheat 3aphotosynthesis 3arice 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseedlings 3atranscription (genetics) 3awater content1 aAycan, Murat 1 aHanamata, Shigeru 1 aBaslam, Marouane 1 aMitsui, Toshiaki 0 tPlants.g2022 Feb. 12, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants110405013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245012600169500001900295520137100314592002801685650002601713650001001739650000901749650002301758650001901781650001701800650001001817650001401827650001401841650003501855650002701890700002101917700001801938700002001956700002201976700002301998700002202021700001902043700002302062700002102085700002002106773011902126856007702245852000902322655001202331IND60732087920221120114849.0210326e20210302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073208792DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120303582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPooh, Ritsuko  Kimata10aFetal Megalencephaly with Cortical Dysplasia at 18 Gestational Weeks Related to Paternal UPD Mosaicism with PTEN Mutation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene is a tumor-suppressor gene located on 10q22-23. Since the introduction of molecular genetics in prenatal diagnostics, various birth defects associated with gene mutations have been diagnosed. However, no reports on fetal cases related to PTEN mutation have been found, so far. We encountered a rare case of fetal PTEN mutation. Fetal macrocephaly was noted at 16 weeks. At 18 and 20 weeks, neurosonography revealed megalencephaly with an asymmetrical structure and multifocal polygyria. The head circumference (HC) was +6.2 SD at 18 weeks and +8.1 SD at 20 weeks. The parents opted for pregnancy termination, and the male fetus was delivered at 21 weeks, with HC +9.3 SD. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array for amniotic cells showed paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) 10q mosaicism, and the mosaic ratio was calculated as 56% from B-allele frequency. Exome sequencing revealed the pathogenic PTEN mutation with mosaicism. The heterozygous PTEN mutation may not cause early manifestations from the fetal period, and an abnormal phenotype may appear after birth. This may be the reason why fetal defects associated with PTEN mutation are not detected. Since this case had homozygous and heterozygous mutations, survival was possible, exhibiting an incredibly huge head with cortical dysplasia from early pregnancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiagnostic techniques 3afetus 3ahead 3ahead circumference 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3amales 3aphenotype 3apregnancy 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atumor suppressor genes1 aMachida, Megumi 1 aImoto, Issei 1 aArai, Eri  Noel1 aOhashi, Hiroyasu 1 aTakeda, Masayoshi 1 aShimokawa, Osamu 1 aFukuta, Kaori 1 aShiozaki, Arihiro 1 aSaitō, Shigeru,1 aChiyo, Hideaki 0 tGenes.g2021 Mar. 02, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120303583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001800158245013100176500002200307500002200329520185700351592002802208653001602236653001302252653001602265653000802281653000802289700001702297700001702314700002002331773007502351856009202426852000902518655001202527IND60613750420221122101803.0180914s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061375042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymertesting.2018.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Huafeng10aIntermolecular interactions and microstructure of glycerol-plasticized soy protein materials at molecular and nanometer levels  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aGlycerol plasticized soy protein is an important kind of biodegradable materials among the possible soy protein systems. Fully realized performance relies on the investigation and understanding of the molecular structure of the plasticized soy protein. However, the relevant research is primarily limited in the microstructure and physical properties of the mixtures with a lack of knowledge on the intermolecular interactions at molecular and nano-scale levels. In this work, intermolecular interaction and molecular motion of soy protein in glycerol plasticized systems were investigated at molecular and nanometer levels. Several techniques including atomic force microscope (AFM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and ¹³C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (¹³C NMR), have been effectively employed. Observations from AFM and TEM indicated that the glycerol plasticized soy protein materials were heterogeneous at nanometer scale and there were two important phases existing in the materials, i.e. protein-rich domain and glycerol-rich domain. The protein-rich domain was composed of compact aggregations of pan-like protein while the glycerol-rich domain possessed a loose chain-like structure. Further studies on the interactions between soy protein and glycerol at molecular level using NMR indicated that the strong hydrogen bonds between glycerol and protein molecules was greatly affected by amino acid residues on protein chains. The protein-rich micro-domains were mainly composed of amino acids with long alkane lateral chains or aromatic ring lateral groups, while amino acids with polar groups or short nonpolar lateral groups formed glycerol-rich micro-domains. These results would be beneficial for the development and realization of plasticized soy protein based nanocomposites and blend materials with high performance.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSoy protein 0aGlycerol 0aInteraction 0aAFM 0aNMR1 aGuo, Gaiping1 aXiang, Aimin1 aZhong, Wei-Hong0 tPolymer testing.g2018, dElsevier LtdwJournal:26776x0142-94187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymertesting.2018.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245011200211300001600323520102700339592002801366650002201394650002201416650002401438650001401462650002501476650001701501650001601518650001301534650002201547650001501569650001301584650002701597650001801624650003701642653001201679653001501691653001301706653002901719653001701748653002401765700001601789700002201805700005401827773013501881856008702016852000902103655001202112IND60621665020221120090352.0190131e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062166502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.10.1682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlghazwi, Mousa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7480-981X10aComparative study on neuroprotective activities of fucoidans from Fucus vesiculosus and Undaria pinnatifida  ap. 255-264.  aThis study investigated the neuroprotective activities of five different fucoidan samples with different chemical compositions prepared from Fucus vesiculosus (FE, FF, and S) and Undaria pinnatifida (UE and UF) to determine if they reduced aggregation or cytotoxicity of Aβ1–42 in neuronal PC-12 cells.

Fucoidan from different seaweed sources and with varying chemical compositions demonstrate a range of neuroprotective activities that may have potential to alter Aβ1–42 neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aFucus vesiculosus 3aUndaria pinnatifida 3aapoptosis 3achemical composition 3acytotoxicity 3afluorometry 3afucoidan 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amacroalgae 3aneurites 3aneuroprotective effect 3aneurotoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aSeaweed 0aMacroalgae 0aFucoidan 0aNeuroprotective activity 0aAmyloid beta 0aAlzheimer's disease1 aSmid, Scott1 aKarpiniec, Samuel1 aZhang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5111-40970 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 122 p.255-264dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.10.1683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001700192245011900209500001900328506007600347520087900423592002801302506003701330650001701367650002101384650002201405650001701427650000701444650002201451650002301473650002101496653002201517653001601539653001901555700001701574773009301591856008501684852000901769655001201778IND60690727420221207115413.0200508e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069072742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e002462doi7 aPMC53189632pmcid7 a282396702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsega, Moges10aInfluence of acidic pH on the formulation of TiO2 nanocrystalline powders with enhanced photoluminescence property  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTitanium dioxide (TiO₂) nanoparticles were prepared by the sol-gel method at different pH values (3.2–6.8) with a hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution. Raw samples were calcined at 500 °C for 2 h. The effects of pH on the structural, morphological and optical properties of TiO₂ nanoparticles were investigated. At pH 4.4–6.8, only the anatase phase of TiO₂ was observed. Under strong acidic condition at pH 3.2 rutile, brookite and anatase co-exist, but rutile is the predominant phase. The strain value increased and the crystallite size decreased as the HCl content increased. The increased crystallite sizes in the range 21–24 nm and enhanced blue emission intensity around 432 nm was obtained for the sample at pH 5.0. Experimental results showed that TiO₂ nanoparticles synthesized at pH 5.0 exhibited the best luminescence property with pure anatase phase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acrystallites 3aemissions factor 3ahydrochloric acid 3ananocrystals 3apH 3aphotoluminescence 3asol-gel processing 3atitanium dioxide 0aMaterials science 0aEngineering 0aNanotechnology1 aDejene, F.B.0 tHeliyon.g2017 Feb., v. 3, no. 2 p.e00246-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e002463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245016300160500001900323520176600342592002802108650001602136650001602152650001502168650001902183650001502202650002902217650002502246650001602271653002202287653002802309653001002337653001402347653003002361700001702391700002002408773011402428856008202542852000902624655001202633IND60713114920221118181511.0201125e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071311492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1120972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Chen10aTriggered afterslip on the southern Hikurangi subduction interface following the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake from InSAR time series with atmospheric corrections  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaikōura earthquake represents an extremely complex event involving over ten major crustal faults, altering conventional understanding of multi-fault ruptures. Although evidence for coseismic slip on the Hikurangi subduction interface is controversial, we present afterslip on the subduction zone beneath Marlborough using 13 months of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) observations. The spatially and temporally correlated atmospheric errors in SAR interferograms are problematic, and hence a new InSAR time series approach, combining the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service (GACOS) with a spatial-temporal Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) filter to facilitate the InSAR time series analysis, is developed. For interferograms with over 250 km spatial extent, we achieve a 0.77 cm displacement RMS difference against GPS, improving 61% from the conventional InSAR time series method (TS). Comparisons between the overlapping region of two independent tracks show an RMS difference of 1.1 cm for the TS-GACOS-APS combined method, improving 54% from the TS method and 27% from using TS with an APS filter only. The APS filter reduces the short wavelength residuals substantially, but fails to remove the long wavelength error even after the ramp removal, revealing that the GACOS correction has played a key role in mitigating long wavelength atmospheric effects. The resultant InSAR displacements, together with the GPS displacements, are used to recover the time-dependent afterslip distribution on the Hikurangi subduction interface, which provides insights for reviewing the co-seismic slip sources, the present status of the subduction plate boundary and future seismic hazards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aearthquakes 3aenvironment 3ageophysics 3ainterferometry 3asubduction 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atime series analysis 3awavelengths 0aInSAR time series 0aAtmospheric corrections 0aGACOS 0aAfterslip 0aHikurangi subduction zone1 aLi, Zhenhong1 aPenna, Nigel T.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 251 p.112097-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1120973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012400169300001600293520139600309592002801705650001901733650003501752650001801787650002001805650001901825650001601844650001901860650002801879651001001907700001601917700001701933700001701950700001701967700001301984700001601997700001702013700001402030700001602044700001602060700001502076700001302091700001802104773010402122856008602226852000902312655001202321IND60087751320221121064933.0141102e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008775132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Jianhui10aOptimization and proficiency testing of a pseudovirus-based assay for detection of HIV-1 neutralizing antibody in China  ap. 267-275.  aAmong the neutralizing antibody evaluation assays, the single-cycle pseudovirus infection assay is high-throughput and can provide rapid, sensitive and reproducible measurements after a single cycle of infection. Cell counts, pseudovirus inoculation levels, amount of diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-dextran), and the nonspecific effects of serum and plasma were tested to identify the optimal conditions for a neutralizing antibody assay based on pseudoviruses. Optimal conditions for cell counts, pseudovirus inoculation, and amount of DEAE-dextran were 1×10⁴cells/well, 200TCID₅₀/well, and 15μg/ml, respectively. Compared with serum samples, high-concentration anticoagulants reduced the relative light unit (RLU) value. The RLU value increased sharply initially but then decreased slowly with dilution of the plasma sample. Test kits containing 10 HIV-1 CRF07/08_BC pseudovirus strains and 10 plasma samples from individuals infected with HIV-1 CRF07/08_BC were assembled into two packages and distributed to nine laboratories with a standard operating procedure included. For the 10 laboratories that evaluated the test, 17 of 44 (37%) laboratory pairs were considered equivalent. A statistical qualification rule was developed based on the testing results from 5 experienced laboratories, where a laboratory qualified if at least 83% of values lied within the acceptable range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aPseudoviridae 3aanalytical kits 3aanticoagulants 3ablood serum 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aChina1 aWang, Wenbo1 aWen, Zhiheng1 aSong, Aijing1 aHong, Kunxue1 aLu, Shan1 aZhong, Ping1 aXu Jianqing,1 aKong, Wei1 aLi, Jingyun1 aShang, Hong1 aLing, Hong1 aRuan, Li1 aWang, Youchun0 tJournal of virological methods.g2012 Nov., v. 185, no. 2 p.267-275dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03879naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001500137245015900152300001600311500001900327520242200346592002802768650001302796650001302809650002202822650002302844650000902867650002802876650002002904650001002924650002202934650000802956650001302964650002802977650001703005650002403022650001403046653001503060653002703075653002203102700001803124700001503142700002003157700001403177773011403191856007103305852000903376655001203385IND60730246120221116224028.0210305s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073024612DNAL7 a10.1071/AN201972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimoni, M.10aDetermination of the optimal priming interval of rumen fluids used as inocula for the in vitro digestibility trials through radial enzyme diffusion method  ap. 525-531.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aContext Determination of the neutral detergent fibre digestibility is one of the important parameters to consider when formulating diets. However, the in vitro determination shows low repeatability because of the source of rumen-fluid inoculum. Priming of the rumen fluid inocula, obtained through an oesophageal probe, has been proposed to overcome this issue. Aim The objective of the study was to investigate the evolution of the microbial enzymatic activities of different rumen fluids during a priming procedure, to establish the fermentation interval that minimises the differences among rumen-fluid degradative potentials. Methods Three farms for each type of diet were involved in the study. Rumen fluids were obtained from dry and lactating cows fed the following four diet types: 100% hay or a diet with 80:20 forage:concentrate ratio (F:C) as dry-cow diets, and ad libitum hay and concentrate, or a total mixed ration (both at 60:40 F:C) as lactating-cow diets. On each farm, rumen fluid was collected from three Holstein cows by using an oesophageal probe, and mixed. Two aliquots of each rumen fluid mix were added to the medium containing the same priming substrate in an in vitro batch-fermentation system. During the incubation, the fermentation fluids were sampled in duplicate at 0-, 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, 24- and 48-h intervals. Enzymatic activities of amylase, cellulase and xylanase were determined by radial enzyme diffusion method. Key results Initial enzymatic activities were quite variable and increased with an increasing incubation time. By 24 h, amylase showed similar values among high-concentrate diet fermentation fluids, and a lower data dispersion in comparison to the other intervals; cellulase was characterised by similar values in all the fermentation fluids derived from diets including concentrates, and xylanase showed similar activity in the fermentation fluids derived from high-concentrate diets. Development of the enzymatic activity of the fermentation fluids derived from the 100% hay diet differed from the others. Conclusions A 24-h priming procedure was needed to stabilise and equalise the enzymatic activity of the rumen fluid from cows fed high-concentrate diets. This was not observed in rumen fluid from cows fed hay-based diets. Implications The 24-h-primed rumen fluid can be used to increase the repeatability of neutral detergent fibre digestibility determination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aamylases 3aanimal production 3abatch fermentation 3adiet 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3afarms 3afeed concentrates 3ahay 3ainoculum 3aneutral detergent fiber 3arumen fluids 3atotal mixed rations 3axylanases 0adairy cows 0ain vitro digestibility 0anutrient analysis1 aTsiplakou, E.1 aPitino, R.1 aQuarantelli, A.1 aRighi, F.0 tAnimal production science.g2021, v. 61, no. 5 p.525-531dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl37620x1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN201973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01846naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245006600201300001800267506007600285520076700361592002801128506003701156650001801193650001201211650001001223650001201233650002601245700002101271773013201292856007501424852000901499655001201508IND60538496720221207090906.0160815e20120328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053849672DNAL7 a10.1021/ja301013h2doi7 aPMC33242642pmcid7 a223976832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFier, Patrick

We report a straightforward method for the cross-coupling of aryl and vinyl iodides with a difluoromethyl group generated from readily available reagents to form difluoromethylarenes and difluoromethyl-substituted alkenes. The reaction of electron-neutral, electron-rich, and sterically hindered aryl and vinyl iodides with the combination of CuI, CsF and TMSCF₂H leads to the formation of difluoromethyl-substituted products in high yield with good functional group compatibility. This transformation is surprising, in part, because of the prior observation of the instability of CuCF₂H.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagrochemicals 3aalkenes 3adrugs 3aiodides 3alaboratory techniques1 aHartwig, John F.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Mar. 28, v. 134, no. 12 p.5524-5527dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja301013h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011400170520148600284592002801770650001101798650002001809650001701829650002001846650001401866650002501880650003001905650002301935650001301958650001901971650002401990650000902014650001802023650001202041653002002053653001302073653002602086653001202112700002302124700002502147700002502172700002402197700002802221700002802249700002502277700002202302700002202324700002902346773009402375856008202469852000902551655001202560IND60725327820221119060547.0210511e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072532782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1066512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEfremov, Sergey M.10aImpact of malnutrition on survival in adult patients after elective cardiac surgery: Long-term follow up data  aThe data article refers to the paper titles “Impact of malnutrition on long-term survival in adult patients after elective cardiac surgery” [1]. The data refer to the analysis of the relationship between baseline malnutrition and long-term mortality after cardiac surgery. Baseline demographic, nutritional, and medical history data were collected for each enrolled patient. Baseline serum albumin and C-reactive (CRP) protein levels were also obtained. Surgical risk was assessed in accordance with the logistic EuroSCORE. Intraoperative data including cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time and postoperative characteristics, such as postoperative complications, number of days in the ICU, and hospitalization duration, were also collected. Data on nutritional status were collected using four nutritional screening tools: (1) malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST), (2) short nutritional assessment questionnaire (SNAQ), (3) mini-nutritional assessment (MNA), and (4) nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS-2002). Both electronic medical records and phone interviews were used for survival data collection. ROC analysis was performed to analyze prognostic value of baseline and perioperative variables on long-term mortality. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis of predictors of 3- and 8-year mortality were performed. Kaplan-Meyer curves, describing the impact of baseline and perioperative characteristics on 3- and 8-year survival were also performed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3adata collection 3amalnutrition 3amedical history 3amortality 3anutrition assessment 3anutrition risk assessment 3anutritional status 3apatients 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aserum albumin 3asurgery 0aCardiac surgery 0aSurvival 0aNutritional screening 0aAlbumin1 aIonova, Tatiana I.1 aNikitina, Tatiana P.1 aVedernikov, Pavel E.1 aDzhumatov, Timur A.1 aOvchinnikov, Timofey S.1 aRashidov, Abduvahhob A.1 aKhomenko, Alexandr E1 aStoppe, Christian1 aHeyland, Daren K.1 aLomivorotov, Vladimir V.0 tData in Brief.g2021 Feb., v. 34 p.106651-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.1066513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245012200165300002000287520130200307592002801609650001101637650001801648650002801666650001801694650001401712650003001726650001901756650002601775650002801801650002401829650001901853650001501872653001801887653002601905653002401931653002601955653002601981653003002007700002202037700002502059700001902084700002402103700001802127700005902145700002502204700006202229773014102291856007802432852000902510655001202519IND60645137420221121130135.0190523e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064513742DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b055552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharifi, Farrokh10aPhoto-Cross-Linked Poly(ethylene glycol) Diacrylate Hydrogels: Spherical Microparticles to Bow Tie-Shaped Microfibers  ap. 18797-18807.  aBow tie-shaped fibers and spherical microparticles with controlled dimensions and shapes were fabricated with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate hydrogel utilizing hydrodynamic shear principles and a photopolymerization strategy under a microfluidic regime. Decreasing the flow rate ratio between the core and sheath fluids from 25 (50:2) to 1.25 (100:80) resulted in increasing the particles size and reducing the production rate by 357 and 86%, respectively. The width of the fibers increased by a factor of 1.4 when the flow rate ratio was reduced from 2.5 to 1 due to the decrease of the shear force at the fluid/fluid interface. The stress at break and Young’s modulus of the fibers were enhanced by 32 and 63%, respectively, when the sheath-to-core flow rate ratio decreased from 100:40 to 100:80. The fiber fabrication was simulated using the finite element method, and the numerical and experimental results were in agreement. Adult hippocampal stem/progenitor cells and bone-marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells were seeded onto the fibrous scaffolds in vitro, and cellular adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation were investigated. Microgrooves on the fibers’ surface were shown to positively affect cell adhesion when compared to flat fibers and planar controls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acell adhesion 3afinite element analysis 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrogels 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amicroparticles 3amodulus of elasticity 3aphotochemical reactions 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3astem cells 0amicrofluidics 0abow tie-shaped fibers 0aphotopolymerization 0ahydrodynamic focusing 0afinite element method 0acell adhesion improvement1 aPatel, Bhavika B.1 aMcNamara, Marilyn C.1 aMeis, Peter J.1 aRoghair, Marissa N.1 aLu, Mingchang1 aMontazami, Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8827-00261 aSakaguchi, Donald S.1 aHashemi, Nicole N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8921-75880 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 May 01, v. 11, no. 20 p.18797-18807dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b055553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001100140245014100151300002000292520135600312592002801668650002401696650002101720650002801741650001901769650001401788650001301802650001401815650002401829700001201853700001501865700001301880773012501893856007402018852000902092655001202101IND60640801020221118071522.0190505e20160921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064080102DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra08269f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, C.14aThe electrochemical sensor based on electrochemical oxidation of nitrite on metalloporphyrin–graphene modified glassy carbon electrode  ap. 90480-90488.  aIn this study, 5-(4-aminophenyl)-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin]Mn(iii) (MnNH₂TPP) and graphene oxide (GO) composite materials (GO–MnNH₂TPP) were successfully used to modify a glassy carbon electrode (GC) by the drop casting method. The GO–MnNH₂TPP/GC composite electrode was used to investigate the electrocatalytic oxidation features of nitrite ion by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and amperometric I–T curve techniques. These experimental results show the GO–MnNH₂TPP/GC composite electrode has excellent electrocatalytic performance for the detection of nitrite. The oxidation peak current of nitrite ion at the GO–MnNH₂TPP/GC composite electrode has shifted negatively and the intensity of the oxidation peak current increased greatly compared with that at the GC, GO/GC and MnNH₂TPP/GC electrodes. A linear relationship has been established between the oxidation current and the nitrite ion concentration. The detection limit of the GO–MnNH₂TPP/GC composite electrode for the detection of nitrite ion was found to be 1.1 μM and 2.5 μM (S/N = 3) using CV and amperometric I–T curve techniques, respectively. The GO–MnNH₂TPP/GC electrode possesses excellent electrocatalytic activity, rapid response time, low detection limit, high selectivity for nitrite and was applied to the detection of nitrite in real water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3agraphene oxide 3amanganese 3anitrites 3aoxidation 3asensors (equipment)1 aGuo, B.1 aGuo, X.

Mechanistically, a tandem process involving elimination/Umpolung/protonation occurs in a single step to generate terminal aryl- and styryl-acetylenes from geminal dibromoalkenes. The key to the success of this transformation lies in the organobase-mediated generation of the acetylide from the 1-bromoalkynes at room temperature. The unique characteristics of DBU as an inherently safer reagent make it an attractive alternative to previous systems wherein required pyrophoric reagents and nonambient temperatures remain unsolved issues. The procedure does not work for the synthesis of alkyl-acetylenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aorganic compounds1 aThummala, Yadagiri1 aDoddi, Venkata Ramana0 tOrganic letters.g2015 Sept. 18, v. 17, no. 18 p.4640-4643dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.orglett.5b023983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245009700168300001600265520157300281592002801854650001301882650001601895650001001911650001801921650001101939650001101950650001101961650001801972650000901990650001301999650001602012650002002028650001402048653003002062653003402092653002502126653001302151700002302164700002202187700002302209773013402232856008602366852000902452655001202461IND60552885320221119065227.0161021e20151005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055288532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.04.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yihui14aThe controlled aggregation and tunable viscosity of nanostructured lipid carrier dispersions  ap. 138-147.  aApplications of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) in drug delivery and the encapsulation of bioactive, lipophilic compounds have been hindered by the tendency of SLN suspensions to undergo uncontrolled aggregation due to polymorphic transformation of the lipid crystals. Second generation lipid nanoparticle systems have been developed by mixing liquid lipid with solid lipid to form more stable nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). In this study, we investigated the effect of chemical formulation on the aggregation behavior and rheology of NLC dispersions. We found that NLC suspension viscosity could be modified by an order of magnitude by controlling particle aggregation with different surfactant and/or oil concentrations. The viscosity could be tuned by decreasing the amount of surfactant and/or oil to achieve a desired level of particle aggregation. Oscillatory sweep tests showed that non-aggregated and aggregated dispersions exhibited typical behaviors of a viscoelastic liquid and a viscoelastic solid, respectively. Modeling results suggested a stronger particle–particle bonding force and a higher aggregation efficiency as the amount of surfactant and/or oil was decreased. Both experimental and modeling results indicated that aggregated samples had an interconnected network structure, while no indication of network formation was observed for non-aggregated samples. Collectively these results suggest that controlled NLC aggregation can be exploited to develop dispersions with tunable viscosity for applications such as rheology modification.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystals 3adispersions 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3alipids 3amixing 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3arheology 3asurfactants 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity 0aSolid lipid nanoparticles 0aNanostructured lipid carriers 0aParticle aggregation 0aRheology1 aCorona, Alessandro1 aBhatia, Surita R.1 aHenson, Michael A.0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2015 Oct. 05, v. 482 p.138-147dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.04.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245011500153300001600268500002000284520182100304592002802125650003202153650001002185650001302195650001102208650001802219650002002237650002002257650001902277650002602296650001902322650001202341700001302353700001802366700001402384700001802398773014002416856007302556852000902629655001202638IND60595566620221119171350.0180605e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059556662DNAL7 a10.1111/jhn.125102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, S.10aFifteen years of using a second stage protein substitute for weaning in phenylketonuria: a retrospective study  ap. 349-356.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: In phenylketonuria (PKU), during weaning, it is necessary to introduce a second stage phenylalanine (Phe)‐free protein substitute (PS) to help meet non‐Phe protein requirements. Semi‐solid weaning Phe‐free PS have been available for >15 years, although no long‐term studies have reported their efficacy. METHODS: Retrospective data from 31 children with PKU who commenced a weaning PS were collected from clinical records from age of weaning to 2 years, on: gender; birth order; weaning age; anthropometry; blood Phe levels; age commenced and dosage of weaning PS and Phe‐free infant L‐amino acid formula; natural protein intake; and issues with administration of PS or food. RESULTS: Median commencement age for weaning was 17 weeks (range 12–25 weeks) and, for weaning PS, 20 weeks (range 13–37 weeks). Median natural protein was 4 g day⁻¹ (range 3–11 g day⁻¹) and total protein intake was >2 g kg⁻¹ day⁻¹ from weaning to 2 years of age. Children started on 2–4 g day⁻¹ protein equivalent (5–10 g day⁻¹ of powder) from weaning PS, increasing by 0.2 g kg⁻¹ day⁻¹ (2 g day⁻¹) monthly to 12 months of age. Teething and illness adversely affected the administration of weaning PS and the acceptance of solid foods. Altogether, 32% of children had delayed introduction of more textured foods, associated with birth order (firstborn 80% versus 38%; P = 0.05) and food refusal when teething (80% versus 29%; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Timing of introduction of solid foods and weaning PS, progression onto more textured foods and consistent feeding routines were important in aiding their acceptance. Any negative behaviour with weaning PS was mainly associated with food refusal, teething and illness. Parental approach influenced the acceptance of weaning PS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropometric measurements 3ablood 3achildren 3agender 3aphenylalanine 3aphenylketonuria 3aprotein content 3aprotein intake 3aretrospective studies 3atextured foods 3aweaning1 aDaly, A.1 aMacDonald, J.1 aPinto, A.1 aMacDonald, A.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2018 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.349-356dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45807x0952-38717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jhn.125103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01748naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002300147245008400170300001600254520086000270592002801130650002301158650001201181650001301193650000901206650001401215650001101229650001201240650001001252773008001262856008301342852000901425655001201434IND4470731920221119091504.0150812e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447073192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2011.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakajima, Sadahiko10aCalorie supply does not alleviate running-based taste aversion learning in rats  ap. 605-614.  aVoluntary running establishes aversion to the paired taste in rats. A proposed mechanism underlying this taste aversion learning is energy expenditure caused by the running. The energy expenditure hypothesis predicts that running-based taste aversion should be alleviated by a calorie supply since this would compensate for the energy expended by running. Accordingly, running-based taste aversion would be less readily established to a caloric substance (20% sucrose solution) than to a noncaloric substance (0.2% sodium saccharin solution). Because the sucrose and saccharin aversions were equivalent in Experiment 1, the validity of the energy expenditure hypothesis was questioned. Experiments 2 and 3 also pose a problem for this hypothesis, as post-session calorie supply by glucose tablets failed to alleviate running-based aversion to salty water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy expenditure 3aglucose 3alearning 3arats 3asaccharin 3asodium 3asucrose 3ataste0 tAppetite.g2011 Dec., v. 57, no. 3 p.605-614dElsevier Ltdx0195-66637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2011.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245015200168300001600320520206200336592002802398650004102426650001502467650001202482650001902494650001402513650002002527650001302547650001302560650002102573650003002594650001202624650001602636650001502652653001902667653001902686653002402705653002202729653002502751700001602776700001802792700001602810700001402826700001702840773010202857856008702959852000903046655001203055IND60558422720221117203429.0170719e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055842272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.11.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xiang10aFarmland–atmosphere feedbacks amplify decreases in diffuse nitrogen pollution in a freeze-thaw agricultural area under climate warming conditions  ap. 484-494.  aAlthough climate warming and agricultural land use changes are two of the primary instigators of increased diffuse pollution, they are usually considered separately or additively. This likely lead to poor decisions regarding climate adaptation. Climate warming and farmland responses have synergistic consequences for diffuse nitrogen pollution, which are hypothesized to present different spatio-temporal patterns. In this study, we propose a modeling framework to simulate the synergistic impacts of climate warming and warming-induced farmland shifts on diffuse pollution. Active accumulated temperature response for latitudinal and altitudinal directions was predicted based on a simple agro-climate model under different temperature increments (△T0 is from 0.8°C to 1.4°C at an interval of 0.2°C). Spatial distributions of dryland shift to paddy land were determined by considering accumulated temperature. Different temperature increments and crop distributions were inserted into Soil and Water Assessment Tool model, which quantified the spatio-temporal changes of nitrogen. Warming led to a decrease of the annual total nitrogen loading (2.6%–14.2%) in the low latitudes compared with baseline, which was larger than the decrease (0.8%–6.2%) in the high latitudes. The synergistic impacts amplified the decrease of the loading in the low and high latitudes at the sub-basin scale. Warming led to a decrease of the loading at a rate of 0.35kg/ha/°C, which was lower than the synergistic impacts (3.67kg/ha/°C) at the watershed level. However, warming led to the slight increase of the annual averaged NO3 (LAT) (0.16kg/ha/°C), which was amplified by the synergistic impacts (0.22kg/ha/°C). Expansion of paddy fields led to a decrease in the monthly total nitrogen loading throughout the year, but amplified an increase in the loading in August and September. The decreased response in spatio-temporal nitrogen patterns is substantially amplified by farmland–atmosphere feedbacks associated with farmland shifts in response to warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aarid lands 3aclimate 3aglobal warming 3aheat sums 3aland use change 3alatitude 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anonpoint source pollution 3apaddies 3atemperature 3awatersheds 0aClimate change 0aFarmland shift 0aSynergistic impacts 0aDiffuse pollution 0aHigh-middle latitude1 aOuyang, Wei1 aHao, Zengchao1 aShi, Yandan1 aWei, Peng1 aHao, Fanghua0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Feb. 01, v. 579 p.484-494dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.11.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009000167300001600257520120200273592002801475650001301503650001201516650001401528650001101542650002201553650002101575650001301596650002001609650001601629650001601645653002801661653001301689653002401702653002101726653001301747653002301760700001601783773013501799856008601934852000902020655001202029IND60552885420221119065221.0170607e20150920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055288542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Shan12aA simple method to prepare superamphiphobic aluminum surface with excellent stability  ap. 143-150.  aA superamphiphobic aluminum surface was successfully prepared by a simple and environmental method with hot ammonia solution etching and subsequent fluorosilane modification. The hierarchical triangular prism arrays-on-nanoplatelets morphology, when combined with the low surface energy material on the aluminum surface, could help the surface obtain excellent repellence toward a wide range of liquids with the surface tension of 25.7–72.1mNm−1. The processing conditions including reaction time and ammonia concentration were investigated to determine their effects on wettability. The obtained superamphiphobic aluminum surface was demonstrated to possess excellent chemical stability. The evaluation results indicated that the superamphiphobic surface had fascinating chemical stability, which could withstand corrosive liquids (HCl/NaOH solutions, 25°C), hot water (30–100°C), solvent immersion, high temperature, and long-term period. The as-prepared superamphiphobic surface was also proven to be endued good corrosion resistance. This work provides a simple, economic, environmental, and efficient way to prepare superamphiphobic aluminum surface with excellent chemical stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aammonia 3acorrosion 3aenergy 3ahydrochloric acid 3asodium hydroxide 3asolvents 3asurface tension 3atemperature 3awettability 0aHierarchical structures 0aAluminum 0aSuperamphiphobicity 0aChemical etching 0aAdhesion 0aChemical stability1 aDeng, Wenli0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2015 Sept. 20, v. 481 p.143-150dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.04.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01745naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245007000155300001800225520082900243592002801072650001201100650001101112650001401123650002301137650000901160650001201169700002301181700001101204773013201215856007501347852000901422655001201431IND60538496920221119221304.0160815e20120328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053849692DNAL7 a10.1021/ja30113972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Weibo10aLigand Effects and Ligand Design in Homogeneous Gold(I) Catalysis  ap. 5697-5705.  aGold catalysis is considered one of the most important breakthroughs in organic synthesis during the past decade, but a rational understanding of ligand effects in gold catalysis is lacking. Most gold-catalyzed reactions go through three major stages: (i) electronic activation of alkyne (or allene) to generate a vinyl gold intermediate; (ii) protodeauration to generate the product and regenerate the cationic gold catalyst; (iii) decay of the active gold catalyst. Our research provides a clearer understanding of how ligands influence each of the three stages in the gold catalytic cycle. What is even more important, by not focusing on a particular gold-catalyzed reaction, we have been able to categorize most gold-catalyzed reactions and propose a ligand design protocol for each category of gold-catalyzed reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aallene 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3agold 3aligands1 aHammond, Gerald B.1 aXu, Bo0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Mar. 28, v. 134, no. 12 p.5697-5705dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja30113973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01896naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010500156300002000261520082600281592002801107650001501135650001401150650001601164650001001180650002401190650002201214700001501236700001601251700001501267700001301282700001701295700001501312773012401327856007401451852000901525655001201534IND60618612120221118033547.0181030e20180613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061861212DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra03732a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ying10aHighly efficient green synthesis and photodynamic therapeutic study of hypericin and its derivatives  ap. 21786-21792.  aA highly efficient synthetic pathway for hypericin (7a) was achieved under mild conditions with an overall yield over two steps of 92% using emodinanthrone as a starting material, where protohypericin, a key precursor of hypericin, was synthesized in water with microwave assistance, which was then photocyclized to hypericin with a high yield via 1 h irradiation in a visible light reactor equipped with 575 nm monochromatic lamps.

Ecosystem models used to evaluate such tradeâoffs need to have the capability of capturing the dynamic stability that can arise when predatorâprey interactions are restricted to spatial and temporal arenas. Foraging arenas appear common in aquatic systems and are created by a wide range of mechanisms, ranging from restrictions of predator distributions in response to predation risk caused by their own predators, to riskâsensitive foraging behaviour by their prey. Foraging arenas partition the prey in each predatorâprey interaction in a food web into vulnerable and invulnerable states, with exchange between these states potentially limiting overall trophic flow. Inclusion of vulnerability exchange processes in models for recruitment processes and food web responses to disturbances like harvesting leads to very different predictions about dynamic stability, trophic cascades and maintenance of ecological diversity than do models based on largeâscale mass action (random mixing) interactions between prey and predators. Although a number of methods to estimate these critical exchange rates are presented, none are considered fully satisfactory. The most important challenge for the practical application of models that incorporate foraging arena theory today is not only developing new or improved methods for measuring exchange rates but also evaluating how such rates vary in responses to major fisheryâinduced changes in abundances of predators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental models 3arisk 3afood webs 3amixing 3aaquatic environment 3apredators 3afood processing 3amethodology 3apredation 3aecosystems 3aforaging 3apredator-prey relationships 0arecruitment 0anew methods1 aWalters, Carl J.,d1944-1 aChristensen, Villy0 tFish and fisheries.g2012 Mar., v. 13, no. 1 p.41-59dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00432.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001800192245020900210506007600419520085000495592002801345506003701373650003101410650002601441650001301467650001101480650001601491650001501507650002201522650001701544650001301561650001601574650001601590650001601606650001501622650001401637650001801651700003201669700002001701700002501721700002101746773012701767856008501894852000901979655001201988IND60660504820221207103157.0190823e20190805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066050482DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms70802392doi7 aPMC67232662pmcid7 a313872112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManish Kumar,10a5-Methyl Furfural Reduces the Production of Malodors by Inhibiting Sodium l-Lactate Fermentation of <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em>: Implication for Deodorants Targeting the Fermenting Skin Microbiome  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStaphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) is a common bacterial colonizer on the surface of human skin. Lactate is a natural constituent of skin. Here, we reveal that S. epidermidis used sodium l-lactate as a carbon source to undergo fermentation and yield malodors detected by gas colorimetric tubes. Several furan compounds such as furfural originating from the fermentation metabolites play a role in the negative feedback regulation of the fermentation process. The 5-methyl furfural (5MF), a furfural analog, was selected as an inhibitor of sodium l-lactate fermentation of S. epidermidis via inhibition of acetolactate synthase (ALS). S. epidermidis treated with 5MF lost its ability to produce malodors, demonstrating the feasibility of using 5MF as an ingredient in deodorants targeting malodor-causing bacteria in the skin microbiome.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aacetolactate synthase 3abacteria 3acarbon 3acolorimetry 3adeodorants 3aenzyme inhibition 3afermentation 3afurfural 3aingredients 3alactic acid 3ametabolites 3amicrobiome 3aoff odors 3askin (animal)1 aMyagmardoloonjin, Binderiya1 aKeshari, Sunita1 aNegari, Indira Putri1 aHuang, Chun-Ming0 tMicroorganisms.g2019 Aug. 05, v. 7, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms70802393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245011100129300001600240506002800256520172700284592002802011506003702039650001102076650001302087650002102100650001102121650002002132650001402152653001702166653001402183653002702197653002502224700001602249773012902265852000902394655001202403IND60740063220221207132815.0210420e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074006322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhadiyan, J.10aInvestigating the Discharge Conditions of the Circular Buoyant Co-flow Jet in the Infinitely Shallow Water  ap. 157-173.  aResource is Open Access  aDischarge of contaminants in the acceptor ambient has negative environmental impacts. Extremely shallow acceptor ambient conditions will have a significant impact on the diffusion of the contaminants flow. To achieve the effect of the hydraulic, geometric and environmental conditions of the contaminant flow in the acceptor ambient, an experimental model of surface draining was applied. The model consisted of a flume with 3.2 meters length, 0.6 meters width and 0.9 height. Accordingly, by considering three simple single drainers with the diameters of 1.2, 1.6 and 2.2 centimeters, a dense flow with 20, 40 and 60 g/L concentrations occurred in an acceptor ambient with H/d = 2. The results showed that equilibrium length was extremely decreased by increasing the concentrations; this was such that with increasing the concentration three times from 20 to 60 g/L, this length was decreased from 25 to 10. However, based on the results, it was found that the effect of the changes of the viscosity parameter over the relative length was significant, as its effect was high in all concentrations to 100; then it tended to become a constant value.. In this regard, the effect of changes in the surface tension parameters over the relative length was investigated; the results showed that this parameter was always effective in the extremely shallow acceptor ambient at all stages from the beginning to the end of the progress. It is important to note that this had a constant slope in all concentrations and surface tension had an effect on flow diffusion with a certain trend in all concentrations. In fact, surface tension in all concentrations reached to 5 after the equilibrium length and jet energy dissipation area.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenergy 3ageometry 3ahydraulic flumes 3amodels 3asurface tension 3aviscosity 0acircular jet 0adiffusion 0ainfinite shallow water 0adensity surrounding.1 aMardasi, B.0 t̒Ulūm-i āb va khāk.g2018 June, v. 22, no. 1 p.157-173dIsfahan University of TechnologywJournal:27871x2476-55547nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006800165520091100233592002801144650002801172650001301200650002001213650001001233650001401243650002301257650002301280650002301303650001201326650001301338650001801351650000901369651001301378653002601391653002501417653002201442700003301464700004001497700003401537700004001571700003601611700002101647773009401668856008201762852000901844655001201853IND60725328320221119103747.0210511e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072532832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1066562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuzmar, Isaac10aDataset for the estimation of a new body fat measurement method  aDue to the increasing prevalence of obesity and its negative consequences worldwide on public health, body composition analysis is a central pillar to assess the nutritional status.

Due to the obesity pandemic, new datasets from other populations are needed to develop a body fat basic mathematical equation formula that could be used worldwide to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity in a specific population group predisposed to develop metabolic syndrome or death, secondary to high cardiovascular risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody fat 3adata collection 3adeath 3aequations 3ametabolic syndrome 3ametropolitan areas 3anutritional status 3aobesity 3apandemic 3apublic health 3arisk 3aColombia 0aBody fat distribution 0aNutrition assessment 0aIdeal body weight1 aArroyo, José Rafael Merlano1 aVillanueva, Manuel Andrés Cantillo1 aOrtega, Laura Vanessa Sevilla1 aCortissoz, Gloria Sthefanny Goenaga1 aBandera, Xelenys Paola Granados1 aZalabata, Eliana0 tData in Brief.g2021 Feb., v. 34 p.106656-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.1066563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013700170300001600307520118800323592002801511650002401539650002001563650003001583650001001613650001301623650002001636650001201656650001901668650001601687650001201703650001201715650001201727650001001739650001401749650001401763650001201777650001101789650001101800651001501811700001901826773009601845856008101941852000902022655001202031IND60477650120221118064254.0160303e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047765012DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-015-3456-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorgman, Corrie C.14aThe indirect effects of climate variability on the reproductive dynamics and productivity of an avian predator in the arid Southwest  ap. 279-291.  aThe deserts of the southwestern US are experiencing rapid warming, and climate models predict declining winter precipitation. The combined effects of higher air temperatures and drought are a reduction in productivity, which may importantly impact reproduction in consumers. Here, we investigate the effects of warming and drought on the reproductive timing and output in loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) in central New Mexico from 2007 to 2012. We found increases in air temperature of 3 °C during the breeding season (March–July) and highly variable winter and annual precipitation. With increasing spring temperatures, shrikes advanced nesting phenology by 20 days over 6 years, a much higher rate than is reported for any other bird species. During this period, the number of breeding pairs also increased from 25 to 37, and clutch size and the number offspring produced per successful nest did not vary. Nest success, however, was often very low and ranged from 11 to 46 %. Although our models indicated that low nest success was driven by precipitation and temperature, it was mediated indirectly through increased predation rates during the hot and dry periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLanius ludovicianus 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abirds 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3aclutch size 3adeserts 3adrought 3anesting 3anests 3aphenology 3apredation 3aprogeny 3aspring 3awinter 3aNew Mexico1 aWolf, Blair O.0 tOecologia.g2016 Jan., v. 180, no. 1 p.279-291dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3456-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010300169300001600272520099900288592002801287650002901315650002501344650001201369650001101381650001301392650000901405650001101414650001101425650001101436650001401447650001501461650001701476650000901493650000901502650001401511650002601525650001101551650001901562650001901581650000901600650002201609650002301631650001501654650000901669651001001678653001701688653002201705653001801727653002301745700001801768700002501786700002201811773011601833856008801949852000902037655001202046IND60567081720221119211424.0190318e20170630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056708172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalas, P.M.10aHeavy metal distribution and contamination status in the sedimentary environment of Cochin estuary  ap. 191-203.  aHeavy metals (Fe, Mn, Cr, Zn, Ni, Pb, Cu, Co and Cd) in the surface sediments of Cochin estuary, Southwest coast of India were analyzed to understand the spatio-temporal variation and contamination status via six sampling campaigns. Pollution indices like enrichment factor, geoaccumulation index and pollution load index inferred that the sediments of the northern arm of the estuary exhibited severe trace metal accumulation. Numerical sediment quality guidelines were applied to assess adverse biological effects of the trace metals, suggesting that occasional biological effect may occur due to Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb. Correlations between metals, organic carbon, silt and clay suggested that both fine grained sediment and organic matter were important carriers for these metals. Multivariate statistics indicated that the sources of Cu and Ni resulted primarily from natural weathering processes, whereas enriched levels of Cd, Cr, Zn and Pb were mainly attributed to anthropogenic activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abioactive properties 3acadmium 3acarbon 3achromium 3aclay 3acoasts 3acobalt 3acopper 3aestuaries 3aguidelines 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amultivariate analysis 3anickel 3aorganic matter 3apollution load 3asilt 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3aweathering 3azinc 3aIndia 0aHeavy metals 0aPollution indices 0aContamination 0aEstuarine sediment1 aSujatha, C.H.1 aRatheesh Kumar, C.S.1 aCheriyan, Eldhose0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2017 June 30, v. 119, no. 2 p.191-203dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245010900214520170500323592002802028650001402056650002202070650001602092650001002108650003502118650001502153650001302168650001702181650001402198650001802212650001702230650001902247650002302266650002902289653000902318653000802327653001002335653000702345653000702352653000902359653000902368653000802377653001102385653000902396653000802405653000902413653000702422653001002429653000802439653003502447653002002482653002802502700006402530700002802594700001802622700002602640700001902666700001902685700002602704700003002730700002602760773008802786856008302874852000902957655001202966IND60720028120221122093108.0220606e20210205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072002812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2020.1453332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbazari, Mohammad Foad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3383-852610aPHBV nanofibers promotes insulin-producing cells differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells  aTissue-engineering associated techniques have long been employed to improve the various elements of the therapeutic approaches toward the more efficient ones in diabetic states. The resultant constructs comprise of the polymeric scaffolds with proper degradation rates that produce bodily compatible components, and the pluripotent cells that are highly capable of generating islet-like cells. In this study, Poly-(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) nanofibers were fabricated by the Electrospinning. After validation of its 3-D structure, fibers size and non-toxicity, insulin-producing cells (IPC) differentiation potential of the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were evaluated during growing on the PHBV nanofibers in comparison with tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). SEM analyses confirmed the 3-D and nanofibrous structure of the fabricated scaffold. The survival rate of the iPSCs cultured on the PHBV nanofibers was increased significantly compared to the cells cultured on the TCPS, which is an evidence for the non-toxicity of the nanofibers. Insulin and C-peptide secretion levels significantly increased in the differentiated iPSCs on PHBV nanofibers compared to those cells cultured on TCPS. Moreover, levels of the gene transcription and translation results revealed that insulin, Glut-2, and Pdx-1 genes and insulin protein, in IPC-differentiated iPSCs grown on PHBV nanofibers are significantly higher than those cells grown on TCPS. Taken together, these results go beyond previous reports, showing thatiPSCs-PHBV as a promising cell-copolymer construct, could potentially be applied in the pancreatic tissue engineering applications to diabetic patient treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3ac-peptide 3achemical elements 3adegradation 3agenes 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3ananofibers 3apatients 3apolystyrenes 3asecretion 3asurvival rate 3atherapeutics 3atissue culture 3atissue engineering 3atranscription (genetics) 0aPHBV 0aIPC 0aiPSCs 0app 0aEC 0aTCPS 0aNEAA 0aKSR 0aGLUT-2 0aPdx1 0aKRB 0aDAPI 0aSD 0aANOVA 0aPES 0aInduced pluripotent stem cells 0aPHBV nanofibers 0aInsulin producing cells1 aZare Karizi, Shohreh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0305-85881 aHajati-Birgani, Nazanin1 aNorouzi, Sara1 aKhazeni, Zahraalsadat1 aHashemi, Javad1 aShafaghi, Lida1 aSoleimanifar, Fatemeh1 aMansour, Reyhaneh Nassiri1 aEnderami, Seyed Ehsan0 tGene.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 768 p.145333-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.1453333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011500159520160700274592002801881650001301909650001601922650001601938650001301954650003101967650001901998650001502017700001802032700001802050700002002068700001902088700001402107700001702121700001702138700001702155700001902172773012802191856007502319852000902394655001202403IND60766930420221118215550.0220211e20220118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076693042DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140304322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Qiuning 12aA Study on Pseudorange Biases in BDS B1I/B3I Signals and the Impacts on Beidou Wide Area Differential Services  aDue to satellite signal deformations, there are different constant biases in the same satellite signal that are measured by different technical types of receivers and different satellite signals that are measured by the same type of receiver, which are named pseudorange biases. These biases cannot be transmitted to users with existing navigation parameters, such as satellite time group delay (TGD) and receiver differential code biases (DCB). With the improvement of the signal-in-space accuracy of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), the pseudorange bias has become one of the primary error sources affecting the accuracy of GNSS services. To ensure the accuracy for users under the wide area differential services (WADS), we extracted the pseudorange biases of Beidou Satellite Navigation System (BDS) B1I, B3I and B1I/B3I signals and analyzed the impact of those biases on users under the WADS. Finally, we tried to eliminate this influence. The results show that the pseudorange biases of the B3I signal are smaller than those of the B1I signal at the centimeter level, but the pseudorange biases of the B1I/B3I signal can reach the meter level. Due to the large pseudorange bias of the B1I/B3I signal, the average user equivalent ranging error (UERE) under the WADS is 1.19 m, which is no better than the average UERE under open services (OS). Influenced by the pseudorange biases, the average positioning accuracies of the B1I/B3I signal are 4.17 m and 4.24 m under the WADS and the OS. When the pseudorange biases are deducted, these accuracies are 3.03 m and 3.50 m, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3adeformation 3aexhibitions 3aextracts 3aglobal positioning systems 3aremote sensing 3asatellites1 aCao, Yueling 1 aHu, Xiaogong 1 aTang, Chengpan 1 aZhou, Shanshi 1 aGuo, Rui 1 aLi, Xiaojie 1 aTian, YiJun,1 aYang, Yufei 1 aYang, Jianhua 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 18, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140304323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245011200161300001600273520115800289592002801447650002501475650002601500650001501526650001201541650001301553650002201566650001101588650001601599650002101615650002301636650001401659650001001673650001601683651001201699653001901711653001601730653001801746653001201764653001001776700001701786700001501803700002001818773012301838856007901961852000902040655001202049IND60555508720221119172451.0161029e20160418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055550872DNAL7 a10.1139/cjps-2015-03072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoussavi, A.10aEstablishing field stands of Russian dandelion (Taraxacum Kok-saghyz) from seed in southern Ontario, Canada  ap. 887-894.  aTaraxacum Kok-saghyz (L.E. Rodin) (TKS) is a natural source of rubber. There is a rising interest in TKS establishment as a new crop in Ontario. Trials were conducted at Simcoe and Guelph, Ontario between 2013 and 2014 to explore the possibility of establishing TKS plants from seed in fields in Ontario. The effects of seeding depth, watering regimes, polymer, and covering mulch on the recruitment of TKS were explored. It was found that TKS displays very low field recruitment levels regardless of treatment. KNO₃ did not have any significant effect on TKS seed germination. Seedling emergence was greatest when seeds were placed on the soil surface and decreased with increasing seeding depth. Two years of field experiments highlighted that TKS seedlings recruit better in moderate conditions when the temperature is optimum for TKS germination (warm but not hot, <25 °C). TKS seedlings recruited better at Simcoe (with a sandy soil type) than at Guelph (with a loamy soil type). Overall, however, field recruitment from seed was low (15% at best) and these results suggest that establishing TKS from seed in Ontario fields remains a challenge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaraxacum kok-saghyz 3afield experimentation 3aloam soils 3amulches 3apolymers 3apotassium nitrate 3arubber 3asandy soils 3aseed germination 3aseedling emergence 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3atemperature 3aOntario 0anatural rubber 0arecruitment 0aseeding depth 0apolymer 0amulch1 aCici, S.Z.H.1 aLoucks, C.1 aVan Acker, R.C.0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2016 Apr. 18, v. 96, no. 5 p.887-894dCanadian Science Publishingx1918-18337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjps-2015-03073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01356naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245009500157300001800252520048500270592002800755650002100783650001900804650002200823650001900845700001400864773011400878856007700992852000901069655001201078IND60120952320221119144522.0150213e199908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012095232DNAL7 a10.1007/s0001800503802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoang, B.10a‘Identify’ and ‘lock in’: molecular integration during synaptic target recognition  ap. 1399-1406.  aSynaptic target recognition is a complex molecular event.

We present a theoretical framework for understanding synaptic target recognition and discuss the features of its molecular components and their integration, drawing on the rapid progress made in recent studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3anervous system 3aneurotransmitters 3asynaptogenesis1 aChiba, A.0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g1999 Aug., v. 55, no. 11 p.1399-1406dSpringer-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0001800503803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01806naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011900171300001600290520052900306536003100835592002800866596003000894650001300924650001300937650002300950650001600973650001100989650001201000650002301012650002301035651001001058653001401068653001501082653001201097653001001109700002601119700001701145700001701162773009901179856008501278852000901363655001201372IND60677677620221123014238.0191213e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067767762DNAL7 a10.1080/00837792.2019.16752612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarma, Jatindra10aRediscovery of Syzygium cyanophyllum (Myrtaceae): a threatened rheophytic shrub endemic to Assam, north-east India  ap. 301-305.  aSyzygium cyanophyllum is rediscovered after a gap of 103 years from Assam, north-east India.

The increased viscosity of gel brings a negative effect on surface tension which reduces the gel enhanced foam volume. In turn, the increased viscosity could enhance the thickness and strength of foam film which increases foam stability and plugging capacity in porous media. The morphology results show that the gel enhanced foam has a thicker bubble film which enhances its foam stability. The effect of injection mode, gas–liquid ratio, gas injection velocity and formation permeability on the plugging capacity was investigated by single sand-pack experiments. When the gas–liquid ratio and gas injection velocity were respectively set at 1:1 and 0.5ml/min, co-injection of gel enhanced foaming solution and gas could obtain a better plugging capacity in high permeability sand-packs. Parallel sand-pack experiments show that the profile improvement capacity of high formation permeability ratio is much better than that of low formation permeability ratio. The visual simulation experiment was also conducted to illustrate the flowing behavior of gel enhanced foam. By Jiamin effect or Jamin superimposed effect, directly plugging and bridging in the large pore space, the gel enhanced foam can effectively reduce the permeability of porous media in high permeability zones and divert fluid into low permeability zones, thus increases the swept volume. The treatment has been successfully used in Henan oilfield of China which provides a reference to water production control in other similar high temperature oilfields.  aPublisher supplied data 3afoaming 3afoams 3agels 3aoil fields 3apermeability 3apolymers 3aporous media 3asurface tension 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3aChina 0aGel enhanced foam 0aIn-depth profile control 0aStability 0aPlugging capacity 0aOilfield application1 aDai, Caili1 aZhang, Yanhui1 aChen, Ang1 aYan, Zhihu1 aZhao, Mingwei0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2015 Oct. 05, v. 482 p.115-124dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.04.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245017200166300001800338520127500356592002801631596009701659650001701756650001901773650001501792650001601807650001901823650001601842650001501858650001801873650004301891650002201934650001501956650001301971650002701984650001302011650004402024700002202068700002102090700001902111700005602130773011502186856008202301852000902383655001202392IND60638204220221119090648.0190426e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063820422DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-019-01446-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernal, José10aImproved Separation of Intact Glucosinolates in Bee Pollen by Using Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Coupled to Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry  ap. 1170-1178.  aA method to determine 15 intact glucosinolates (epiprogoitrin; glucoalyssin; glucobrassicanapin; glucobrassicin; glucoerucin; glucoiberin; gluconapin; gluconasturtiin; glucoraphanin; glucotropaeolin; 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin; 4-methoxyglucobrassicin; neoglucobrassicin; progoitrin; sinigrin) in bee pollen has been proposed, by means of ultra-high liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass detector. Efficient sample treatment (with average analyte recoveries between 80 and 96%) involving a solid-liquid extraction with hot water, followed by solid-phase extraction with a weak anion exchange sorbent (NH₂), was employed to analyze those intact glucosinolates in bee pollen. Chromatographic analysis (15 min) was performed on a fully porous silica–based column (Luna® Omega C₁₈) with a mobile phase composed of a mixture of acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) and water (0.1% formic acid) in gradient elution mode at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Accordingly, the analytical performance of the proposed method was evaluated, and it was then applied to determine intact glucosinolates in commercial bee pollen samples from different Spanish regions. Ten intact glucosinolates were identified in certain samples over a wide concentration range.  aPublisher supplied data  aRTA2015-00013-C03-03cMinisterio de Econom?a, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de Espa?a 3aacetonitrile 3aanion exchange 3abee pollen 3aformic acid 3aglucobrassicin 3aglucoiberin 3agluconapin 3aglucoraphanin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aprogoitrin 3asinigrin 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aGonzález, David,1 aValverde, Silvia1 aToribio, Laura1 aAres, Ana M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8371-39000 tFood analytical methods.g2019 May, v. 12, no. 5 p.1170-1178dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4237774x1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-019-01446-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01979naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012500157300001800282520093200300592002801232650002001260650002001280650001601300700001301316700001701329700001701346700001401363700001401377700002001391700001701411773012901428856007501557852000901632655001201641IND60754438820221121042634.0211023e20211021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075443882DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ay01299a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Congcong12aA novel liquid crystal sensing platform for highly selective UO₂²⁺ detection based on a UO₂²⁺-specific DNAzyme  ap. 4732-4738.  aA label-free and selective sensor was established for uranyl ion (UO₂²⁺) detection based on a UO₂²⁺-dependent DNAzyme and liquid crystals (LCs). In the presence of UO₂²⁺, the substrate chains can be cleaved at the rA site by the DNAzyme strands. The cleaved products released from the DNAzyme strand will hybridize with the capture probes that are fixed on the LC sensing substrate to form double strands. The formation of double strands would disturb the original orientation and induce the rearrangement of liquid crystal molecules, resulting in the polarization images changing from uniform black to bright. Attributed to the specificity of the DNAzyme and the optical signal of the LC, a highly selective and label-free method was established with a detection limit of 25 nM. This approach showed satisfactory analytical performance and offered an inspiring platform for detecting other radioactive elements.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3aliquid crystals 3auranyl ions1 aLi, Ping1 aWu, Zhaoyang1 aFan, Fengfei1 aQian, Duo1 aYi, Yuxin1 aYang, Shengyuan1 aXiao, Fubing0 tAnalytical methods.g2021 Oct. 21, v. 13, no. 40 p.4732-4738dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ay01299a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003700140245011700177520144300294592002801737650001101765650001201776650001901788650001301807650002101820650001401841650001501855650000901870650001501879650002901894651001801923651001101941700002001952700002001972700002501992700002102017700002302038700001602061700002002077700002102097700002002118700002402138773012802162856007502290852000902365655001202374IND60766930520221118215514.0220211e20220118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076693052DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140304442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade la Barreda-Bautista, Betsabe 10aTowards a Monitoring Approach for Understanding Permafrost Degradation and Linked Subsidence in Arctic Peatlands  aPermafrost thaw resulting from climate warming is threatening to release carbon from high latitude peatlands. The aim of this research was to determine subsidence rates linked to permafrost thaw in sub-Arctic peatlands in Sweden using historical orthophotographic (orthophotos), Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. The orthophotos showed that the permafrost palsa on the study sites have been contracting in their areal extent, with the greatest rates of loss between 2002 and 2008. The surface motion estimated from differential digital elevation models from the UAV data showed high levels of subsidence (maximum of −25 cm between 2017 and 2020) around the edges of the raised palsa plateaus. The InSAR data analysis showed that raised palsa areas had the greatest subsidence rates, with maximum subsidence rates of 1.5 cm between 2017 and 2020; however, all wetland vegetation types showed subsidence. We suggest that the difference in spatial units associated with each sensor explains parts of the variation in the subsidence levels recorded. We conclude that InSAR was able to identify the areas most at risk of subsidence and that it can be used to investigate subsidence over large spatial extents, whereas UAV data can be used to better understand the dynamics of permafrost degradation at a local level. These findings underpin a monitoring approach for these peatlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate 3ainterferometry 3alatitude 3aorthophotography 3apeatlands 3apermafrost 3arisk 3asubsidence 3asynthetic aperture radar 3aArctic region 3aSweden1 aBoyd, Doreen S.1 aLedger, Martha 1 aSiewert, Matthias B.1 aChandler, Chris 1 aBradley, Andrew V.1 aGee, David 1 aLarge, David J.1 aOlofsson, Johan 1 aSowter, Andrew 1 aSjögersten, Sofie 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 18, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140304443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01335naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245006000160300001600220520033400236592002800570650001600598650002200614650002600636650001700662650001200679650001600691650001900707650001300726700001700739700001700756700001500773773011100788856007700899852000900976655001200985IND60120952420221119144446.0150213e199804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012095242DNAL7 a10.1007/s0001800501632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, J.

The outcome of these collisions controls the dynamics of the granulation process and the fundamental physics of the impacts are of interest. This paper examines the impact of glass beads (model particles) and solid Poly Ethylene Glycol (PEG) flakes on a substrate of PEG as the temperature of the PEG layer is increased from below its melting point to above it. While the layer is in the solid state, the result of the impact can be quantified by the coefficient of restitution. When the layer is in the liquid state, the impact can be quantified by the immersion behaviour. The results obtained show that the coefficient of restitution between either glass beads and PEG flakes and the PEG layer is strongly affected by temperatures. As the PEG layer approaches its melting point, the coefficient of restitution falls to zero. Once the temperature of the PEG layer exceeds the melting point, the impact is characterised by a transient maximum indentation and then rebound to an equilibrium position. These too are strongly dependent on temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglass 3aliquids 3amelting point 3amodels 3apowders 3asolids 3atemperature 0aGranulation 0aImpact 0aCoefficient of restitution 0aBinder melting1 aMangwandi, C.1 aWalker, G.1 aRing, D.1 aCronin, K.0 tPowder technology.g2016 June, v. 294 p.411-420dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.02.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009300171300001600264520085600280592002801136650001301164650001301177650001801190650001101208650002001219650000901239653000901248653002401257653001901281653001801300653002201318700002601340700001801366700002601384700002101410700002801431773013401459856008601593852000901679655001201688IND60552885920221119065321.0170607e20151020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055288592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.04.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaars, Roel J.10aMorphology-controlled functional colloids by heterocoagulation of zein and nanoparticles  ap. 209-215.  aA general and reproducible heterocoagulation method is presented to prepare sub-micron sized zein protein particles, loaded with negatively charged nanoparticles. These composite carrier particles can be obtained in three different morphologies, and each morphology can be prepared using nanoparticles of various size, shape and composition. An important feature of the zein composites is their long-term stability in water even in conditions where free nanoparticles often aggregate within days. Additionally, we modify the composite particles by coating them with a thin layer of silica via condensation of sodium silicate, opening possibilities for highly specific, functionalized carrier particles. Finally, the formation of hollow silica shells containing negatively charged nanoparticles is demonstrated, using the zein composites as a template.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acolloids 3ananoparticles 3asilica 3asodium silicate 3azein 0aZein 0aComposite particles 0aSilica coating 0aNanoparticles 0aHeterocoagulation1 avan Leeuwen, Y.

The signaling system encompassing Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor NF‐κB Ligand (RANKL)/RANK/Osteoprotegerin (OPG) was discovered to play an important role in the regulation of ECM formation and degradation in bone tissue. However, whether and how this signaling pathway plays a role in liver or pulmonary ECM degradation is unclear up to now. Interestingly, increased decoy receptor OPG levels are found in fibrotic tissues. We hypothesize that RANKL can stimulate RANK on macrophages and initiate the process of ECM degradation. This process may be inhibited by highly expressed OPG in fibrotic conditions. In this case, RANKL mutants that can bind to RANK without binding to OPG might become promising therapeutic candidates. In this study, we built a structure‐based library containing 44 RANKL mutants and found that the Q236 residue of RANKL is important for OPG binding. We show that RANKL_Q236D can activate RAW cells to initiate the process of ECM degradation and is able to escape from the obstruction by exogenous OPG. We propose that the generation of RANKL mutants with reduced affinity for OPG is a promising strategy for the exploration of new therapeutics against fibrosis.  aPublisher supplied data  a11056cStichting voor de Technische Wetenschappen  cChina Scholarship Council  aT3‐112cDutch Top Institute Pharma project TNF‐ligands in cancer0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abones 3aextracellular matrix 3afibrosis 3aligands 3aliver 3amacrophages 3amutants 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aMichiels, Timo1 aSetroikromo, Rita1 avan Merkerk, Ronald1 aCool, Robbert H.1 aQuax, Wim J.0 tFEBS journal.g2019 Sept., v. 286, no. 18 p.3582-3593dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.149253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245016800171300001600339520185200355592002802207650001502235650001502250650002602265650001202291650001002303650001202313650001402325650001202339650001102351651001802362700002102380700002602401700002302427700002502450773009602475856008102571852000902652655001202661IND60477650320221118064237.0160303e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047765032DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-015-3457-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChagnon, Pierre-Luc10aInteraction type influences ecological network structure more than local abiotic conditions: evidence from endophytic and endolichenic fungi at a continental scale  ap. 181-191.  aUnderstanding the factors that shape community assembly remains one of the most enduring and important questions in modern ecology. Network theory can reveal rules of community assembly within and across study systems and suggest novel hypotheses regarding the formation and stability of communities. However, such studies generally face the challenge of disentangling the relative influence of factors such as interaction type and environmental conditions on shaping communities and associated networks. Endophytic and endolichenic symbioses, characterized by microbial species that occur within healthy plants and lichen thalli, represent some of the most ubiquitous interactions in nature. Fungi that engage in these symbioses are hyperdiverse, often horizontally transmitted, and functionally beneficial in many cases, and they represent the diversification of multiple phylogenetic groups. We evaluated six measures of ecological network structure for >4100 isolates of endophytic and endolichenic fungi collected systematically from five sites across North America. Our comparison of these co-occurring interactions in biomes ranging from tundra to subtropical forest showed that the type of interactions (i.e., endophytic vs. endolichenic) had a much more pronounced influence on network structure than did environmental conditions. In particular, endophytic networks were less nested, less connected, and more modular than endolichenic networks in all sites. The consistency of the network structure within each interaction type, independent of site, is encouraging for current efforts devoted to gathering metadata on ecological network structure at a global scale. We discuss several mechanisms potentially responsible for such patterns and draw attention to knowledge gaps in our understanding of networks for diverse interaction types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aendophytes 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3afungi 3alichens 3aphylogeny 3athallus 3atundra 3aNorth America1 aU’Ren, Jana M.1 aMiadlikowska, Jolanta1 aLutzoni, François1 aElizabeth Arnold, A.0 tOecologia.g2016 Jan., v. 180, no. 1 p.181-191dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3457-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05281naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245010400164300001300268520350400281592002803785650000803813650001503821650002803836650002503864650002003889650001903909650001203928650002003940650002203960650002603982650002404008650001004032650001304042650001104055650001004066650001904076650001304095650002204108650001904130650003304149650001104182650002204193650001804215650001404233650001004247650003004257650002204287650000804309650001604317650001004333650001904343651001504362651001204377651001104389700001704400773011404417856007904531961001204610852000904622655001204631IND60549033820221119075321.0160906e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054903382DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-03-11-01882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZambino, P. J.10aFirst Report of Rust Caused by Puccinia psidii on Paperbark, Melaleuca quinquenervia, in California  ap. 1314.  aInfections by Puccinia psidii Winter were detected on Melaleuca quinquenervia (Cav.) Blake (paperbark, tea tree) during a regular inspection of a San Diego, California nursery in November 2010 by San Diego County inspectors. Urediniospore morphology, production of bright-yellow uredinia on both upper and lower leaf surfaces, DNA sequencing, and inoculation tests confirm the identity of the pathogen. From digital image analysis, dimensions of 49 urediniospores from the paperbark rust collection were 25 (19 to 30) × 21 (18 to 23) μm, typical of uredinia of P. psidii (3). Some urediniospores also had a distinctive, unornamented “tonsure” near the base, and all pustules lacked teliospores. Both latter features are considered by some (3) as more typical of an asexual sub-taxon, Uredo rangelii Simpson, Tho., Grgur. which however, has narrower urediniospores than we report. U. rangelii is also considered less of a threat to Eucalyptus than other variants of P. psidii in the broad sense (1). The 627-bp DNA sequence of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the paperbark rust (GenBank Accession No. JF960255) obtained by John Hanna at the USDA Forest Service, Forestry Sciences Lab, Moscow, ID using PCR and ITS1/ITS4 primers had over 99% identity with 18 GenBank sequences of P. psidii from diverse Myrtaceae, including Melaleuca, Psidium, and Eucalyptus. In January and February of 2011, inoculations of 7- to 10-cm cuttings of active terminal growth demonstrated pathogenicity to the three species of Myrtaceae that were tested: paperbark, common myrtle Myrtus communis L., and brush cherry Syzygium australe (J.C. Wendl. ex Link) B. Hyland (=Eugenia australis, =E. myrtifolia) cv. Monterey Bay. Uredinia developed within 10 days of inoculation on inoculated host cuttings. Proportions of cuttings infected for paperbark, common myrtle, and brush cherry were 5 of 7, 6 of 6, and 1 of 6, respectively; pustules were most abundant on common myrtle and least abundant (a single pustule) on brush cherry. Similarly treated control cuttings were not infected. P. psidii has previously caused severe outbreaks on paperbark in Florida (2). California interceptions and nursery detections of P. psidii are recorded in the California Department of Food and Agriculture's internal, unpublished, Pest Detection Database, have all occurred since 2003, and include Florida sources. From the Database, detections on materials shipped into California nurseries have been: brush cherry from Florida, March and April, 2004 at Valley Center, CA; allspice (Pimenta dioica (L) Merr.) from Florida, June 2005 at Gilroy, CA; and Java apple/rose apple (Syzygium samarangense [Blume] Merr. & L.M. Perry [= Eugenia javanica Lam.]) from Hawaii, 2008 at Anaheim, CA. Other California nursery infestations have been: brush cherry, April 2004, at Valley Center, CA; pohutukawa (Metrosideros excelsa Solander ex J. Gaertner), July 2007 at Bonsall, CA; and common myrtle, November 2008 at Fallbrook, CA. The rust has not been reported in California on any plants outside of nursery settings or on Eucalyptus in any setting. The current strains of P. psidii in California appear likely to remain a recurrent problem for ornamental plant and foliage crops in the myrtle family grown in some nursery settings.References: (1) A.

However, the mechanism that down-regulates hMSH3 in CRC is not known. In this study, a significant association between over-expression of glucose transporter 1, a marker for hypoxia, and down-regulation of hMSH3 in CRC tissues was observed. Therefore, we examined the effect of hypoxia on the expression of hMSH3 in human cell lines. When cells with wild type p53 (wt-p53) were exposed to hypoxia, rapid down-regulation of both hMSH2 and hMSH3 occurred. In contrast, when null or mutated p53 (null/mut-p53) cells were exposed to hypoxia, only hMSH3 was down-regulated, and at slower rate than wt-p53 cells. Using a reporter assay, we found that disruption of the two putative hypoxia response elements (HREs) located within the promoter region of the hMSH3 abrogated the suppressive effect of hypoxia on reporter activity regardless of p53 status. In an EMSA, two different forms of HIF-1α complexes that specifically bind to these HREs were detected. A larger complex containing HIF-1α predominantly bound to the HREs in hypoxic null/mut-p53 cells whereas a smaller complex predominated in wt-p53 cells. Finally, HIF-1α knockdown by siRNA significantly inhibited down-regulation of hMSH3 by hypoxia in both wt-p53 and mut-p53 cells.

Using an additive and substitutive design, we examined how populations and communities containing >20 animal taxa are affected by four insecticides applied individually and as a mixture for 18 wks in aquatic mesocosms. The four insecticides had distinct lethal effects on the response and recovery of cladocerans, copepods, amphipods, isopods, and amphibians but not snails. The lethal effect on cladocerans and copepods induced trophic cascades that facilitated algal blooms and abiotic changes (higher pH and dissolved oxygen, but lower light transmission). Exposure to endosulfan resulted in a lag effect reducing cladocerans and spring-breeding amphibian abundance. The reduction in spring-breeding amphibian abundance led to cascading indirect effects on summer-breeding amphibians. Finally, the mixture treatment had lethal effects throughout the community that led to long-term effects on amphibian mass and unique indirect consequences on phytoplankton and abiotic variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aCopepoda 3aIsopoda 3aalgal blooms 3aamphibians 3adissolved oxygen 3aendosulfan 3along term effects 3apH 3aphytoplankton 3asnails 3atrophic relationships 0aAquatic community 0aOrganophosphate 0aOrganochlorine 0aInsecticide mixtures1 aRelyea, Rick0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2014 June, v. 189 p.18-26dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2014.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010800163300001600271520129500287592002801582650001501610650002101625650000901646650002001655650001001675650002001685650001101705650002501716650001901741650001501760650001401775650002201789650004301811650001701854650002401871653002901895653000901924653003601933700001601969700001501985700001702000700001302017773011502030856008202145852000902227655001202236IND60781809020221119221814.0220704e20220705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078180902DNAL7 a10.2478/jvetres-2022-00332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Xiaoli10aClinicopathological analysis of expression of enhancer of zeste homologue 2 in canine mammary carcinoma  ap. 267-272.  aEnhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) is the human homologue of Drosophila zeste gene enhancer. The aim of this study was to determine the expression of EZH2 in canine mammary carcinomas (CMCs) and its relationship with clinicopathological features. The expression of EZH2 mRNA and protein in 53 CMC tissue and 8 normal mammary gland tissue samples was measured by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining assay, respectively. The relationship between EZH2 protein expression and clinicopathological features was analysed by χ2 test to further explore the clinical significance of EZH2 in CMCs. Compared with normal mammary gland tissues, EZH2 mRNA expressions were significantly increased in CMC tissues (P < 0.01). Moreover, normal mammary glands did not express the EZH2 protein but carcinomic glands did, and expression increased in CMCs with high histological grades, especially in histological grade II (P < 0.05). However, EZH2 expression was not related to age, tumour size, or metastasis (P > 0.05). The expression of EZH2 in one type of CMC was not significantly different from the expression in any other type (P > 0.05). EZH2 is highly expressed in CMCs, indicating that it can be used as a molecular marker for early diagnosis, prognosis, or therapy of CMCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3abreast neoplasms 3adogs 3aearly diagnosis 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amammary glands 3ametastasis 3aprognosis 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 3aveterinary medicine 0acanine mammary carcinoma 0aEZH2 0aclinicopathological examination1 aFan, Yuying1 aLi, Yongqi1 aShi, Dongmei1 aLiu, Yun0 tJournal of Veterinary Research.g2022 July 05, v. 66, no. 2 p.267-272dSciendowJournal:23185x2450-86087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jvetres-2022-00333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245009600179300001600275500000900291520189000300592002802190650001302218650001202231650001002243650001902253650002802272650001402300650001202314650002502326700002202351773012202373852000902495856009802504655001202602IND9005271720221118055032.0191122e199009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900527172DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1990.0011183X003000050002x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yuguang10aRole of Carbohydrates in Desiccation Tolerance and Membrane Behavior in Maturing Maize Seed  ap. 971-975.  aepub  aSeed corn (Zea mays L.) ears harvested at seed moisture contents greater than 400 g H₂O kg⁻¹ fresh wt. (fw) are sensitive to rapid, high-temperature (45–50 °C) drying, but tolerant to low-temperature drying. A preconditioning process that precludes this injury without major moisture loss was used to study the nature of the drying damage and the role of soluble sugars in membrane stabilization during drying of two seed corn hybrids. Ears were harvested at moisture contents of 550, 450, and 400 g H₂O kg⁻¹ fw, and preconditioned at 35 °C for 6 to 48 h before drying at 50 °C. Seed germination was correlated with leachate conductivity (r = −0.79) and sugar leakage (r = −0.80) after different times of preconditioning indicating the involvement of membrane function in the damage caused by high temperature drying. Total soluble-sugar concentration decreased during preconditioning with no significant change individual monosaccharide content. The percentage composition of sucrose and a larger oligosaccharide, raffinose, increased significantly during preconditioning. The high correlations between raffinose/sucrose and warm germination, conductivity, and sugar leakage (r = 0.83, −0.80, and −0.71 for A632, and 0.89, −0.78, and −0.79 for B73, respectively) indicates the added effect of raffinose on induced protection. These results suggest that soluble-sugar compositional relationships rather than absolute content may play an important role in membrane stabilization. The presence of raffinose at certain levels also may be a key factor in protecting maturing seeds from high temperature drying damage. The results also indicate that the transition from desiccation intolerance to tolerance is metabolic and not necessarily related to moisture loss. Journal Paper no.

However, the florasulam resistance status of flixweed in the North China Plain is poorly understood, which hinders the integrated management of this weed in winter wheat production systems. Thus, 45 flixweed populations were collected in wheat fields in these areas, and their sensitivity to florasulam and ALS-inhibitor-resistant mutation diversity were assessed. Meanwhile, alternative herbicides/herbicide mixtures for the control of florasulam-resistant flixweed were screened and evaluated under greenhouse and field conditions. Of the populations, 30 showed florasulam resistance (RRR and RR), 9 had a high risk of evolving florasulam resistance (R?) and 6 were susceptible. These populations had 5.3 to 345.1-fold resistance to florasulam, and 4 ALS resistance mutations (P197H, P197S, P197T and W574L) were observed. The subsequent herbicide sensitivity assay showed that the SD-06 population (with ALS1 P197T and ALS2 W574L mutations) exhibited cross-resistance to all ALS inhibitors tested, but was sensitive to MCPA-Na, fluroxypyr, carfentrazone-ethyl and bipyrazone. Meanwhile, the other HN-07 population with non-target-site resistance (NTSR) also showed resistance to all tested ALS inhibitors, and it was “R?” to MCPA-Na while sensitive to fluroxypyr, carfentrazone-ethyl and bipyrazone. The field experiments were conducted at the research farm where the SD-06 population was collected, and the results suggested that florasulam at 3.75–4.5 g ai ha⁻¹ had little efficacy (0.6–12.1%), whereas MCPA-Na + carfentrazone-ethyl (87.1–91.2%) and bipyrazone+fluroxypyr (90.1–97.8%) controlled the resistant flixweed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDescurainia sophia 3aTriticum aestivum 3aacetolactate synthase 3achemical control 3across resistance 3afarms 3aflorasulam 3afluroxypyr 3agreenhouses 3aherbicide resistance 3amutation 3aphysiology 3arisk 3aweeds 3awinter wheat 3aChina 0aResistance status 0aNorth China plain 0aWeed management1 aSun, Penglei1 aGuo, Wenlei1 aDong, Xiuxia1 aLau, Wai Tong,1 aWang, Jinxin0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2021 Feb., v. 172 p.104748-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.1047483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03672naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245007400172500001900246520222400265592002802489650002402517650001502541650002202556650002002578650001202598650001602610650001302626650001502639650001502654650001902669650001502688653001002703653000902713653000602722653003402728653001302762700001602775700002302791700002102814700002702835700002802862700002802890700002502918700001802943773011402961856008203075852000903157655001203166IND60713113820221118180801.0201125e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071311382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1120612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoussel, Jean-Romain10alidR: An R package for analysis of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAirborne laser scanning (ALS) is a remote sensing technology known for its applicability in natural resources management. By quantifying the three-dimensional structure of vegetation and underlying terrain using laser technology, ALS has been used extensively for enhancing geospatial knowledge in the fields of forestry and ecology. Structural descriptions of vegetation provide a means of estimating a range of ecologically pertinent attributes, such as height, volume, and above-ground biomass. The efficient processing of large, often technically complex datasets requires dedicated algorithms and software. The continued promise of ALS as a tool for improving ecological understanding is often dependent on user-created tools, methods, and approaches. Due to the proliferation of ALS among academic, governmental, and private-sector communities, paired with requirements to address a growing demand for open and accessible data, the ALS community is recognising the importance of free and open-source software (FOSS) and the importance of user-defined workflows. Herein, we describe the philosophy behind the development of the lidR package. Implemented in the R environment with a C/C++ backend, lidR is free, open-source and cross-platform software created to enable simple and creative processing workflows for forestry and ecology communities using ALS data. We review current algorithms used by the research community, and in doing so raise awareness of current successes and challenges associated with parameterisation and common implementation approaches. Through a detailed description of the package, we address the key considerations and the design philosophy that enables users to implement user-defined tools. We also discuss algorithm choices that make the package representative of the ‘state-of-the-art’ and we highlight some internal limitations through examples of processing time discrepancies. We conclude that the development of applications like lidR are of fundamental importance for developing transparent, flexible and open ALS tools to ensure not only reproducible workflows, but also to offer researchers the creative space required for the progress and development of the discipline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3aecology 3aenvironment 3aforestry 3alandscapes 3aphilosophy 3aprivate sector 3avegetation 0aLiDAR 0alidR 0aR 0aAirborne laser scanning (ALS) 0aSoftware1 aAuty, David1 aCoops, Nicholas C.1 aTompalski, Piotr1 aGoodbody, Tristan R.H.1 aMeador, Andrew Sánchez1 aBourdon, Jean-François1 ade Boissieu, Florian1 aAchim, Alexis0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 251 p.112061-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1120613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03935naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245006100171300001300232520248100245592002802726650000802754650001302762650001402775650002002789650001002809650001502819650001502834650001302849650000802862650001202870650001602882650001302898650001302911650001502924650001702939650001402956650001402970650002002984650001603004650001303020650001103033650001003044651001503054651001003069653001303079653002003092653001203112653001703124653001503141653001003156773009803166856008403264852000903348655001203357IND60123377020221122214447.0150428e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012337702DNAL7 a10.1080/15275922.2014.9910052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaplan, Isaac R.13aAn Avoidable Tragedy at the Sea Cliff (Rincon) Oil Field  ap. 7-26.  aThree men were killed and four others were injured during a well drill operation on Hobson Well C-10A in the Sea Cliff Oil Field (also known as Rincon Oil Field), in Ventura County, California, United States, on August 10, 1994, as a result of errors made by the work supervisors at the site. The oil field was under management by Vintage Petroleum, Ltd., which was sued for negligence by the families of the deceased and injured. The coroner's autopsy examination concluded that the cause of the deaths was due to the inhalation of the toxic gas carbon monoxide (CO). This gas was assumed to have been released from the firing of high-energy guns (HEGs) using carbon-rich explosive pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) in an oxygen-depleted environment, during a fracking operation by Schlumberger Corporation on Well C-10A. The author of this article was appointed as an expert witness by Schlumberger to evaluate if the coroner's conclusion was correct. A series of chemical analytical analyses were conducted on the vapor phase of samples, in addition to dissolved components in water from Well C-10A and two adjacent wells. Stable isotope analyses were also conducted on hydrogen (H ₂), methane (CH ₄), nitrogen (N ₂), CO, and water (H ₂O) 3 weeks after the accident, as well as on four additional occasions from September to December 1994. Control test analyses were performed on the products from HEG firings, using the same explosives as those used in the perforation of Well C-10A in control chambers at a Schlumberger facility in Houston, Texas. The conclusion reached was that the dominant products of PETN detonations are H ₂, CH ₄, CO, and N ₂. However, the isotope ratios (D/H and ¹³C/ ¹²C) of methane in the control experiments were different in Well C-10A, following the detonation on August 10, 1994, than those resulting from controlled PETN explosions. The conclusion reached in this study was that the fracking of the well at a depth of around 2,150 ft had increased the permeability of the sediment layers in the Padres Zone at that depth to allow the rapid release of a large quantity of natural gas, primarily CH ₄, which supersaturated the water in the well. This event caused the formation of a large bubble, which ballooned out of the well to the surface, displacing air in the location where the men were working, and thus causing asphyxiation, which resulted in the death of the three men. The judge accepted this interpretation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aasphyxia 3abreathing 3acarbon monoxide 3adeath 3aexplosions 3aexplosives 3ahydrogen 3amen 3amethane 3anatural gas 3anecropsy 3anitrogen 3aoil fields 3apermeability 3apetroleum 3asediments 3astable isotopes 3asupervisors 3atoxicity 3avapors 3awells 3aCalifornia 3aTexas 0afracking 0acarbon monoxide 0amethane 0aasphyxiation 0anegligence 0adeath0 tEnvironmental forensics.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 16, no. 1 p.7-26dTaylor & Francisx1527-59307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15275922.2014.9910053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012500166300002000291520185700311592002802168650001602196650002002212650001702232650001902249650002502268650001602293650002302309650002602332650001902358650002502377650004402402650004102446650001002487650002202497650001602519650001302535650001502548650001902563650001602582650001802598650001402616650001802630650001302648650001802661700001402679700001702693700001602710700001702726700001902743773014902762856008102911852000902992655001203001IND60572521320221122040320.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057252132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-8463-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Cuiping10aStructure and function of the bacterial communities during rhizoremediation of hexachlorobenzene in constructed wetlands  ap. 11483-11492.  aVertical flow constructed wetlands (VF CWs) are considered to be effective for treating organic pollutants. The rhizosphere of macrophytes such as Phragmites sp., Typha sp. serves as an active and dynamic zone for the microbial degradation of organic pollutants. However, it is still not clear how soil bacterial communities respond to macrophytes and pollutants during the process. For this purpose, the seedlings of Phragmites australis and Typha angustifolia were planted respectively in the VF CWs added with HCB at a dose of 2 mg/kg. During 96 days of cultivation, we monitored hexachlorobenzene (HCB) removal efficiency by GC/MS and the structure of the rhizosphere bacterial communities in the different VF CWs by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and constructed bacterial clone library based on PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene. As expected, the rhizosphere bacterial communities also remained insensitive to HCB exposure in the wetland soil. The diversity of these microbes presented two stages, from the varied up and down to equilibrium in the entire experimental period. Molecular analysis revealed that the phylum Firmicutes dominated over the bacterial communities. The genera that increased under HCB stress included the well-known HCB-degrading bacteria (Pseudomonas sp. and Alcaligenes sp.) and other common bacteria found in contaminated soil but with lesser known practical functions (Burkholderia sp., Lysinibacillus fusiformis, and Bacillus cereus). Furthermore, there was a certain variance in the relative abundances of the bacterial phyla and HCB removal efficiency among different VF CW treatments. The degradation of HCB in T. angustifolia microcosms was faster than that in P. australis and unvegetated wetlands, and the highest bacterial diversity and richness was found in the VF CWs comprising T. angustifolia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcaligenes 3aBacillus cereus 3aBurkholderia 3aLysinibacillus 3aPhragmites australis 3aPseudomonas 3aTypha angustifolia 3abacterial communities 3abiodegradation 3aconstructed wetlands 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agenes 3ahexachlorobenzene 3amacrophytes 3aplanting 3apollutants 3apolluted soils 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal RNA 3aseedlings 3asoil bacteria 3avariance 3awetland soils1 aWang, Bei1 aDai, Xiaoyan1 aLi, Shuying1 aLu, Guangqiu1 aZhou, Yuanqing0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Apr., v. 24, no. 12 p.11483-11492dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-8463-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01866naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245011300163300001600276500002000292520052600312592002800838596001000866596008100876596006400957596002801021650001701049650001601066650001201082650001601094650001901110650001301129650001201142650001701154700002201171700006101193773013101254856007401385852000901459655001201468IND60626803420221119213526.0181229e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062680342DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.292252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Katharine Y.10aReplacement of ProB28 by pipecolic acid protects insulin against fibrillation and slows hexamer dissociation  ap. 264-267.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNon‐canonical amino acid mutagenesis was used to examine the biophysical consequences of changing ring size and structure at the single proline site in insulin.

Since 2005, Fujian Province of Mainland China and Taiwan across the Taiwan Strait have both implemented aggressive air pollution control policies designed based on different principles, but a comprehensive evaluation of these control policies on PM₂.₅pollution levels is still lacking. In the current study, we assessed the effects of these policies in the Taiwan Strait Region from 2005 to 2018 using full-coverage, high-resolution PM₂.₅generated by a satellite-driven machine learning model. A ten-fold cross-validation for our prediction model showed an R²value of 0.89, demonstrating that these predictions can be used for policy evaluation. During the 14-year period, PM₂.₅levels in all areas of Fujian and Taiwan underwent a significant decrease. Separate regression models for policy evaluation in Taiwan and Fujian showed that all considered policies have mitigated PM₂.₅pollution to various degrees. The Clean Air Action Plans (CAAP) is the most effective control policy in Taiwan, while the Action Plan of Air Pollution Prevention and Control (APPC-AP) and Three-year Action Plan for Blue Skies (3YAP-BS) as well as their provincial implementation plans are the most successful in Fujian. The effectiveness of control policies, however, varies by land-use types especially for Taiwan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair pollution control 3adecision making 3aenvironment 3aland use 3amodels 3apolicy analysis 3asatellites 3aChina 3aTaiwan 0aAir pollution control policy 0aEfficacy evaluation 0aPM2.5 exposure assessment 0aRandom Forest 0aTaiwan Strait1 aBi, Jianzhao1 aMeng, Xia1 aGeng, Guannan1 aHuang, Keyong1 aLi, Jing1 aTang, Lina1 aLiu, Yang0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 251 p.112067-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1120673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245011500204506007600319520146300395592002801858506003701886650002201923650001501945650003101960650001201991650001202003650001002015650001302025650001602038650001102054650001702065650001602082650001302098650002802111650002402139650001102163650002002174700002002194700002002214700002302234773011902257856007702376852000902453655001202462IND60651316620221207135046.0190711e20190624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065131662DNAL7 a10.3390/plants80601852doi7 aPMC66303722pmcid7 a312385222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoly, Valentin 10aPollination Type Recognition from a Distance by the Ovary Is Revealed Through a Global Transcriptomic Analysis  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSexual reproduction in flowering plants involves intimate contact and continuous interactions between the growing pollen tube and the female reproductive structures. These interactions can trigger responses in distal regions of the flower well ahead of fertilization. While pollination-induced petal senescence has been studied extensively, less is known about how pollination is perceived at a distance in the ovary, and how specific this response is to various pollen genotypes. To address this question, we performed a global transcriptomic analysis in the ovary of a wild potato species, Solanum chacoense, at various time points following compatible, incompatible, and heterospecific pollinations. In all cases, pollen tube penetration in the stigma was initially perceived as a wounding aggression. Then, as the pollen tubes grew in the style, a growing number of genes became specific to each pollen genotype. Functional classification analyses revealed sharp differences in the response to compatible and heterospecific pollinations. For instance, the former induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related genes while the latter affected genes associated to ethylene signaling. In contrast, incompatible pollination remained more akin to a wound response. Our analysis reveals that every pollination type produces a specific molecular signature generating diversified and specific responses at a distance in the ovary in preparation for fertilization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSolanum chacoense 3aaggression 3aethylene signaling pathway 3afemales 3aflowers 3agenes 3agenotype 3aplant ovary 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3apollination 3apotatoes 3areactive oxygen species 3asexual reproduction 3astigma 3atranscriptomics1 aTebbji, Faïza 1 aNantel, André,1 aMatton, Daniel  P.0 tPlants.g2019 June 24, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants80601853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245009000178300001600268520095800284592002801242650002001270650002401290650002001314650001701334650001301351650001101364650001101375650002201386650001501408650001701423650000901440650002101449650001101470650001301481650000901494651001001503651001101513653001401524653001701538653001301555653001801568653002301586700002201609700002201631700002801653773010101681856008401782852000901866655001201875IND60123377120221122214441.0150428e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012337712DNAL7 a10.1080/15275922.2014.9910062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomnitsas, Konstantinos10aUsing Various Guidelines and Approaches for the Assessment of Marine Sediment Quality  ap. 109-116.  aThe aim of the present study is to explore the implications of using different quality guidelines and approaches for marine sediment characterization. As a case study, the sediments of Souda Port, Crete, Greece, were examined in order to assess heavy metal contamination and to estimate anthropogenic contribution and potential adverse effects to aquatic environment, as well as to indicate feasible future management options. The concentration of six heavy metals (Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) was determined and compared with different sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) and regional/national criteria established for dredged material characterization and management. In addition, the geo-accumulation index (I gₑₒ) was calculated and the sediments toxicity and heavy metals bioavailability were determined. Based on the experimental data, it is deduced that Souda sediments are characterized as moderately polluted only in terms of Co, Ni, and Pb.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aaquatic environment 3abioavailability 3acase studies 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3adredged materials 3aguidelines 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amarine sediments 3anickel 3atoxicity 3azinc 3aCrete 3aGreece 0asediments 0aheavy metals 0atoxicity 0acontamination 0aquality guidelines1 aPyliotis, Ioannis1 aZaharaki, Dimitra1 aManoutsoglou, Emmanouil0 tEnvironmental forensics.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 16, no. 1 p.109-116dTaylor & Francisx1527-59307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15275922.2014.9910063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006800152245012900220500002200349500002200371520141000393592002801803650004401831650002701875650002601902650002601928650002001954650002901974650002502003650001702028650001302045650002102058650001902079650001302098650001702111650001802128650001302146650001602159650001002175650000902185650001302194650001802207650000702225650001802232650001502250650001302265650003702278650003702315653002702352653001602379653001602395653001802411653001702429700002702446700002802473700002202501700005702523700002602580700002302606773011102629856008602740852000902826655001202835IND60613749420221122020224.0180914s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061374942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.06.1982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaravanakumar, Kandasamy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4465-437810aFungal enzyme-mediated synthesis of chitosan nanoparticles and its biocompatibility, antioxidant and bactericidal properties  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aThis paper reports the synthesis of chitosan nanoparticles (T-CSNPs) using the fungal enzyme of Trichoderma harzianum and its biocompatible, antioxidant and bactericidal properties. This T-CSNPs synthesis was confirmed by strong plasma (Plasmon) resonance peak at 280 nm using UV–Vis spectrophotometer. T-CSNPs were of spherical shape, as evident by field emission transmission electron microscopic (FETEM) analysis, and the average size of T-CSNPs was 90.8 nm, as calculated using particle size analyzer (PSA). The functional groups showed modifications of Chitosan in T-CSNPs, as evident by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) analysis. T-CSNPs were found soluble at wide range of pH, showing 100% solubility at pH 1–3 and 72% at pH 10. The T-CSNPs exhibited antioxidant property in dose-dependent manner with pronounced activity at 100 mg·mL⁻¹. The T-CSNPs also showed bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium by causing detrimental effects on bacterial cells. The T-CSNPs (50 μg·mL⁻¹) did not display any cytotoxic effect on murine fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells, as evident by Cell viability and acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining assays, which confirmed biocompatibility of the nanoparticles. This work suggested further investigations on utilization of the mycosynthesized nanochitosan in biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3aacridine orange 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abacteria 3abiocompatibility 3acell viability 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3aethidium 3afibroblasts 3afungi 3amice 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aparticle size 3asolubility 3astaining 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aChitosan nanoparticles 0aTrichoderma 0aAntioxidant 0aAntibacterial 0aCytotoxicity1 aChelliah, Ramachandran1 aMubarakAli, Davoodbasha1 aJeevithan, Elango1 aOh, Deog-Hwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7472-04361 aKathiresan, Kandasamy1 aWang, Myeong-Hyeon0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.06.1983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008800171300001400259520086300273592002801136650001201164650001201176650001901188650001201207650001901219650000901238650001001247650000901257653002501266653001501291653001701306653001701323653001701340653001301357700001701370700001901387700002101406700002801427700002101455700001901476773008701495856008401582852000901666655001201675IND60546015120221118223108.0160903e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054601512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2014.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Nevel, Lotte10aMetal and nutrient dynamics in decomposing tree litter on a metal contaminated site  ap. 54-62.  aIn a forest on sandy, metal polluted soil, we examined effects of six tree species on litter decomposition rates and accompanied changes in metal (Cd, Zn) and nutrient (base cations, N, C) amounts. Decomposition dynamics were studied by means of a litterbag experiment lasting for 30 months. The decomposition peak occurred within the first year for all tree species, except for aspen. During litter decomposition, high metal litter types released part of their accumulated metals, whereas low metal litter types were characterized by a metal enrichment. Base cations, N and C were released from all litter types. Metal release from contaminated litter might involve risks for metal dispersion towards the soil. On the other hand, metal enrichment of uncontaminated litter may be ecologically relevant as it can be easily transported or serve as food source.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3acations 3achemical bases 3aforests 3apolluted soils 3arisk 3atrees 3azinc 0aLitter decomposition 0aLitterbags 0aTree species 0aTrace metals 0aBase cations 0aNitrogen1 aMertens, Jan1 aDemey, Andreas1 aDe Schrijver, An1 aDe Neve, S.q(Stefaan),1 aTack, Filip M.G.1 aVerheyen, Kris0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2014 June, v. 189 p.54-62dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2014.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03770naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245014800177300001600325520196600341592002802307650002202335650001502357650001602372650001802388650001702406650002002423650001302443650001202456650001702468650001302485650002102498650001902519650001802538650001302556650002102569650001802590650001702608650001902625650003302644650001402677650001702691650001602708650001502724650001602739650002502755653001402780653001402794653002402808653001702832653002502849653001202874700002702886700001902913773012602932856008903058852000903147655001203156IND60085395520221116185856.0190410e20131005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008539552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2013.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehranfar, Fahimeh12aA combined spectroscopic, molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation study on the interaction of quercetin with β-casein nanoparticles  ap. 100-107.  aThe interaction of quercetin with β-casein nanoparticle micelle was studied at various temperatures in order to do a complete thermodynamic and molecular analysis on the binding process. The results of fluorescence studies showed the possibility of fluorescence energy transfer between excited tryptophan and quercetin. The determined values of critical transfers distance and the mean distance of ligand from Trp-143 residues in β-casein micelle represents a non-radiative energy transfer mechanism for quenching and the existence of a significant interaction between this flavonoid and β-casein nanoparticle. The equilibrium binding of quercetin with β-casein micelle at different temperatures was studied by using UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy. The chemometric analysis (principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) methods) on spectrophotometric data revealed the existence of two components in solution (quercetin and β-casein–quercetin complex) and resolved their pure concentration and spectral profiles. This information let us to calculate the equilibrium binding constant at various temperatures and the relevant thermodynamic parameters of interaction (enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy) with low uncertainty. The negative values of entropy and enthalpy changes represent the predominate role of hydrogen binding and van der Waals interactions in the binding process. Docking calculations showed the probable binding site of quercetin is located in the hydrophobic core of β-casein where the quercetin molecule is lined by hydrophobic residues and make five hydrogen bonds and several van der Waals contacts with them. Moreover, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation results suggested that this flavonoid can interact with β-casein, without affecting the secondary structure of β-casein. Simulations, molecular docking and experimental data reciprocally supported each other.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aabsorption 3abeta-casein 3abinding sites 3achemometrics 3aenergy transfer 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aleast squares 3amicelles 3amolecular models 3ananoparticles 3aphotobiology 3aphotochemistry 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquercetin 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3atryptophan 3auncertainty 3avan der Waals forces 0aβ-Casein 0aQuercetin 0aUV–Vis absorption 0aFluorescence 0aChemometric analysis 0aDocking1 aBordbar, Abdol-Khalegh1 aParastar, Hadi0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2013 Oct. 05, v. 127 p.100-107dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2013.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002700188245006000215300001800275500001100293506007600304520107400380592002801454506003701482650001401519650001901533650001601552650001601568650001101584650001001595650001801605650001901623650002301642650001701665650001201682650001701694650001301711700002001724700002901744700001901773773012301792856008101915852000901996655001202005IND60549104020221207063839.0160910e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054910402DNAL7 a10.1007/s12272-016-0807-82doi7 aPMC50071892pmcid7 a275150492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlores-Toro, Joseph A.10aAutophagy in the liver: cell’s cannibalism and beyond  ap. 1050-1061.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChronic liver disease and its progression to liver failure are induced by various etiologies including viral infection, alcoholic and nonalcoholic hepatosteatosis. It is anticipated that the prevalence of fatty liver disease will continue to rise due to the growing incidence of obesity and metabolic disorder. Evidence is accumulating to indicate that the onset of fatty liver disease is causatively linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal lipid accumulation. Current treatment options for this disease are limited. Autophagy is an integral catabolic pathway that maintains cellular homeostasis both selectively and nonselectively. As mitophagy and lipophagy selectively remove dysfunctional mitochondria and excess lipids, respectively, stimulation of autophagy could have therapeutic potential to ameliorate liver function in steatotic patients. This review highlights our up-to-date knowledge on mechanistic roles of autophagy in the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease and its vulnerability to surgical stress, with an emphasis on mitophagy and lipophagy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautophagy 3adisease course 3afatty liver 3ahomeostasis 3alipids 3aliver 3aliver failure 3aliver function 3ametabolic diseases 3amitochondria 3aobesity 3apathogenesis 3apatients1 aGo, Kristina L.1 aLeeuwenburgh, Christiaan1 aKim, Jae-sung,0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2016 Aug., v. 39, no. 8 p.1050-1061dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-016-0807-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03372naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100001700189245008600206300001100292506007600303520151000379592002801889596006501917506003701982650001802019650002102037650002702058650002002085650001202105650001802117650001902135650002002154650001402174650002302188650002302211650001002234650003702244650003402281650002002315650001702335650001902352650002502371650000902396650002402405650001502429651001402444700002002458700001802478700002002496700001702516700001802533773012702551856008302678852000902761655001202770IND60687074420221207112904.0220709e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068707442DNAL7 a322047032pmid7 aPMC70925122pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-020-02889-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Dahye10aRumex acetosa modulates platelet function and inhibits thrombus formation in rats  ap. 98.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The Rumex acetosa has been used in medicinal treatment, food technology and phytotherapeutics in Eastern Asia and many other countries. However, its effect on cardiovascular system and antiplatelet activity remained to be known. In this study, we examined the antiplatelet activity of R. acetosa in detailed manner to understand underlying mechanism. METHODS: To study this, whole blood was obtained from male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats and aggregation of washed platelets measured using light transmission aggregometry. Intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca²⁺]ᵢ) was measured using Fura-2/AM while ATP release evaluated by luminometer. Activation of integrin αIIbβ₃ analyzed by flow cytometry and clot retraction. Furthermore, we studied the signaling pathways mediated by R. acetosa extract by western blot analysis. RESULTS: R. acetosa extract markedly inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation and ATP release in a dose-dependent manner. It also suppressed [Ca²⁺]ᵢ mobilization, integrin αIIbβ₃ activation and clot retraction. The extract significantly attenuated phosphorylation of the MAPK pathway (i.e., ERK1/2, JNK), MKK4, PI3K/Akt, and Src family kinase. CONCLUSION: Taken together, this data suggests that R. acetosa extract exhibits anti-platelet activity via modulating MAPK, PI3K/Akt pathways, and integrin αIIbβ₃-mediated inside-out and outside-in signaling, and it may protect against the development of platelet-related cardiovascular diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  aNational Research Foundation of KoreacMinistry of Education0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRumex acetosa 3aWestern blotting 3aadenosine triphosphate 3ablood platelets 3acalcium 3adose response 3aflow cytometry 3afood technology 3aintegrins 3alaboratory animals 3alight transmission 3amales 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aphytotherapy 3aplant extracts 3aplatelet aggregation 3arats 3asignal transduction 3athrombosis 3aEast Asia1 aIrfan, Muhammad1 aLee, Dong-ha,1 aHong, Seung-Bok1 aOh, Jae-Wook1 aRhee, Man Hee0 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.98-98dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-020-02889-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03533naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245011400199300001600313500002000329520157800349592002801927596005701955596005702012596007302069596005902142596005902201596011502260596012902375650002302504650002102527650006602548650001302614650002102627650004402648650003002692650002202722650001202744700006002756700005702816773013102873856007403004852000903078655001203087IND60626803520221119213419.0181229e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062680352DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.291912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishimori, Kana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4980-641110aDesign of maleimide monomer for higher level of alternating sequence in radical copolymerization with styrene  ap. 367-375.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis work deals with design of maleimide monomer toward more precise control of alternating sequence for radical copolymerization with styrene. Crucial in this study is sequence analysis by MALDI‐TOF‐MS for resultant copolymers that was obtained via ruthenium‐catalyzed living radical copolymerization with a malonate‐based alkyl halide initiator showing selective initiation ability. The copolymers of a simple N‐alkyl maleimide [e.g., N‐ethyl maleimide (EMI)] with styrene gave complicated peak patterns for the MALDI‐TOF‐MS spectra indicating low degree of alternating sequence, in contrary to expectation from the reactivity ratios (almost zero). A simple substitution of methyl group (CH₃) of EMI with trifluoromethyl (CF₃: CF₃‐MI) made the peak patterns much simpler giving the copolymer with higher alternating sequence. More interestingly, the peak interval of the copolymer at earlier polymerization stage was equal to sum of the molecular weights of CF₃‐MI and styrene, suggesting possibility of the pair propagation of the monomers. Indeed, ¹H NMR analyses of the mixture of maleimide with styrene suggested stronger interaction of CF₃‐MI than EMI. Based on the results, maleimide derivatives carrying a substituent‐designable electron‐withdrawing group [ROC(O)N–: R = substituent] were newly designed toward incorporation of functional side chains. They also gave higher alternating sequence for the copolymerization with styrene. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

Techniques based on X-ray radiation and visible light reflection, such as “blue intensity” (BI), integrate both the density/composition and the dimensions of the cell walls to derive microdensitometric data. In contrast, the dendroanatomical technique relies only on the dimensions of the cell walls. It is therefore possible to isolate cell wall variables by subtracting data derived using the dendroanatomical technique from data derived using X-ray and BI-based techniques.In this study, we explore differences in well-replicated data from parallel X-ray, BI, and dendroanatomical measurements of temperature-sensitive Pinus sylvestris trees from northern Finland. We aim to determine whether cell wall density is critical to the success of X-ray-based MXD, and whether the BI-based parameter counterpart, here termed MXBI, contains useful information about the composition of the cell wall (specifically the lignin).Our results indicate that cell wall density and cell wall BI have no relevant influence on MXD and MXBI measurements. Even in years with severely reduced lignification, identified as so-called “blue rings”, dendroanatomical MXD (aMXD) measurements do not deviate significantly from their MXD or MXBI counterparts. Moreover, derived chronologies of cell wall density and cell wall BI contain no significant climate signals when correlated with local climate. Maximum latewood density of conifers can thus be obtained without bias using the dendroanatomical technique. Because lignin content appears to play a negligible role for cell wall BI, the cell wall BI likely presents the biggest challenge when producing unbiased MXBI data. This is because BI data is notorious for cell wall color distortion across the heartwood and sapwood, and between living wood and dead wood, and may therefore distort the otherwise strong link with wood density on multidecadal scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aX-radiation 3abias 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3aclimate 3acolor 3aconifers 3adead wood 3adensity 3adimensions 3aheartwood 3ainformation 3alatewood 3alight 3alignification 3alignin 3alignin content 3asapwood 3atemperature 3atrees 3awood 3awood density 3aFinland 0aX-ray density 0aDendroanatomy 0aBlue reflectance 0aPalaeoclimatology1 aFonti, Marina V.1 aFonti, Patrick1 aVan den Bulcke, Jan1 avon Arx, Georg0 tDendrochronologia.g2021 Feb., v. 65 p.125785-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl71157x1125-78657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2020.1257853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245010900174300002000283520195000303592002802253650002102281650001502302650002202317650002002339650003102359650001602390650002802406650001702434650001802451650001502469650003902484650001302523650002002536650002002556650001302576650001602589700002402605773014902629856008102778852000902859655001202868IND60572521520221122040438.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057252152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6686-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSillapawattana, Panwad10aEffects of imidacloprid on detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase on Folsomia candida (Collembola)  ap. 11111-11119.  aChemical analyses of the environment can document contamination by various xenobiotics, but it is also important to understand the effect of pollutants on living organisms. Thus, in the present work, we investigated the effect of the pesticide imidacloprid on the detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) from Folsomia candida (Collembola), a standard test organism for estimating the effects of pesticides and environmental pollutants on non-target soil arthropods. Test animals were treated with different concentrations of imidacloprid for 48 h. Changes in steady-state levels of GST messenger RNA (mRNA) and GST enzyme activity were investigated. Extracted proteins were separated according to their sizes by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the resolved protein bands were detected by silver staining. The size of the glutathione (GSH) pool in Collembola was also determined. A predicted protein sequence of putative GSTs was identified with animals from control group. A 3-fold up-regulation of GST steady-state mRNA levels was detected in the samples treated with 5.0 mg L⁻¹ imidacloprid compared to the control, while a 2.5- and 2.0- fold up-regulation was found in organisms treated with 2.5 and 7.5 mg L⁻¹ imidacloprid, respectively. GST activity increased with increasing imidacloprid amounts from an initial activity of 0.11 μmol min⁻¹ mg⁻¹ protein in the control group up to 0.25 μmol min⁻¹ mg⁻¹ protein in the sample treated with the 5.0 mg L⁻¹ of pesticide. By contrast, the total amount of GSH decreased with increasing imidacloprid concentration. The results suggest that the alteration of GST activity, steady-state level of GST mRNA, and GSH level may be involved in the response of F. candida to the exposure of imidacloprid and can be used as biomarkers to monitor the toxic effects of imidacloprid and other environmental pollutants on Collembola.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFolsomia candida 3abiomarkers 3achemical analysis 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression regulation 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3aimidacloprid 3amessenger RNA 3apollutants 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins 3asilver staining 3asoil arthropods 3atoxicity 3axenobiotics1 aSchäffer, Andreas,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Apr., v. 24, no. 12 p.11111-11119dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6686-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001100151245012000162520108900282592002801371650002601399650002101425650001801446650001301464650002301477650001401500650002301514653002001537653004901557653001801606653002001624653002601644700001801670700001901688700001501707700001701722700005701739773011101796856008601907852000901993655001202002IND60696088420221119040506.0200824e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069608842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1093142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xu10aKinetic models to understand the coexistence of formation and decomposition of hydroperoxide during lipid oxidation  aTheoretical and empirical models about the coexistence of formation and decomposition of hydroperoxide during lipid oxidation under Rancimat conditions were established, verified and compared in this research. Theoretical models were proposed based on the simplified three steps of free radical chain reactions by solving kinetic differential equations, giving both formation and decomposition equations. Empirical models were modified from former phenomenological equations by eliminating the parameter of inflection time. Two groups of equations were both well verified by 93 sets of experimental data with adj-R² of 0.9585–0.9967 and 0.9431–0.9977. Theoretical models were only suitable for the accumulation period of hydroperoxide, while empirical models were able to describe the whole process but give the inappropriate formation and decomposition equations. The further applications of models in quantitatively defining oxidation stages (lag, exponential and stationary phases) and re-evaluating the total oxidation value (TOTOX’ = 2.27*PV + AnV) were also introduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3adifferential equation 3aempirical models 3afree radicals 3akinetics 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidation 3atheoretical models 0aLipid oxidation 0aFormation and decomposition of hydroperoxide 0aKinetic model 0aOxidation stage 0aTotal oxidation value1 aWu, Gangcheng1 aHuang, Jianhua1 aZhang, Hui1 aJin, Qingzhe1 aWang, Xingguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8571-60720 tFood research international.g2020 Oct., v. 136 p.109314-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1093143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245012900164300001600293520098700309592002801296650001501324650001001339650001301349650001801362650001701380650001401397650002401411650002101435650002801456650001101484650001701495653002201512653001801534653001901552700002301571773013501594856008701729852000901816655001201825IND60621664020221122092442.0190131e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062166402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.10.1952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Xin10aUtilisation of dietary fibre (non-starch polysaccharide and resistant starch) molecules for diarrhoea therapy: A mini-review  ap. 572-577.  aWithin the last ten years the utilisation of dietary fibre formats (non-starch polysaccharide and resistant starch) for diarrhoea therapy, have been evaluated. These polysaccharides ferment within the colon and generate short chain fatty acids which facilitate sodium absorption. Comparisons between polysaccharide structure/physico-chemical properties and fermentation capacity in the large intestine are presented. The potential dichotomy associated with recommending dietary fibre ingestion to avoid and treat diarrhoea is also considered. Overall, this mini-review presents an overview of the current knowledge with respect to role of dietary fibre in the management (prevention and treatment) of diarrhoea (osmotic and secretory). It aims to inform the medical and non-medical communities with respect to this relatively poorly researched and understood health related area. Different forms of dietary fibre are considered in this context along with their mechanisms of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acolon 3adiarrhea 3adietary fiber 3afermentation 3aingestion 3amechanism of action 3aresistant starch 3ashort chain fatty acids 3asodium 3atherapeutics 0aDiarrhoea therapy 0aDietary fibre 0aPolysaccharide1 aTester, Richard F.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 122 p.572-577dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.10.1953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012900163500001900292520170700311592002802018650001502046650001102061650001602072650001102088650001402099650001502113653002402128653002202152653001902174653001602193653001902209653002802228653001902256653003102275700001702306773011402323856008202437852000902519655001202528IND60713114020221118180849.0201125e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071311402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1120812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Fukai10aImproving precision of high-rate altimeter sea level anomalies by removing the sea state bias and intra-1-Hz covariant error  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper assessed the precision of 20-Hz sea level anomaly (SLA) estimates with different sea state bias (SSB) corrections from reprocessed Jason-1/2/3 and Sentinel-3A data over the period of 2002–2019 within 100 km from the entire Australian coast. The altimeter waveforms were retracked by the modified Brown-peaky (MBP) retracker for Jason missions and by the SAMOSA+ retracker for Sentinel-3A. We recalculated the 20-Hz and composite SSB corrections using a regional parametric model from 20-Hz retracked estimates of the SLA, significant wave height (SWH) and wind speed. The composite SSB correction, which was recomputed after removing the retracker-dependant correlated error in 20-Hz SLA, is found to achieve better performance than other SSB corrections in the study area. Applying the 20-Hz and composite SSB corrections has reduced ~10% and ~13% of noise, respectively, in the MBP-retracked 20-Hz Jason SLA estimates, while only ~2% of noise reduction is shown by applying the 1-Hz standard SSB correction. It is also found that the improvement of retracked Sentinel-3A SLA estimates by SSB corrections is very low (~3%), indicating a dedicated SSB correction model should be developed for the SAR mode altimeter.As a result, the precision of composite SSB-corrected SLA estimates for all Jason missions can be retained at the level of 5.1 ± 1.1 cm until 3 km from the Australian coast, which is slightly lower than that of Sentinel-3A (4.2 ± 0.9 cm). The degradation within 3 km from the coast mainly corresponds to the along-track direction for MBP-retracked Jason SLA estimates, and the across-track direction for SAMOSA+ retracked Sentinel-3A SLA estimates, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltimeters 3acoasts 3aenvironment 3amodels 3asea level 3awind speed 0aSatellite altimetry 0aSea level anomaly 0aJason missions 0aSentinel-3A 0aData precision 0aAustralian coastal zone 0aSea state bias 0aIntra-1-Hz covariant error1 aDeng, Xiaoli0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 251 p.112081-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1120813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01479naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012100157300002000278520049400298592002800792650002100820650001700841650001300858650002200871650001900893650001600912700001600928700001600944773012100960856007501081852000901156655001201165IND60550308320221122002905.0160910e20141205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055030832DNAL7 a10.1021/jo502349a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Huangdi10aMild and Catalyst-Free Petasis/Decarboxylative Domino Reaction: Chemoselective Synthesis of N-Benzyl Propargylamines  ap. 11812-11818.  aMulticomponent domino reactions are attractive for assembling functionalized compounds.

S12-S40.  aZinc supplementation trials carried out among children have produced variable results, depending on the specific outcomes considered and the initial characteristics of the children who were enrolled. We completed a series of meta-analyses to examine the impact of preventive zinc supplementation on morbidity; mortality; physical growth; biochemical indicators of zinc, iron, and copper status; and indicators of behavioral development, along with possible modifying effects of the intervention results. Zinc supplementation reduced the incidence of diarrhea by ∼20%, but the impact was limited to studies that enrolled children with a mean initial age greater than 12 months. Among the subset of studies that enrolled children with mean initial age greater than 12 months, the relative risk of diarrhea was reduced by 27%. Zinc supplementation reduced the incidence of acute lower respiratory tract infections by ∼15%. Zinc supplementation yielded inconsistent impacts on malaria incidence, and too few trials are currently available to allow definitive conclusions to be drawn. Zinc supplementation had a marginal 6% impact on overall child mortality, but there was an 18% reduction in deaths among zinc-supplemented children older than 12 months of age. Zinc supplementation increased linear growth and weight gain by a small, but highly significant, amount. The interventions yielded a consistent, moderately large increase in mean serum zinc concentrations, and they had no significant adverse effects on indicators of iron and copper status. There were no significant effects on children's behavioral development, although the number of available studies is relatively small. The available evidence supports the need for intervention programs to enhance zinc status to reduce child morbidity and mortality and to enhance child growth. Possible strategies for delivering preventive zinc supplements are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3ablood serum 3achild growth 3acopper 3adiarrhea 3adietary mineral supplements 3ainfants 3airon 3amalaria 3ameta-analysis 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apreschool children 3apuberty 3arelative risk 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aweight gain 3azinc 0aChildren 0agrowth 0ainfants 0airon status indicators 0amorbidity 0amortality 0aprevention 0azinc supplementation1 aPeerson, Janet M.1 aBaker, Shawn K.1 aHess, Sonja Y.0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 30, no. 1_suppl1 p.S12-S40dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/15648265090301S1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245015700162300001800319520160900337592002801946650002001974650002101994650000902015650001902024650001502043650002602058650001502084700001802099700002202117773011002139856007502249852000902324655001202333IND60529586420221120082812.0160717e20130305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052958642DNAL7 a10.1021/ac303642p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazenby, Robert
A.10aHopping Intermittent Contact-Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (HIC-SECM): Visualizing Interfacial Reactions and Fluxes from Surfaces to Bulk Solution  ap. 2937-2944.  aHopping intermittent contact-scanning electrochemical microscopy (HIC-SECM) is introduced as a powerful new technique for the quantitative visualization of redox activity and concentration at and above a surface of interest. HIC-SECM combines a hopping imaging mode, in which data are acquired at a tip as a function of distance (z) from the surface, at a series of x, y pixels across the surface, using the principles of intermittent contact to provide a nonelectrochemical means of determining when the tip and the substrate come into contact. The implementation of HIC-SECM is described, and SECM feedback measurements in three-dimensional (3D) space over a gold band array are presented. To demonstrate the generality of the methodology, flux imaging is also carried out over a Pt-disk ultramicroelectrode (UME) in the feedback mode and substrate generation/tip collection mode. The type of information that can be extracted from the data sets acquired include x-y current maps at a well-defined tip–substrate separation (parallel to the surface), x-z current maps (normal to the surface), 3D x-y-z profiles, approach curves at particular spots on the surface of interest, and surface topography. Moreover, because HIC-SECM utilizes an oscillating probe, alternating current data are also obtained that greatly enhances the information content compared to other types of electrochemical imaging. Furthermore, interfacial fluxes are ubiquitous in chemistry and allied areas, and HIC-SECM opens up the possibility of detailed flux visualization in three dimensions for many physicochemical processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aelectrochemistry 3agold 3aimage analysis 3amicroscopy 3aquantitative analysis 3atopography1 aMcKelvey, Kim1 aUnwin, Patrick R.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 Mar. 05, v. 85, no. 5 p.2937-2944dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac303642p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100006100181245011600242300001600358500002000374506007600394520055200470592002801022596004501050596004401095596006801139596006401207596004501271596004701316506003701363650001501400650004401415650001901459650001301478700006201491700006201553700001601615700001901631700005801650700008501708700005901793700006301852700006601915700002301981700005802004700005802062700006102120700007502181700006302256700006702319700006202386700006002448773013102508856007402639852000902713655001202722IND60626803620221207095156.0181229e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062680362DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.292472doi7 aPMC64746832pmcid7 a310112402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDolinski, Neil D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2160-881110aWhat happens in the dark?

In this study, emerging photo‐mediated controlled radical polymerizations are evaluated with in situ ¹H NMR monitoring to assess their behavior in the dark. Interestingly, it is observed that Cu‐mediated systems undergo long‐lived, linear growth during dark periods in organic media.  aPublisher supplied data  aW911NF‐09‐0001cArmy Research Office  aFT12010096cAustralian Research Council  aW911NF‐09‐0001cInstitute for Collaborative Biotechnologies  aR35GM119702cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  aDMR 1720256cNational Science Foundation  aCHE‐1752140cNational Science Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amonitoring 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aPage, Zachariah A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1013-54221 aDiscekici, Emre H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7083-57141 aMeis, David1 aLee, In‐Hwan1 aJones, Glen R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5378-60731 aWhitfield, Richard C.q(Richard Charles),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4787-20601 aPan, Xiangcheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3344-46391 aMcCarthy, Blaine G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4137-37031 aShanmugam, Sivaprakash1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5954-13361 aKottisch, Veronika1 aFors, Brett P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2222-38251 aBoyer, Cyrille1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4564-47021 aMiyake, Garret M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2451-70901 aMatyjaszewski, K.q(Krzysztof),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1960-34021 aHaddleton, David M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4965-08271 aRead de Alaniz, Javier,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2770-94771 aAnastasaki, Athina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6615-10261 aHawker, Craig J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9951-851X0 tJournal of polymer science.g2019 Feb. 1, v. 57, no. 3 p.268-273dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3938549x0887-624X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.292473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011300171300001600284520102500300592002801325650001701353650001501370650001801385650001501403650001901418650001701437650001801454650002501472650002101497651001001518700002001528700001401548700001801562700001901580773012101599856008101720852000901801655001201810IND60549104220221119040347.0160906e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054910422DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-015-0535-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSai krishnaveni, A.10aSARAL/AltiKa Altimetry Data for Monitoring of Inland Water Body: a Case Study of Mayurakshi Reservoir, India  ap. 797-802.  aPresent study aims at monitoring of water levels for Mayurakshi reservoir (~68 sq. km) located in the Jharkhand state, India using Geophysical Data Records (GDR) data from SARAL/AltiKa launched in February, 2013. Reservoir water levels for the period April, 2013 to December 2014 were derived from space using SARAL/AltiKa data. The absolute average difference, standard deviation and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between altimetric data and gauge readings were 0.49, 0.29 and 0.56 m respectively. The accuracy of the relative water levels ranges between 0.008 and 0.8 m with a mean of 0.34 m, standard deviation of 0.27 m and RMSE of 0.44 m. Resulting time series of relative height changes and the amplitude variations are identical for most of the study period except during low stage, linked to the fact that some reservoir waveforms are season dependent. The results highlight the applicability of the SARAL/AltiKa data for monitoring small to medium reservoirs having surface area less than 100 sq. km.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ageophysics 3ainland waters 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3asurface area 3asurface water 3atime series analysis 3awater reservoirs 3aIndia1 aChowdary, V.

Western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, is a key pest of corn in the midwestern United States that has developed field-evolved resistance to all available Bt traits. The first Bt trait to be commercialized for management of rootworm was Cry3Bb1 in 2003, and field-evolved resistance appeared in 2009. In this study, we examined fields in counties where greater-than-expected injury to Cry3 (Cry3Bb1 or mCry3A) corn roots (>1 node) had previously been reported (problem counties) and counties where injury had not been reported (non-problem counties). Four to eight fields were sampled per county in 2015, 2016, and 2017 to quantify rootworm abundance, root injury, Cry3Bb1resistance, and rootworm management strategies. Rootworm abundance, root injury, and resistance to Cry3Bb1 did not differ between county types. Management tactics differed between county types, with problem counties growing more corn, using more soil insecticide, and growing more Cry34/35Ab1 corn. Additionally, a comparison of root injury to Bt and non-Bt corn within fields indicated that farmers derived an economic benefit from planting Bt corn to manage corn rootworm. Our results suggest that rootworm populations are similar between problem and non-problem counties in Iowa due to similar levels of selection pressure on Cry3 corn, but problem county fields have applied more management tactics due to previous rootworm issues in the area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 3abacteria 3acorn 3aentomology 3afinancial economics 3ainsecticides 3apests 3aselection pressure 3asoil 3aIowa 0aintegrated pest management 0alandscape 0aresistance management 0arootworm 0atransgenic crop1 aHead, Graham P.1 aGassmann, Aaron J.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2020 May 25, v. 113, no. 4 p.1839-1849dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toaa1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245014100178300001400319500001400333520053400347592002800881650001500909650001700924650001500941650001300956650001700969650001900986651001101005700002801016700002801044700002501072700003101097700002401128700002701152700002901179700002801208700001901236700003601255700003501291700003201326773014201358856008301500852000901583655001201592IND60717426220210315000000.0201230e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071742622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.riam.2020.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoester, Vanice Rodrigues10aDisseminated sporotrichosis with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in an HIV patient: Case report and review of the literature  ap. 97-99.  aNAL-light  aSporotrichosis has been occurring as outbreaks in Brazil, reaching epidemic levels in some regions.

The broader community has also embraced the term and, ultimately, it has become a proxy for species conservation. As a consequence, conservation of biodiversity has effectively become the only approach to minimising continued species loss. However, despite the widespread use of the term, there is confusion over its definition, even among disciplines to which the term has become a focus. In Australia, much of the biodiversity conservation/restoration is community-driven (e.g., landcare, political pressure of animal welfare groups) with a focus on species and habitat biodiversity. Genetic diversity is seldom seriously considered. As a consequence, native species biodiversity management is often not maximising the potential outcomes. Arguably the greatest issue associated with incorporating genetics more centrally into biodiversity restoration is that its definition is often considered complex. In addition, the negative aspects of ignoring the genetic component of biodiversity may be masked by the positives when the outputs of a program provide many individuals of species considered at risk of extinction despite the longer term outcomes potentially having the opposite effect. To better manage biodiversity restoration all of us who use the term within our discipline need to ensure that, wherever possible, we seek to inform those around us of the importance of genetic biodiversity in biodiversity restoration programs. A first step is to determine a simple, all-encompassing definition of biodiversity that explicitly includes genetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3abiodiversity 3aextinction 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3apolitics 3arisk 3aAustralia 0adefinition of biodiversity 0asingle-species management 0aspecies diversity 0acommunity-driven ecological restoration 0akoala conservation 0aendangered species restoration0 tAustralian zoologist.g2014, dRoyal Zoological Society of NSWwJournal:19830x0067-22387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7882/AZ.2014.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245014300164300001600307520094400323592002801267650001201295650001901307650001101326650001401337650002601351650001301377650001501390650001901405650001801424650001201442651001001454653002401464653001401488653001601502653000901518653001801527700005601545700001801601773008801619856008401707852000901791655001201800IND60546015320221118223054.0160903e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054601532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2014.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Enzai10aEffects of nitrogen additions on biomass, stoichiometry and nutrient pools of moss Rhytidium rugosum in a boreal forest in Northeast China  ap. 166-171.  aGlobal nitrogen (N) deposition has been enhanced with anthropogenic N emissions, and its impacts on mosses are receiving more and more attention. This study investigates how N deposition influence the biomass and stoichiometry of moss Rhytidium rugosum, using a 3-year N enrichment experiment with 0, 2, 5 and 10 g N m−2 yr−1 in a boreal forest in Northeast China. Low N additions caused an N redundancy and moderate to high N additions resulted in a biomass loss. N additions reduced biomass ratios of green to brown tissues and increased N and phosphorus (P) contents, suggesting changes in photosynthetic capacity and litter decomposition. Biomass N pools showed a unimodal response to the N additions, and P pools decreased under moderate and high N additions. Our findings indicate significant stoichiometric and biomass changes caused by N deposition may lead to a substantial carbon and nutrient loss in boreal moss carpets.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aboreal forests 3acarbon 3aemissions 3amosses and liverworts 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3astoichiometry 3atissues 3aChina 0aNitrogen deposition 0aN:P ratio 0aCarbon pool 0aMoss 0aBoreal forest1 aLiu, Xiuyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6142-52511 aFang, Jingyun0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2014 May, v. 188 p.166-171dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2014.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245009000206300001800296520136400314592002801678596009701706596009601803650002901899650001501928650002001943650001801963650001001981650001301991650001302004650001102017653001102028653002102039653001002060653001202070653000802082700005502090700005902145700005802204773013202262856008602394852000902480655001202489IND60779071320221121055229.0220603e20220511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077907132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.2c001372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xinyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0934-415510aProfiling Yeast Deletion Strains Using Sample Multiplexing and Network-Based Analyses  ap. 1525-1536.  aThe yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a widely used model system for investigating conserved biological functions and pathways. Advancements in sample multiplexing have facilitated the study of the yeast proteome, yet many yeast proteins remain uncharacterized or only partially characterized. Yeast deletion strain collections are powerful resources for yeast proteome studies, uncovering the effects of gene function, genetic interactions, and cellular stresses. As complex biological systems cannot be understood by simply analyzing the individual components, a systems approach is often required in which a protein is represented as a component of large, interacting networks. Here, we evaluate the current state of yeast proteome analysis using isobaric tag-based sample multiplexing (TMTpro16) to profile the proteomes of 75 yeast deletion strains for which we measured the abundance of nearly 5000 proteins. Using statistical approaches, we highlighted covariance and regulation subnetworks and the enrichment of gene ontology classifications for covarying and coregulated proteins. This dataset presents a resource that is amenable to further data mining to study individual deletion strains, pathways, proteins, and/or interactions thereof while serving as a template for future network-based investigations using yeast deletion strain collections.  aPublisher supplied data  aGM132129cNational Institute of General Medical Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000057  aGM67945cNational Institute of General Medical Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000057 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acovariance 3adata collection 3agene ontology 3agenes 3aproteome 3aresearch 3ayeasts 0aTMTpro 0adeletion strains 0ayeast 0aRTS-MS3 0aYKO1 aLi, Jiaming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9065-69131 aGygi, Steven P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7626-00341 aPaulo, Joao A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4291-413X0 tJournal of proteome research.g2022 May 11, v. 21, no. 6 p.1525-1536dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.2c001373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245021600166300001800382520163600400592002802036650003202064650001002096650001302106650002302119700001902142700001902161700002202180700001602202700001602218700002202234700002002256700002402276773012102300856008202421852000902503655001202512IND60576407320221119002346.0170804e20170706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057640732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b029972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasuda, Satoshi10aHot-Spot Residues to be Mutated Common in G Protein-Coupled Receptors of Class A: Identification of Thermostabilizing Mutations Followed by Determination of Three-Dimensional Structures for Two Example Receptors  ap. 6341-6350.  aG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are indispensable to life and also implicated in a number of diseases, construct important drug targets. For the efficient structure-guided drug design, however, their structural stabilities must be enhanced. An amino-acid mutation is known to possibly lead to the enhancement, but currently available experimental and theoretical methods for identifying stabilizing mutations suffer such drawbacks as the incapability of exploring the whole mutational space with minor effort and the unambiguous physical origin of the enhanced or lowered stability. In general, after the identification is successfully made for a GPCR, the whole procedure must be followed all over again for the identification for another GPCR. Here we report a theoretical strategy by which many different GPCRs can be considered at the same time. The strategy is illustrated for three GPCRs of Class A in the inactive state. We argue that a mutation of the residue at a position of NBW = 3.39 (NBW is the Ballesteros–Weinstein number), a hot-spot residue, leads to substantially higher stability for significantly many GPCRs of Class A in the inactive state. The most stabilizing mutations of the residues with NBW = 3.39 are then identified for two of the three GPCRs, using the improved version of our free-energy function. These identifications are experimentally corroborated, which is followed by the determination of new three-dimensional (3D) structures for the two GPCRs. We expect that on the basis of the strategy, the 3D structures of many GPCRs of Class A can be solved for the first time in succession.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3adrugs 3amutation 3aphysical chemistry1 aKajiwara, Yuta1 aToyoda, Yosuke1 aMorimoto, Kazushi1 aSuno, Ryoji1 aIwata, Sō,1 aKobayashi, Takuya1 aMurata, Takeshi1 aKinoshita, Masahiro0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 July 06, v. 121, no. 26 p.6341-6350dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.7b029973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001700161245008400178300001800262500000900280500001500289520167000304592002801974650001802002650001602020650001002036650001002046650001602056650001402072650001502086650002002101650001102121653002502132653001002157773012402167852000902291856009802300655001202398IND9005272520221118060300.0191122e199009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900527252DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1990.0011183X003000050010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilen, T.

Merr.] seed protein and oil concentrations and their interrelationships with seed yield are important considerations in a soybean breeding program. Brachytic stem and narrow leaflet traits were transferred to a ‘Tracy-M’ background to evaluate their effect on seed yield and concentration of seed protein and oil. Data were collected oil eight brachytic stem (sb) lines, eight narrow leaflet (In)lines, seven lines with the combination (sb, In) of traits, and the recurrent parent, Tracy-M, from 1986 through 1988 at Stoneville, MS, on a Sharkey clay soil (very-fine, montmorillonitic, nonacid, thermic Vertic Haplaquept). Seed protein and oil concentrations were determined by near infrared reflectance. Combined over years, Tracy-M had a seed yield of 2612 kg ha⁻¹. Seed yields of the sb, sb In, and In groups were 2352, 2213, and 2361 kg ha⁻¹, respectively, and were significantly (P ≤ 0.01) lower than that of Tracy-M. Seed protein concentration of the sb, sb In, and In groups were 441, 444, and 426 g kg⁻¹, respectively, and were all significantly (P ≤ 0.01) different from the 432 g kg⁻¹ protein concentration of Tracy-M. Only the sb In group had an oil concentration that was significantly (P ≤ 0.01) different from that of Tracy-M. The reason for the significantly higher seed protein concentration of brachytic lines over that of the recurrent parent Tracy-M is unknown. None of the ancestors used in the development of the experimental lines has a seed protein concentration as high as that of Tracy-M.

These small wetlands support the growth of rare plant species. Although their origins, which could be anthropogenic or geologic due to salt/gypsum lens dissolution, have been debated for 150years, they have not yet been the focus of an integrated study. In 39 geological borings along a 15-km² strip, no salt/gypsum lenses and more than 260 CDs were recorded using LiDAR. All of the investigated CDs have a bathtub form with a flat bottom. Complete excavations clearly showed a cut contact between the sediment and the horizontal marl substratum at the bottom, and a cut at the edges of the upper marl layers. Radiocarbon dating of sediment bottoms showed that sedimentation began between the second Iron Age and the Roman period. The frequencies of pollen and Sporormiella-type depict an open landscape with grassland, pasture and cropland. These convergent findings challenge the hypothesis that CDs formed naturally and suggest that they area instead anthropogenic. Because no soil deposits were found around the CDs, digging may have been intended to marl the surrounding acidic silty soils. The high density and small size of CDs will allow the detailed reconstruction of landscape and biodiversity modifications in the region for the two last millennia.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acropland 3agrasslands 3agypsum 3alandscapes 3alidar 3amarl 3apastures 3apollen 3aradiocarbon dating 3asediments 3asilty soils 3awetlands 3aFrance1 aRuffaldi, Pascale1 aGoepp, Stéphanie1 aRitz, Frédéric1 aGeorges-Leroy, Murielle1 aPollier, Benoit1 aDambrine, Etienne0 tGeomorphology.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 126, no. 1-2 p.121-131dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2010.10.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010600174500002200280500002200302520144400324592002801768650001201796650001701808650001701825650001201842650001101854650001801865650001301883650001901896650001401915650002101929650003901950650001701989650002202006653001102028653001702039653002102056653002902077653003302106653002702139700002302166700002402189700002402213700001702237700001902254700002602273773011102299856008602410852000902496655001202505IND60613749820221122020524.0180914s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061374982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.06.1372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiccardi, Claudia10aExploring the conformational behaviour and aggregation properties of lipid-conjugated AS1411 aptamers  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aAS1411 is a nucleolin-binding aptamer which attracted great interest as active targeting ligand for the selective delivery of therapeutic agents to tumour cells. In this work we selected three AS1411 derivatives 5′-conjugated with lipophilic tails and studied their properties in view of their application in liposomial formulations and/or lipid coated-nanoparticles for targeted therapies.The conformational behaviour of these AS1411 analogs has been investigated in comparison with the unmodified aptamer by CD, UV, PAGE, SEC-HPLC, DLS and thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assays to get insight in their secondary structure and aggregation properties. This study has been performed in pseudo-physiological buffers mimicking the extra- and intracellular environments, and at different concentrations in the μM range, paying special attention to the effects of the lipophilic tail on the overall aptamer conformation. The 5′-lipidated AS1411 derivatives proved to fold into stable, parallel unimolecular G-quadruplex structures, forming large aggregates, mainly micelles, at conc. >10 μM. Preliminary bioscreenings on selected cancer cells showed that these derivatives are less cytotoxic than AS1411, but maintain a similar biological behaviour.This study demonstrated that lipophilic tails dramatically favour the formation of AS1411 aggregates, however not impairing the formation and thermal stability of its peculiar G4 motifs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffers 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence 3aligands 3alipids 3alipophilicity 3amicelles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3atherapeutics 3athermal stability 0aAS1411 0aG-quadruplex 0aLipid conjugates 0aConformational behaviour 0aBiophysical characterization 0aAggregation properties1 aMusumeci, Domenica1 aKrauss, Irene Russo1 aPiccolo, Marialuisa1 aIrace, Carlo1 aPaduano, Luigi1 aMontesarchio, Daniela0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.06.1373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003000153245009300183300001400276520163700290592002801927650003101955650001801986650001102004650001902015650002602034650001402060650001602074650000902090650001902099650001502118650002302133650002502156650001902181650001602200650001002216653002502226653000802251653001802259653002902277653003102306653001902337700001902356700002302375700001802398700001902416700002102435773010502456856008802561852000902649655001202658IND60538105120221122005743.0190319e20150324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053810512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuntingford, C.q(Chris),10aCombining the [ABA] and net photosynthesis-based model equations of stomatal conductance  ap. 81-88.  aStomatal conductance gs is variously depicted as being dependent on environmental conditions (Jarvis, 976), transpiration (Monteith, 1995), net photosynthesis (Leuning, 1995) or chemical signalling arriving in the xylem (Tardieu and Davies, 1993). Accurate descriptions of gs are being increasingly demanded in the large-scale land surface model components of General Circulation Models (GCMs) to predict future land-atmospheric fluxes of water vapour, heat and carbon dioxide. The JULES model, for instance, uses the net photosynthesis description combined with a relatively simple semi-linear dependence on soil moisture content that modulates the photosynthesis dependence (Cox et al., 1998).Dewar (2002) combines the Leuning (1995) and Tardieu and Davies (1993) models. We revisit that combination, and discuss whether the Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) implicit in both components is different or in common. Further, we show a potential re-arrangement of the combined equations reveals that this model for gs can be considered as being dependent on only four variables: evaporative flux Jw, net photosynthesis an, soil moisture content θ and ambient CO2 concentration ca. Expressed this way, gs is influenced by two relatively slowly varying stores of the hydrological and carbon cycles (soil water content and atmospheric CO2) and two more rapidly fluctuating fluxes from both cycles (evaporation and net photosynthesis).We consider how the modelling structure and its response to both canopy-level and soil environmental controls may make it suitable for inclusion in GCMs, and what this entails in terms of parameterisation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aabscisic acid 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aenvironmental factors 3aequations 3aevaporation 3aheat 3aphotosynthesis 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3astomatal conductance 3avapor pressure 3awater vapor 3axylem 0aStomatal conductance 0aABA 0aSoil moisture 0aTerrestrial carbon cycle 0aGeneral circulation models 0aClimate change1 aSmith, D.

They are among the main reservoirs, carriers, and transmitters of many infectious and parasitic diseases. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Ambo, Bako and Gojo towns of West Shoa Zone, from January 2015 to June 2017 with the objectives of estimating the prevalence and associated risk factors of gastrointestinal helminths of dogs. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used for data analysis. P-value of <0.05 was considered significant. Out of 310 dogs sampled and subjected to faecal examination using flotation and sedimentation methods, 158 (50.97%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 45.26–56.66%) of the dogs were positive for helminths infection. The study identified Ancylostoma caninum (36.8%), Toxocara canis (9.7%), Uncinaria spp. (4.5%), Physaloptera canis (4.5%), Salminicola canis (3.22%), Oncicola canis (1.9%), Spirocerca lupi (0.3%), T. leonina (1.0%), Trichuris vulpis (0.97%), Diphyllobothrium (1.29%), Taenid spp. (0.3%), and Mesocestoides spp. (0.3%). Out of the 243 male and 67 female dogs examined, 123 males (50.6%) and 35 females (52.2%) were positive for one or more gastrointestinal helminths. There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the overall prevalence of helminth infections between sexes, age, breed, district and management of dogs. From the total positive dogs, 123 (39.7%) had a single infection while 36 (11.6%) of dogs had mixed infection. The odds of acquiring T. canis was 4.88 times higher in dogs of Gojo (p = 0.004) as compared to Bako town. The probability of acquiring T. canis infection was 4.49 times higher in juvenile dogs (p = 0.012) as compared to adult dogs. The prevalence of gastrointestinal helminths of dogs in Ambo, Bako, and Gojo towns was high. The diversity of the helminth parasites detected together with their zoonotic importance calls for the need of regular deworming and training of dog owners to create awareness about transmission, clinical signs, prevention, and control of helminth parasites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAncylostoma caninum 3aDiphyllobothrium 3aMesocestoides 3aPhysaloptera 3aSpirocerca lupi 3aToxocara canis 3aTrichuris vulpis 3aUncinaria 3aadults 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3adeworming 3adogs 3afecal examination 3afemales 3agastrointestinal system 3ahelminths 3ajuveniles 3amales 3aregression analysis 3aveterinary parasitology 3aEthiopia 0aDog 0aPrevalence 0aRisk factors 0aWest Shoa1 aTola, Getachew Kebebew1 aSarba, Edilu Jorga1 aGetaneh, Abraham Mekebib1 aMarami, Lencho Megersa1 aEndale, Solomon Shiferaw0 tVeterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports.g2020 July, v. 21 p.100443-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23280x2405-93907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2020.1004433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245012400197300001600321500002000337520061200357592002800969596006900997596005901066596005901125596006201184596002201246596002201268596002201290650002301312650001701335650001901352650002301371700006301394700005401457700003001511700006301541773013101604856007401735852000901809655001201818IND60626803920221119213330.0181229e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062680392DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.292242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagata, Yuuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5926-584512aA bidirectional screw‐sense induction of poly(quinoxaline‐2,3‐diyl)s that depends on the degree of polymerization  ap. 260-263.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPoly(quinoxaline‐2,3‐diyl)s containing (S)‐3‐octyloxymethyl side chains with low degree of polymerization exhibited M‐helical conformations in cyclohexane, while the polymers with high low degree of polymerization adopt P‐helical conformations.

The 2011 Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident released radiocesium into the atmosphere and into the western Pacific Ocean; other investigators have detected Fukushima-derived radionuclides in a variety of marine products harvested off the western coast of North America. We tested two subsistence-consumed food products from St. Paul Island, Alaska for Fukushima-derived radionuclides: 54 northern fur seal, and nine putchki (wild celery, Angelica lucida) plants. Individual northern fur seal samples were below minimum detectable activity concentrations of ¹³⁷Cs and ¹³⁴Cs, but when composited, northern fur seal tissues tested positive for trace quantities of both isotopes. Radiocesium was detected at an activity concentration of 37.2 mBq ¹³⁴Cs kg⁻¹ f.w. (95% CI: 35.9–38.5) and 141.2 mBq ¹³⁷Cs kg⁻¹ f.w. (95% CI: 135.5–146.8). The measured isotopic ratio, decay-corrected to the date of harvest, was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.25–0.28). The Fukushima nuclear accident released ¹³⁴Cs and ¹³⁷Cs in roughly equal quantities, but by the date of harvest in July 2014, this ratio was 0.2774, indicating that this population of seals has been exposed to small quantities of Fukushima-derived radiocesium. Activity concentrations of both ¹³⁴Cs and ¹³⁷Cs in putchki were below detection limits, even for composited samples. Northern fur seal is known to migrate between coastal Alaska and Japan and the trace ¹³⁴Cs in northern fur seal tissue suggests that the population under study had been minimally exposed Fukushima-derived radionuclides. Despite this inference, the radionuclide quantities detected are small and no impact is expected as a result of the measured radiation exposure, either in northern fur seal or human populations consuming this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngelica 3aCallorhinus ursinus 3aaccidents 3acesium 3acoasts 3afoods 3ahuman population 3aisotopes 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3aradioactivity 3aradionuclides 3aseals 3atissues 3aAlaska 3aJapan 3aPacific Ocean 0aCs-134 0aCs-137 0aBioaccumulation 0aNuclear reactor 0aFukushima 0aSeal1 aDuncan, Colleen1 aDickerson, Bobette1 aWilliams, Michael1 aGelatt, Thomas1 aBell, Justin1 aJohnson, Thomas E.0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2016 Feb., v. 152 p.1-7dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2015.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01704naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245006500133300001600198500001900214520078400233592002801017650001501045650002501060650002801085653001601113653001101129653002101140700001601161700001901177773019701196852000901393655001201402IND60716724120221120065755.0201224e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071672412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Lakhwinder10aDevelopment Perspectives of Women self help Groups in Punjab  ap. 163-171.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSelf-help groups engaged in development activities have the potential to empower their members through the provision of knowledge, skills, motivation, and competencies that underpin sustainable agriculture.

The Agrobacterium T-DNA oncogene 6b causes complex growth changes in tobacco including enations; this unusual phenotype has been called “6b enation syndrome”. A detailed morphological and anatomical analysis of the aerial part of Nicotiana tabacum plants transformed with a dexamethasone-inducible dex-T-6b gene revealed several striking growth phenomena. Among these were: uniform growth of ectopic photosynthetic cells on the abaxial leaf side, gutter-like petioles with multiple parallel secondary veins, ectopic leaf primordia emerging behind large glandular trichomes, corniculate structures emerging from distal ends of secondary veins, pin-like structures with remarkable branching patterns, ectopic vascular strands in midveins and petioles extending down along the stem, epiascidia and hypoascidia, double enations and complete inhibition of leaf outgrowth. Ectopic stipule-like leaves and inverted leaves were found at the base of the petioles. Epinastic and hyponastic growth of petioles and midveins yielded complex but predictable leaf folding patterns. Detailed anatomical analysis of over sixty different 6b-induced morphological changes showed that the different modifications are derived from hypertrophy and abaxial hyperplasia, with ectopic photosynthetic cells forming spot-like, ridge-like and sheet-like meristems and ectopic vascular strands forming regular patterns in midveins, petioles and stems. Part of the enation syndrome is due to an unknown phloem-mobile enation factor. Graft experiments showed that the 6b mRNA is mobile and could be the enation factor. Our work provides a better insight in the basic effects of the 6b oncogene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aaerial parts 3abranching 3ahyperplasia 3ahypertrophy 3aleaf primordia 3amessenger RNA 3aoncogenes 3apetioles 3aphenotype 3astems 3atobacco 3atransfer DNA 3atrichomes1 aOtten, Léon0 tPlanta.g2016 Jan., v. 243, no. 1 p.131-148dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-015-2387-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013100160300002000291520100800311592002801319650001301347650002401360650001801384650001501402650001301417650001301430650001701443650000901460650001301469650002801482650001901510650001401529650002401543700002401567700001701591700001401608700001801622700002101640773012401661856007401785852000901859655001201868IND60640800120221118071554.0190505e20160627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064080012DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra08196g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sŭng-han,10aPhotothermal conversion upon near-infrared irradiation of fluorescent carbon nanoparticles formed from carbonized polydopamine  ap. 61482-61491.  aFluorescence and photothermal conversion mediated by near-infrared radiation (NIR) is reported for carbonized polydopamine nanoparticles. Carbonized polydopamine demonstrated excitation-dependent fluorescence emission, together with NIR-responsive photothermal conversion properties. The concentration-dependent photothermal heating from carbonized fluorescent carbon nanoparticles-polydopamine (FNP-pDA) induces hyperthermal killing of both cancer cell lines and bacteria in vitro. Although most of the dopamine moieties of polydopamine become dehydrated upon carbonization, the remaining dopamine-hydroxyl groups can confer adhesive properties. These fluorescent coatings are compatible with many substrates, and the surface passivation of FNP-pDA with polyethylene glycol improves quantum yield and extends fluorescence lifetimes. The novel infrared-responsive photothermal and fluorescent carbon nanoparticles reported here show promise for a range of potential biomedical and research applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3acarbon quantum dots 3acarbonization 3acell lines 3acoatings 3adopamine 3afluorescence 3aheat 3amoieties 3anear infrared radiation 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apolyethylene glycol1 aSharker, Shazid Md.1 aLee, Haeshin1 aIn, Insik1 aLee, Kang Dae1 aPark, Sung Young0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 27, v. 6, no. 66 p.61482-61491dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra08196g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01486naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013900166300001800305520039300323592002800716650001400744650002300758650002300781650002300804650002300827650001100850650001400861650001200875700001900887700001400906700001500920773010700935856008501042852000901127655001201136IND60578961220221119081822.0170815e20150918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057896122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b023512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Baokun10aHighly Regio-, Diastereo-, and Enantioselective Mannich Reaction of Allylic Ketones and Cyclic Ketimines: Access to Chiral Benzosultam  ap. 4608-4611.  aAn organocatalytic asymmetric Mannich reaction of allylic ketones with cyclic N-sulfonyl α-iminoester has been developed.

Not surprisingly, Hsp90 does not accomplish these activities alone. Instead, an ever-growing number of cochaperones have been identified, leading to an explosion of reports on their molecular and cellular effects on Hsp90 chaperoning of client substrates. Notable among these clients are many members of the steroid receptor family, such as glucocorticoid, androgen, estrogen and progesterone receptors. Cochaperones typically associated with the mature, hormone-competent states of these receptors include p23, the FK506-binding protein 52 (FKBP52), FKBP51, protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) and cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40). The ultimate relevance of these cochaperones to steroid receptor action depends on their physiological effects. In recent years, the first mouse genetic models of these cochaperones have been developed. This work will review the complex and intriguing phenotypes so far obtained in genetically-altered mice and compare them to the known molecular and cellular impacts of cochaperones on steroid receptors.

In this study the impact of sampling strategy on the quantitative determination of micropollutants in effluent wastewater was investigated. An extended list of 90 chiral and achiral micropollutants representing a broad range of biological and physico-chemical properties were studied simultaneously for the first time. During composite sample collection micropollutants can degrade resulting in the under-estimation of concentration. Cooling collected sub-samples to 4°C stabilised ≥81 of 90 micropollutants to acceptable levels (±20% of the initial concentration) in the studied effluents. However, achieving stability for all micropollutants will require an integrated approach to sample collection (i.e., multi-bottle sampling with more than one stabilisation method applied). Full-scale monitoring of effluent revealed time-paced composites attained similar information to volume-paced composites (influent wastewater requires a sampling mode responsive to flow variation). The option of monitoring effluent using time-paced composite samplers is advantageous as not all WWTPs have flow controlled samplers or suitable sites for deploying portable flow meters. There has been little research to date on the impact of monitoring strategy on the determination of chiral micropollutants at the enantiomeric level. Variability in wastewater flow results in a dynamic hydraulic retention time within the WWTP (and upstream sewerage system). Despite chiral micropollutants being susceptible to stereo-selective degradation, no diurnal variability in their enantiomeric distribution was observed. However, unused medication can be directly disposed into the sewer network creating short-term (e.g., daily) changes to their enantiomeric distribution. As enantio-specific toxicity is observed in the environment, similar resolution of enantio-selective analysis to more routinely applied achiral methods is needed throughout the monitoring period for accurate risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompliance 3acooling 3adiurnal variation 3adrug therapy 3aeffluents 3aenvironmental assessment 3aflowmeters 3amonitoring 3amultiresidue analysis 3aphysicochemical properties 3aquantitative analysis 3arisk assessment 3asamplers 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aPharmaceutical 0aIllicit drug 0aPersonal care product 0aSampling 0aPolypropylene 0aStability 0aWastewater 0aChiral1 aProctor, Kathryn1 aYoudan, Jane1 aBarden, Ruth1 aKasprzyk-Hordern, Barbara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6809-28750 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Feb. 01, v. 579 p.569-578dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.11.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245015200203300001400355500002000369520145500389592002801844596006301872596006301935596007501998650002802073650002102101650002002122650001002142650003502152650001102187650001602198650001602214700001402230700001802244700002202262700005302284700002202337700002302359773011402382856007902496852000902575655001202584IND60666700320221119031529.0190919e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066670032DNAL7 a10.1111/1744-7917.127052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xu‐Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6081-711710aFlexible manipulation of Omb levels in the endogenous expression region of Drosophila wing by combinational overexpression and suppression strategy  ap. 14-21.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aManipulating an exogenous or endogenous gene of interest at a defined level is critical for a wide variety of experiments. The Gal4/UAS system has been widely used to direct gene expression for studying complex genetic and biological problems in Drosophila melanogaster and other model organisms. Driven by a given tissue‐specific Gal4, expressing UAS‐transgene or UAS‐RNAi (RNA interference) could be used to up‐ or down‐regulate target gene expression, respectively. However, the efficiency of the Gal4/UAS system is roughly predefined by properties of transposon vector constructs and the insertion site in the transgenic stock. Here, we describe a simple way to modulate optomotor blind (omb) expression levels in its endogenous expression region of the wing disc. We co‐expressed UAS‐omb and UAS‐omb‐RNAi together under the control of dpp‐Gal4 driver which is expressed in the omb expression region of the wing pouch. The repression effect is more sensitive to temperature than that of overexpression. At low temperature, overexpression plays a dominant role but the efficiency is attenuated by UAS‐omb‐RNAi. In contrast, at high temperature RNAi predominates in gene expression regulation. By this strategy, we could manipulate omb expression levels at a moderate level. It allows us to manipulate omb expression levels in the same tissue between overexpression and repression at different stages by temperature control.  aPublisher supplied data  aNSFC31402021cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNSFC31672364cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a201805D211019c2018 Special Talents Projects in Shanxi Province, China 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aRNA interference 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3amodels 3atemperature 3atransposons1 aDong, Wei1 aLi, Kai‐Xia1 aWang, Juan‐Juan1 aShen, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6021-71511 aMoussian, Bernard1 aZhang, Jian‐Zhen0 tInsect science.g2020 Feb., v. 27, no. 1 p.14-21dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3869360x1672-96097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.127053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008300168300001600251520158300267592002801850650001301878650001001891650001101901650001201912650001601924653001301940653001401953653002201967653002301989653000802012700001502020773009902035856008402134852000902218655001202227IND60606251520221120161852.0180725e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060625152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2016.02.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuhr, Bettina10aOn the effect of stress dependent interparticle friction in direct shear tests  ap. 211-220.  aContact friction is a key influence factor for the shearing behaviour of granular media. In the discrete element method (DEM) contact friction is usually modelled with Coulomb's law assuming a constant interparticle friction coefficient. From tribology it is known that friction is influenced by several factors, e.g., temperature, normal stress, surface condition, etc. None of these influences can be modelled with the constant interparticle friction coefficient from Coulomb's law. For a given granular material (particle shape distribution), the usage of constant interparticle friction in DEM models generally results in constant bulk friction coefficients in the simulation of direct shear tests. While this is frequently seen in experiments with equi-sized spherical particles, papers exist in literature which report a stress dependency of bulk friction for non-spherical particles of certain materials. In this work, a stress dependency of bulk friction is obtained by introducing a model for stress dependent interparticle friction in DEM simulations. For validation experimental results of direct shear tests conducted on single or paired glass beads are used. While the bulk friction of paired spheres clearly decreases with increasing normal stress, it is nearly constant for single spheres. DEM simulations with the stress dependent interparticle friction are in good accordance with the experimental results of both single and paired spheres. A comparison with simulations, using constant interparticle friction, clearly shows the advantage of the proposed model.  aPublisher supplied data 3afriction 3aglass 3amodels 3apowders 3atemperature 0aFriction 0aTribology 0aDirect shear test 0aGranular materials 0aDEM1 aSix, Klaus0 tPowder technology.g2016 June, v. 294 p.211-220dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.02.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245014200210300001600352506007600368520145100444592002801895506003701923650001501960650001401975650002601989650002802015650001002043650001702053650001702070650001902087650001802106650001902124650001902143650002502162650001302187651001402200700002002214700002402234700001702258700002302275700001902298700002102317773009302338856008102431852000902512655001202521IND60477649320221207075242.0160513e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047764932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-015-2399-92doi7 aPMC46983082pmcid7 a263539122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrosnan, James T.12aA new amino acid substitution (Ala-205-Phe) in acetolactate synthase (ALS) confers broad spectrum resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides  ap. 149-159.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMAIN CONCLUSION : This is a first report of an Ala-205-Phe substitution in acetolactate synthase conferring resistance to imidazolinone, sulfonylurea, triazolopyrimidines, sulfonylamino-carbonyl-triazolinones, and pyrimidinyl (thio) benzoate herbicides. Resistance to acetolactate synthase (ALS) and photosystem II inhibiting herbicides was confirmed in a population of allotetraploid annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.; POAAN-R3) selected from golf course turf in Tennessee. Genetic sequencing revealed that seven of eight POAAN-R3 plants had a point mutation in the psbA gene resulting in a known Ser-264-Gly substitution on the D1 protein. Whole plant testing confirmed that this substitution conferred resistance to simazine in POAAN-R3. Two homeologous forms of the ALS gene (ALSa and ALSb) were detected and expressed in all POAAN-R3 plants sequenced. The seven plants possessing the Ser-264-Gly mutation conferring resistance to simazine also had a homozygous Ala-205-Phe substitution on ALSb, caused by two nucleic acid substitutions in one codon. In vitro ALS activity assays with recombinant protein and whole plant testing confirmed that this Ala-205-Phe substitution conferred resistance to imidazolinone, sulfonylurea, triazolopyrimidines, sulfonylamino-carbonyl- triazolinones, and pyrimidinyl (thio) benzoate herbicides. This is the first report of Ala-205-Phe mutation conferring wide spectrum resistance to ALS inhibiting herbicides.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aD1 protein 3aPoa annua 3aacetolactate synthase 3aamino acid substitution 3agenes 3agolf courses 3ahomozygosity 3alawns and turf 3anucleic acids 3aphotosystem II 3apoint mutation 3arecombinant proteins 3asimazine 3aTennessee1 aVargas, Jose J.1 aBreeden, Gregory K.1 aGrier, Logan1 aAponte, Raphael A.1 aTresch, Stefan1 aLaforest, Martin0 tPlanta.g2016 Jan., v. 243, no. 1 p.149-159dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-015-2399-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01654naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008600168300001200254520060000266592002800866650001000894650001200904650001600916650002300932650001500955650000900970700002000979700001700999700002501016700002301041700001901064773013101083856008101214852000901295655001201304IND60638202820221119093142.0190426e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063820282DNAL7 a10.3103/S01476874190100222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogatyrev, L.

The use of granular organic fertilizer can optimize soil as a growing medium of beans. In addition, the application of harvest interval setting in combination with the use of granular organic fertilizer probably can improve production and quality bean pods. The research aimed to find out granular organic fertilizer doses and harvest interval setting that resulted in good effects on the growth, yield, and quality of beans grown on Inceptisol from Jatinangor, West Java. A field experiment was carried out at Ciparanje field, Jatinangor, West Java from February to April 2016. The experiment was arranged in a Randomized Block Design (RBD) with 12 treatments and 3 replications. The results showed that the dose of 150 kg ha-1 granular organic fertilizer and harvest interval of every two days resulted in shoot:root ratio of 12.8, increased percentage of productive branches up to 57.48%, increased percentage of grade B pods (60.17%) and lowered the percentage of grade C pods (29.21%).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInceptisols 3abeans 3afield experimentation 3aorganic fertilizers 3asoil quality 3aIndonesia 0aBean 0agranular organic fertilizer 0aharvest interval 0aInceptisol 0apod quality1 aWawan, Sutari1 aLutfiyyah, Syarief Aanisah1 aRisti, Oktavia Ade0 tJurnal tanah Tropika dan Kualitas Lingkungan.g2018 May, v. 23, no. 2 p.65-72dUniversity of LampungwJournal:27737x2086-66827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5400/jts.2018.v23i2.653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01382naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013800169300001300307520041700320592002800737650002600765650000900791650002100800651001100821700002000832700001800852773013200870856008101002852000901083655001201092IND60638202920221119094114.0190426e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063820292DNAL7 a10.3103/S01476874190100342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuyvolova, A.

Thus, the attack of a plant by one herbivore species may result in changes in the performances of other species on the same plant. It has been suggested that species with comparable feeding modes induce similar plant defences and such herbivores are therefore expected to have a negative effect on each other’s performance. We studied two closely related phytophagous mite species with identical feeding modes. Yet, one of the species (Tetranychus urticae) induces tomato plant defences, whereas the other (T. evansi) reduces them. We found that the “inducing” species benefits from the downregulation of defences by the “reducing” species, which, in turn, suffers from the induction of defences by the inducing species. Moreover, the performances of the two mite species on leaves that were previously attacked by both species simultaneously were intermediate between that on leaves previously attacked by each of the mites separately. The activity of proteinase inhibitor, a defensive compound, was not found to be intermediate in leaves attacked by both species simultaneously—it was almost as high as the activity seen in leaves with defences induced by T. urticae. Oviposition rates of T. urticae showed a nonlinear correlation with inhibitor activity, suggesting that it is potentially problematic to use this activity as an indicator of the level of plant defence. Our results show that herbivores with similar feeding modes have opposite effects on plant defence and differentially affect each other’s performance on co-infested plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTetranychus urticae 3abiochemical pathways 3aleaves 3aoviposition 3aphytophagous mites 3aplant response 3aproteinase inhibitors 3atomatoes1 aPallini, Angelo1 aJanssen, Arne0 tOecologia.g2016 Jan., v. 180, no. 1 p.1-10dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3344-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245017400157300002000331520122900351592002801580650003101608650001401639650001901653650001101672650001101683650001601694650002101710650002401731650002201755650002101777700001701798700001701815773012401832856007401956852000902030655001202039IND60640800320221118071410.0190505e20160706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064080032DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra08224f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jihua10aImproved mechanical properties and thermal degradation of low-temperature hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber composites with poly(sodium methacrylate) nanowires  ap. 64110-64120.  aOne dimensional (1D) organic nanofiller hybrid composites have captured scientists’ attention due to their importance in property reinforcement. However, the generation and good dispersion of these nanostructures is always difficult to solve in such composites. In this article, low-temperature grade hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (LTG-HNBR) composites with various sodium methacrylate (NaMAA) weights were prepared. By the induction of electrostatic interactions and in-site polymerization, 1D poly(NaMAA) nanowires were created in the matrix during their vulcanization processes. Owing to the existence of nanowires, the modulus and tensile properties of the composites were greatly reinforced, but their glassy temperatures barely changed. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the incorporation of NaMAA increased the thermal decomposition temperature of the matrix, and the advent of poly(NaMAA) nanowires helped enhance the thermal stability of the composites, reducing the diffusion speed of degradation products and thus improving the decomposition temperatures. We believe that these findings can provide some guidance to direct the applications of rubber composites with organic 1D nanowires.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ananowires 3apolymerization 3arubber 3asodium 3atemperature 3atensile strength 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aLiu, Mingjie1 aWang, Shutao0 tRSC advances.g2016 July 06, v. 6, no. 68 p.64110-64120dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra08224f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100002000162245004500182300001600227520153700243592002801780650002501808650002901833650002001862650001201882650000901894650001101903650001301914650001301927650001201940650001901952650001201971650001101983650005401994650006502048650004402113650002402157650001202181651001602193651001602209653001302225653001702238653002402255653001502279700001802294700002802312700002102340700001802361773015102379856007802530852000902608655001202617IND60083453520221121084855.0190312e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008345352DNAL7 a232004692pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2012-56412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanaszewska, A.12aA comprehensive dairy valorization model  ap. 761-779.  aDairy processors face numerous challenges resulting from both unsteady dairy markets and some specific characteristics of dairy supply chains. To maintain a competitive position on the market, companies must look beyond standard solutions currently used in practice. This paper presents a comprehensive dairy valorization model that serves as a decision support tool for mid-term allocation of raw milk to end products and production planning. The developed model was used to identify the optimal product portfolio composition. The model allocates raw milk to the most profitable dairy products while accounting for important constraints (i.e., recipes, composition variations, dairy production interdependencies, seasonality, demand, supply, capacities, and transportation flows). The inclusion of all relevant constraints and the ease of understanding dairy production dynamics make the model comprehensive. The developed model was tested at the international dairy processor FrieslandCampina (Amersfoort, the Netherlands). The structure of the model and its output were discussed in multiple sessions with and approved by relevant FrieslandCampina employees. The elements included in the model were considered necessary to optimally valorize raw milk. To illustrate the comprehensiveness and functionality of the model, we analyzed the effect of seasonality on milk valorization. A large difference in profit and a shift in the allocation of milk showed that seasonality has a considerable impact on the valorization of raw milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3adecision support systems 3ahuman resources 3amarkets 3amilk 3amodels 3aplanning 3araw milk 3arecipes 3atransportation 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDairy Productsxeconomicsxsupply & distribution. 2aDairyingxeconomicsxmethodsxorganization & administration. 2aMilkxeconomicsxsupply & distribution. 2aModels, Theoretical 2aSeasons 3aNetherlands 0aNetherlands 0araw milk 0avalorization 0aproduction planning 0aallocation1 aCruijssen, F.1 avan der Vorst, J.G.A.J.1 aClaassen, G.D.H.1 aKampman, J.L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2013 Feb., v. 96, no. 2 p.761-779dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-56413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100003900184245010300223300001600326506007600342520123700418592002801655506003701683650002101720650001301741650002601754650001701780650001801797650002501815650000901840650001201849650001401861650002501875650001201900650001701912650001101929650003101940650002201971650001201993650001202005650001102017650000902028650001802037650002602055650001102081650001002092653002202102653002002124653002202144653003602166653001702202700002602219700003402245773011102279856007902390852000902469655001202478IND60515085120221207141612.0160311e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051508512DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2012.26892doi7 aPMC37790152pmcid7 a240444932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurukar, Mallur Somasundra Abignan10aRenoprotective Effect of Coccinia indica Fruits and Leaves in Experimentally Induced Diabetic Rats  ap. 839-846.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDiabetic nephropathy is one of the secondary complications of diabetes mellitus that is marked by changes in extracellular matrix components leading to end-stage renal failure. Diet plays an important role in managing diabetes. In the present study, the effect of Coccinia indica consumption on diabetes-mediated kidney damage was determined. Both control and diabetic rats were fed with AIN-76 diet supplemented with C. indica fruits and leaves individually at 10% and 5%, respectively, for a period of 2 months. Various parameters, such as fasting blood glucose, urine sugar, albumin excretion, kidney index, and glomerular filtration rate, were ameliorated to various extents by the supplementation of C. indica in the diet. Additionally, diabetic rats fed with diet supplemented with C. indica fruits or leaves showed improvement in glucose tolerance compared to control diabetic rats. They also exhibited beneficial effects on key antioxidant enzymes of the kidney. Furthermore, an increase in laminin and fibronectin as a result of diabetes was alleviated in C. indica-fed rats. These results indicate that the consumption of C. indica is beneficial in partially containing diabetes-mediated deleterious effects on the kidney.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCoccinia grandis 3aalbumins 3aanimal disease models 3aantioxidants 3ablood glucose 3adiabetic nephropathy 3adiet 3aenzymes 3aexcretion 3aextracellular matrix 3afasting 3afibronectins 3afruits 3aglomerular filtration rate 3aglucose tolerance 3akidneys 3alaminin 3aleaves 3arats 3arenal failure 3arenoprotective effect 3asugars 3aurine 0aalbumin excretion 0aCoccinia indica 0adiabetes mellitus 0aextracellular matrix components 0akidney index1 aMahadevamma, Siddaiah1 aChilkunda, Nandini Dattatreya0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 16, no. 9 p.839-846dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2012.26893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012500172300001800297520095600315592002801271650001201299650001101311650002301322650000901345650002001354650002101374650001101395650001801406650000901424650001401433650001301447650000901460650001601469650000801485650000901493650000901502653001101511653002401522653002601546653001401572653002701586653001801613653001601631700005601647773014301703856008501846852000901931655001201940IND60632383320190501000000.0190314e20190125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063238332DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b063312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZürner, Philipp10aLeaching and Selective Extraction of Indium and Tin from Zinc Flue Dust Using an Oxalic Acid-Based Deep Eutectic Solvent  ap. 5300-5308.  aDeep eutectic solvents have previously been used as cost-effective and readily available alternatives to conventional ionic liquids. Due to their versatile complexation properties, they are potential lixiviants for selective metal processing. In this study, we investigate the leaching behavior of three choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvents to selectively separate indium and tin from an oxide flue dust material. Ethylene glycol, urea, and oxalic acid dihydrate were used as hydrogen bond donors in the eutectic mixtures. The highest leaching yields were observed in the oxalic acid system Oxaline. A two-step precipitation procedure was developed for the leachate solution to separate the target metals indium and tin from the main flue dust components, i.e., iron, zinc, lead, and copper. This ionometallurgical approach was compared to equivalent leaching experiments using aqueous oxalic acid solutions and other deep eutectic solvents.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholine 3acopper 3acost effectiveness 3adust 3aethylene glycol 3ahydrogen bonding 3aindium 3aionic liquids 3airon 3aleachates 3aleaching 3alead 3aoxalic acid 3atin 3aurea 3azinc 0aIndium 0aMetallurgical waste 0aCritical raw material 0aRecycling 0aDeep eutectic solvents 0aIonic liquids 0aOxalic acid1 aFrisch, Gero1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8997-77440 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Jan. 25, v. 7, no. 5 p.5300-5308dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b063313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245014000184300001600324520145200340592002801792650002301820650001301843650001001856650002301866650001501889650001601904650003001920650001701950650001201967650001301979650003501992650002002027650002402047650000902071700001902080700002202099700002302121773009502144856008102239852000902320655001202329IND60079984320221122210811.0140728e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6007998432DNAL7 a249168572pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-014-1196-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaba, Yuki G.10aAdjustment of web-building initiation to high humidity: a constraint by humidity-dependent thread stickiness in the spider Cyrtarachne   ap. 587-593.  aCyrtarachne is an orb-weaving spider belonging to the subfamily Cyrtarachninae (Araneidae) which includes triangular-web-building Pasilobus and bolas spiders. The Cyrtarachninae is a group of spiders specialized in catching moths, which is thought to have evolved from ordinary orb-weaving araneids. Although the web-building time of nocturnal spiders is in general related to the time of sunset, anecdotal evidence has suggested variability of web-building time in Cyrtarachne and its closely related genera. This study has examined the effects of temperature, humidity, moonlight intensity, and prey (moths) availability on web-building time of Cyrtarachne bufo, Cyrtarachne akirai, and Cyrtarachne nagasakiensis. Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) have revealed that humidity, and not prey availability, was the essential variable that explained the daily variability of web-building time. Experiments measuring thread stickiness under different humidities showed that, although the thread of Cyrtarachne was found to have strong stickiness under high humidity, low humidity caused a marked decrease of thread stickiness. By contrast, no obvious change in stickiness was seen in an ordinary orb-weaving spider, Larinia argiopiformis. These findings suggest that Cyrtarachne adjusts its web-building time to favorable conditions of high humidity maintaining strong stickiness, which enables the threads to work efficiently for capturing prey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgiope bruennichi 3ahumidity 3amoths 3astatistical models 3astickiness 3atemperature 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAdhesiveness 2aAnimals 2aHumidity 2aPredatory Behaviorxphysiology 2aSilkxchemistry 2aSpidersxphysiology 2aTime1 aKusahara, Miki1 aMaezono, Yasunori1 aMiyashita, Tadashi0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2014 July, v. 101, no. 7 p.587-593dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-014-1196-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01942naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007200171300001800243520083100261592002801092650002501120650002201145650001101167650002701178650001501205653001801220653001601238653003301254653001501287700002101302700002001323700002601343773011601369856008601485852000901571655001201580IND60611534820221120231041.0201209e20180920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061153482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.1452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmor, Mehdi Ben10aRevisiting industrial organization: Product service systems insight  ap. 1459-1477.  aThis literature review puts forward a comparison between the traditional seller, usually represented by classic Industrial Organization (IO) models, and system providers, which are illustrated by Product Service System (PSS) models.

R.10aEffects of a Chinese medical herbs complex on cellular immunity and toxicity-related conditions of breast cancer patients  ap. 712-718.  aRose geranium (Pelargonium graveolens, Geraniaceae) has anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties, and promotes wound healing. Similarly, Ganoderma tsugae (Ganodermataceae), Codonopsis pilosula (Campanulaceae) and Angelica sinensis (Apiaceae) are traditional Chinese herbs associated with immunomodulatory functions. In the present study, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to examine whether the Chinese medicinal herb complex, RG-CMH, which represents a mixture of rose geranium and extracts of G. tsugae, C. pilosula and A. sinensis, can improve the immune cell count of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to prevent leucopenia and immune impairment that usually occurs during cancer therapy. A total of fifty-eight breast cancer patients who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy were enrolled. Immune cell levels in patient serum were determined before, and following, 6 weeks of cancer treatment for patients receiving either an RG-CMH or a placebo. Administration of RG-CMH was associated with a significant reduction in levels of leucocytes from 31·5 % for the placebo group to 13·4 % for the RG-CMH group. Similarly, levels of neutrophils significantly decreased from 35·6 % for the placebo group to 11·0 % for the RG-CMH group. RG-CMH intervention was also associated with a decrease in levels of T cells, helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells compared with the placebo group. However, these differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. In conclusion, administration of RG-CMH to patients receiving chemotherapy/radiotherapy may have the capacity to delay, or ease, the reduction in levels of leucocytes and neutrophils that are experienced by patients during cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngelica sinensis 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCodonopsis pilosula 3aGanoderma tsugae 3aPelargonium graveolens 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablood serum 3abreast neoplasms 3acell-mediated immunity 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3aherbs 3aimmunomodulation 3amedicinal plants 3anatural killer cells 3aneutrophils 3apatients 3aplacebos 3aradiotherapy 3atissue repair 0aBreast cancer 0aChemotherapy 0aRadiotherapy 0aChinese medical herbs 0aImmune cell counts1 aChiu, H.

A coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD)/electrochemical model is used for the analysis. The results show that gravity significantly affects the hydrodynamics in the microchannel and consequently reduces the cell performance dramatically with certain orientations. This important phenomenon has been widely ignored in previous works. Parametric analysis offers useful insights for enhancing the MMFC designs that minimize the adverse effects towards a feature of orientation-independence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3afuel cells 3agravity 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels1 aLeung, Michael K.H.1 aLeung, Dennis Y.C.1 aWang, Huizhi0 tApplied energy.g2012 Feb., v. 90, no. 1 p.80-86dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.04.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002500113040001800138100001800156245009200174300001800266520132900284592002801613650001901641650002301660650002601683650001201709650001001721650001701731650001601748650001901764650001201783651001101795651001801806700002101824700002001845700002101865700002001886700002001906700002101926700002101947700002301968773010801991856007102099852000902170655001202179IND60082270420221118035702.0141017e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008227042DNAL7 a247066042pmid7 a10.1002/ps.37932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLegg, James P10aBiology and management of Bemisia whitefly vectors of cassava virus pandemics in Africa  ap. 1446-1453.  aCassava mosaic disease and cassava brown streak disease are caused by viruses transmitted by Bemisia tabaci and affect approximately half of all cassava plants in Africa, resulting in annual production losses of more than $US 1 billion. A historical and current bias towards virus rather than vector control means that these diseases continue to spread, and high Bemisia populations threaten future virus spread even if the extant strains and species are controlled. Progress has been made in parts of Africa in replicating some of the successes of integrated Bemisia control programmes in the south‐western United States. However, these management efforts, which utilise chemical insecticides that conserve the Bemisia natural enemy fauna, are only suitable for commercial agriculture, which presently excludes most cassava cultivation in Africa. Initiatives to strengthen the control of B. tabaci on cassava in Africa need to be aware of this limitation, and to focus primarily on control methods that are cheap, effective, sustainable and readily disseminated, such as host‐plant resistance and biological control. A framework based on the application of force multipliers is proposed as a means of prioritising elements of future Bemisia control strategies for cassava in Africa. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aBemisia tabaci 3abiological control 3abiological resistance 3acassava 3afauna 3ainsecticides 3amultipliers 3avector control 3aviruses 3aAfrica 3aUnited States1 aShirima, Rudolph1 aTajebe, Lensa S1 aGuastella, Devid1 aBoniface, Simon1 aJeremiah, Simon1 aNsami, Elibariki1 aChikoti, Patrick1 aRapisarda, Carmelo0 tPest management science.g2014 Oct., v. 70, no. 10 p.1446-1453dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.37933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008900166300001600255520095100271592002801222650001901250650005001269650001601319650001901335650001401354650001701368650001101385650001601396650001101412650002101423651001001444651001801454653003701472653000901509653001901518653001401537653000901551700001301560773011901573856008401692852000901776655001201785IND60122301320221119071421.0150325e20140207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012230132DNAL7 a10.1080/02772248.2014.9342462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrajian, H.10aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Syrian olive oils and their likely daily intakes  ap. 342-352.  aThe levels of 16 US Environmental Protection Agency polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (16 EPA PAHs) in Syrian olive oils have been determined.

Moreover, three samples exceeded the European Union (EU) maximum level of 2 μg kg ⁻¹ for benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in oils and fats, and only one sample exceeded the EU maximum level of 10 μg kg ⁻¹ for the sum of benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, BaP, and benzo[b]fluoranthene (PAH4). The likely daily intakes of the total sum of 16 EPA PAHs, the sum of eight genotoxic PAHs, the sum of PAH4, the BaP, and the BaP equivalent through consumption of Syrian olive oils were estimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aanthracenes 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3achemistry 3agenotoxicity 3alipids 3anaphthalene 3aolives 3avirgin olive oil 3aSyria 3aUnited States 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aPAHs 0abenzo[a]pyrene 0aolive oil 0aHPLC1 aOdeh, A.0 tToxicological and environmental chemistry.g2014 Feb. 7, v. 96, no. 2 p.342-352dTaylor & Francisx1029-04867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02772248.2014.9342463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011600164300002000280520128400300592002801584650001501612650001401627650001201641650001601653650002601669650001301695650002601708650001201734650002301746650001301769650001601782650001701798700005801815700001901873700006001892700002301952700001901975700001901994700001702013700006102030700002902091700006902120700001902189773013802208856008002346852000902426655001202435IND60609516320180918000000.0180823e20180725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060951632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b045492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrause, Simon10aAdsorption Contraction Mechanics: Understanding Breathing Energetics in Isoreticular Metal–Organic Frameworks  ap. 19171-19179.  aA highly porous metal–organic framework DUT-48, isoreticular to DUT-49, is reported with a high surface area of 4560 m²·g–¹ and methane storage capacity up to 0.27 g·g–¹ (164 cm³·cm–³) at 6.5 MPa and 298 K. The flexibility of DUT-48 and DUT-49 under external and internal (adsorption-induced) pressure is analyzed and rationalized using a combination of advanced experimental and computational techniques. While both networks undergo a contraction by mechanical pressure, only DUT-49 shows adsorption-induced structural transitions and negative gas adsorption of n-butane and nitrogen. This adsorption behavior was analyzed by microcalorimetry measurements and molecular simulations to provide an explanation for the lack of adsorption-induced breathing in DUT-48. It was revealed that for DUT-48, a significantly lower adsorption enthalpy difference and a higher framework stiffness prevent adsorption-induced structural transitions and negative gas adsorption. The mechanical behavior of both DUT-48 and DUT-49 was further analyzed by mercury porosimetry experiments and molecular simulations. Both materials exhibit large volume changes under hydrostatic compression, demonstrating noteworthy potential as shock absorbers with unprecedented high work energies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abreathing 3abutanes 3acalorimetry 3acoordination polymers 3aenthalpy 3amechanical properties 3amethane 3amolecular dynamics 3anitrogen 3aporosimetry 3asurface area1 aEvans, Jack D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9521-26011 aBon, Volodymyr1 aSenkovska, Irena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7052-10291 aEhrling, Sebastian1 aStoeck, Ulrich1 aYot, Pascal G.1 aIacomi, Paul1 aLlewellyn, Philip1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5124-70521 aMaurin, G.q(Guillaume),1 aCoudert, François-Xavier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5318-39101 aKaskel, Stefan0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 July 25, v. 122, no. 33 p.19171-19179dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b045493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245013900167300001600306520122700322592002801549650001701577650001101594650001501605650001801620650000901638650002001647650001801667650001401685650001201699650001301711650001701724650001501741650001501756650001801771650002201789650001601811650001501827650001801842650001601860650001501876653002001891653001801911653001501929653001801944653001701962700001701979700002101996700001902017700002302036700002002059773016502079856008402244852000902328655001202337IND60686910520221117004625.0200621e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068691052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2020.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJangra, Sumit13aAn observation on the embryonic development in Thrips palmi (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) eggs obtained by an artificial oviposition setup  ap. 492-497.  aThrips palmi is an important insect pest of vegetables and ornamental crops worldwide. Besides direct damage caused by feeding, it transmits several tospoviruses in a persistent-propagative manner. Eggs of T. palmi are microscopic and embedded within plant tissue by the sharp ovipositor of adult female. In the present study, an artificial oviposition setup has been standardized for T. palmi. Eggs of T. palmi were harvested in sterile water between two thin membranes. The developmental stages of T. palmi embryo were studied starting from oviposition up to hatching by inverted and confocal reflection microscopy. Energids were homogeneously distributed at an early stage of development. The anterior end of the egg curved with a constriction post 38 h. Initiation of tissue organization, mouthparts, appendages, compound eyes were observed at different time points. Appendages were well developed and segmentation was prominent post 70 h. The embryo was completely developed at around 80 h and hatched by 86 h post oviposition at 28 °C temperature. The study first time reports the embryonic development of T. palmi that would be helpful in detailed investigations of thrips developmental biology and evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThrips palmi 3aadults 3aappendages 3acompound eyes 3aeggs 3aembryo (animal) 3aembryogenesis 3aevolution 3afemales 3ahatching 3ainsect pests 3amicroscopy 3amouthparts 3aorganogenesis 3aornamental plants 3aoviposition 3aovipositor 3aplant tissues 3atemperature 3avegetables 0aEgg development 0aEmbryogenesis 0aEgg-laying 0aOrganogenesis 0aMelon thrips1 aDhall, Heena1 aAggarwal, Shilpi1 aMandal, Bikash1 aJain, Rakesh Kumar1 aGhosh, Amalendu0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2020 June, v. 23, no. 2 p.492-497dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied EntomologywJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2020.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01780naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245013400203300001600337500002000353520049100373592002800864650002200892650002300914650001500937650001100952650002500963650002400988650001301012650001401025650002301039700002101062700002001083700002001103700002701123700002701150773012201177856007401299852000901373655001201382IND60787018420221120230350.0220807e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078701842DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.138072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristoffersen, Mads1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6335-745910aBenthic habitat selection in juvenile European eel Anguilla anguilla: implications for coastal habitat management and restoration  ap. 996-999.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe critically endangered European eel Anguilla anguilla is dependent on suitable habitat qualities over a vast geographic area.

Recent work has highlighted that at sublethal concentrations, Cd can impair the ability of fish to respond to important sensory cues. In the present study, we examined whether chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of waterborne Cd (1, 2.5 and 5 μg/L) can result in reproductive impairment in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) as measured by the standard Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 21-day reproductive assay. In addition, we also evaluated the effects of chronic waterborne Cd exposure on Cd accumulation in target tissues (liver and ovary) and plasma estradiol level in females and on the reproductive behaviour of fathead minnows. We found that the standard endpoints used in the OECD reproductive assays (e.g., egg production, number of spawning attempts, brood size) are more sensitive to Cd exposure than behavioural endpoints; however, the traditional method of interpreting reproductive impairment may underestimate toxic effects. Cadmium accumulation in liver and ovary of fish increased with increasing Cd exposure concentrations; however, plasma estradiol level remained unaffected. Reproductive capacity in fathead minnows decreased at waterborne Cd concentrations as low as 1 μg/L. The findings of our study have important implications for understanding the effects of chronic Cd exposure in metal-impacted feral fish populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3afemales 3aliver 3aeconomics 3areproductive performance 3along term effects 3areproductive behavior 3acadmium 3aminnows 3aspawning 3aegg production 3atoxicity 3aPimephales promelas 3aestradiol 3aanimal ovaries 3aaquatic ecosystems 3achronic exposure 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxtoxicity 2aCyprinidae 2aFemale 2aReproductionxdrug effects 2aToxicity Tests, Chronic 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 0aenvironmental exposure1 aFerrari, Maud C.

Previously, we reported that skimmed and concentrated bovine late colostrum (SCBLC) obtained from normal unimmunized cows at 6 to 7d after parturition effectively prevented against human rotavirus (HRV)-induced severe gastroenteritis in vivo, when administered as a single dose 60min before viral inoculation. In the present study, we examined the efficacy of multiple administrations of SCBLC at smaller dosages after viral inoculation in vivo. We demonstrate that multiple administrations within 24h after virus inoculation resulted in earlier recovery from diarrheal symptoms, in an administration frequency-dependent manner. Furthermore, we investigated whether isolated IgG anti-HRV activity in SCBLC was equivalent to that of IgG isolated from bovine mature milk as measured by in vitro activity assays. We found that IgG-containing fractions from SCBLC and mature milk exhibited approximately the same level of anti-HRV activity. We concluded that the SCBLC contains a high level of IgG against HRV-induced severe gastroenteritis, which will be possible to use in protective effects in immunocompromised hosts, such as children and the elderly. Multiple doses of SCBLC during the early stages of infection or lower dosage of SCBLC given as a single dose both resulted in relief of diarrheal symptoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus 3aanimal models 3achildren 3acow colostrum 3acows 3adiarrhea 3aelderly 3agastroenteritis 3agastrointestinal system 3ahumans 3aimmunocompromised population 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amilk 3aparturition 3aprotective effect 3atherapeutics 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Sucklingximmunology 2aCattle 2aColostrumximmunology 2aDiarrheaximmunologyxprevention & controlxvirology. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aGastroenteritisximmunologyxprevention & controlxvirology. 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Gximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aRadioimmunoprecipitation Assay 2aRotavirusximmunology 2aRotavirus Infectionsximmunologyxtherapy. 0abovine late colostrum 0ahuman rotavirus 0amultiple administrations 0aimmunoglobulin G1 aYamamoto, M.1 aCairangzhuoma, 1 aXijier, 1 aYabe, T.1 aUchida, K.1 aKawasaki, M.1 aNakagomi, T.1 aNakagomi, O.1 aMinamoto, N.1 aKanamaru, Y.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2013 Feb., v. 96, no. 2 p.806-814dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-58473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010300169300001600272520143600288592002801724650001901752650001601771650001501787650001901802650001201821650001601833650002201849650001501871653001601886653001501902653001501917653001101932653001601943653001301959653001901972653003401991700002302025700005902048700002002107773010402127856008502231852000902316655001202325IND60546300020221122045840.0160903e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054630002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.09.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpiller, Marc10aFlexible design in water and wastewater engineering – Definitions, literature and decision guide  ap. 271-281.  aUrban water and wastewater systems face uncertain developments including technological progress, climate change and urban development. To ensure the sustainability of these systems under dynamic conditions it has been proposed that technologies and infrastructure should be flexible, adaptive and robust. However, in literature it is often unclear what these technologies and infrastructure are. Furthermore, the terms flexible, adaptive and robust are often used interchangeably, despite important differences. In this paper we will i) define the terminology, ii) provide an overview of the status of flexible infrastructure design alternatives for water and wastewater networks and treatment, and iii) develop guidelines for the selection of flexible design alternatives. Results indicate that, with the exception of Net Present Valuation methods, there is little research available on the design and evaluation of technologies that can enable flexibility. Flexible design alternatives reviewed include robust design, phased design, modular design, modular/component platform design and design for remanufacturing. As developments in the water sector are driven by slow variables (climate change, urban development), rather than market forces, it is suggested that phased design or component platform designs are suitable for responding to change, while robust design is an option when operations face highly dynamic variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aengineering 3aguidelines 3ainfrastructure 3amarkets 3aterminology 3aurban development 3awastewater 0aFlexibility 0aRobustness 0aAdaptivity 0aDesign 0aUncertainty 0aPlanning 0aSustainability 0aWaste water treatment/network1 aVreeburg, Jan H.G.1 aLeusbrock, Ingo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8378-93711 aZeeman, Grietje0 tJournal of environmental management.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 149 p.271-281dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.09.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03922naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245013700206300002000343520241100363592002802774650001602802650001102818650002102829650001402850650001302864650001802877650001202895650002202907650001102929650001102940650001702951650001102968700002902979700005503008700002203063700006103085700005503146700006003201773013803261856008003399852000903479655001203488IND60609516520180918000000.0180823e20180727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060951652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b046602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchner, Florian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0335-072210aExperimental and Computational Study on the Interaction of an Ionic Liquid Monolayer with Lithium on Pristine and Lithiated Graphite  ap. 18968-18981.  aWe report results of a combined experimental and computational model study on the interaction of the battery-relevant ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([BMP]⁺[TFSI]⁻) with Li on pristine highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), which aims at a molecular-/atomic-level understanding of the processes at the electrode|electrolyte interface of Li-ion batteries. Employing mainly X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy as well as dispersion-corrected density functional calculations (DFT-D), we find intact anion–cation pairs for adsorbed [BMP]⁺[TFSI]⁻ (sub)monolayers on HOPG at 300 K and also on lithiated HOPG at 80 K, that is, under conditions where the mobility of Li⁺ in the bulk is low. Vapor deposition of [BMP]⁺[TFSI]⁻ on lithiated HOPG at 300 K results in rapid accumulation of Liᵟ⁺ at the surface or in the surface region, indicating that deintercalation is activated under these conditions. This is explained by a dynamic equilibrium between bulk Li⁺ and surface Liᵟ⁺, which is established independent of whether Li is deposited as metallic Li⁰ from the vacuum side or segregates as Li⁺ from the bulk of lithiated HOPG to the surface and which is shifted to the side of surface Liᵟ⁺ by stabilization of these species. Stabilization occurs either by formation of stable Li-containing surface compounds by reactive decomposition mainly of the [TFSI]⁻ anions (Li₃N, Li₂S, LiF, etc.) or by interaction of partially charged Liᵟ⁺ species with [TFSI]⁻ anions in the adlayer. DFT-D calculations reveal that a possible initial step in the reactive decomposition is the transfer of electrons from the HOPG surface covered with Liᵟ⁺ into the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of [TFSI]⁻, resulting in elongation and cleavage of the S–N bond and finally insertion of Li into it. Alternatively, stabilization of Liᵟ⁺ is possible by formation of a polar bond with the oxygen atoms of [TFSI]⁻ within the IL adlayer. The resulting calculated work function decrease ΔΦ with respect to that of the bare graphite (0001) surface is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. The interaction of [BMP]⁺[TFSI]⁻ and Li at the HOPG interface is considered as the initial stage of the solid|electrolyte interphase formation at the electrode|electrolyte interface in Li-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aanions 3achemical bonding 3aelectrons 3agraphene 3aionic liquids 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aspectroscopy 3avapors1 aForster-Tonigold, Katrin1 aKim, Jihyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1262-65991 aAdler, Christiane1 aBansmann, Joachim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3205-74501 aGroß, Axel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4037-73311 aBehm, R.

A high-fibre diet has been correlated with lower BMI and a lower incidence of hyperlipidaemia, CVD, hypertension and diabetes. The present randomised, parallel-design study compared the effects of fibre intake from a healthy diet v. fibre supplement diets on blood pressure (BP) and vascular function over 12 weeks. Overweight and obese adults were randomised to one of three groups: control (with placebo), fibre supplement (FIB) or healthy eating group with placebo (HLT). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was lower in the FIB group compared with the control group at week 6, but not at week 12. However, SBP was lower in the HLT group compared with control group at week 12. At week 6, the FIB group presented lower diastolic blood pressure and augmentation index compared with the control group, but this result did not persist to the end of the study. The present study did not show any improvements in BP or vascular function in overweight and obese individuals with psyllium fibre supplementation over 12 weeks of intervention. However, a healthy diet provided the greatest improvements in BP in overweight and obese subjects. Further research with hypertensive individuals is necessary to elucidate whether increased fibre consumption in the form of psyllium supplementation may provide a safe and acceptable means to reduce BP, vascular function and the risk of developing CVD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlantago 3aadults 3abody mass index 3adiabetes 3adiastolic blood pressure 3ahealthy diet 3ahigh fiber diet 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypertension 3ametabolic syndrome 3aoverweight 3apathogenesis 3aplacebos 3arisk 3asystolic blood pressure 0aFibre 0aVascular function 0aBlood pressure 0aObesity 0aCVD 0aPsyllium 0aMetabolic syndrome1 aKhossousi, Alireza1 aBinns, C.q(Colin),1 aDhaliwal, Satvinder1 aRadavelli-Bagatini, Simone0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2012 Mar. 14, v. 107, no. 5 p.725-734dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145110034973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011900169300001600288520129800304592002801602650000901630650001501639650002001654650001001674650002701684650002001711650002201731700002301753700001801776773009101794856008301885852000901968655001201977IND60777307320221121222743.0220516s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077730732DNAL7 a10.1163/1568538077802025302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPellet, Jérôme10aEstimating population size in the European tree frog (Hyla arborea) using individual recognition and chorus counts  ap. 287-294.  aChorus counts are widely used to assess population abundance in breeding anurans. It is however unclear how such counts translate into true population sizes. We monitored chorus activity in two populations of the European tree frog (Hyla arborea) over three years, while simultaneously conducting a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) study on breeding males. Three to four capture sessions were made each year, spread across the acme of the breeding season. Individual recognition was ensured by photographs of the linea marginalis. We used Pollock's robust design to test several biological hypotheses and estimate demographic parameters. Male survival was estimated as mean ±SE = 0.297 ± 0.154. Population trends deduced from chorus counts (maximum or mean) and modelled male population sizes were not concordant. We showed that there is no simple relationship between maximum or mean chorus size and modelled male population sizes estimated from CMR study and that population trends inferred from chorus counts are likely to be biased to an unknown extent. Even though CMR methods need significant time and personnel investments in order to produce reliable results, we advocate their use in the study of pond breeding amphibians' demography, as it provides unbiased and more precise estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHyla 3ademography 3ahuman resources 3amales 3amark-recapture studies 3apopulation size 3aspecies abundance1 aHelfer, Véronique1 aYannic, Glenn0 tAmphibia-reptilia.g2007, v. 28, no. 2 p.287-294dBrillwJournal:6284x0173-53737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568538077802025303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01732naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002200135245010000157300001800257500002000275520062200295592002800917650001400945650002200959650001200981650003900993650001701032650002401049650002301073650002001096700001901116700002101135773014501156852000901301856007201310655001201382IND9105277020221120120953.0200105e199111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910527702DNAL7 a10.2307/12424332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Douglas L.10aCost Effectiveness and Equity Aspects of Soil Conservation Programs in a Highly Erodible Region  ap. 1053-1062.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Conservation Reserve (CRP) and Conservation Compliance Programs could divide the soil conservation burden between farmers and taxpayers. In a highly erodible southeastern Washington region, however, a uniform region‐wide CRP bid cap and relaxed compliance requirements resulted in little or no projected burden for farmers in arid, less productive subregions. In contrast, farmers in a more productive subregion were projected to bear 50% or more of the costs of soil conservation. The projected government cost per ton of soil conserved also increased threefold from the most to the least productive subregion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFarm Bill 3asoil conservation 3afarmers 3agovernmental programs and projects 3asoil erosion 3aprofits and margins 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic impact1 aKanjo, Paul L.1 aWalker, David J.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1991 Nov., v. 73, no. 4 p.1053-1062dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12424333Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03183naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245016700202300001300369520152700382592002801909650002801937650002101965650002601986650001502012650001302027650001602040650002102056650002002077650001302097650001002110650001502120650000902135650002302144650002102167650001302188650001602201650001402217651001802231653002302249653002802272653001302300653001002313653001702323700001302340700002602353700002002379700001902399700001302418773010402431856008502535852000902620655001202629IND60629177620221116165016.0190403e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062917762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLepp, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3740-470610aImmunization with subunits of a novel pilus produced by virulent Clostridium perfringens strains confers partial protection against necrotic enteritis in chickens  ap. 7-13.  aNecrotic enteritis (NE) is an economically important disease of broiler chickens that is caused primarily by Clostridium perfringens strains that produce the NetB toxin. It is controlled in North America principally through the application of in-feed antimicrobials, but alternative control methods, such as vaccination, are urgently needed. We previously identified a cluster of C. perfringens genes prevalent in disease-causing strains, denominated VR-10B, that is predicted to encode a pilus. The current study evaluated the ability of three predicted pilin structural subunits (CnaA, FimA, FimB) to protect against NE in two immunization studies. In the first study, young broiler chickens were immunized twice intramuscularly (i.m.) with CnaA or FimA, which resulted in only a weak serum antibody response, and no reduction in the severity of intestinal lesions following experimental challenge with C. perfringens strain CP1. In the second study, chickens were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with CnaA, FimB, or a combination of all three proteins, on days 7, 14 and 19, which resulted in a marked antibody response specific to each antigen. Chickens immunized with either CnaA or FimB had significantly reduced NE lesion severity, whereas immunization with all three proteins in combination did not provide protection. Western blot experiments using serum from immunized birds were also performed, providing the first experimental evidence to suggest that this locus may in fact encode a functional pilus structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium perfringens 3aWestern blotting 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3abroiler chickens 3acontrol methods 3afimbriae 3agenes 3aintestines 3aloci 3anecrotic enteritis 3apoultry diseases 3aproteins 3avaccination 3avirulence 3aNorth America 0aNecrotic enteritis 0aClostridium perfringens 0aChickens 0aPilus 0aImmunization1 aOjha, S.1 aMehdizadeh Gohari, I.1 aChakravarty, B.1 aPrescott, J.F.1 aGong, J.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2019 Mar., v. 230 p.7-13dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001900169245008100188300001800269520109500287592002801382650002001410650002901430650002001459650001501479650001001494650001501504650002001519650002701539650001401566650001301580650002101593650001901614650004101633650001701674650001401691650002901705650003401734650004401768650004601812650002401858650006401882650005901946700001802005700001802023773009902041856008402140852000902224655001202233IND60086639320221119130508.0141102e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008663932DNAL7 a216019682pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2011.04.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, Michael10aFate and effects of anthropogenic chemicals in mangrove ecosystems: A review  ap. 2328-2346.  aThe scientific literature for fate and effects of non-nutrient contaminant concentrations is skewed for reports describing sediment contamination and bioaccumulation for trace metals. Concentrations for at least 22 trace metals have been reported in mangrove sediments. Some concentrations exceed sediment quality guidelines suggesting adverse effects. Bioaccumulation results are available for at least 11 trace metals, 12 mangrove tissues, 33 mangrove species and 53 species of mangrove-habitat biota. Results are specific to species, tissues, life stage, and season and accumulated concentrations and bioconcentration factors are usually low. Toxicity tests have been conducted with 12 mangrove species and 8 species of mangrove-related fauna. As many as 39 effect parameters, most sublethal, have been monitored during the usual 3 to 6 month test durations. Generalizations and extrapolations for toxicity between species and chemicals are restricted by data scarcity and lack of experimental consistency. This hinders chemical risk assessments and validation of effects-based criteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanthropogenic activities 3abioaccumulation 3aecosystems 3afauna 3aguidelines 3arisk assessment 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3atrace elements 2aAvicenniaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aBiodiversity 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aMetalsxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aRhizophoraceaexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSeawaterxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data1 aPryor, Rachel1 aWilking, Lynn0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2011 Oct., v. 159, no. 10 p.2328-2346dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2011.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245017500169300001600344520189800360592002802258650001302286650001402299650001302313650001302326650001902339650002102358650001602379650001902395653001302414653001202427653001402439653002302453653002302476700001602499700001902515700002502534700002002559773010802579856008502687852000902772655001202781IND60636691020221122005826.0190509e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063669102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2019.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRemón, Javier10aTowards a sustainable bio-fuels production from lignocellulosic bio-oils: Influence of operating conditions on the hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol over a Mo2C/CNF catalyst  ap. 111-120.  aThis work firstly provides a thorough insight into the effects of the operating conditions (catalyst loading, initial H2 pressure temperature, reaction time, H2/guaiacol ratio and liquid reaction volume) on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of guaiacol over a Mo2C/CNF catalyst. Under the operating condition tested, gas and solid formation was negligible and guaiacol was primary converted to different liquid products, including non-deoxygenated (0-oxy), mono-deoxygenated (1-oxy) and fully deoxygenated (2-oxy) compounds, together with high molecular weight soluble oligomers. An increase in the catalyst loading increased the guaiacol conversion and HDO efficiency, augmenting the proportions of HDO products. Among these species, the progressive transformation of 1-oxy compounds into 2-oxy species was kinetically and thermodynamically controlled by the catalyst loading and the amount of H2 dissolved in the liquid medium, respectively. Augmenting the H2 pressure increased the H2 availability in the liquid, which led to increases over time in the guaiacol conversion and HDO efficiency, thus promoting the production of HDO products and facilitating the transformation of guaiacol into fully de-oxygenated products. This increase depended on the reaction volume, with more pronounced variations occurring for a small than for a large volume due to the greater variations occurring in the H2/guaiacol ratio for the former than the latter. The temperature exerted a kinetic promoting effect together with a thermodynamic inhibitory influence, as some of the reactions involved were not thermodynamically favoured at high temperature. Therefore, the detailed analysis included in this work brings novel information on guaiacol HDO, which can help to establish the basis for catalysts development and reactors design to achieve a sustainable bio-fuels production from lignocellulosic bio-oils.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3acatalysts 3aguaiacol 3ahydrogen 3alignocellulose 3amolecular weight 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aGuaiacol 0aBio-oil 0aBio-fuels 0aHydrodeoxygenation 0aMo2C/CNF catalysts1 aOchoa, Elba1 aFoguet, Carlos1 aPinilla, José Luis,1 aSuelves, Isabel0 tFuel processing technology.g2019 Aug., v. 191 p.111-120dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2019.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245005300189300001800242520098000260592002801240650001301268650001401281650001101295650001501306650001401321650002601335650001901361650006701380650001501447650002301462650004301485650005901528700002101587700002001608773009901628856008401727852000901811655001201820IND60086639420221119130308.0141102e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008663942DNAL7 a217822982pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2011.06.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRainbow, P.

Regulatory options to reduce such nonpoint pollution imply costs to producers. By integrating plant simulation, hydrologic, and economic models of farm‐level processes, this study evaluates on‐farna costs of strategies to reduce nitrate groundwater pollution. The empirical focus is on intensively managed, irrigated farms in the Columbia Basin of Oregon. Results suggest that changes in timing and application rates of nitrogen and water reduce nitrate pollution with little loss in profits. Once such practices are adopted, further reductions in nitrates can be achieved only at increasing costs to producers.  aPublisher supplied data 3agroundwater contamination 3anitrates 3aeconomic impact 3afarm management 3acrop yield 3asimulation models 3afarm income 3acosts and returns 3afarm inputs 3ataxes 3adynamic models 3abioeconomic models 3aOregon1 aAdams, Richard M.1 aPerry, Gregory M.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1991 Nov., v. 73, no. 4 p.1063-1073dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12424343Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03191naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014700168500002200315520154400337592002801881650002001909650000801929650002301937650001101960650002301971650003901994650001002033650001602043650001802059650001302077650001502090650001402105650001702119650001502136650004302151650001002194650000902204650001802213650002402231650001302255653005102268653004502319653002302364653002202387700001802409700002002427700001602447773009202463856008502555852000902640655001202649IND60628563620221120055352.0190408e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062856362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilner, Holli10aQuantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) detection of soilborne pathogen Sclerotium rolfsii  aPre-press version  aEarly detection of soilborne disease is essential for prediction of disease development and successful disease management. Traditional methods of monitoring soilborne diseases based on plant growth and symptoms did not take into account the presence and inoculum potential of pathogens in the soil, which generally delay the prevention of diseases. To detect and quantify soil populations of Sclerotium rolfsii, the causal agent of southern blight of tomatoes, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) was used to measure the amount of soil general fungal and specific S. rolfsii DNA. Significantly higher amounts of total fungal and S. rolfsii DNA were detected in inoculated than in uninoculated soil in a greenhouse inoculation experiment. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was successfully developed to detect the abundance of S. rolfsii through whole cell hybridization and was further applied for visual detection of the abundance of S. rolfsii in the soil samples of greenhouse inoculation experiment. Natural abundance of S. rolfsii in soil with a DNA amount of 0.06 pg µl−1 DNA extraction, which was equivalent to 8 pg g−1 soil, was successfully detected. The hybridization signal detected in soil for S. rolfsii had a great correlation with the amount of infested DNA levels of S. rolfsii. Molecular detection and quantification of soilborne pathogens in plant roots and in the soil could provide valuable information to predict disease development and apply management practices for soilborne diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAthelia rolfsii 3aDNA 3aSclerotium (genus) 3ablight 3adisease prevention 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3ahybridization 3ainoculum 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3aplant growth 3aprediction 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3asoil-borne diseases 3atomatoes 0aQuantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) 0aFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) 0aSclerotium rolfsii 0aSoilborne disease1 aJi, Pingsheng1 aSabula, Michael1 aWu, Tiehang0 tApplied soil ecology.g2019 Jan. 01, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005400146245011100200300001800311520104600329592002801375650001501403650001001418650001101428650001401439650001701453650001901470650001001489650001801499700001601517700001401533700001801547773017001565856008001735852000901815655001201824IND60601996520221119051900.0180709e20180221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060199652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b002712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Zheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3844-395310aGas Flow Behavior through Inorganic Nanopores in Shale Considering Confinement Effect and Moisture Content  ap. 3430-3440.  aPrevious attempts to characterize the gas transport through inorganic nanopores were not fully successful. The presence of an adsorption water film within nanopores is generally overlooked. Moreover, the compound influences of moisture content and confinement effect on critical properties of the gas phase have not been considered before. With the intent of overcoming these deficiencies, a fully coupled analytical model has been developed, in which complex bulk-gas transport mechanisms, moisture content, confinement effect, and various cross-section shapes of nanopores are incorporated. Results show that the confinement effect will significantly enhance the apparent gas permeability when the pore radius is smaller than 5 nm, and the real-gas effect can achieve an average increase of 4.38% when the pore radius falls in the range 1–2 nm. The stress dependence will greatly decrease the apparent gas permeability and the corresponding degree for slitlike inorganic nanopores will slightly increase with the increasing aspect ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3agases 3amodels 3ananopores 3apermeability 3aprocess design 3ashale 3awater content1 aShi, Juntai1 aWu, Keliu1 aLi, Xiangfang0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Feb. 21, v. 57, no. 9 p.3430-3440dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b002713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011000165300001600275520177600291592002802067650001302095650001202108650001502120650001102135650002902146650001202175650001502187650002102202650001302223650001102236650001502247650001502262650001602277650001902293650001102312650001102323650001802334650001202352650001502364651001802379653004202397653002902439653001102468653001202479653001902491653001102510653002402521700002102545700001502566700001402581700001702595773011002612856008202722852000902804655001202813IND60592564320221119013108.0200503e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059256432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2018.02.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriffin, C.G.10aQuantifying CDOM and DOC in major Arctic rivers during ice-free conditions using Landsat TM and ETM+ data  ap. 395-409.  aAs high-latitudes warm, permafrost thaws, and the hydrological cycle accelerates, ground-based monitoring of riverine organic matter may be supplemented by satellite remote sensing during ice-free conditions. Recent programs, namely the Arctic Great Rivers Observatory, have established methodologically consistent sampling across the hydrograph, and shared the resulting data publicly. However, these efforts are limited by frequency, funding, and length of record. Satellite remote sensing can be used to estimate chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) as a riverine constituent that influences optical properties in surface waters. In this study, daily CDOM absorption was first estimated using discharge-constituent regression-based models for 2000–2013. We then regressed these discharge-based CDOM estimates against Landsat TM and ETM+ surface reflectance data from Google Earth Engine for the six largest rivers draining the pan-Arctic watershed (the Kolyma, Lena, Mackenzie, Ob', Yenisey, and Yukon rivers). These CDOM results were converted to dissolved organic carbon (DOC), using the strong relationship (R² = 0.88) between direct measurements of the two constituents. Using river-specific remote sensing models, R² could be as high as 0.84. Grouping all rivers into a single “universal” regression reduced R² and increased root mean square errors, such as in the Yenisey River where R² dropped by 0.63, and RMSE rose by 1.1 m⁻¹. Seasonally varying discharge drove much of the variation in satellite-derived CDOM and DOC, corroborating recent studies. Satellite imagery can increase the frequency of monitoring observations, particularly during summer and fall when riverine CDOM absorption may be most sensitive to thawing permafrost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aLandsat 3aabsorption 3aautumn 3adissolved organic carbon 3afunding 3ahydrograph 3ahydrologic cycle 3alatitude 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apermafrost 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asummer 3asurface water 3athawing 3awatersheds 3aArctic region 0aChromophoric dissolved organic matter 0aDissolved organic carbon 0aArctic 0aLandsat 0aRemote sensing 0aRivers 0aGoogle Earth Engine1 aMcClelland, J.W.1 aFrey, K.E.1 aFiske, G.1 aHolmes, R.M.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2018 May, v. 209 p.395-409dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.02.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04121naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009600175500002200271520219000293592002802483650002302511650002702534650002502561650002402586650002402610650002202634650001802656650002402674650002402698650002002722650002002742650001902762650001902781650002302800650002102823650002102844650002302865650000702888650002902895650002002924650002402944650002102968650001102989651001103000651001803011653001903029653002803048653003703076653002303113653001603136653002303152700002403175700002303199700005703222700001803279773009203297856008503389852000903474655001203483IND60628563820221117171347.0190408e20190104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062856382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStefanowicz, Anna M.10aInvasive plant species identity affects soil microbial communities in a mesocosm experiment  aPre-press version  aPlant invasions can considerably modify soil microbial communities and processes. The direction and magnitude of these changes depend on invasive plant species. This problem has been studied in the field using a space-for-time substitution approach, but rarely in experimental conditions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the effects on soil microbial properties in a mesocosm experiment of four invasive plant species in Europe, namely, Impatiens glandulifera, Reynoutria japonica, Rudbeckia laciniata and Solidago gigantea, and two expansive species native to Europe but invasive in North America, namely Artemisia vulgaris, Phalaris arundinacea, as well as a mixture of these two species grown in pots in two loamy sand soils differing in elemental concentrations and pH. After two years, microbial activity was measured using soil respiration, urease and arylsulfatase activity; total, bacterial and fungal biomass was measured using substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and/or phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA); and community structure was measured using PLFA. Soil microbial parameters were significantly affected by plant species, soil type and their interaction. Contrary to expectations, R. japonica did not exhibit a strong negative effect on soil microorganisms. Microbial activity and/or biomass in soils under R. japonica, A. vulgaris, R. laciniata and/or species mixture were relatively high, though it depended to some extent on microbial parameters and soil type. In contrast, most microbial parameters had rather low values in bare (unplanted) soil and soils under P. arundinacea and S. gigantea. The largest differences between species were observed in the case of fungal biomass and fungi:bacteria ratio in both soils. Fungal biomass under A. vulgaris and R. japonica was a few times higher than in soils under S. gigantea, P. arundinacea and/or I. glandulifera. Our experiment proved that invasive plant species can modify soil microbial properties considerably during a period as short as two growing seasons. Alterations in the soil environment can potentially be considered as niche construction and support the growth and spread of invaders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia vulgaris 3aImpatiens glandulifera 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3aReynoutria japonica 3aRudbeckia laciniata 3aSolidago gigantea 3aarylsulfatase 3acommunity structure 3aecological invasion 3aedaphic factors 3aenzyme activity 3afungal biomass 3agrowing season 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aloamy sand soils 3amicrobial activity 3apH 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aplants (botany) 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil respiration 3aurease 3aEurope 3aNorth America 0aPlant invasion 0aSoil bacteria and fungi 0aPhospholipid fatty acid analysis 0aEnzymatic activity 0aRespiration 0aNiche construction1 aStanek, Małgorzata1 aMajewska, Marta L.1 aNobis, Marcin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1594-24181 aZubek, Szymon0 tApplied soil ecology.g2019 Jan. 04, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005200139245009800191300001600289500002000305520145600325592002801781650001501809650000901824650002301833650002001856650001001876650000901886650001701895650002301912650002301935650002101958650001401979650002401993650001402017650000902031650001202040650001402052650001302066651001002079700002102089700005602110773012102166856007302287852000902360655001202369IND60608816520221121024537.0180810e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060881652DNAL7 a10.1111/acv.123892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHome, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0369-819810aCanine Conundrum: domestic dogs as an invasive species and their impacts on wildlife in India  ap. 275-282.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDomestic dogs are increasingly being recognized as a conservation threat for native species. In many places, their impacts may be as severe as other invasive predators such as cats and rats. We conducted the first ever sub‐continent scale assessment of the impacts of dogs on native species in India using an online key informant survey and reports from national print media. Dogs reportedly attacked 80 species, of which 31 were IUCN Red list threatened species, including four Critically Endangered species. Larger bodied mammals such as ungulates and carnivores, were most commonly reported to be attacked, although this may be an observation bias. Approximately 68% of the attacks were carried out by dogs unaccompanied by humans. Most of the attacks were carried out by packs of dogs with 45% of these attacks leading to the death of the prey. Nearly 48% of the incidents were reported in and around wildlife protected areas, suggesting that dogs are an important large‐scale edge effect around protected areas in India. For Critically Endangered species that are already suffering from serious population declines due to other causes, the impact of dogs may seriously impede population recovery efforts. Mitigating the impacts of dogs on wildlife requires a multi‐pronged approach of responsible dog ownership, restriction in free‐ranging behaviour, and strong population control measures, especially around sensitive conservation areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarnivores 3acats 3aconservation areas 3acontrol methods 3adeath 3adogs 3aedge effects 3aendangered species 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aownership 3apopulation dynamics 3apredators 3arats 3asurveys 3aungulates 3awildlife 3aIndia1 aBhatnagar, Y.

In this study, I investigate how morphological adaptation to feeding ecology influences a mating signal. In birds, changes in feeding ecology can cause rapid divergence in bill morphology. Because bills are also important for song production, feeding ecology may influence song divergence. During song, birds can rapidly change vocal tract resonance using bill movement, yet are constrained in rate and magnitude of bill movements resulting in a trade-off between trill rate and frequency bandwidth. Male swamp sparrows vary in their ability to produce rapid, broad-band trills and females prefer more physically demanding songs. Populations of swamp sparrows adapted to the feeding ecology of tidal marshes have larger bills than inland populations. Larger bills should increase the constraints of producing rapid, broad-band trills allowing for a test of how changes in feeding ecology affect a feature of song used in mate choice. I found significant differences in acoustic features of song consistent with the hypothesis that coastal males are less able to meet the physical demands of song production because of the constraints of having larger bills. As possible compensation for decreases in song performance, coastal populations exhibit an increase in song complexity. These changes support the current model of how motor constraints influence song production and suggest a mechanism by which feeding ecology can influence signal evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBird song 0ageographic variation 0amate choice 0asexual selection 0aswamp sparrow 0avocal performance0 tEvolution.g2006 Sept., v. 60, no. 9 p.1936-1944dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F06-051.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014100170300001400311520133300325592002801658650001101686650001401697650001601711650002101727650002001748650002301768650001401791650001701805650002101822650001701843650001001860650001401870653001401884653001401898653002101912653001101933653002101944700001201965700001501977700001801992700005702010700001902067700001502086700001202101700001402113700006002127773009402187856008702281852000902368655001202377IND60780346120221118043742.0220824e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078034612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2022.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jia-Dong10aCryopreservation of porcine skin-derived stem cells using melatonin or trehalose maintains their ability to self-renew and differentiate  ap. 23-34.  aPorcine skin-derived stem cells (pSDSCs) are a type of adult stem cells (ASCs) that retain the ability to self-renew and differentiate. Currently, pSDSCs research has entered an intense period of development; however there has been no research regarding methods of cryopreservation. In this paper, we explored an efficient cryopreservation method for pSDSCs. Our results demonstrated that cryopreserving 50 μm diameter pSDSCs aggregates resulted in a lower apoptosis rate and a greater ability to proliferate to form larger spherical cell aggregates than during single-cell cryopreservation. To further optimize the cryopreservation method, we added different concentrations of melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, MLT) and trehalose (d-trehalose anhydrous, TRE) to act as cryoprotectants (CPAs) for the pSDSCs. After comparative experiments, we found that the cryopreservation efficiency of 50 mM TRE was superior. Further experiments demonstrated that the reason why 50 mM TRE improved cryopreservation efficiency was that it reduced the intracellular oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage caused by cryopreservation. Taken together, our results suggest that cryopreserving 50 μm diameter pSDSCs aggregates in F12 medium with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 50 mM TRE promotes the long-term storage of pSDSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aapoptosis 3acryobiology 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3amelatonin 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3astorage time 3aswine 3atrehalose 0aMelatonin 0aTrehalose 0aCryopreservation 0apSDSCs 0aOxidative stress1 aSun, Yu1 aQiao, Tian1 aZhang, Shu-Er1 aDyce, Paul W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4574-33211 aGeng, Yuan-Wei1 aWang, Ping1 aGe, Wei1 aShen, Wei1 aCheng, Shun-Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2836-27620 tCryobiology.g2022 Aug., v. 107 p.23-34dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2022.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010600160300001800266520106400284592002801348650002201376650001201398650001901410650001301429650001701442653002801459653002601487653002201513700002101535700002801556700002001584700002101604700002101625700001901646700002101665700001601686700002201702700002101724773012301745856007501868852000901943655001201952IND60528823320170710000000.0160717e20150225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052882332DNAL7 a10.1021/am506984m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIonescu, Andreea10aElectropolymerized Highly Photoconductive Thin Films of Cyclopalladated and Cycloplatinated Complexes  ap. 4019-4028.  aThe complete characterization of novel electropolymerizable organometallic complexes is presented. These are newly synthesized cyclometalated complexes of general formula (PPy)M(O∧N)ⁿ (H(PPy) = 2-phenylpyridine, M = Pd(II) or Pt(II), H(O∧N)ⁿ = Schiff base). Polymeric thin films have been obtained from these complexes by electropolymerization of the triphenylamino group grafted onto the H(O∧N)ⁿ ancillary ligand. The redox behavior and the photoconductivity of both of the monomers (PPy)M(O∧N)ⁿ and the electropolymerized species have been investigated. The polymeric films of (PPy)M(O∧N)ⁿ have shown a very significant enhancement of photoconductivity when compared to their monomeric amorphous counterparts. The high stability of the obtained films strongly suggests that electropolymerization of cyclometalated complexes represents a viable deposition technique of quality thin films with improved photoconduction properties, hence opening the door to a new class of materials with suitable properties for optoelectronic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3afilms (materials) 3aligands 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aschiff bases 0apalladium(II) complexes 0aelectropolymerization 0aphotoconductivity1 aLento, Raffaella1 aMastropietro, Teresa

Six-month egg-laying shelducks were intramuscularly injected with DTMUV strain XZ-2012. Morphological analysis revealed the presence of vacuolar degeneration in the periellipsoidal lymphatic sheaths (PELS) of spleen white pulp following infection, especially from 12 hpi to 3 dpi. Ultrastructural images showed an obvious swelling of cells and their mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Using RNA-seq analysis, the expression levels of RIG-I like receptors (RLRs), downstream IRF7 and proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 from RIG-I signaling pathway were non-apparently upregulated at 2 hpi and apparently at 3 dpi, while MHC-II expression was obviously downregulated at 2 hpi. The expression levels of downstream antiviral cytokines type-I IFNs, anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), chemokines and their receptors associated with lymphocyte homing were significantly upregulated at 3 dpi. The population of lymphocyte was increased at 6 dpi. The immune function of spleen was recovered starting from 9 dpi. These findings of this study suggest that DTMUV invaded into the spleen via RIG-I signaling pathway and enhanced immune evasion by inhibiting MHC-II expression during the early stage of infection. Additionally, DTMUV induced PELS lesions through activating IL-6 expression. Furthermore, DTMUV increased the expression levels of RLRs, antiviral type-I IFNs, lymphocyte homing-related genes and proteins as well as the number of lymphocytes in the infected duck spleen. Taken altogether, this study provides new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of DTMUV infection in duck spleen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTembusu virus 3acell adhesion molecules 3achemokines 3aducks 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agenes 3aimmune evasion 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3alymphocytes 3amitochondria 3aoviposition 3apulp 3areceptors 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3aspleen 3avacuoles 3aviral load 0aDuck Tembusu virus 0aSpleen 0aPathogenicity 0aRNA-seq 0aLymphocyte homing1 aLi, Wenqian1 aLiu, Enxue1 aHuang, Haixiang1 aWang, Taozhi1 aWang, Xindong1 aShi, Yonghong1 aYang, Ping1 aChen, Qiusheng0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2019 Mar., v. 230 p.32-44dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01833naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245006600175300001600241520083800257592002801095650001101123650002501134650002201159650001201181650000901193650001301202651001101215653001101226653000801237653001901245700001801264700001901282773007801301856008301379852000901462655001201471IND60096957520221120072500.0160903e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009695752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2013.04.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKretzschmar, Gavin L.10aRussia's resource capitalism—market vs political signalling  ap. 771-782.  aSince the early post-Soviet era, when many strategically important Russian oil and gas fields were sold on unfavourable terms, the state has been seeking to regain control of these strategic assets. With Putin's return to the Presidency in 2012, Russia's U-turn over oil and gas privatizations has again caused market consternation. We examine strategic asset acquisitions by Russian O&G companies during Putin's first terms as president and suggest that there should however, be few surprises. Under Putin, strategic deals in Russia are often informal, dominated by Russian partners, subject to internecine rivalries and, we show, are ‘somehow’ known by markets prior to promulgation. Findings suggest that in Russia deals of strategic substance are recognized by financial markets prior to the announcement of political policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3abusiness enterprises 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3aoils 3apolitics 3aRussia 0aRussia 0aOil 0aState politics1 aSimpson, Ewan1 aHaque, Mujibul0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 Oct., v. 61 p.771-782dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2013.04.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245011700212520158800329592002801917650001901945650001901964650001201983650001501995650002602010650002402036650001802060650002102078650002002099653002002119653001002139653002902149653002002178653002602198700005802224700006602282700006402348700001802412700006102430773011102491856008702602961001302689852000902702655001202711IND60780346220221118043743.0220714e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078034622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.1160042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhilben, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8598-904310aEnrichment of 13C with depth in soil organic horizons is not explained by CO2 or DOC losses during decomposition  aStable isotope ratios of soil organic carbon (SOC) are a potentially powerful, integrative tool for analyzing the soil C cycle. However, limited understanding of the mechanisms for C isotope fractionation in soil prevents their widespread application. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is progressively enriched in ¹³C with age and depth in the soil profile even though CO₂ produced during soil respiration is typically enriched in ¹³C compared to SOC. This results in an apparent mass balance paradox. To resolve this paradox, we hypothesized that the loss of ¹³C-depleted DOC during soil diagenesis, the combination of microbial decomposition and abiotic processes such as leaching, can account for the increase in SOC δ¹³C with depth. We combined three independent approaches (field measurements, a laboratory incubation experiment, and seasonal sampling of DOC across a climate transect) to systematically evaluate the relationship between the δ¹³C of soil respiration, DOC, and the SOC it is derived from. However, DOC was not significantly depleted in ¹³C compared to SOC in any of the three approaches, and mass balance calculations indicated that the DOC flux cannot account for the full extent of ¹³C enrichment of SOC with depth in the soil profile. We suggest that vertical C transport by plant roots or fungi, rather than diagenesis, may be largely responsible for the observed C isotope profile. Future studies aimed at understanding these vertical transport processes should enable increased application of soil δ¹³C, enhancing soil biogeochemical studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3adiagenesis 3aisotope fractionation 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil profiles 3asoil respiration 3astable isotopes 0aStable isotopes 0aδ13C 0aDissolved organic carbon 0aOrganic horizon 0aIsotope fractionation1 aBowering, Keri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2429-84921 aPodrebarac, Frances A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8879-26921 aLaganière, Jérôme1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2649-91131 aEdwards, Kate1 aZiegler, Susan E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0708-13360 tGeoderma.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 424 p.116004-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.1160043Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245013000209300001600339500001900355520153100374592002801905650001601933650002001949650001001969650002401979650002602003650001402029650002502043650001202068650001602080650001002096650001402106650001302120650001302133653001102146653001602157653001102173653000902184653001502193700001402208700001902222700002002241700001502261700001702276700002402293773013902317856008102456852000902537655001202546IND60717727120221119094921.0201116e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071772712DNAL7 a10.1017/S00074853200002802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReisig, Dominic D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9979-581310aLocation of Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae on different plant parts of determinate and indeterminate soybean  ap. 725-731.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHelicoverpa zea (Boddie) is a damaging pest of many crops including soybean, Glycine max (L.), especially in the southern United States. Previous studies have concluded that oviposition and development of H. zea larvae mirror the phenology of soybean, with oviposition occurring during full bloom, younger larvae developing on blooms and leaves, intermediate aged larvae developing on varying tissue types, and older larvae developing on flowers and pods. In a field trial, we investigated the presence of natural infestations of H. zea larvae by instar in determinate and indeterminate soybean varieties. In complementary experiments, we artificially infested H. zea and allowed them to oviposit on plants within replicated cages (one with a determinate variety and two with an indeterminate variety). Plants were sampled weekly during the time larvae were present. In the natural infestation experiment, most larvae were found on blooms during R3 and were early to middle instars; by R4, most larvae were found on leaves and were middle to late instars. In contrast, in the cage study, most larvae were found on leaves regardless of soybean growth stage or larval stage. Determinate and indeterminate growth habit did not impact larval preference for different soybean tissue types. Our studies suggest H. zea larvae prefer specific tissue types, but also provide evidence that experimental design can influence the results. Finally, our finding of larval preference for leaves contrasts with findings from previous studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aHelicoverpa zea 3acages 3aexperimental design 3afield experimentation 3aflowering 3aindeterminate growth 3ainstars 3aoviposition 3apests 3aphenology 3aresearch 3asoybeans 0aBlooms 0adevelopment 0aleaves 0apods 0apreference1 aCook, Don1 aGreene, Jeremy1 aCaprio, Michael1 aGore, Jeff1 aMusser, Fred1 aReay-Jones, Francis0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2020 Dec., v. 110, no. 6 p.725-731dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853200002803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245009500205300001600300520110100316592002801417650001401445650001101459650001001470650001601480650001901496650002001515650001501535650001501550653001801565653001601583653001901599653002701618700002301645700002301668700002301691773011001714856008201824852000901906655001201915IND60592564620221119013319.0200503e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059256462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2018.02.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabaghy, Sabah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9453-892210aSpatially enhanced passive microwave derived soil moisture: Capabilities and opportunities  ap. 551-580.  aLow frequency passive microwave remote sensing is a proven technology for providing soil moisture estimates, but the coarse resolution of its data restricts the range of applications. Downscaling, otherwise known as disaggregation, has been proposed as the solution to spatially enhance these coarse resolution soil moisture observations, through association with complementary observations, or ancillary information about land surface features at higher spatial resolution. Such information includes solar reflectance, thermal emission, passive microwave emissions at a higher frequency, radar backscatter, soil or surface attributes such as topography and soil properties, and land surface modelling. Each of these ancillary data sources has its own strengths and limitations in terms of, for example, sensitivity to surface soil moisture dynamics and availability. This paper provides an extensive review of the capabilities and opportunities of current soil moisture downscaling approaches which provide a deterministic pattern of soil moisture, together with their strengths and limitations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3amodels 3aradar 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asoil properties 3asoil water 3atopography 0aSoil moisture 0aDownscaling 0aDisaggregation 0aSubpixel heterogeneity1 aWalker, Jeffrey P.1 aRenzullo, Luigi J.1 aJackson, Thomas J.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2018 May, v. 209 p.551-580dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.02.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03846naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012300163300001600286520213000302592002802432650001102460650001602471650001902487650002602506650001602532650001302548650001302561650001102574650001202585650001502597650001302612650002102625650000902646650001602655650001202671650001002683650001802693650002302711650001702734651001302751653003002764653002602794653001902820653001602839653003302855653001702888653002002905653002202925700001702947700002102964700001602985700001703001700001503018773010803033856008203141852000903223655001203232IND60636691720221122005708.0190425e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063669172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2019.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Bauw, P.10aCombining phosphorus placement and water saving technologies enhances rice production in phosphorus-deficient lowlands  ap. 177-189.  aLowland rice production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is often limited by water supply and low phosphorus (P) availability and efforts are needed towards more efficient management of both resources. Field and pot experiments were set up to evaluate combinations of water saving technologies and micro-dose P placement methods (i.e. the localized application of a small P dose to a sub-surface area, often combined with seeds into the planting hole) with due attention to treatment effects on root architecture. A two-year field experiment was set up in a lowland rice field in Tanzania with factorial combinations of different levels of water supply (field capacity, alternating wetting drying, permanent flooding) and P application (no P; 3.45 and 6.90 kg ha−1 placement versus 25 kg ha−1 broadcast), thereby testing residual effects in year 2. A trial in pots (10.5 L) was additionally performed with equivalent treatments and allowing measurements of soil solution composition, apparent fertilizer efficiency, and root density versus depth. Rice grain yields ranged 0–5 ton ha−1 and mainly responded to P application. The P placement at the lowest P rate resulted in higher grain yield at field capacity (2.0–2.5 ton ha−1) than in flooded rice (1.2–1.6 ton ha−1), whereas these differences were absent at higher P rates. Lower water supply at field capacity enhanced root growth and rooting depth, decreased nodal root thickness and enhanced root P uptake efficiency compared to flooded condition. Modelling P diffusion outwards the granules showed more restricted P diffusion under reduced water supply and, therefore, less P immobilization in the soil under field capacity. These differences between water treatments were more pronounced at lower than at higher P supply. This study shows that both root responses and P diffusion outwards placed granules explain rice development and yields under micro-dose P placement and water saving technologies. P placement can contribute to intensify rice production while countering soil P decline in P deficient lowlands when resources are limited.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrying 3afertilizers 3afield capacity 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3agranules 3alowlands 3amodels 3apaddies 3aphosphorus 3aplanting 3aresidual effects 3arice 3aroot growth 3arooting 3aseeds 3asoil solution 3awater conservation 3awater supply 3aTanzania 0aWater saving technologies 0aPhosphorus efficiency 0aP micro-dosing 0aP placement 0aAlternate wetting and drying 0aAerobic rice 0aRoot plasticity 0aRoot architecture1 aVandamme, E.1 aSenthilkumar, K.1 aLupembe, A.1 aSmolders, E.1 aMerckx, R.0 tField crops research.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 236 p.177-189dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2019.03.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03498naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006300153245014600216300001400362520158100376592002801957650001601985650001502001650001602016650001602032650002902048650001702077650002102094650001902115650001902134650001902153650001702172650002802189650001602217650002002233650001502253653001602268653001802284653001902302653002802321653001602349653000902365653000802374653000902382653000902391653000802400653001002408653002302418653001902441653001202460653000902472653000902481653001402490653000702504653000702511653000702518653000702525700002202532700002102554700002102575773011902596856008802715852000902803655001202812IND60532913720221118053903.0190318e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053291372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2014.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOukarroum, Abdallah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1942-561010aCorrelation between reactive oxygen species production and photochemistry of photosystems I and II in Lemna gibba L. plants under salt stress  ap. 80-88.  aIncreased rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a common plant response to various environmental stresses. In chloroplast thylakoids, the reaction centers of photosystems I and II are the major generation site of ROS. In the present study, the changes of chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, P700 absorption change and ROS production (using the fluorescent probe 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate) were investigated in Lemna gibba plants exposed to salt stress (0–400mM NaCl). Salt stress inhibited PSI and PSII activities and resulted in a decrease in overall activity of the electron transport chain while stimulating ROS production. When L. gibba plants were kept into dark condition, NaCl treatment did not showed any significant change in ROS formation compared to control. However, NaCl treatment in light condition induced a strong increase in ROS formation. The production of ROS at 400mM NaCl was 2.6 and 10 fold higher compared to the control respectively after 6h and 24h treatment in light. Furthermore, the correlation between ROS production and the two photosystems (PSI and PSII) activities in L. gibba plants was analyzed. Our data confirmed the correlation between the ROS production and PSII and PSI activities. We showed that ROS production was highly correlated to maximal quantum yield of PSII (R2=0.91) and efficiency with which a trapped exciton can move an electron into the electron transport chain (R2=0.86). While the correlation coefficient (R2) value ROS formation and ΔI/Io820nm (measure of redox states of plastocyanin and P700) was 0.63.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLemna gibba 3aabsorption 3achlorophyll 3acorrelation 3aelectron transport chain 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3aplant response 3aplastocyanin 3areactive oxygen species 3asalt stress 3asodium chloride 3athylakoids 0aLemna gibba 0aPhotosystem I 0aPhotosystem II 0aReactive oxygen species 0aSalt stress 0aφPo 0aψo 0aφRo 0aδRo 0aABS 0aChl a 0aFo (F20μs) and FM 0aOJIP transient 0aPItotal 0aP700 0aPSII 0aQA and QB 0aRC 0aVI 0aVJ 0aVt1 aBussotti, Filippo1 aGoltsev, Vasilij1 aKalaji, Hazem M.0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2015 Jan., v. 109 p.80-88dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2014.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001700135245010800152300001500260520107700275592002801352650001501380650002601395650001301421650001501434650002001449700001501469700001901484773015101503856007001654856010201724852000901826655001201835IND60777308120221121222810.0220516e20220516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077730812DNAL7 a10.3791/617152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fang,10aAssisted selection of biomarkers by linear discriminant analysis effect size (lefse) in microbiome data  ap. e61715.  aThere is growing attention toward closed biological genomes in the environment and in health. To explore and reveal the intergroup differences among different samples or environments, it is crucial to discover biomarkers with statistical differences among groups. The application of Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) can help find good biomarkers. Based on the original genome data, quality control, and quantification of different sequences based on taxa or genes are carried out. First, the Kruskal-Wallis rank test was used to distinguish between specific differences among statistical and biological groups. Then, the Wilcoxon rank test was performed between the two groups obtained in the previous step to assess whether the differences were consistent. Finally, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was conducted to evaluate the influence of biomarkers on significantly different groups based on LDA scores. To sum up, LEfSe provided the convenience for identifying genomic biomarkers that characterize statistical differences among biological groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3adiscriminant analysis 3agenomics 3amicrobiome 3aquality control1 aHe, Shishi1 aDang, Chenyuan0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2022 May 16, , no. 183 p.e61715-e61715dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/617153Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/61715/assisted-selection-biomarkers-linear-discriminant-analysis-effect  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245010400191300001800295520095900313592002801272650001601300650001501316650001101331650001201342650001001354650001201364650001201376650001101388650001001399650001601409650000901425650001001434650001401444650001101458650001401469650001301483650000901496650001601505650001201521650006701533650005201600650002101652650001101673650002201684650000901706650003401715650003001749650002401779700001801803700001301821773009901834856008401933852000902017655001202026IND60086639920221119130247.0141102e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008663992DNAL7 a217832882pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2011.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerglund, Å.M.M.10aSpecies- and age-related variation in metal exposure and accumulation of two passerine bird species  ap. 2368-2374.  aWe measured the concentration of several elements (arsenic [As], calcium [Ca], cadmium [Cd], copper [Cu], nickel [Ni], lead [Pb], selenium [Se] and zinc [Zn]) in adult and nestling pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) and great tits (Parus major) at different distances to a Cu–Ni smelter in 2009. Feces of nestlings generally failed to correspond with internal element concentrations but reflected the pollution exposure, indicating an increased stress by removal of excess metals. The uptake of Cu and Ni were regulated, but As, Cd, Pb and Se accumulated in liver tissue. Pied flycatchers had generally higher element concentrations than great tits. The higher accumulation of As and Pb in pied flycatcher livers was explained by a more efficient absorption, whereas the higher Cd concentration was primarily due to different intake of food items. Age-related differences occurred between the two species, though both Cd and Se accumulated with age.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParus major 3aabsorption 3aadults 3aarsenic 3abirds 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acopper 3afeces 3afood intake 3alead 3aliver 3anestlings 3anickel 3apollution 3aselenium 3azinc 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Exposurexanalysisxstatistics & numerical data. 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aFecesxchemistry 2aFemale 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMetalsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPasseriformesxmetabolism 2aSpecies Specificity1 aKoivula, M.J.1 aEeva, T.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2011 Oct., v. 159, no. 10 p.2368-2374dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2011.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006600155245006000221300001400281520139700295592002801692650001401720650002501734650001101759650002401770650001401794650002001808650002401828650003301852650001701885650003901902650001401941650002201955650001401977650001001991650001702001653001402018653001402032653001002046653001202056653001402068653001802082700002402100700002602124700002202150700001902172700002502191773011002216856009002326852000902416655001202425IND60636691920221122005840.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063669192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2019.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSirotkin, Alexander V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2170-130310aEffect of quercetin on ovarian cells of pigs and cattle  ap. 44-51.  aThe bioflavonoid quercetin is a component of food with numerous biological effects, but its function in reproductive processes and mechanisms in various species remain unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of quercetin on ovarian cells isolated from ovaries of two phytophagous mammalian species (i.e. pigs and cattle). There was analysis of the effect of quercetin (0, 1, 10, and 100 ng/mL) on cultured granulosa cells of pigs and cattle. Proliferation (PCNA) and apoptosis (bax) markers and release of progesterone (P4), testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), and IGF-I were quantified using quantitative immunocytochemistry, enzyme immunoassay, or radioimmunoassay. Treatments with quercetin reduced PCNA and bax accumulation and decreased P4 release from both granulosa cells of pigs and cattle. In cells of pigs, treatment with quercetin reduced T output, however, in cells of cattle quercetin increased T release. In cells of pigs, quercetin reduced IGF-I release. In cells of cattle, quercetin at smaller doses (1 or 10 ng/mL), promoted and at a large dose (100 ng/mL) reduced IGF-I secretions. There was no substantial E2 release from granulosa cells of pigs or cattle. These observations are the first to indicate there is a direct action of quercetin on basic ovarian cell functions (proliferation, apoptosis, and hormones release) which can be species-specific.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abioactive properties 3acattle 3aenzyme immunoassays 3aestradiol 3agranulosa cells 3aimmunocytochemistry 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aprogesterone 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aquercetin 3aradioimmunoassays 3asecretion 3aswine 3atestosterone 0aNutrition 0aFecundity 0aOvary 0aHormone 0aApoptosis 0aProliferation1 aHrabovszká, Sandra1 aŠtochmaľová, Aneta1 aGrossmann, Roland1 aAlwasel, Saleh1 aHalim Harrath, Abdel0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2019 June, v. 205 p.44-51dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2019.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245012100196500002000317520147700337592002801814596011701842596010201959650002202061650001802083650001202101650001702113650001002130650001202140650001302152650001802165650001102183650001802194650001102212650002002223650001502243650003202258650002002290650001102310650001602321700001902337700001602356700001702372700001802389773014202407856007502549852000902624655001202633IND60777308320221121222914.0220516e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077730832DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.164942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Guijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6866-345510aImpact of ethanol vapor treatment on the quality of water bamboo (Zizania caduciflora L.) shoots during cold storage  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study evaluated the effect of ethanol vapor treatments on the physicochemical characteristics and quality of postharvest water bamboo shoots (WBS) (Zizania caduciflora L.). WBS were treated with ethanol vapor at doses of 0 (control), 500, 750, and 1000 μl/L at 0 ± 1°C for 35 days. The fruit were evaluated for weight loss, firmness, color, total soluble solids, soluble sugars, malondialdehyde, lignin, and lignification‐related enzyme activities. The results revealed that all ethanol treatments could inhibit the weight loss and softening of WBS, reduce the reduction of soluble solids and soluble sugars content, inhibit the lignification‐associated enzymes peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase activities, and reduce the synthesis of lignin. Among them, the 750 μl/L ethanol vapor treatment had a significant effect on all tested parameters and maintained the storage quality of WBS better than other treatments. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Water bamboo shoot is a nutritionally rich aquatic vegetable. However, its quality deteriorates rapidly after harvest due to wilting, softening, and lignification. The ethanol vapor treatment in this study significantly reduced the softening and lignification of WBS. The ethanol vapor treatment is simple and has less residue, which is effective in maintaining the fruit quality and reducing the nutritional loss of WBS after harvest. It is a safe and environmentally friendly preservation method for WBS.  aPublisher supplied data  a21 DZ2292200cShanghai Agricultural Products Preservation and Processing Professional Technical Service Platform  cShanghai Agricultural Products Preservation and Processing Engineering Technology Research Centre 3aZizania latifolia 3abamboo shoots 3abamboos 3acold storage 3acolor 3aethanol 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3afruits 3alignification 3alignin 3amalondialdehyde 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3astorage quality 3avapors 3aweight loss1 aWang, Chunfang1 aLiu, Hongru1 aLiu, Chenxia1 aQiao, Yongjin0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2022 May, v. 46, no. 5 p.e16494-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.164943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001400169245015000183300001800333520096000351592002801311650000801339650001401347650001401361650001301375650001401388650002501402650002901427650001801456650002601474650005601500650002001556650002401576650004101600700001901641700001701660700001601677700001601693773009901709856008401808852000901892655001201901IND60086640120221119124142.0141102e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008664012DNAL7 a217845662pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2011.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Yu10aWastewater treatment plants and landfills emit volatile methyl siloxanes (VMSs) to the atmosphere: Investigations using a new passive air sampler  ap. 2380-2386.  aVolatile methyl siloxanes (VMSs) are a class of chemicals with an increasing range of applications and widespread distribution in the environment. Passive air samplers (PAS) comprising sorbent-impregnated polyurethane-foam (SIP) disks were first calibrated and then deployed around two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and at two landfill sites to investigate inputs of VMSs to air. SIP-derived air concentrations for ΣVMSs (ng/m³) at background sites on the perimeter of the WWTP were 479±82.3 and comparable to results for the upwind samples at the landfills (333±194). Order of magnitude higher concentrations of ΣVMSs (ng/m³) were found for on-site samples at the WWTPs (3980±2620) and landfills (4670±3360). Yearly emissions (kg/yr) to air were estimated and ranged from 60–2100 and 80–250, respectively, for the cyclic VMSs. These findings demonstrate and quantify for the first time, waste sector emissions of VMSs to the atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aemissions 3alandfills 3asamplers 3asiloxanes 3awastewater treatment 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aAir Pollution 2aAtmospherexchemistry 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aRefuse Disposal 2aSiloxanesxanalysis 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysis1 aShoeib, Mahiba1 aAhrens, Lutz1 aHarner, Tom1 aMa, Jianmin0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2011 Oct., v. 159, no. 10 p.2380-2386dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2011.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245011400177300001600291520107600307592002801383650001901411650001401430650001001444650002101454650001501475650001601490650002101506650001001527650001701537650003501554650002601589653000901615653001001624653001601634653002701650700001601677700001201693700001601705700001801721700001601739700001201755700001801767773011101785856008901896852000901985655001201994IND60636692020221122005744.0190410e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063669202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2019.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhuangbiao10aSingle nucleotide polymorphisms in BMP2 and BMP7 and the association with litter size in Small Tail Han sheep  ap. 183-192.  aAlthough it has been investigated for many years, the physiological processes regulating prolificacy in sheep remains unclear because of regulation by many genes. To better understand the effects of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) comprising g.48462350C>T in BMP2, g.58171856C>G and g.58171886A>C in BMP7, a population genetic analysis was conducted using data obtained from genotyping in 768 sheep from six breeds (three polytocous and three monotocous). The results indicate that all the sheep breeds were considered to conform to the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.05). The associations of these three SNPs with litter size in 384 Small Tail Han sheep were analyzed, therefore, and found to be correlated with fecundity as assessed by mean litter size (P < 0.05). Bioinformatic analysis indicated there was a transmembrane domain change that occurred after a mutation in BMP2 at g.48462350C>T, and changes involving transcription factors such as USF1, USF2 and INMS1 in the BMP7 promoter region might be involved in greater sheep prolificacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3afecundity 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3agenotyping 3alitter size 3apromoter regions 3asheep 3asheep breeds 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscription factors 0aSNPs 0aSheep 0aLitter size 0aBioinformatic analysis1 aLiu, Qiuyue1 aDi, Ran1 aHu, Wenping1 aWang, Xiangyu1 aHe, Xiaoyun1 aMa, Lin1 aChu, Mingxing0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2019 May, v. 204 p.183-192dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2019.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003800139245011700177300001800294500002000312520168500332592002802017650001002045650001902055650002202074650002202096650002402118650001302142650002002155650002302175650002102198650001002219650001602229650001402245650002302259650002402282650001402306650001002320650002602330651001102356700007102367700002002438773013002458856007402588852000902662655001202671IND60786524720221122205350.0220804e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078652472DNAL7 a10.1002/ajb2.17302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález‐Di Pierro, Ana María10aGermination success of large‐seeded plant species ingested by howler monkeys in tropical rain forest fragments  ap. 1625-1634.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE: Primates are important seed dispersers, especially for large‐seeded (>1 cm long) tropical species in continuous and fragmented rainforests. METHODS: In three forest fragments within the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, southern Mexico, we investigated the effect of seed passage through the gut of howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) on the germination rate and maximum germination (%) of native, large‐seeded species. One group of howler monkeys, per fragment, was followed and fresh feces collected. Large seeds were removed to compare their germination success with non‐ingested seeds of the same species collected underneath parent plants. RESULTS: Feces contained large seeds from seven tree species (Ampelocera hottlei, Castilla elastica, Dialium guianense, Garcinia intermedia, Pourouma bicolor, Spondias mombin, Trophis racemosa) and one liana species (Abuta panamensis). Except for G. intermedia, ingested seeds germinated significantly faster than non‐ingested seeds, which had negligible germination. Ingested seeds of D. guianense, P. bicolor, S. mombin, T. racemosa, and A. panamensis had significantly greater germination, while G. intermedia had significantly lower germination and seed ingestion had no apparent effect for A. hottlei and C. elastica. CONCLUSIONS: In general, seed ingestion by howler monkeys confers faster germination compared with non‐ingested seeds. Faster germination reduces predation probabilities and increases seedling establishment in forest fragments. Primate dispersal services contribute to germination heterogeneity within plant populations of old‐growth forest species and to their persistence in forest fragments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbuta 3aAlouatta pigra 3aCastilla elastica 3aDialium guianense 3aGarcinia intermedia 3aPourouma 3aSpondias mombin 3aconservation areas 3adigestive system 3afeces 3agermination 3aingestion 3aold-growth forests 3aplant establishment 3apredation 3atrees 3atropical rain forests 3aMexico1 aBenítez‐Malvido, Julieta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6180-16511 aLombera, Rafael0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2021 Sept., v. 108, no. 9 p.1625-1634dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44651x0002-91227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.17303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04459naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245008500212300001600297520259200313592002802905650001502933650001202948650001102960650001502971650001102986650001202997650001503009650001003024650001103034650001903045650001303064650001103077650001203088650001003100650001603110650001503126651001003141653003003151653001903181653001303200653002703213653001803240653002103258653002203279653001303301653001103314700005903325700005703384700002303441700006203464700002103526700006403547700001803611773012503629856008203754852000903836655001203845IND60592565020221119013217.0200503e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059256502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2018.02.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlangakoon, Nayani T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6607-060510aConstraining plant functional types in a semi-arid ecosystem with waveform lidar  ap. 497-509.  aAccurate classification of plant functional types (PFTs) reduces the uncertainty in global biomass and carbon estimates. Airborne small-footprint waveform lidar data are increasingly used for vegetation classification and above-ground carbon estimates at a range of spatial scales in woody or homogeneous grass and savanna ecosystems. However, a gap remains in understanding how waveform features represent and ultimately can be used to constrain the PFTs in heterogeneous semi-arid ecosystems. This study evaluates lidar waveform features and classification performance of six major PFTs, including shrubs and trees, along with bare ground in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho, USA. Waveform lidar data were obtained with the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO). From these data we derived waveform features at two spatial scales (1 m and 10 m rasters) by applying a Gaussian decomposition and a frequency-domain deconvolution. An ensemble random forest algorithm was used to assess classification performance and to select the most important waveform features. Classification models developed with the 10 m waveform features outperformed those at 1 m (Kappa (κ) = 0.81–0.86 vs. 0.60–0.70, respectively). At 1 m resolution, lidar height features improved the PFT classification accuracy by 10% compared to the analysis without these features. However, at 10 m resolution, the inclusion of lidar derived heights with other waveform features decreased the PFT classification performance by 4%. Pulse width, rise time, percent energy, differential target cross section, and radiometrically calibrated backscatter coefficient were the most important waveform features at both spatial scales. A significant finding is that bare ground was clearly differentiated from shrubs using pulse width. Though the overall accuracy ranges between 0.72 and 0.89 across spatial scales, the two shrub PFTs showed 0.45–0.87 individual classification success at 1 m, while bare ground and tree PFTs showed high (0.72–1.0) classification accuracy at 10 m. We conclude that small-footprint waveform features can be used to characterize the heterogeneous vegetation in this and similar semi-arid ecosystems at high spatial resolution. Furthermore, waveform features such as pulse width can be used to constrain the uncertainty of terrain modeling in environments where vegetation and bare ground lidar returns are close in time and space. The dependency on spatial resolution plays a critical role in classification performance in tree-shrub co-dominant ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3agrasses 3alandscapes 3alidar 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asavannas 3ashrubs 3astreams 3atrees 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 3aIdaho 0aAirborne Snow Observatory 0aWaveform lidar 0aDrylands 0aPlant functional types 0aRandom forest 0aMachine learning 0aFeature selection 0aEnsemble 0aCarbon1 aGlenn, Nancy F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2124-76541 aDashti, Hamid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9397-34581 aPainter, Thomas H.1 aMikesell, T.

A set of new low-temperature organic compounds, for heat recovery purposes, was obtained by solving the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem with nominal values from a previous work. Monte Carlo simulations with Latin hypercube sampling were carried out to asses the effect of uncertain group contributions on thermo-physical properties. Furthermore, a set-based robust counterpart was formulated by taking into account uncertainty only in linear constraints. The results show that even small uncertainty in group contribution parameters can lead to significant variations in thermo-physical properties of the compounds analyzed. Therefore, it is necessary to consider uncertainty in the Computer-aided molecular design formulation. Solutions of the robust counterpart became more conservative as the uncertainty set size increased, producing organic compounds different from the nominal case.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aheat recovery 3aorganic compounds 3aprocess design 3auncertainty1 aFlores-Tlacuahuac, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7944-00570 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Mar. 26, v. 57, no. 14 p.5058-5069dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b003023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007000139245005800209300001800267500002000285520173900305592002802044650002402072650001102096650002502107650001402132650002202146650002702168650001902195650002502214650002302239651001102262651001802273700006602291700006102357700001702418700006702435700007502502700006902577700005402646773013002700856007402830852000902904655001202913IND60786524920221122205403.0220804e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078652492DNAL7 a10.1002/ajb2.17252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez‐Barrera, Gabriela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3743-282210aGenetic imprints of Brosimum alicastrum Sw. in Mexico  ap. 1793-1807.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE: The mechanisms generating the geographical distributions of genetic diversity are a central theme in evolutionary biology. The amount of genetic diversity and its distribution are controlled by several factors, including dispersal abilities, physical barriers, and environmental and climatic changes. We investigated the patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation among populations of the widespread species Brosimum alicastrum in Mexico. METHODS: Using nuclear DNA microsatellite data, we tested whether the genetic structure of B. alicastrum was associated with the roles of the Trans‐Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as geographical barriers to gene flow and to infer the role of past events in the genetic diversity patterns. We further used a maximum‐likelihood population‐effects mixed model (MLPE) to identify the main factor affecting population differentiation in B. alicastrum. RESULTS: Our results suggested that Mexican B. alicastrum is well differentiated into three main lineages. Patterns of the genetic structure at a finer scale did not fully correspond to the current geographical barriers to gene flow. According to the MLPE mixed model, isolation by distance is the best model for explaining the genetic differentiation of B. alicastrum in Mexico. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the differentiation patterns might reflect (1) an ancient differentiation that occurred in Central and South America, (2) the effects of past climatic changes, and (3) the functions of some physical barriers to gene flow. This study provides insights into the possible mechanisms underlying the geographic genetic variation of B. alicastrum along a moisture gradient in tropical lowland forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrosimum alicastrum 3abotany 3aevolutionary biology 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anuclear genome 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models 3aMexico 3aSouth America1 aOchoa‐Zavala, Maried1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5107-44891 aQuesada, Mauricio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7776-92861 aHarvey, Nick1 aNúñez‐Farfán, Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5829-83381 aGonzález‐Rodríguez, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6196-72881 aRocha‐Ramírez, Víctor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9425-94671 aOyama, Ken1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0367-19640 tAmerican journal of botany.g2021 Sept., v. 108, no. 9 p.1793-1807dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44651x0002-91227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.17253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03572naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148242048800178245012200666300001800788500001900806520157200825592002802397596009502425650001702520650001102537650002802548650002602576650001502602650001502617650001602632650002102648650001102669650001502680650002302695650001602718650001602734651001102750700003302761700003302794700002802827700002802855773012802883856008203011852000903093655001203102IND60717727820221119094541.0201116e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071772782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-020-02237-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamora-Luria, Juan Carlos10aContrôle des réseaux de fractures sur un aquifère karstique côtier: une étude de cas du nord-est de la péninsule du Yucatán (Mexique) Control de redes de fracturas en un acuífero kárstico costero: caso de estudio del noreste de la península de Yucatán 沿海岩溶含水层裂隙网络的控制作用:以墨西哥Yucatán半岛东北部为例 Controle das redes de fraturas em um aquífero cárstico costeiro: estudo de caso no nordeste da Península de Yucatán (México)10aControl of fracture networks on a coastal karstic aquifer: a case study from northeastern Yucatán Peninsula (Mexico)  ap. 2765-2777.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Yucatán Peninsula karst aquifer in southeastern Mexico is important because it is the only source of freshwater supply in the region. Along the eastern coast, the aquifer behaves as a shallow unconfined aquifer, and one of its main characteristics is the development of a complex network of karstic conduits. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is a geophysical technique that provides reliable information on aquifer properties that can be applied to karst. With this in mind, ERT surveys (with dipole-dipole and Wenner arrays) together with vertical profiles of groundwater electrical conductivity were obtained in the northeast of Yucatán Peninsula in the Akumal zone. The objective was to evaluate the characteristic structure of the unsaturated and saturated areas, and to determine the importance of factors at a local level that affect the thickness of the freshwater lens, as well as groundwater flow directions near the coast. The results of the ERT sections show a thin vadose zone with resistivity values greater than 1,052 Ωm and a saturated zone with resistivity values that vary from 1 to 1,052 Ωm, and show the presence of dissolution conduits and fracture zones that are affecting the freshwater lens of the aquifer. In addition, water-table measurements show the role of fracture networks in the groundwater flow. The overall results indicate conditions for a possible microbasin in the Akumal zone, highlighting the importance of local fractures, which could work as groundwater divides along the eastern coast of the Yucatán Peninsula.  aPublisher supplied data  aCátedras CONACYT para jóvenes investigadores.cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología 3acase studies 3acoasts 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrical resistance 3afreshwater 3ageophysics 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3akarsts 3atomography 3aunconfined aquifer 3avadose zone 3awater table 3aMexico1 aPerera-Burgos, Jorge Adrián1 aGonzález-Calderón, Alfredo1 aMarin Stillman, Luis E.1 aLeal-Bautista, Rosa Ma.0 tHydrogeology journal.g2020 Dec., v. 28, no. 8 p.2765-2777dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-020-02237-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03884naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245013000204300001600334520209600350592002802446650001702474650001202491650001502503650001702518650001102535650001302546650002002559650001202579650001502591650001502606650001902621650001502640650001402655650001402669650002602683650001902709650001802728650001702746650001102763650001202774651001502786653003602801653002502837653003302862653002202895653002702917653002502944700001702969700002402986700002003010700003903030773011003069856008203179961001203261852000903273655001203282IND60592565220221119013255.0200503e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059256522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2018.02.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTane, Zachary1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9594-975012aA framework for detecting conifer mortality across an ecoregion using high spatial resolution spaceborne imaging spectroscopy  ap. 195-210.  aBetween 2013 and 2015, during a time of severe drought and elevated bark beetle (Dendroctonus spp.) activity in California, the amount of conifer mortality in the Southern Sierra Nevada increased greatly. Remote sensing is a critical means of providing up-to-date information on the location, magnitude, and extent of mortality across a broad geographic area. We used eleven Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) flight lines, resampled to 30 by 30 m pixel size and acquired on six separate dates as part of the HyspIRI Preparatory Campaign to simulate spaceborne imaging spectroscopy. We also spectrally degraded the AVIRIS images to simulate Landsat-8 data. We tested the ability of single-date and multi-temporal remote sensing to identify red stage conifer mortality, healthy conifer, and non-conifer dominated pixels using a random forest algorithm. Accuracy was assessed with an independent validation dataset acquired via WorldView imagery in areas spatially separate from where training data were collected, as well as through comparison with aerial detection survey and canopy water loss data, with generally good agreement. We found that classifications based on imaging spectroscopy significantly outperformed broadband multispectral feature sets (with a highest overall accuracy of 85.1% obtained by imaging spectroscopy and 80.2% obtained by the simulated multispectral images). We also found that classifications based on multi-temporal imaging spectroscopy were more accurate than single-date imaging spectroscopy (the highest overall accuracy obtained for single-date imaging spectroscopy was 83.4%). Imaging spectroscopy that included interseasonal data from the end of the drought outperformed all other datasets, including interannual data that included only images collected in the summer. Multi-date analysis also improved accuracy using broad band systems. Although current spaceborne assets are adequate for monitoring bark beetle mortality in a heterogeneous ecosystem, a spaceborne imaging spectrometer would further improve operational accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendroctonus 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3abark beetles 3acanopy 3aconifers 3adata collection 3adrought 3aecoregions 3aecosystems 3aimage analysis 3amonitoring 3amortality 3amountains 3amultispectral imagery 3aremote sensing 3aspectrometers 3aspectroscopy 3asummer 3asurveys 3aCalifornia 0aSpaceborne imaging spectroscopy 0aBark beetle outbreak 0aRandom Forest classification 0aFeature selection 0aTree mortality mapping 0aTime series analysis1 aRoberts, Dar1 aKoltunov, Alexander1 aSweeney, Stuart1 aRamirez Villamarin, Carlos Andres,0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2018 May, v. 209 p.195-210dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.02.0733Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010600170520203700276592002802313650002302341650002102364650001202385650002902397650002602426650001202452650001802464650001302482650001902495650001502514650001302529650001102542650001802553650001402571651001002585653002102595653002402616653002602640653001802666653002702684700001802711700001502729700001702744700001702761700001702778773009602795856008702891852000902978655001202987IND60780346920221118043741.0220714e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078034692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.1160122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Qianqian10aWildfire decouples soil multi-element cycles: Contributions of legacy effects and temporal variations  aHigh-severity wildfires may lead to significant impacts on biogeochemical cycling both by burning biomass and by fire legacies.

Despite element concentrations jumped up and down remarkably during the first few months, results showed that the average availability and stability of all elements in soils of the SB site were lower than those of the UB site and legacy effects of fire were consistently significant on available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sodium. Temporal trajectories (months to years) varied amongst elements, and organic carbon (C) and N depleted more than other elements did. High levels (i.e. above the null model threshold) of multi-element coupling in soils of the UB site were maintained during our monitoring periods. By contrast, a reduction in the degree of element coupling was detected over time in soils of the SB site, which was concomitant with the core role of C and the great variability of P. Fire- and time-induced shifts in cation exchange capacity, acid phosphatase activity, capillary porosity and aggregate fraction dominated the uncoupling of multiple soil elements, implying the critical contributions of fire legacy effects and temporal variations. These responses have important implications for the consideration of additional long-term studies because such biogeochemical decoupling of elements may have unpredicted consequences under global change scenarios. Meanwhile, this work is helpful to predict the direction of ecosystem succession and to provide scientific evidence for management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus tabuliformis 3aacid phosphatase 3abiomass 3acation exchange capacity 3aecological succession 3aforests 3aglobal change 3anitrogen 3aorganic carbon 3aphosphorus 3aporosity 3asodium 3astoichiometry 3awildfires 3aChina 0aForest ecosystem 0aSeverely burnt soil 0aMonths since the fire 0aLegacy effect 0aMulti-element coupling1 aZhang, Yujian1 aZhu, Qiang1 aBai, Yansong1 aSun, Xingyue1 aLiu, Yanhong0 tGeoderma.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 424 p.116012-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.1160123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015400157300001800311520135400329592002801683650001501711650002101726650001101747650002101758650002901779650001701808650000901825650001901834650002101853650000901874650000901883650001501892650001601907650001301923650003001936650003701966653001702003653002602020653002102046653001402067653002702081700002402108700003402132700001802166773012302184856007502307852000902382655001202391IND60528824120170710000000.0160717e20150225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052882412DNAL7 a10.1021/am507972b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Xin R.10aAu Nanostructured Surfaces for Electrochemical and Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance-Based Monitoring of α-Synuclein–Small Molecule Interactions  ap. 4081-4088.  aIn this proof-of-concept study, the fabrication of novel Au nanostructured indium tin oxide (Au-ITO) surfaces is described for the development of a dual-detection platform with electrochemical and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-based biosensing capabilities. Nanosphere lithography (NSL) was applied to fabricate Au-ITO surfaces. Oligomers of α-synuclein (αS) were covalently immobilized to determine the electrochemical and LSPR characteristics of the protein. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were performed using the redox probe [Fe(CN)₆]³–/⁴– to detect the binding of Cu(II) ions and (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) to αS on the Au-ITO surface. Electrochemical and LSPR data were complemented by Thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence, surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. EGCG was shown to induce the formation of amorphous aggregates that decreased the electrochemical signals. However, the binding of EGCG with αS increased the LSPR absorption band with a bathochromic shift of 10–15 nm. The binding of Cu(II) to αS enhanced the DPV peak current intensity. NSL fabricated Au-ITO surfaces provide a promising dual-detection platform to monitor the interaction of small molecules with proteins using electrochemistry and LSPR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achemical bonding 3acopper 3aelectrochemistry 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3afluorescence 3agold 3aimage analysis 3aindium tin oxide 3aions 3airon 3amonitoring 3ananospheres 3aproteins 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aα-synuclein 0aParkinson’s disease 0aelectrochemistry 0abiosensor 0ananosphere lithography1 aWallace, Gregory Q.1 aLagugné-Labarthet, François1 aKerman, Kagan0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Feb. 25, v. 7, no. 7 p.4081-4088dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam507972b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245012200175300001400297520173200311592002802043653000902071653001102080653001302091653003202104653002202136653002102158653002702179700002002206700002202226773008802248856009002336852000902426655001202435IND60127198520221119201027.0151110e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012719852DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00004.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteven, Janet C.10aSexual dimorphism in the quantitative-genetic architecture of floral, leaf, and allocation traits in silene latifolia  ap. 42-57.  aMany species exhibit sexual dimorphism in a variety of characters, and the underlying genetic architecture of dimorphism potentially involves sex-specific differences in the additive-genetic variance––covariance matrix (G) of dimorphic traits. We investigated the quantitative-genetic structure of dimorphic traits in the dioecious plant Silene latifolia by estimating G (including within-sex matrices, Gₘ, Gf, and the between-sex variance––covariance matrix, B), and the phenotypic variance––covariance matrix (P) for seven traits. Flower number was the most sexually dimorphic trait, and was significantly genetically correlated with all traits within each sex. Negative genetic correlations between flower size and number suggested a genetic trade-off in investment, but positive environmental correlations between the same traits resulted in no physical evidence for a trade-off in the phenotype. Between-sex genetic covariances for homologous traits were always greater than 0 but smaller than 1, showing that some, but not all, of the variation in traits is caused by genes or alleles with sex-limited expression. Using common principal-components analysis (CPCA), a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation approach, and element-by-element comparison to compare matrices, we found that Gₘ and Gf differed significantly in eigenstructure because of dissimilarity in covariances involving leaf traits, suggesting the presence of variation in sex-limited genes with pleiotropic effects and//or linkage between sex-limited loci. The sex-specific structure of G is expected to cause differences in the correlated responses to selection within each sex, promoting the further evolution and maintenance of dimorphism.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCPCA 0adioecy 0aG matrix 0asex-limited gene expression 0asexual dimorphism 0aSilene latifolia 0asize//number trade-off1 aDelph, Lynda F.1 aBrodie, Edmund D.0 tEvolution.g2007 Jan., v. 61, no. 1 p.42-57dBlackwell Science Incx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1558-5646.2007.00004.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245005400174300001600228520120800244592002801452650002201480650003101502650001001533650001801543650001101561650001901572650001101591653002101602653001801623653002601641653002201667700002701689773009001716856008501806852000901891655001201900IND60564007820221116171615.0180830e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056400782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.06.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDindarloo, Saeid R.10aDeterminants of fuel consumption in mining trucks  ap. 232-240.  aAnalysis of fuel consumption in a large surface mine, during more than 5000 cycles of material transportation, revealed considerable variability in the data. Truck fuel estimation based on the mining truck manufacturers' manuals/estimates is not capable of capturing this variability in the fuel consumption data. Partial least squares regression and autoregressive integrated moving average methods were employed to examine the effect of cyclic activities on fuel consumption, and to recommend relevant remedies for consumption reduction. Proper modifications of the operation can result in improved cycle times. Consequently, minimizing some cyclic activities would enhance energy efficiency. The truck “empty idle time” was a major contributor to unnecessary fuel consumption. Since the truck queues at shovels are a major component of the “empty idle time”, decisions should be reviewed to reduce the truck queues at loading points. Improved dispatching strategies, optimal muck pile shape and size distribution, and improved shovel/loader operator skills are effective preventive measures to minimize truck flow bottlenecks at loading points, and thus to improve energy efficiency at mines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy use and consumption 3afuels 3aleast squares 3amining 3atransportation 3atrucks 0aFuel consumption 0aMining trucks 0aTruck empty idle time 0aEnergy efficiency1 aSiami-Irdemoosa, Elnaz0 tEnergy.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 112 p.232-240dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.06.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002700142245009500169520119600264592002801460650001801488650001301506650001001519650001501529650002001544650001301564650001101577653001601588653001901604653002101623653001801644700002401662700001901686773010301705856007801808852000901886655001201895IND4434426820221117072513.0160209e20100113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443442682DNAL7 a10.2202/1556-3758.16672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFathollahzadeh, Hamzeh10aEffective Conditions for Extracting Higher Quality Kernels from the Sonnati salams Apricot  aThis study focused on researching the effective conditions for extracting high quality apricot kernels.

Apricot pits were analyzed at 6.82, 12.93, 17.81 and 23.01% wet base moisture contents and apricot kernels were analyzed at 2.86, 4.10, 8.81 and 13.03% wet base moisture contents. Apricot pits and kernels were compressed at different moisture contents and the amounts of needed force for cracking were calculated along the length, width and thickness of pits and kernels. It was observed that, with increasing moisture content of the apricot pits and kernels, the energy for cracking decreased. Furthermore, this study also revealed that cracking an apricot pit requires higher rupture force and energy when compressed along its length and that cracking an apricot kernel requires higher rupture force when compressed along its thickness. Results showed that for the proper extraction of kernels, apricot pits should be compressed along its width at certain moisture content, which is very important for designing apricot pit-crushing machines.  aPublisher supplied data 3awater content 3aapricots 3aseeds 3aextraction 3afood processing 3acracking 3aforces 0aapricot pit 0aapricot kernel 0amoisture content 0arupture force1 aTabatabaie, Hossein1 aMobli, Hossein0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2010 Jan. 13, v. 6, no. 1dDe Gruyterx1556-37587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1556-3758.16673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245009200174300001400266520216000280592002802440653002502468653002402493653002002517653002502537653003002562700002202592700002302614700002102637773008802658856009002746852000902836655001202845IND60127198620221119201015.0151110e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012719862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00005.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeinig, Cynthia10aAntagonistic multilevel selection on size and architecture in variable density settings  ap. 58-67.  aIn some ecological settings, an individual's fitness depends on both its own phenotype (individual-level selection) as well as the phenotype of the individuals with which it interacts (group-level selection). Using contextual analysis to measure multilevel selection in experimental stands of Arabidopsis thaliana, we detected significant linear selection that reversed across individual versus group levels for two composite phenotypic traits, ““size”” and ““elongation.”” In both cases, selection at the individual level acted to increase values of these traits, presumably due to their positive effect on resource acquisition. Group selection favored decreased values of the same traits. Nonlinear selection was weak but significant in several cases, including stabilizing selection on developmental rate; individuals with very rapid development likely had lower than average fitness due to their reduced resource level at reproduction, while very delayed reproduction may have resulted in lower fitness if prolonged competition for resources reduced overall environmental quality and fitness of all individuals in a group. Under this scenario, stabilizing selection on individual traits is evidence of selection at the group level. Significant density-dependent selection suggests that a threshold density must be reached before group selection acts. Below this threshold, selection at the individual level affects phenotypic evolution more strongly than group selection. A second experiment measured multilevel selection in progeny stands of the original experimental plants. Multilevel selection again acted antagonistically on a composite trait that included size and elongation as well as on an architectural trait, branch production. The magnitude of individual versus group selection was relatively similar in the progeny generation, and the observed balance of individual versus group selection across densities is generally consistent with the hypotheses that multilevel selection can contribute to phenotypic evolution and to important demographic phenomena, including soft selection and the ““law of constant yield.””  aPublisher supplied data 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0acontextual analysis 0agroup selection 0amultilevel selection 0ashade-avoidance responses1 aJohnston, Jill A.1 aWillis, Charles G.1 aMaloof, Julin N.0 tEvolution.g2007 Jan., v. 61, no. 1 p.58-67dBlackwell Science Incx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1558-5646.2007.00005.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014300163300001600306520134000322592002801662650003201690650002501722650002001747650002001767650002101787650002001808650001801828650001601846650001801862650002001880650001401900650002401914650001001938650002901948650003601977650002702013650003302040653003202073653002802105653002402133653001802157653004102175700001502216700001902231700001602250700001402266700001902280773010702299856008502406852000902491655001202500IND60629179120221116165130.0190403e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062917912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.01.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Zhi10aClassical swine fever virus non-structural proteins modulate Toll-like receptor signaling pathways in porcine monocyte-derived macrophages  ap. 101-109.  aToll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial activators of the innate immune response that play various roles in viral infection. Studies have confirmed that classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infection has significant effects on the expression of immune effectors participating in TLR signaling pathways; however, the involvement of CSFV-encoded proteins in TLR signaling pathways remains unclear. In this study, lentiviral individually expressing CSFV non-structural proteins (NSPs) were constructed to identify the “key proteins” that affect TLR gene expression and to analyze the impacts of these proteins on factors downstream of the TLR signaling pathways. The results indicated that Npro, NS2, NS3, NS3/4A, NS4B and NS5A all failed to induce the activation of NF-κB p65. Furthermore, NS4B was found to inhibit poly (I:C) stimulation-mediated activation of the TLR3 signaling pathway in porcine monocyte-derived macrophages (pMDMs), thereby suppressing the TRIF mRNA transcription, the IRF3 protein translation and the NF-κB p65 phosphorylation, and ultimately affecting the secretion of IL-6 and IFN-β; CSFV NS5A protein could significantly increase the activation of MyD88 and IRF7 as well as the consequent synthesis of IFN-α in pMDMs. The results suggest that CSFV NSPs affect TLR-mediated innate immune responses in pMDMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClassical swine fever virus 3aToll-like receptor 3 3agene expression 3ainnate immunity 3ainterferon-alpha 3ainterferon-beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3aphosphorylation 3asecretion 3asignal transduction 3aswine 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atranslation (genetics) 3aviral nonstructural proteins 0aClassical swine fever virus 0aNon-structural proteins 0aToll-like receptors 0aInnate immune 0aPorcine monocyte-derived macrophages1 aYang, Qian1 aZheng, Minping1 aLv, Huifang1 aKang, Kai1 aZhang, Yanming0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2019 Mar., v. 230 p.101-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.01.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005300140245012700193500002000320520168600340592002802026596011102054650002502165650002102190650002502211650001702236650001802253650001202271650001502283650001102298650001602309650002902325650003302354650001602387650001602403700005702419700001702476700001302493700001502506700001802521773014202539856007502681852000902756655001202765IND60777308920221121222851.0220516e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077730892DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.166022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6168-657410aEthanol/ammonium sulfate ultrasonic‐assisted liquid–liquid extraction of flavonoids from Tibetan Sea‐buckthorn fruit  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn ultrasonic‐assisted liquid–liquid extraction based on the aqueous two‐phase system (ATPS) was applied for the first time in this study for the extraction of flavonoids from Tibetan sea‐buckthorn (Hippophae thibetana S) fruit. The response surface method provided the optimum values of several experimental variables. The best extraction yield of 8.30 ± 0.03% was obtained for two cycles of extraction, using an ultrasound bath temperature of 50°C and liquid–solid ratio 99:1. The antioxidant capacity of the extract was assessed by the in vitro DPPH and ABTS assays, with the IC₅₀ values similar to or better than ascorbic acid (0.343 mg/ml and 0.164 mg/ml, respectively). This study revealed the great potential of ultrasound‐aided ATPS as the green alternative for the extraction of flavonoids from H. thibetana S. The high antioxidant activity of the extract indicates its applicability as a natural functional ingredient for food and other industries. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In this study, ethanol and ammonium sulfate were selected as extraction and separation solvents to optimize the extraction process of flavonoids from sea buckthorn fruits, which is simpler and more environmentally friendly than the traditional method, while reducing the process cost, and has great application value. In addition, the analysis of the extracted components of edible sea buckthorn fruits revealed that the flavonoids contained in sea buckthorn fruits have antioxidant activity close to that of vitamin C. Combined with the above studies, sea buckthorn fruits have the potential to be developed into functional foods and additives with antioxidant functions.  aPublisher supplied data  cFood Science and Engineering Subject Construction Project by Tibet Agriculture Animal Husbandry University 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3aammonium sulfate 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3aethanol 3aflavonoids 3afruits 3aingredients 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3aultrasonics1 aZhang, Tianyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9432-14671 aXing, Jinjin1 aXue, Bei1 aLuo, Zhang1 aLiu, Zhendong0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2022 May, v. 46, no. 5 p.e16602-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.166023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148242050300169245010900672300001800781500001900799520119300818592002802011650001302039650001602052650002102068650002702089650001802116650001402134650001802148700002002166700001802186773012802204856008202332852000902414655001202423IND60717728120221119094406.0201116e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071772812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-020-02246-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDekker, Joris M.10aEcoulement des eaux souterraines sous des fouilles de chantier et érosion de couches horizontales provisoires d’injection de ciment silicaté Flujo de agua subterránea debajo de excavaciones para la construcción y erosión de capas horizontales temporarias de inyección de silicato 基坑地下水的流动和硅酸盐灌浆材料形成的临时水平层的侵蚀作用 Fluxo de água subterrânea sob cavas de construção e erosão de camadas horizontais temporárias de rejunte de silicato10aGroundwater flow below construction pits and erosion of temporary horizontal layers of silicate grouting  ap. 2821-2832.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInjection of silicate grouting materials is widely used to create temporary horizontal layers for reducing inflow of groundwater at construction sites, in regions with shallow water tables. The erosion of a grouting layer was investigated by means of analytical solutions for groundwater flow and transport within a pit after construction finished. Erosion is assumed to occur by dissolution of the temporary injection layer and subsequent advective transport. Thereby, the hydraulic conductivity changes with time. This paper presents novel analytical solutions and approximate solutions for the major fluxes in the construction pit as a function of the domain settings, aquifer gradient and hydraulic conductivity. In addition, the mass flux and the dilution ratio of erosion-related components leaving the construction pit and entering the aquifer are quantified. Derived solutions are verified against numerical simulations. A sensitivity study shows the impact of domain settings on fluxes and dilution ratio. The results confirm that mass flux of grout components increases with ongoing erosion. Thus, its effect on groundwater quality increases with time after construction ceased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amass transfer 3asilicates 3awater quality1 aSweijen, Thomas1 aZech, Alraune0 tHydrogeology journal.g2020 Dec., v. 28, no. 8 p.2821-2832dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-020-02246-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015900169300001600328520129500344592002801639650001201667650002501679650001701704650002301721650002201744650001501766650001701781650001501798650002201813650002701835650001401862650000901876650002801885650001801913650001301931651001401944700001701958700002001975700002001995700001802015700002502033700002102058773009502079856008502174852000902259655001202268IND60084365720221119154624.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008436572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2011.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, Jae-Young10aPolicy adoption of ecosystem services for a sustainable community: A case study of wetland assimilation using natural wetlands in Breaux Bridge, Louisiana  ap. 114-118.  aAcademicians and government officials have advocated incorporating ecosystem services into environmental policy-making processes. The State of Louisiana has adopted policy guidelines for using natural wetlands to assimilate nutrients in secondarily treated municipal effluent, thus utilizing ecosystem services of natural wetlands. We describe a case study for the city of Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, to discuss policy guidelines and assess ecological and financial benefits of this approach. In addition to water quality improvement, wetland assimilation provides additional ecosystem services, including increased vegetative productivity, surface accretion, and carbon sequestration. Financially, using wetland assimilation at Breaux Bridge generated an economic savings of $1.8 million in capital costs and annual savings of $72,116 for operation and maintenance costs, resulting in nearly $3 million savings over the lifetime of the project, due to its low capital expenditures and high energy efficiency, compared with a sand filtration method. When considering rapidly depleting non-renewable resources (e.g., fossil fuels) and challenging financial situations of small communities across the nation, wetland assimilation can be an important factor in designing sustainable communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acarbon sequestration 3acase studies 3aecosystem services 3aenergy efficiency 3afiltration 3afossil fuels 3aguidelines 3aissues and policy 3anonrenewable resources 3anutrients 3asand 3asustainable communities 3awater quality 3awetlands 3aLouisiana1 aDay, John W.1 aLane, Robert L.1 aHunter, Rachael1 aSabins, Dugan1 aPintado, Kristine L.1 aFranklin, Jeremy0 tEcological engineering.g2012 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.114-118dElsevier B.V.x0925-85747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2011.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245012000187300001800307520091400325592002801239650001301267650001201280650001201292650001301304650001101317650001301328650001101341650002801352650000901380650000901389650001401398650001101412650001301423650001501436650001301451650000901464650001201473650006701485650005201552650002401604650002901628650004201657651002101699651001501720651001601735700001801751700002701769700002201796700002501818700002201843773009901865856008401964852000902048655001202057IND60086640620221119124622.0141102e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008664062DNAL7 a217641932pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2011.06.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJerez, Silvia10aConcentration of trace elements in feathers of three Antarctic penguins: Geographical and interspecific differences  ap. 2412-2419.  aAntarctica is often considered as one of the last pristine regions, but it could be affected by pollution at global and local scale.

The present study investigated, from the perspective of environmental sustainability, Taiwanese university students’ purchase intentions and loyalty toward green products. A survey was administered to students in eight universities who had received 8 h of climate change education, generating a total of 1586 valid respondents. Results of structural equation modeling showed that individuals must have environmental ethics before they can become aware of their social and self-responsibility to the environment, which then increases their green product purchase intentions and consumer loyalty. This study identified the relationships between the environmental responsibility chain (environmental ethics, social responsibility, and self-responsibility), beliefs in climate change, purchase intention, and consumer loyalty toward green products. The effectiveness of adaptation strategies that reduce the psychological distance of climate change requires consideration of both temporal and spatial distances. Self-responsibility fully mediates the relationships between environmental ethics and purchase intentions and consumer loyalty, which demonstrates the importance of using more environmentally responsible strategies to promote pro-environmental behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acollege students 3aenvironmental protection 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aethics 3asocial responsibility 3astructural equation modeling 3asurveys 3auniversities 0aAdaptation strategy 0aEnvironmental responsibility chain 0aMediation effect 0aPartial least square method1 aYu, Tai-Kuei1 aZhao, Zhengmin,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Sept. 10, v. 161 p.390-402dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.05.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245007900170300001800249520121200267592002801479650002801507650001401535650001701549650001201566650001601578650001701594650004701611650000901658650001301667650002301680650001401703700006401717700006701781773013601848856008001984852000902064655001202073IND60609513720221123041432.0180823e20180730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060951372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b049632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInthavong, Walailuk10aPolymer Probe Diffusion in Globular Protein Gels and Aggregate Suspensions  ap. 8075-8081.  aTransport properties of macromolecules in dense aggregate suspensions and gels of proteins are important for usage of these biomaterials in areas such as pharmaceutics, food, and cosmetics. The mobility of polymers in protein gels has received some attention in the past, but the mobility in dense aggregate suspensions has not yet been investigated. In this study, self-diffusion of probe dextran chains was studied in suspensions of aggregates with different size and morphology and in gels using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching over a wide range of concentrations. Brownian diffusion of the probes was observed in aggregate suspensions as well as in weak gels formed just beyond the critical gel concentration. Diffusion of polymers in dense suspensions of protein aggregates depends not only on the concentration but also on the size and morphology of the aggregates. It is not directly related to the viscosity or the dynamic correlation length. Diffusion of polymers in protein gels is anomalous and occurs on logarithmic time scales. The recovery of the fluorescence for densely cross-linked gels was logarithmic with time, suggesting an exponential distribution of diffusion coefficients.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3acosmetics 3acrosslinking 3adextran 3adiffusivity 3afluorescence 3afluorescence recovery after photobleaching 3agels 3apolymers 3aprotein aggregates 3aviscosity1 aNicolai, T.q(Taco),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7206-19751 aChassenieux, Christophe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3859-82770 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 July 30, v. 122, no. 33 p.8075-8081dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b049633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010700171300001800278500002000296500001900316500000900335520137800344592002801722596005601750596009401806650001501900650001701915650001101932650001201943650001401955650002401969650002301993650001402016650001602030650001402046650001702060650001502077650002502092650002402117700001902141700003202160700002202192773013402214856008402348961001302432852000902445655001202454IND60665143420221117230533.0220805e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066514342DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2017.02.00782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArbizu, Carlos I.10aPhylogenetic Prediction of Alternaria Leaf Blight Resistance in Wild and Cultivated Species of Carrots  ap. 2645-2653.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aPlant scientists make inferences and predictions from phylogenetic trees to solve scientific problems. Crop losses due to disease damage is an important problem that many plant breeders would like to solve, so the ability to predict traits like disease resistance from phylogenetic trees derived from diverse germplasm would be a significant approach to facilitate cultivar improvement. Alternaria leaf blight (ALB) is among the most devastating diseases of carrots (Daucus spp., Apiaceae) worldwide. Thus, new approaches to identify resistant germplasm to this disease are needed. In a study of 106 accessions of wild and cultivated Daucus and related genera, we determined plant height is the best explanatory variable to predict ALB resistance using a phylogenetic linear regression model. Using the estimated area under the disease progress curve, the most resistant species to ALB were the non‐carrot relative Ammi visnaga (L.) Lam. and the wild carrot relative D. crinitus Desf. A permutation tail probability test was conducted considering phylogenetic signal to evaluate the strength of association between the Daucus phylogeny and ALB resistance. We found that species belonging to clade A, which includes carrots and other Daucus possessing 2n = 18, 20, or 22 chromosomes, are slightly more resistant to ALB than members of other clades of the Daucus phylogeny.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Council of Science and Technology of Perú  a2011‐51300‐30903cUSDA‐NIFA‐Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative 3aAlternaria 3aAmmi visnaga 3aDaucus 3acarrots 3acultivars 3adisease progression 3adisease resistance 3agermplasm 3aleaf blight 3aphylogeny 3aplant height 3aprediction 3aprobability analysis 3aregression analysis1 aTas, Pamela M.1 aSimon, P.

The metabonomics study on the hot syndrome may provide insight into understanding of its pathology and play a role in the prevention and treatment of its related diseases. In this paper, the rats were dosed with the hot syndrome prescription, ginseng and water. The corresponding urine samples were identified by rapid resolution liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. More than 1,000 metabolic compounds from different urine samples could be further differentiated by principal component analysis. As a result, the rat body temperature and weight were recognized as the hot syndrome related factors. Some specific metabolites have been discovered as a pattern of the potential biomarkers for the hot syndrome. The results showed that ginseng cannot cause the hot syndrome in a reasonable dose, but the hot syndrome prescription can. It is suggested that ginseng cannot be used only as a tradition Chinese medicine but also as a nutrient. The work showed metabonomics method is a valuable tool in studying mechanism of the hot syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPanax 3abiomarkers 3abody temperature 3ahuman health 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aprincipal component analysis 3arats 3arisk 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine1 aMa, Li1 aSun, Yi1 aYang, Liman1 aYue, Hao1 aLiu, Shuying0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2014 July, v. 37, no. 7 p.899-906dSpringer-Verlagx0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-013-0250-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245011400153300001800267520167800285592002801963650001101991650001702002650002302019650001902042650001902061650002402080650001902104650001302123650003702136650001002173650001102183650002502194650001202219650001002231650001002241650001602251650001902267653004002286653001802326653003802344700001802382700002702400773011602427856007102543852000902614655001202623IND60639228120221120063548.0190501s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063922812DNAL7 a10.1071/AN174642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDakhlan, A.10aGenotype × birth type or rearing-type interactions for growth and ultrasound scanning traits in Merino sheep  ap. 1016-1021.  aThis study explores the interaction between genetic potential for growth in Merino lambs and their birth type (BT) or rearing type (RT). Data on birthweight (BWT), weaning weight (WWT), post-weaning weight (PWWT), scan fat (PFAT) and eye muscle depth (PEMD) were used from 3920 single and 4492 twin-born lambs from 285 sires and 5279 dams. Univariate analysis showed a significant sire × BT interaction accounting for 1.59% and 2.49% of the phenotypic variation for BWT and WWT, respectively, and no significant effect for PWWT, PFAT and PEMD. Sire × RT interaction effects were much smaller and only significant for PEMD. Bivariate analysis indicated that the genetic correlation (rg) between trait expression in lambs born and reared as singles versus those born and reared as twins were high for BWT, WWT, PWWT (0.91 ± 0.02 – 0.96 ± 0.01), whereas rg for PFAT and PEMD were lower (0.81 ± 0.03 and 0.86 ± 0.02). The rg between traits expressed in lambs born and reared as singles versus those born as twins but reared as singles were lower: 0.77 ± 0.08, 0.88 ± 0.03, 0.66 ± 0.06 and 0.61 ± 0.08 for WWT, PWWT, PFAT and PEMD, respectively. A different RT only affected the expression of breeding values for PFAT and PEMD (rg 0.62 ± 0.04 and 0.47 ± 0.03, respectively). This study showed genotype × environment interaction for BWT and WWT (sire × BT interaction) and for PEMD (sire by RT interaction). However, sires’ breeding value of a model that accounts for sire × BT interaction provides a very similar ranking of sires compared with a model that ignores it, implying that there is no need to correct for the effect in models for genetic evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerino 3abirth weight 3abivariate analysis 3abreeding value 3adams (mothers) 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic traits 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3alambs 3amodels 3aphenotypic variation 3arearing 3asires 3atwins 3aultrasonics 3aweaning weight 0agenotype × environment interaction 0agrowth traits 0aunivariate and bivariate analysis1 aMoghaddar, N.1 avan der Werf, J.

Here, we report a mathematical model to predict experimental SERS signal (or hotspot) intensity distributions of target molecules on receptor-functionalized nanopillar substrates for biomolecular quantification. We demonstrate that by utilizing only a small set of empirically determined parameters, our general theoretical framework agrees with the experimental data particularly well in the picomolar concentration regimes. This developed model may be generally used for biomolecular quantification using Raman mapping on SERS substrates with planar geometries, in which the hotspots are approximated as electromagnetic enhancement fields generated by closely spaced dimers. Lastly, we also show that the detection limit of a specific target molecule, TAMRA-labeled vasopressin, approaches the single molecule level, thus opening up an exciting new chapter in the field of SERS quantification.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRaman spectroscopy 3adetection limit 3ageometry 3amathematical models 3avasopressin1 aBosco, Filippo G.1 aYang, Jaeyoung1 aRindzevicius, Tomas1 aAlstrom, Tommy S.1 aSchmidt, Michael S.1 aLin, Qiao1 aJu, Jingyue1 aBoisen, Anja0 tRSC advances.g2015 Oct. 09, v. 5, no. 104 p.85845-85853dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra16108h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03739naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003000142245007000172300001400242520200400256592002802260650001302288650000902301650001302310650001202323650001202335650001402347650001402361650001602375650001602391650001602407650001402423650002602437650001502463650001302478650001102491650001502502650001302517650002002530650001502550651001502565653001502580653001702595653001302612653002102625653002402646653001502670700002802685700002702713700002502740700003002765700002602795700002202821773020902843856007603052852000903128655001203137IND60646446020221120080854.0190611e20190328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064644602DNAL7 a10.15553/c2019v741a82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabarimanarivo, Marina N.14aThe extraordinary botanical diversity of inselbergs in Madagascar  ap. 65-84.  aRabarimanarivo, M.N., B.

Candollea 74: 65–83. In English, English and French abstracts. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15553/c2019v741a8 Inselbergs are isolated mountains, mainly granitic or gneissic rock outcrops rising abruptly above surrounding plains. Malagasy inselbergs are often dome-shaped and occur in varying degrees of isolation, but they sometimes form inselberg landscapes, which comprise dozens of individual outcrops. Despite being typical landscape features on Madagascar's high plateau, little data are available on their detailed plant cover. Recent extensive fieldwork, which was conducted between 2010 and 2014, mainly on the central plateau, has resulted in a better knowledge about the floristic composition and habitats of Malagasy inselbergs. The most speciose vascular plant genera were Cynorkis Thouars (18), Cyperus L. (15) and Euphorbia L. (14). Malagasy inselbergs are centres of diversity for succulents (notably species of the genera Aloe L., Euphorbia and Kalanchoe Adans.), carnivorous plants (species of Drosera L. and Utricularia L.) and resurrection plants (notably species of Xerophyta Juss.). The most speciose habitat types were ephemeral flush vegetation and monocotyledonous mats. The latter habitat supports a large number of succulents and resurrection plants. In total 724 taxa out of 338 genera and 107 families have been recorded. Moreover, the variability in floristic composition between different regions is remarkable. Detrimental human impacts include quarrying, grazing, fire and the collection of plants for ornamental purposes (species of Pachypodium Lindl. and Orchidaceae) and as medicine (species of Aloe, Drosera madagascariensis DC., Myrothamnus moschatus (Baill.) Baill.). For the first time, recommendations are made for the conservation of Malagasy inselbergs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrostis 3aAloe 3aCynorkis 3aCyperus 3aDrosera 3aEuphorbia 3aKalanchoe 3aMyrothamnus 3aPachypodium 3aUtricularia 3aXerophyta 3abotanical composition 3acarnivores 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3amedicine 3avascular plants 3avegetation 3aMadagascar 0aInselbergs 0aConservation 0aEndemics 0aMedicinal plants 0aResurrection plants 0aSucculents1 aRamandimbisoa, Brigitte1 aRakotoarivelo, Nivo H.1 aPhillipson, Peter B.1 aAndriambololonera, Sylvie1 aCallmander, Martin W.1 aPorembski, Stefan0 tCandollea.g2019 Mar. 28, v. 74, no. 1 p.65-84dLes conservatoire et jardin botaniques de la Ville de Genève (The Conservatory and Botanical Gardens of the City of Geneva)wJournal:17162x0373-29677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.15553/c2019v741a83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013700166300001600303520119900319592002801518650002301546650001701569650001601586650001001602650004301612650001801655650002101673650001301694650001601707700001801723700002001741700001801761700001901779700001701798700001901815773010501834856008101939852000902020655001202029IND60079981920221122224553.0150216e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6007998192DNAL7 a10.1007/s12272-013-0307-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNugroho, Agung10aSimultaneous analysis and peroxynitrite-scavenging activity of galloylated flavonoid glycosides and ellagic acid in Euphorbia supina  ap. 890-898.  aThe herbs of Euphorbia supina (Euphorbiaceae) have been used to treat hemorrhage, chronic bronchitis, hepatitis, jaundice, diarrhea, gastritis, and hemorrhoids as a medicinal herb. This work is aimed to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the polyphenols with peroxynitrite-scavenging activities. The eight compounds: gallic acid, methyl gallate, avicularin, astragalin, juglanin, isoquercitrin 6″-gallate, astragalin 6″-gallate, and ellagic acid, were isolated from E. supina and used for HPLC analysis and peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻)-scavenging assay. Simultaneous analysis of the eight compounds was performed on MeOH extract and its fractions. The contents in MeOH extract and peroxynitrite-scavenging activities of the dimer of gallic acid, ellagic acid (15.64 mg/g; IC₅₀0.89 μM), and two galloylated flavonoid glycosides, astragalin 6″-gallate (13.72 mg/g; IC₅₀1.43 μM) and isoquercitrin 6″-gallate (16.99 mg/g; IC₅₀1.75 μM), were high, compared to other compounds.

To assist planners and decision-makers at various stages of development projects (planning, implementation, and evaluation), user-friendly tools are needed to assess the effectiveness of BMPs and LID practices. This study describes a simple tool, the Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment-LID (L-THIA-LID), which is enhanced with additional BMPs and LID practices, improved approaches to estimate hydrology and water quality, and representation of practices in series (meaning combined implementation). The tool was used to evaluate the performance of BMPs and LID practices individually and in series with 30 years of daily rainfall data in four types of idealized land use units and watersheds (low density residential, high density residential, industrial, and commercial). Simulation results were compared with the results of other published studies. The simulated results showed that reductions in runoff volume and pollutant loads after implementing BMPs and LID practices, both individually and in series, were comparable with the observed impacts of these practices. The L-THIA-LID 2.0 model is capable of assisting decision makers in evaluating environmental impacts of BMPs and LID practices, thereby improving the effectiveness of stormwater management decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abest management practices 3adevelopment projects 3adevelopmental stages 3aenvironmental impact 3ahydrologic models 3aland use 3ameteorological data 3aplanning 3apollution load 3aresidential density 3astormwater 3astormwater management 3aurban development 3awater quality 3awatersheds 0aBest management practices 0aLow impact development practices 0aModeling 0aRunoff 0aUrban areas1 aAhiablame, Laurent M.1 aBralts, Vincent F.1 aEngel, Bernard A.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 147 p.12-23dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001200166245007200178300001800250520168100268592002801949650002101977650001301998650002402011650002502035650001002060650001402070650002202084650002602106650003302132650000902165650002402174650001702198650001902215650001902234650001802253650002402271700001202295700001902307700001702326700001602343700001502359700002002374773013602394856008102530852000902611655001202620IND50090185120221118172458.0150215e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009018512DNAL7 a247058962pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-014-2844-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWenwen,10aEffect of tetraconazole application on the soil microbial community  ap. 8323-8332.  aTetraconazole is one of the most commonly used triazole fungicides in agricultural practice, and its continuous application poses a potential risk for non-target soil microorganisms. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of tetraconazole at the field rate (T1, 0.33 mgkg⁻¹of soil), three times the field rate (T3, 1.00 mgkg⁻¹of soil) and 10 times the field rate (T10, 3.33 mgkg⁻¹of soil) on the soil microorganisms. To ascertain this effect, the tetraconazole concentration and the microbial properties with potential as bioindicators of soil health (i.e. microbial biomass C, basal respiration, substrate-induced respiration, structure diversity and functional community profiling) were determined. The results showed that the degradation half-lives of tetraconazole varied from 69 to 87 days, depending on the three application concentrations. The microbial biomass C, basal respiration and substrate-induced respiration were inhibited, but they tended to recover at the end of the incubation when tetraconazole was applied at the recommended field rate. The ratios of the gram-negative to gram-positive (GN to GP) bacteria decreased, and the fungi to bacteria ratio increased after a temporal decrease on the seventh day. A principal component analysis of the PLFAs showed that tetraconazole application significantly shifted the microbial community structure on day 7. Different functional community profiles were observed, depending on the tetraconazole application rates. It was concluded that tetraconazole application decreases the soil microbial biomass and activity and changes the structures of the soil microbial community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication rate 3abacteria 3acommunity structure 3afunctional diversity 3afungi 3ahalf life 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil quality 3asoil structure 3asoil treatment 3atetraconazole 3atriazole fungicides1 aXu, Jun1 aDong, Fengshou1 aLiu, Xingang1 aZhang, Ying1 aWu, Xiaohu1 aZheng, Yongquan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 July, v. 21, no. 13 p.8323-8332dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-2844-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02144naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010300158300002000261520092000281592002801201650001501229650001501244650002101259650001301280650002001293650002401313650001101337650002301348700001801371700001701389700001401406700001501420700001101435700001801446700001501464700001801479700001701497773012501514856007401639852000901713655001201722IND60669289720221116205937.0190920e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066928972DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra16110j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Yuejiang10aElectrical and optical polarization responses of composite films based on aligned carbon nanotubes  ap. 86811-86816.  aA simple and efficient approach for large-area preparation of horizontally-aligned carbon nanotube (CNT)–vanadium oxide (VOₓ) composite films is presented. The composite films were prepared by an extended blown-bubble film approach, in which spin coating of VOₓ and bubble-blowing of CNTs were combined. Results reveal that one-dimensional CNTs are well horizontally-aligned in the composite films, and the sheet resistance is significantly decreased after the CNTs have been composed with VOₓ. Particularly, both anisotropies of electrical and optical responses were experimentally observed in such composite films. Based on the experimental results, a model for elucidating the anisotropy of light absorption was theoretically derived.

Capelin spawning in deep‐water were 4.5–14 times more likely to be cannibals than those at the beach, probably due to the higher spatial overlap of spawners and conspecific eggs within this habitat relative to beaches. Males were 2.1–3.7 times more likely to be cannibals than females, but female cannibals had more eggs per stomach. Spawning fish were 1.6–1.9 times more likely to be cannibals than spent fish, but spent female cannibals had more eggs per stomach relative to spawning males and females in either habitat. Findings suggest that cannibalism may be an important foraging strategy, especially at deep‐water spawning habitat, possibly extending the spawning season for males or increasing the probability of post‐spawning survival for females. Although 44% of sampled females and 50% of males were cannibals, the estimated mortality due to egg cannibalism was low (0.49–2.97% of eggs produced annually), suggesting that egg cannibalism does not influence recruitment to a great extent in Newfoundland capelin.  aPublisher supplied data  a283212‐2007cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (CA) Discovery  a2014‐06290cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (CA) Discovery  a2012‐2014cUniversity of Manitoba Faculty of Science Fieldwork  a419835‐2012cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (CA) Ship Time  a436824‐2013cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (CA) Ship Time  a453216‐2014cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (CA) Ship Time 3aMallotus villosus 3acannibalism 3acoasts 3aconspecificity 3aeggs 3afemales 3afish 3ahabitats 3amortality 3aprobability 3astomach 3aAtlantic Ocean1 aDavoren, Gail K.0 tJournal of fish biology.g2018 Oct., v. 93, no. 4 p.641-648dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:13582x0022-11127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.137403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01597naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009600168300001400264520052600278592002800804650001500832650001900847650002700866650001800893650001600911653002100927653000800948653000900956653002400965700002500989700002301014773011701037856008401154852000901238655001201247IND60122298920221120035526.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012229892DNAL7 a10.1080/02772248.2014.9094302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiłosek, Ewa10aDirect and forced photodegradation of sodium dodecyl sulfate and tetraoctylammonium bromide  ap. 27-40.  aThe photostability of two surface active compounds, namely sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB), in model solutions and in the presence of surface water as natural matrix were investigated.

Such high temporal resolution is possible when each neuron in the ascending auditory pathway fires brief action potential at very accurate timing. Various pre- and postsynaptic machineries ensuring such high temporal precision of auditory synaptic transmission have been identified. Of particular, in this review, the role of K⁺ channels in shortening the duration of synaptic potentials will be discussed. First, the contribution of K⁺ channels to AP firing of general auditory neurons will be discussed. Then, the focus will be moved to the inner hair cell (IHC)-auditory afferent nerve fiber (ANF) synapses, the first synapses of ascending auditory pathway. Molecular and immunohistological techniques have revealed various K⁺ channels in the cell bodies and their processes of ANFs. Since the development of patch-clamp recordings from the ANF dendrites in 2002, it became possible to monitor the IHC-ANF synaptic transmission in greater detail. As revealed in brain auditory synapses, several different K⁺ channels appear to participate in reducing the duration of synaptic potentials at the IHC-ANF synapses. In addition, K⁺ channels at the ANF dendrites might act as potential targets of efferent feedback from the brain. The hypothesis is that, upon loud sound exposure, efferent neurotransmitters released onto the ANF dendrites activate certain K⁺ channels and prevent excitotoxicity of ANFs. Therefore, K⁺ channels of the ANF dendrites might provide potential sites of pharmacological actions to prevent noise-induced hearing loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaction potentials 3abrain 3adendrites 3aears 3ahearing disorders 3amammals 3aneurotransmitters 3apotassium channels 3asynaptic transmission 3atemporal variation1 aYi, Eunyoung0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2014 July, v. 37, no. 7 p.821-833dSpringer-Verlagx0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-014-0411-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009200175300001600267520129100283592002801574650001101602650001501613650001501628650001301643650001301656650001701669650001301686650001501699650001101714650001701725650002101742650001401763653000901777653001301786653002201799653000801821653002101829653002501850700002001875700001901895700001701914700001201931773012401943856008502067852000902152655001202161IND60686907920221120071638.0200517e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068690792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhammed, Golam Jalal10aRole of ethylene crosstalk in seed germination and early seedling development: A review  ap. 124-131.  aSeed germination and early seedling development are two critical phases in plant lifecycle that largely determine crop yield. Phytohormones play an essential role in governing these developmental processes; of these, ethylene (ET; C₂H₄), the smallest gaseous hormone, plays a major role via crosstalk with other hormones. Typically, the mechanism of hormone (for instance, auxin, cytokinins, ET, and gibberellins) action is determined by cellular context, revealing either synergistic or antagonistic relations. Significant progress has been made, so far, on unveiling ET crosstalk with other hormones and environmental signals, such as light. In particular, stimulatory and inhibitory effects of ET on hypocotyl growth in light and dark, respectively, and its interaction with other hormones provide an ideal model to study the growth-regulatory pathways. In this review, we aim at exploring the mechanisms of multifarious phenomena that occur via ET crosstalk during the germination of seeds (overcoming dormancy), and all through the development of seedlings. Understanding the remarkably complex mechanism of ET crosstalk that emerges from the interaction between hormones and other molecular players to modulate plant growth, remains a challenge in plant developmental biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aauxins 3acrop yield 3acytokinins 3adormancy 3aethylene 3agibberellins 3ahormones 3ahypocotyls 3amodels 3aplant growth 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 0aCOP1 0aEthylene 0aHormone crosstalk 0aHY5 0aSeed germination 0aSeedling development1 aGantait, Saikat1 aMitra, Monisha1 aYang, Youxin1 aLi, Xin0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2020 June, v. 151 p.124-131dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245006200206300001600268506007600284520134700360592002801707506003701735650001801772650001201790650001201802650001201814650001201826650001401838700001801852700002701870773011001897856004802007852000902055655001202064IND4484435120221207140902.0120821e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448443512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-012-0740-32doi7 aPMC41886352pmcid7 a227333662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchul, Johannes10aAuditory change detection by a single neuron in an insect  ap. 695-704.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe detection of novel signals in the auditory scene is an elementary task of any hearing system. In Neoconocephalus katydids, a primary auditory interneuron (TN-1) with broad spectral sensitivity, responded preferentially to rare deviant pulses (7 pulses/s repetition rate) embedded among common standard pulses (140 pulses/s repetition rate). Eliminating inhibitory input did not affect the detection of the deviant pulses. Detection thresholds for deviant pulses increased significantly with increasing amplitude of standard pulses. Responses to deviant pulses occurred when the carrier frequencies of deviant and standard were sufficiently different, both when the deviant had a higher or lower carrier frequency than the standard. Recordings from receptor neurons revealed that TN-1 responses to the deviant pulses did not depend on the population response strength of the receptors, but on the distribution of the receptor cell activity. TN-1 responses to the deviant pulse occurred only when the standard and deviant pulses were transmitted by different groups of receptor cells. TN-1 responses parallel stimulus specific adaptation (SSA) described in mammalian auditory system. The results support the hypothesis that the mechanisms underlying SSA and change-detection are located in the TN-1 dendrite, rather than the receptor cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTettigoniidae 3ahearing 3ainsects 3amammals 3aneurons 3areceptors1 aMayo, Anne M.1 aTriblehorn, Jeffrey D.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2012 Sept., v. 198, no. 9 p.695-704dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-012-0740-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03708naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245015600158300001800314520180800332592002802140650005802168650001102226650002502237650001602262650001102278650001202289650002402301650002502325650001802350650002102368650002402389650001602413650001002429650002902439650001202468650001502480650002502495650001502520650001002535650001202545650002302557650002002580650001902600650001602619650001302635651001002648653001102658653001102669653002902680653001602709653001902725653001502744700001602759700001802775700002402793700001602817700001702833773011602850856007102966852000903037655001203046IND60639228720221120063521.0190501s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063922872DNAL7 a10.1071/AN178092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNdung’u, P. W.10aImproved region-specific emission factors for enteric methane emissions from cattle in smallholder mixed crop: livestock systems of Nandi County, Kenya  ap. 1136-1146.  aNational greenhouse-gas (GHG) inventories in most developing countries, and in countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in particular, use default (Tier I) GHG emission factors (EFs) provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to estimate enteric methane (CH4) emissions from livestock. Because these EFs are based on data primarily from developed countries, there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with CH4 emission estimates from African livestock systems. Accurate Tier II GHG emission reporting from developing countries becomes particularly important following the Paris Climate agreement made at COP21, which encourages countries to mitigate GHG emissions from agricultural sources. In light of this, the present study provides improved enteric CH4 emission estimates for cattle in Nandi County, Western Kenya, representing a common livestock production system found in East Africa. Using the data from measurements of liveweight and liveweight change, milk production and locomotion collected from 1143 cattle in 127 households across 36 villages over three major agro-ecological zones covering a full year, we estimated total metabolic energy requirements. From this and assessments of digestibility from seasonally available feeds, we estimated feed intake and used this to calculate daily CH4 production by season, and, subsequently, created new EFs. Mean EFs were 50.6, 45.5, 28.5, 33.2 and 29.0 kg CH4/head.year for females (>2 years), males (>2 years), heifers (1–2 years), young males (1–2 years) and calves (<1 year) respectively, and were lower than the IPCC Tier I estimates for unspecified African adult cattle, but higher for calves and young males. Thus, using IPCC Tier 1 EFs may overestimate current enteric CH4 emissions in some African livestock systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aadults 3aagroecological zones 3abody weight 3acalves 3aclimate 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3adigestibility 3aemissions factor 3aenergy requirements 3afeed intake 3afeeds 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheifers 3ahouseholds 3alivestock production 3alocomotion 3amales 3amethane 3amethane production 3amilk production 3amixed cropping 3auncertainty 3avillages 3aKenya 0aAfrica 0acattle 0adry matter digestibility 0afeed basket 0agreenhouse gas 0aliveweight1 aBebe, B.

Biomass has been identified as one of the promising candidates given its availability in large quantities and renewable nature. Among the various feasible synthetic strategies, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) has been admired for its energy efficiency and ability to synthesize carbonaceous materials for use in a wide range of applications. In this review, the different types of biomass and strategies available for the synthesis of carbon-based materials are discussed. Furthermore, factors influencing the efficiency of each strategy are analyzed and evaluated. Subsequently, the utilization of carbonaceous materials in environmental, catalytic, electrical, and biological applications are reviewed to further demonstrate their functionalities across different fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aenergy efficiency 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3asynthesis 0aBiomass 0aPyrolysis carbonization 0aHydrothermal carbonization 0aIonothermal carbonization1 aLi, Zibiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0591-53281 aLiu, Minghuan1 aZhang, Xiaoyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5816-81781 aChen, Yisong1 aXue, Hun1 aYe, Enyi1 aLuque, Rafael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4190-19160 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Jan. 24, v. 7, no. 5 p.4564-4585dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b060303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245014700208300001600355506007600371520137800447592002801825506003701853650001401890650001601904650003101920650002501951650001501976650001601991650001202007650001002019650004302029650001902072650002302091650002002114650001602134650001902150650001702169650002202186650000902208650001702217650001102234650001702245653003202262653002302294653002902317653003502346653002902381700002802410700002202438700002802460700002902488773011002517856007902627852000902706655001202715IND60515083520221207144836.0160311e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051508352DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2012.26722doi7 aPMC37194802pmcid7 a238758992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalekinejad, Hassan10aComparative Protective Effect of Hawthorn Berry Hydroalcoholic Extract, Atorvastatin, and Mesalamine on Experimentally Induced Colitis in Rats  ap. 593-601.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe protective effect of hydroalcoholic extract of hawthorn berries (HBE) on acetic acid (AA)–induced colitis in rats was investigated. Forty-two Wistar rats were divided into seven groups, including control and test groups (n=6). The control animals received saline, and the test animals were treated with saline (sham group), mesalamine (50 mg/kg; M group), atorvastatin (20 mg/kg; A group), HBE (100 mg/kg; H group), mesalamine and HBE (HM group), or atorvastatin plus HBE (HA group), 3 days before and a week after colitis induction. Colitis was induced by administration of 1 mL AA (4%) via a polyethylene catheter intrarectally. High-performance liquid chromatography analyses showed that HBE contained 0.13% and 0.5% oleanolic acid and ursolic acid, respectively. Elevated myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxidation were attenuated in the HA group. The H and HM groups showed marked reductions in colitis-induced decreases in total thiol molecules and body weight. The histopathological studies revealed that HBE decreased colitis-induced edema and infiltration of neutrophils. Our data suggest the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of HBE and atorvastatin protect against AA-induced colitis. The anti-inflammatory effect of HBE may be attributable to its ability to decrease myeloperoxidase activity as a biomarker of neutrophil infiltration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCrataegus 3aacetic acid 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomarkers 3abody weight 3acolitis 3aedema 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahistopathology 3alipid peroxidation 3amyeloperoxidase 3aneutrophils 3aoleanolic acid 3apolyethylene 3aprotective effect 3arats 3asmall fruits 3athiols 3aursolic acid 0aacetic acid-induced colitis 0aantioxidant status 0ahawthorn berries extract 0ahistopathological examinations 0amyeloperoxidase activity1 aShafie-Irannejad, Vahid1 aHobbenaghi, Rahim1 aTabatabaie, Seyed Hamed1 aMoshtaghion, Seyed-Mehdi0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2013 July 01, v. 16, no. 7 p.593-601dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2012.26723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100001900163245010600182300001600288500001900304500000900323520140400332592002801736650001301764650000901777650001201786700001901798773012001817856009801937852000902035655001202044IND60665144220221117230601.0191122e196803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066514422DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1968.0011183X000800020017x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuclos, Leo A.10aComparative Performance of Top Crosses and S1 Progeny for Improving Populations of Corn (Zea mays L.)  ap. 191-194.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aForty-five introduced strains, two Northern U.S.A. single crosses, and their double cross were all crossed to form a synthetic variety which was randomly mated for three generations. Randomly chosen S0 plants were selfed and top crossed to a double cross tester. The top-yielding 11% of the S₁ lines based on S₁ performance and top-yielding 11% of the $₁ lines based on top cross performance were developed into two subsynthetics in which random mating was practiced for three more generations. In the following cycle, mean yields were significantly higher in the S₁. progeny from the synthetic based on S₁ progeny performance than from the synthetic based on top cross performance. Conversely, mean yields were significantly higher in the top crosses from the synthetic based on top cross performance than from the synthetic based on St line performance. The next generation of each sub-synthetic was progagated by intennating the top-yielding 21%, based on S₁ performance and top cross performance, respectively. Samples of seed were drawn from each generation of the subsynthetics and parent synthetic and tested at two locations. These tests indicated that a highly significant yield improvement was made with the first cycle of selection by both methods of evaluation, but there was no significant difference between the two methods. The second cycle of selection was not effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aprogeny1 aCrane, Paul L.0 tCrop science.g1968 Mar., v. 8, no. 2 p.191-194dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1968.0011183X000800020017x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245012400205300001800329520124900347592002801596650001601624650001101640650002001651650002101671650001501692650002301707650001201730650001801742650001401760650001101774650002801785650001501813653001801828653001401846653001501860653002301875653002001898700001601918700001201934700001901946700001201965773014301977856008502120852000902205655001202214IND60632381620221118044129.0190314e20190204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063238162DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b060402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5937-195210aElectroactive Au@Ag Nanoparticle Assembly Driven Signal Amplification for Ultrasensitive Chiral Recognition of d-/l-Trp  ap. 5157-5166.  aA novel ingenious and ultrasensitive chiral electrochemical transducer is proposed for tryptophan (Trp) isomer detection by using electroactive Au@Ag NPs as electrochemical tags. Moreover, the large binding constant of d-Trp on NPs and strong interaction between d-Trp and Cu²⁺ cause electroactive Au@Ag NP to assemble on the electrode, generating strong differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) signals from the oxidation of Ag⁰ to Ag⁺. In sharp contrast to d-Trp, l-Trp leads to the assembly of Au@Ag NP oligomers on the electrode, resulting in a weak DPV signal. The distinct DPV responses enable the developed electrochemical chiral transducer for the sensitive and accurate quantification of d-/l-Trp. The limit of detection (LOD) is 1.21 pM for d-Trp. This established electrochemical chiral sensor also achieves the specific determination of enantiomeric excess. In comparison to other reported approaches, this proposed electrochemical chiral sensor excels by its sensitivity, simplicity, and good availability of electroactive Au@Ag NP assemblies. Target-induced colorimetric assays can be converted into electrochemical assays for the dual signal amplification in the field of ultrasensitive enantioselective chiral discrimination.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolorimetry 3acopper 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenantioselectivity 3aisomers 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3asilver 3atransducers (equipment) 3atryptophan 0aElectroactive 0aAu@Ag NPs 0aAssemblies 0aChiral recognition 0aTrp enantiomers1 aCui, Linyan1 aKe, Wei1 aZheng, Fangjie1 aLi, Xiu0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Feb. 04, v. 7, no. 5 p.5157-5166dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b060403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01776naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245007100153300001600224520061000240592002800850650001200878650001100890650002000901650002400921650001500945650001500960650001000975650002000985650001301005650001501018650001901033650002101052700001501073700002001088700001401108700001701122700001201139773012201151856007201273852000901345655001201354IND60662239720221119114221.0190904e20050623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066223972DNAL7 a10.1039/b502192h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xingfa10aPreparation of water soluble poly(aniline) and its gas-sensitivity  ap. 507-513.  aWater soluble poly(aniline) was prepared using the chemical oxide method by adding a small amount of poly(sodium-p-styrenesulfonate).

It was easily recovered by high-purity N₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaniline 3acarbon 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3adesorption 3aelectrodes 3agases 3agreen chemistry 3anitrogen 3asulfonates 3atrimethylamine 3awater solubility1 aWang, Mang1 aChen, Hongzheng1 aLi, Guang1 aSun, Jingzhi1 aBai, Ru0 tGreen chemistry.g2005 June 23, v. 7, no. 7 p.507-513dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b502192h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245017200167300001600339520128500355592002801640650001201668650002201680650002001702650001901722650001201741650000901753650001401762650001001776651001801786653001201804653004001816653001101856653001401867653001301881700002801894700002101922700002101943700001801964700002201982700001902004700002502023700002302048700002202071700002302093700002302116700001802139700001902157700002902176700002302205700001902228773014402247856008202391852000902473655001202482IND60594737620221119153213.0180904e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059473762DNAL7 a10.2994/SAJH-D-17-00113.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, Aaron M.14aThe Tiny Skull of the Peruvian Gecko Pseudogonatodes barbouri (Gekkota: Sphaerodactylidae) Obtained via a Divide-And-Conquer Approach to Morphological Data Acquisition  ap. 102-116.  aThe Peruvian sphaerodactyl gecko, Pseudogonatodes barbouri, is among the smallest reptile species in South America. Morphological information about this species, or even the genus, is limited. In this study, we produced a bone-by-bone description from the skull and atlantoaxial complex to contribute new phenotypic information about this poorly known lizard. To achieve this objective, we employed a divide-and-conquer approach in which each author digitally isolated one or two bones from the skull and produced a written description of these elements, thereby reducing 3D imaging processing and description to a fraction of time. In addition to a reduced phalanx in the fourth toe of both the hand and foot, the genus is characterized by having nasal bones with a broad lateral wing, an ectopterygoid that clasps the pterygoid, and an anterior shifting of the paroccipital process and as consequence the position of the quadrate, and squamosal not participating in the quadrate suspension. There are also modifications in fenestration and foramina and a trend towards synostosis of the jaw bones (e.g., coronoid + splenial, compound bone + surangular). Pseudogonatodes bears four long processes on the intercentrum of the axis; which is a character of New World sphaerodactyls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGekkota 3aanimal morphology 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3alizards 3anose 3aphenotype 3askull 3aSouth America 0aCT scan 0aHigh-resolution computer tomography 0aLizard 0aOsteology 0aSquamata1 aBeach-Mehrotra, Mallika1 aBermudez, Yarima1 aClark, Geneva E.1 aDaza, Juan D.1 aGlynne, Elizabeth1 aHagyari, David1 aHarnden, Jennifer M.1 aHolovacs, Nicholas1 aKanasiro, André,1 aLofthus, Amanda J.1 aPierce, Zachary W.1 aAaliyah, Ryan1 aSyed, Samreena1 aVallejo-Pareja, Maria C.1 aWalker, Bethany A.1 aWillett, James0 tSouth american journal of herpetology.g2018 Apr., v. 13, no. 1 p.102-116dBrazilian Society of HerpetologywJournal:19723x1808-97987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2994/SAJH-D-17-00113.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002800158245019100186300001600377520187400393592002802267650000902295650001002304650001502314650001502329650001502344650001102359650001602370650001102386700002202397700001602419773015402435856007302589852000902662655001202671IND60082268520221118035723.0141017e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008226852DNAL7 a252126992pmid7 a10.1111/vec.122312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiguère, S.q(Steeve),10aAccuracy of calculated arterial saturation in oxygen in neonatal foals and effects of monitor, sensor, site of sensor placement, and degree of hypoxemia on the accuracy of pulse oximetry  ap. 529-535.  aOBJECTIVES: To (1) assess the agreement between calculated values for arterial hemoglobin saturation of oxygen (SaO₂) and values obtained by co‐oximetry, (2) assess the accuracy of 2 pulse oximetry monitors for measurement of SaO₂ in foals, and for each monitor, and (3) determine the optimal combination of sensor type and site of sensor placement for SaO₂ monitoring. DESIGN: Prospective experimental study. SETTING: University teaching hospital. ANIMALS: Six neonatal foals. INTERVENTIONS: Foals were anesthetized with isoflurane and SaO₂ was manipulated by varying the inspired fraction of oxygen. SaO₂ was calculated from oxygen tension or measured by pulse oximetry using 2 monitors equipped with transmission or reflectance sensors attached to the foal's tongue, lip, ear, or inserted rectally (reflectance sensor only). SaO₂ values measured by co‐oximetry were used as the gold standard to calculate bias. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean (±SD) SaO₂ determined by co‐oximetry was 65.2% ± 11.8%, 85.4% ± 2.5%, and 97.2% ± 0.4% at the low, intermediate, and high SaO₂ level, respectively. Sensors attached to the ear failed to provide SaO₂ readings for most attempts. Reflectance sensors placed on the lip or rectally gave significantly larger biases at low SaO₂ (−17.0% and −23.6%, respectively) than at higher levels. Bias of all other combinations of monitors, sensors, and sites (−1.8 to −4.1%) was not significantly influenced by the level of SaO₂ or different from each other. The bias of calculated saturation was similar to that of pulse oximetry. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission sensors placed on the lip or tongue or reflectance sensors placed on the tongue give the most accurate assessment of SaO₂ in anesthetized neonatal foals. Calculated saturation is not more accurate than pulse oximetry to estimate SaO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aears 3afoals 3ahemoglobin 3aisoflurane 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3areflectance 3atongue1 aSanchez, L.

C1106-C1116.  aIn Korean rice wine (makgeolli) model, we tried to develop a prediction model capable of eliciting a quantitative relationship between initial amino acids in makgeolli mash and major aromatic compounds, such as fusel alcohols, their acetate esters, and ethyl esters of fatty acids, in makgeolli brewed. Mass‐spectrometry‐based electronic nose (MS‐EN) was used to qualitatively discriminate between makgeollis made from makgeolli mashes with different amino acid compositions. Following this measurement, headspace solid‐phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry (GC‐MS) combined with partial least‐squares regression (PLSR) method was employed to quantitatively correlate amino acid composition of makgeolli mash with major aromatic compounds evolved during makgeolli fermentation. In qualitative prediction with MS‐EN analysis, the makgeollis were well discriminated according to the volatile compounds derived from amino acids of makgeolli mash. Twenty‐seven ion fragments with mass‐to‐charge ratio (m/z) of 55 to 98 amu were responsible for the discrimination. In GC‐MS combined with PLSR method, a quantitative approach between the initial amino acids of makgeolli mash and the fusel compounds of makgeolli demonstrated that coefficient of determination (R²) of most of the fusel compounds ranged from 0.77 to 0.94 in good correlation, except for 2‐phenylethanol (R² = 0.21), whereas R² for ethyl esters of MCFAs including ethyl caproate, ethyl caprylate, and ethyl caprate was 0.17 to 0.40 in poor correlation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aalcohols 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acids 3aaromatic compounds 3aelectronic nose 3afermentation 3agas chromatography 3ahexanoic acid 3amash 3amass spectrometry 3amicroextraction 3amodels 3aprediction 3arice wines 3avolatile compounds1 aLee, Jang‐Eun1 aPark, Hyun‐Jin0 tJournal of food science.g2014 June, v. 79, no. 6 p.C1106-C1116dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.12489  aDNAL 7aarticle03673naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245016400155300001800319520159300337592002801930650002201958650002301980650001902003650002002022650002402042650002102066650001202087650001902099650001202118650001502130650000902145650002202154650002102176650001102197650001202208650001202220650002902232650001002261650002202271650001402293650001202307650002302319650000902342650002102351650002002372650001302392650001602405650001302421651001602434653001102450653002402461653002102485653002002506653001902526653001302545700001902558700001802577700001702595700001902612700002302631700002202654700001702676700001902693700001902712773011602731856007102847852000902918655001202927IND60639228920221120063506.0190501s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063922892DNAL7 a10.1071/AN180192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJonker, Arjan10aMethane and carbon dioxide emissions from lactating dairy cows grazing mature ryegrass/white clover or a diverse pasture comprising ryegrass, legumes and herbs  ap. 1063-1069.  aThere is a growing interest in forage mixtures (Diverse pasture; e.g. containing grasses, legumes and herbs), especially those with a greater tolerance of dry conditions and a decreased nitrogen (N) content (reducing N losses), compared with ryegrass (Lolium perenne L and Lolium multiflorum L)/white clover (Trifolium repens L) pastures (RyeWC), which dominate New Zealand pastoral systems for dairy production. However, the effect of alternative forages on enteric methane (CH4) emissions is not known. The objective of the present trial was to compare CH4 emissions and milk production from dairy cows grazing either mature RyeWC or mature Diverse pasture (both approximately with pasture mass of 5600 kg DM/ha). The Diverse mixture comprised ryegrass, white clover, lucerne (Medicago sativa L), chicory (Cichorium intybus L) and plantain (Plantago lanceolata L). Milk production, measured from cows commencing at ~162 days of lactation, was less when cows grazed RyeWC than Diverse pastures (15.4 vs 16.7 kg/day; P < 0.001), whereas CH4 production (g/day) was similar for the respective treatments (411 g/day; P = 0.16). Milk composition was not affected by diet and CH4 intensity was similar for both diets (22 g/kg fat- and protein-corrected milk; P = 0.31). Methane yield [g/kg predicted dry matter intake (DMI)] averaged 22.6 and 24.9 for cows grazing RyeWC and Diverse pastures, respectively (P = 0.006). In conclusion, although the CH4 yield was greater when Diverse pasture was grazed, relative to RyeWC, there were no differences in emissions intensity or total CH4 emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCichorium intybus 3aLolium multiflorum 3aLolium perenne 3aMedicago sativa 3aPlantago lanceolata 3aTrifolium repens 3aalfalfa 3acarbon dioxide 3achicory 3adairy cows 3adiet 3adry matter intake 3aemissions factor 3aforage 3agrasses 3agrazing 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aherbs 3alactating females 3alactation 3amethane 3amethane production 3amilk 3amilk composition 3amilk production 3anitrogen 3apastoralism 3apastures 3aNew Zealand 0acattle 0acircadian emissions 0aC-Lock GreenFeed 0aenteric methane 0amature pasture 0aplantain1 aFarrell, Lydia1 aScobie, David1 aDynes, Robyn1 aEdwards, Grant1 aHague, H.q(Helen)1 aMcAuliffe, Russel1 aTaylor, Anna1 aKnight, Trevor1 aWaghorn, Garry0 tAnimal production science.g2019, v. 59, no. 6 p.1063-1069dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl37620x1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN180193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001800135245013900153300001500292520116000307592002801467650001501495650003001510650001501540650001701555650001501572650001901587650002201606650001601628650001701644650001301661650001901674650001301693650002101706650001301727650001501740650001301755650001301768650001201781700001801793700002101811700001901832700001501851700002401866700002401890773015201914856006902066856010002135990002302235852000902258655001202267IND60646446420221120081323.0190611e20190609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064644642DNAL7 a10.3791/595512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaruyama, Ami10aExtraction of aqueous metabolites from cultured adherent cells for metabolomic analysis by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry  ap. e59551.  aMetabolomic analysis is a promising omics approach to not only understand the specific metabolic regulation in cancer cells compared to normal cells but also to identify biomarkers for early-stage cancer detection and prediction of chemotherapy response in cancer patients. Preparation of uniform samples for metabolomic analysis is a critical issue that remains to be addressed. Here, we present an easy and reliable protocol for extracting aqueous metabolites from cultured adherent cells for metabolomic analysis using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS). Aqueous metabolites from cultured cells are analyzed by culturing and washing cells, treating cells with methanol, extracting metabolites, and removing proteins and macromolecules with spin columns for CE-MS analysis. Representative results using lung cancer cell lines treated with diamide, an oxidative reagent, illustrate the clearly observable metabolic shift of cells under oxidative stress. This article would be especially valuable to students and investigators involved in metabolomics research, who are new to harvesting metabolites from cell lines for analysis by CE-MS.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acell lines 3adrug therapy 3aharvesting 3alung neoplasms 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amethanol 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidants 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3aprediction 3aproteins 3astudents 3awashing1 aKami, Kenjiro1 aSasaki, Kazunori1 aSatō, Hajime,1 aSato, Yuzo1 aTsuchihara, Katsuya1 aMakinoshima, Hideki0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 June 09, , no. 148 p.e59551-e59551dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/595513Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/59551/extraction-aqueous-metabolites-from-cultured-adherent-cells-for  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003300113040001800146100001500164245017000179300002000349520161000369592002801979650001002007650001902017650001702036650002302053650001002076650001402086650001002100650001702110650001202127650001702139700001702156700001702173700001602190700001702206773010002223856004602323852000902369655001202378IND50090205920221118172453.0140612e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009020592DNAL7 a248373492pmid7 a10.1111/1750-3841.124802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLowe, B.K.10aEffects of Retail Style or Food Service Style Packaging Type and Storage Time on Sensory Characteristics of Bacon Manufactured from Commercially Sourced Pork Bellies  ap. S1197-S1204.  aObjectives were to characterize differences in pork bellies that were stored frozen for different durations prior to processing and characterize sensory properties of the bacon derived from those bellies when stored in either retail or food service style packaging. Bellies (n = 102) were collected from 4 different time periods, fresh bellies (never frozen) and bellies frozen for 2, 5, or 7 mo, and manufactured into bacon under commercial conditions. Food service bacon was packaged in oxygen‐permeable polyvinyl lined boxes layered on wax‐covered lined paper and blast frozen (–33 °C) for 45 or 90 d after slicing. Retail bacon was vacuum‐packaged in retail packages and refrigerated (2 °C) in the dark for 60 or 120 d after slicing. At the end of respective storage times after slicing, bacon was analyzed for sensory attributes and lipid oxidation. Off‐flavor and oxidized odor of bacon increased (P < 0.01) with increasing storage time in both packaging types. Lipid oxidation increased (P < 0.01) as storage time increased from day 0 to day 45 in food service packaged bacon from frozen bellies, but was unchanged (P ≥ 0.07) with time in food service packaged bacon from fresh bellies. Lipid oxidation was also unchanged (P ≥ 0.21) over time in retail packaged bacon, with the exception of bellies frozen for 5 mo, which was increased from day 0 to day 90. Overall, off‐flavor, oxidized odor, and lipid oxidation increased as storage time after processing increased. Freezing bellies before processing may exacerbate lipid oxidation as storage time after processing was extended.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacon 3afood retailing 3afood service 3alipid peroxidation 3aodors 3apackaging 3apaper 3apork bellies 3aslicing 3astorage time1 aBohrer, B.M.1 aHolmer, S.F.1 aBoler, D.D.1 aDilger, A.C.0 tJournal of food science.g2014 June, v. 79, no. 6 p.S1197-S1204dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.12480  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100003700137245018500174300001800359520184700377592002802224650001902252650001902271650001002290650001202300650001002312650001402322650001702336650001102353650001102364653001702375653001402392653001702406653001602423700002802439700002402467700002202491773011602513856007102629852000902700655001202709IND60639229120221121034107.0190501s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063922912DNAL7 a10.1071/AN180462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallego-Calvo, María de Lourdes10aEffect of body condition and melatonin implants, inserted at different times of the year, on ovarian activity in goats maintained without male contact from the time of implantation  ap. 1048-1055.  aThe aim of the present work was to asses (1) whether body condition (BC) and (2) melatonin implants, inserted at different times of the year between the winter and summer solstices, have an effect on seasonal ovulatory activity in goats without presence of males. Sixty-six Blanca Andaluza does were divided into six groups. Five of these received a melatonin implant on either 18 December (n = 10), 3 February (n = 12), 19 March (n = 12), 30 April (n = 11) or 11 June (n = 11). Following this procedure, the does were completely isolated from bucks. Another 10 goats (YEAR group) were used to monitor natural annual ovarian activity; these females were completely isolated from males over the entire experimental period (from 18 December of one year until 17 December of the next year). Half the does of each group had a low body condition score (BC; ≤2.50; 2.46 ± 0.02), and half had a high BC (≥3.00; 3.24 ± 0.04). Ovulatory activity was monitored via the progesterone concentrations determined in blood samples collected twice per week for 4 months following melatonin implantation, and over 12 months for the YEAR group. Over 46% of the females showed ovarian activity after the melatonin treatment, ranging from the lowest response in December (30%) and the highest one in February (75%) without differences between the dates of melatonin insertion (P > 0.05). However, the response to the melatonin implant was higher in the females with a high BC than in females with a low BC (63% vs 31% for high and of low BC respectively, P < 0.05). The present results indicated that melatonin implants induce ovarian activity in does in the absence of male contact. The moment of melatonin implantation did not modify ovulatory activity. However, the ovulatory response to melatonin implants was higher in the females with a BC of ≥3.00.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood sampling 3abody condition 3abucks 3afemales 3agoats 3amelatonin 3aprogesterone 3asummer 3awinter 0afat reserves 0anutrition 0areproduction 0aseasonality1 aGatica, María Carolina1 aGuzmán, José Luis1 aZarazaga, Luis A.0 tAnimal production science.g2019, v. 59, no. 6 p.1048-1055dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl37620x1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN180463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01479naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024001800130040001800148100002300166245010300189300001600292520046300308592002800771650001600799650002300815650001000838650001900848651001100867700002200878773018600900856008201086852000901168655001201177IND60594737820221119153158.0180522e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059473782DNAL7 a10.1894/SWNAT-D-17-00024.12doi4 aswna-62-03-10  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodgers, Torrey W.12aA High-Elevation Record of the Little Spotted Cat (Leopardus tigrinus oncilla) from Western Panama  ap. 225-227.  aWe report a record of the endangered Central American little spotted cat (Leopardus tigrinus oncilla) from Volcán Barú National Park in the state of Chiriquí, Panama, from a scat identified through noninvasive genetics.

The development and subsequent use of such traits in practice demands a clear understanding of the genetic and phenotypic associations with the various production and functional traits. In this study, the relationships during lactation between milk fat:protein ratio (FPR) and production and functional traits were estimated for Nordic Red cattle, in which published information is scarce. The objectives of this study were to estimate genetic associations of FPR with milk yield (MY), fertility, and udder health traits during different stages of lactation. Traits included in the analyses were MY, 4 fertility traits—days from calving to insemination (DFI), days open (DO), number of inseminations (NI), and nonreturn rate to 56d (NRR)—and 2 udder health traits—test-day somatic cell score (SCS) and clinical mastitis (CM). Data were from a total of 22,422 first-lactation cows. Random regression models were used to estimate genetic parameters and associations between traits. The mean FPR in first-lactation cows was 1.28 and ranged from 1.25 to 1.45. During first lactation, the heritability of FPR ranged from 0.14 to 0.25. Genetic correlations between FPR and MY in early lactation (until 50d in milk) were positive and ranged from 0.05 to 0.22; later in lactation, they were close to zero or negative, indicating that cows may have come out of the negative state of energy balance. The strength of genetic associations between FPR and fertility traits varied during lactation. In early lactation, correlations between FPR and the interval fertility traits DFI and DO were positive and ranged from 0.14 to 0.28. Genetic correlations between FPR and the udder health traits SCS and CM in early lactation ranged from 0.09 to 0.20. Milk fat:protein ratio is a heritable trait and easily available from routine milk-recording schemes. It can be used as a low-cost monitoring tool of poor health and fertility in the most critical phases of lactation and as an important indicator trait to improve robustness in dairy cows through selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalving 3adairy cows 3adays open 3aearly lactation 3aenergy balance 3agenetic correlation 3aheritability 3ainsemination 3amastitis 3amilk 3amilk yield 3amonitoring 3aregression analysis 3asomatic cells 3audders 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgenetics 2aFatsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aFertilityxgenetics 2aLactationxgenetics 2aMammary Glands, Animalxphysiology 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aPhenotype 2aPregnancy 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 0amilk fat:protein ratio 0afunctional trait 0agenetic correlation 0arandom regression1 aStrandén, I.1 aMäntysaari, E.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2013 Feb., v. 96, no. 2 p.1237-1250dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-57203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03919naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245015800162300001600320520140800336592002801744596005901772596005901831596007301890596013101963596007702094596011502171596004402286596008202330596007402412650001202486650002602498650002402524650002002548650002002568650002402588650002302612650002202635650001002657650001602667650002102683650001802704650001902722650002802741650001202769650001602781650000902797650001002806650001502816650002302831650001702854700002002871700002002891700001602911700001402927700001902941700001402960700005702974773013403031856008303165852000903248655001203257IND60646446620221120051741.0200710e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064644662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-019-01361-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuan10aIncreasing livestock wastewater application in alternate-furrow irrigation reduces nitrification gene abundance but not nitrification rate in rhizosphere  ap. 439-455.  aIn water-scarce regions, alternate-furrow irrigation (AFI)—alternately wetting half of the plant roots—has proven to be an effective water-saving approach without compromising yield. However, the extent to which AFI with wastewater affects N cycling genes remains poorly studied. We aimed to investigate changes in main N transformation processes, bacterial and fungal community composition, as well as relative abundance of N cycle-associated genes in soil receiving AFI with swine wastewater. The experimental plan included three irrigation rates, irrigating pepper plants with 50%, 65%, and 80% of the amount of water required under conventional furrow irrigation to prevent the crop suffering water stress. Each treatment had a groundwater irrigation control. We measured edaphic factors, microbial community composition, and relative abundance of genes in rhizosphere and bulk soils. Altering water use in AFI did not exert a significant effect on bacterial and fungal communities. By increasing the irrigation rate of wastewater, relative abundances of nifH, bacterial and archaeal amoA and nosZ genes decreased, whereas those of nirK and nirS genes increased in the rhizosphere soil; nitrification rate did not decrease and the denitrification rate remained unchanged in both rhizosphere and bulk soil, implying that appropriate increase of wastewater use by AFI can improve N use efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data  a41701265cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51479201cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a172102110121cScientific and Technological Project of Henan Province  aFIRI2016-13cCentral Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund (Farmland Irrigation Research Institute, CAAS)  a2017YFD0801103-2cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aNocAgricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program (ASTIP) of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences  a201703250038cChina Scholarship Council  aBBS/E/C/000I0310cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (GB)  aBBS/E/C/000I0130cUnited Kingdom Natural Environment Research Council 3aArchaea 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3adenitrification 3aedaphic factors 3aexperimental design 3afungal communities 3afurrow irrigation 3agenes 3agroundwater 3airrigation rates 3anitrification 3anitrogen cycle 3anutrient use efficiency 3apeppers 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3aswine 3awastewater 3awater conservation 3awater stress1 aNeal, Andrew L.1 aZhang, Xiaoxian1 aCui, Erping1 aGao, Feng1 aFan, Xiangyang1 aHu, Zhao,1 aLi, Zhongyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3880-98550 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2019 July, v. 55, no. 5 p.439-455dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl37530x0178-27627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-019-01361-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100001600163245009600179300001600275500001900291500000900310520143300319592002801752650001601780650001301796650001101809650002101820650001601841650000901857650001401866650001601880650001701896650001601913650001201929650001701941650001101958650001301969650001901982700002002001700001802021700001602039773012102055856009802176852000902274655001202283IND60665144620221118084139.0191122e198803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066514462DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1988.0011183X002800020037x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, A.

Reductions in callus growth rate and embryogenic callus formation occurred with increasing x-ray doses 20 d and 3 months (90 d) after irradiation. Callus irradiated with 0.8 kR showed a significant increase in growth rate and a 20% increase in embryogenic callus 9 months (270 d) after irradiation. A total of 230 R₀ plants were regenerated for evaluation. Pollen fertility and seed set of R₀ plants decreased with increasing x-ray dosage. Days to anthesis and plant height of R₀ plants varied among x-ray treatments but were generally reduced with higher dosages. The number of chromosomal aberrations increased with x-ray dosage. The R₁ seeds taken from R₀ plants were also grown and tested for mutant segregation. Plants regenerated from irradiated calli had a two- to 10-fold increase in mutations over plants regenerated from unirradiated control callus. Germination frequency of seeds from R₀ plants decreased with increasing x-ray dosage. Although chlorophyll mutants were most frequently observed, a number of vigorous plants with earlier anthesis date were also recovered.

The estimated forage–concentrate ratio was 80:20. Milk from pasture ewes had a higher percentage of saturated FAs (SFAs; 62.3 vs 56.5), lower percentages of monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs; 30.4 vs 36.6) and n-6 polyunsaturated FAs, and a lower n-6:n-3 ratio (1.9 vs 2.3) than did that of hay ewes (P < 0.001). Meat of pasture lambs had higher percentages of total polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs; 23.0 vs 20.4; P < 0.05) and n-3 (7.0 vs 5.0; P < 0.001) and lower percentages of MUFAs (37.9 vs 41.8; P < 0.001) and n-6:n-3 (2.0 vs 2.8; P < 0.001) than did that of hay lambs. The inclusion of quebracho increased MUFAs in milk (P < 0.05) and decreased SFAs in meat (P < 0.05). Ewes were correctly classified to the different treatments by using the FA profile of milk (100% score outcome), and to a lesser extend by using the FA profile of lamb (82–100% score outcome); de novo synthesis of FAs in lamb muscle might have reduced the classification accuracy. In conclusion, forage type had a greater effect on the FA profiles of ewe milk and the meat of suckling lambs than did the inclusion of quebracho in the concentrate. To improve the classification of meat of suckling lamb, other biomarkers should be examined. These results are relevant for ewes farmed for the production of milk as well as lambs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3adiet 3aewe milk 3aewes 3afatty acid composition 3aforage 3ahay 3alactating females 3alamb meat 3alambs 3amilk 3amuscles 3apastures 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asuckling 0afarming system 0agrazing 0asheep 0atannins1 aJoy, M.1 aSanz, A.1 aÁlvarez-Rodríguez, J.1 aBlanco, M.0 tAnimal production science.g2019, v. 59, no. 6 p.1108-1118dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl37620x1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN180823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009800166300001600264520105800280592002801338650002201366650002501388650001501413650001701428650001501445650002001460650002601480650002301506650002301529650001501552650000901567650002001576650001101596653001601607653001701623653001901640653002201659653002201681700001901703700002001722773011901742856008401861852000901945655001201954IND60122299520221120035626.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012229952DNAL7 a10.1080/02772248.2014.9138652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Amit10aλ-Cyhalothrin and cypermethrin induce stress in the freshwater muddy fish, Clarias batrachus  ap. 136-149.  aIn order to understand the level of health risk posed by pyrethroid insecticides with strong soil-binding properties to freshwater fish, specifically living in muddy region of aquatic bodies, changes were examined in different biochemical stress markers in a freshwater muddy fish, Clarias batrachus , exposed to pyrethroid insecticides, cypermethrin and λ-cyhalothrin, in low sub-acute concentrations parts per million (ppm) for 96 hr. Data showed significant increase in levels of lipid peroxidation and in activities of lactate dehydrogenase, acid, and alkaline phosphatases along with marked decline in the specific activity of acetylcholinesterase in a concentration-dependent manner. The marked alterations in stress biomarkers indicate that pyrethroids induce significant stress in C. batrachus . This risk assessment study draws attention towards the potential health risk of freshwater muddy fish, which are continuously being exposed to the high concentrations of such insecticides accumulated as runoff in the muddy bottom of aquatic bodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClarias batrachus 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abiomarkers 3acypermethrin 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alambda-cyhalothrin 3alipid peroxidation 3apyrethrins 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arunoff 0apyrethroids 0acypermethrin 0aλ-cyhalothrin 0aClarias batrachus 0astress biomarkers1 aSharma, Bechan1 aPandey, Ravi S.0 tToxicological and environmental chemistry.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 96, no. 1 p.136-149dTaylor & Francisx1029-04867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02772248.2014.9138653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013000168300001600298520110700314592002801421650002201449650001901471650001601490650001301506650001101519650001901530650001901549650001201568650002201580650002001602650002201622650001101644650002001655653001901675653002001694653001601714653002301730653002601753700002601779773010401805856008501909852000901994655001202003IND60546298420221122044826.0160903e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054629842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Si Hui10aBiodecolorization and biodegradation potential of recalcitrant triphenylmethane dyes by Coriolopsis sp. isolated from compost  ap. 274-280.  aTriphenylmethane dyes (TPM) are recalcitrant colorants brought into the environment. In this study, a lesser-known white rot fungus Coriolopsis sp. (1c3), isolated from compost of Empty Fruit Bunch (EFB) of oil palm, was explored for its decolorization potential of TPM dyes. The isolate 1c3 demonstrated good decolorization efficiencies in the treatment of Crystal Violet (CV; 100 mg l−1), Methyl Violet (MV; 100 mg l−1) and Cotton Blue (CB; 50 mg-1), with 94%, 97% and 91%, within 7, 7 and 1 day(s), respectively. Malachite Green (MG; 100 mg l−1) was the most recalcitrant dye, with 52% decolorization after 9 days. Dye removal by 1c3 was presumably via biosorption, whereby the process was determined to be influenced by fungal biomass, initial dye concentrations and oxygen requirements. Biodegradation was also a likely mechanism responsible for dye removal by 1c3, occurred as indicated by the reduction of dye spectra peaks. Detection of laccase, lignin peroxidase and NADH-DCIP reductase activities further substantiate the possible occurrence of biodegradation of TPM dyes by 1c3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3abiodegradation 3abiosorption 3acomposts 3acotton 3adecolorization 3agentian violet 3alaccase 3alignin peroxidase 3amalachite green 3amicrobial biomass 3aoxygen 3awhite-rot fungi 0aBiodegradation 0aCoriolopsis sp. 0aEFB compost 0aDye decolorization 0aTriphenylmethane dyes1 aYien Ting, Adeline Su0 tJournal of environmental management.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 150 p.274-280dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245014900166300001400315520159100329592002801920650000801948650002701956650001301983650002001996650001202016650002202028650002402050650000902074650003002083650003002113650001602143653004102159653002702200653002702227700001702254700001702271700001702288700001302305700002002318700001402338700001802352700001902370700001302389700001902402700001702421773011302438856008402551852000902635655001202644IND60629738120221121055211.0190326e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062973812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2019.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Jinqiang10aSensitive and rapid visual detection of Salmonella Typhimurium in milk based on recombinase polymerase amplification with lateral flow dipsticks  ap. 25-32.  aSalmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) can cause serious foodborne diseases. In this study, an assay combining recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) with lateral flow dipsticks (LFD) was developed to detect S. Typhimurium in milk. The RPA forward primers STF1, STF2, STF3, the reverse primer STR labeled with digoxin, and the probe STProb labeled with FAM were designed and screened to produce RPA products for LFD detection. The RPA reaction volume, temperature, and time were then optimized, and the sensitivity and specificity of the developed method were analyzed. Finally, the RPA–LFD method was evaluated using milk artificially contaminated with S. Typhimurium. Results indicated that the primer pair STF1/STR is the optimal combination for detecting the bacterium. The minimum volume, shortest time, and optimal temperature of the RPA reaction were 10 μL, 10 min, and 40–42 °C, respectively. The limit of detection of RPA-LFD for detecting the genomic DNA of S. Typhimurium was 1 fg, which is 5 and 10 times lower than the corresponding limits of RPA–agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) and PCR–AGE, respectively. Testing with 29 other foodborne bacteria as controls revealed that RPA–LFD was highly specific for S. Typhimurium. RPA–LFD can detect S. Typhimurium at concentrations as low as 1.95 CFU/mL in artificially inoculated milk samples and is thus 10 times more sensitive than PCR. Hence, the RPA–LFD assay established in this study could be a potential point-of-care/need test for S. Typhimurium, especially in areas with limited resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3abacteria 3adetection limit 3adigoxin 3afoodborne illness 3agel electrophoresis 3amilk 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atemperature 0aRecombinase polymerase amplification 0aSalmonella Typhimurium 0aLateral flow dipsticks1 aHuang, Runna1 aSun, Yanting1 aWei, Xiangke1 aWang, Yi1 aJiang, Chunpeng1 aGeng, Yao1 aSun, Xincheng1 aJing, Jianzhou1 aGao, Hui1 aWang, Zhangcun1 aDong, Caiwen0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2019 Mar., v. 158 p.25-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2019.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245006400174520095900238592002801197650002201225650002501247650001701272650001901289650001701308650001801325650001801343650003001361650001301391653004501404653003701449653004901486653002501535653002901560700002401589700001801613700001901631773011101650856008601761852000901847655001201856IND60754684120221121171544.0211114e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075468412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1230042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMóricz, Ágnes M.10aAcetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the giant goldenrod root  aEight bioactive clerodane diterpenes from the root extract of Solidago gigantea Ait.

One uses vanillin sulphuric acid derivatization and densitometry, and the other an inhibition assay of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and video densitometry. Both methods gave figures of merit for quantification including 5.8–33.9 ng and 175.5–448.7 ng LOQs and 2.7–6.9 RSD% and 8.8–13.9 RSD% inter-day precisions, respectively. Based on the diterpenes’ content of 14 root samples collected over a year from the same plant population, the fully flowering plant is suggested to collect the root as a source of these compounds. Excepting one diterpene (with the lowest retardation factor), the quantitative results for the richest sample obtained by the two methods were in harmony. The difference could be due to a matrix effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolidago gigantea 3aacetylcholinesterase 3adensitometry 3aderivatization 3aditerpenoids 3aroot extracts 3asulfuric acid 3athin layer chromatography 3avanillin 0aSolidago gigantea Ait.

The traditional noise map construction method is difficult to be widely used because of its low update frequency and high drawing cost. Based on the crowd-sensing technology and Latent Factor Model (LFM), this paper proposes a new noise map completion method called Spatial-Temporally Related LFM (STR-LFM) for solving the problem of data sparseness. First, the geographic information features including Point of Interest (POI), road network and building outline are fully excavated, and then combine the correlation of the samples in the time dimension to construct the similarity matrixes. After that, use the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to find out the similar samples of missing positions, and finally regard their weighted fusion as the predicted values. Experimental results show that the recovery error is lower than other commonly used methods, and the proposed method has better stability when faced with data sparseness problems at different levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3amental health 3amodels 3apollution 3aroads 3aspatial data 0aUrban noise 0aCrowd-sensing 0aNoise map 0aMap completion1 aChen, Lina1 aZhang, Yilin0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 274 p.115703-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1157033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01513naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010100168300001800269520056200287592002800849650001500877650001000892650001400902650002300916650001300939700005800952773012001010856008401130852000901214655001201223IND60765885920220517000000.0220204e20220126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076588592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.2c000392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJana, Kalipada10aAllylboronic Esters as Acceptors in Radical Addition, Boron 1,2-Migration, and Trapping Cascades  ap. 1100-1104.  aRadical 1,3-carboheteroarylation and 1,3-hydroalkylation of allylboronic esters comprising a 1,2-boron shift is reported.

It was evaluated the sensorial, and the color, lipid oxidation, and visual acceptance in display of dry‐aged beef (0, 14, and 28 days) from young bulls slaughtered with different subcutaneous fat thickness (2.00, 3.00, and 4.00 mm). Meat with 2.00 and 3.00 mm fat had higher acceptability than 4.00 mm (p < .05). Dry aging improved overall acceptability of consumers. Meat with 2.00 and 3.00 mm fat presented higher lightness and lipid oxidation values than 4.00 mm (p < .05) but similar visual acceptance was observed. Dry‐aged beef (14 and 28 days) had lower lightness, but higher redness (p < .05) than not dry aged (0 days). Display reduced color over time, for all dry‐aged treatments (p < .05). Dry aging process increased lipid oxidation but these values were below 2.00 mg/kg of malonaldehyde only in the first day of display. Dry aged for 14 days had similar visual acceptability to not dry‐aged beef until the third day of display (p < .05). Shelf‐life of 0, 14, and 28 days of dry aged was 5.41, 2.55, and 0.23 days. Despite of the increase in lipid oxidation and lightness, the sensorial and display acceptability of meat from young bulls was not prejudiced by the reduction in fat thickness. Beef dry‐aged for 14 days was visually well accepted and could be displayed for 2.55 days without compromising acceptability.  aPublisher supplied data  cBrazilian Council for Research and Technological Development (CNPq)  cCoordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) 3aage at slaughter 3abeef 3acolor 3afat thickness 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3ameat tenderness 3ashelf life 3asubcutaneous fat1 aMacedo, Francisco de Assis Fonseca de1 aSantos, Gladston Rafael de Arruda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7554-93511 aBonin, Edinéia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0242-11701 aVital, Ana Carolina Pelaes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6033-68981 aRamos, Tatiane Rogelio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0752-23731 aPassetti, Ludmila Couto Gomes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7886-27301 aOrnaghi, Mariana Garcia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1440-58611 aCosta, Izabelle Crystine Almeida1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6751-01581 aPrado, Ivanor Nunes do1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1058-70200 tAnimal science journal =.g2020 Jan., v. 91, no. 1 p.e13498-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867063x1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.134983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245010100166300001400267520125200281592002801533650001501561650004401576650001801620650001001638650004301648650001801691650001901709650002101728650001401749653002101763653003101784653004001815653004401855700001801899700001801917700002001935700001701955700001801972773011301990856008402103852000902187655001202196IND60629738220221121055112.0190326e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062973822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2019.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Hai-Feng12aA rapid throughput assay for screening (R)-2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)propionic acid producing microbes  ap. 44-51.  a(R)-2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)propionic acid ((R)-HPOPA) is an important intermediate for the synthesis of optically pure aryloxyphenoxypropionic acid herbicides. Regioselective hydroxylation of (R)-2-phenoxypropionic acid ((R)-POPA) by microbes is one of the most useful methods for the industrial production of (R)-HPOPA. In this study, we designed and optimized a rapid throughput assay for screening (R)-HPOPA producing bacterial/fungal strains which can regioselectively hydroxylate (R)-POPA. (R)-HPOPA could react with 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AAP) in the presence of potassium hexacyanoferrate (K3[Fe(CN)6]) to form indoxyl antipyrine, an orange-red chromophore, that can easily spectrophotometrically be determined at 550 nm. During the verification of the assay we observed an average recovery rate of between 97.3% and 104.5%. Apart from the rapid throughput, no obvious differences in detection (R)-HPOPA in the culture broth samples were found between our rapid throughput multiplate assay and a high-performance liquid chromatography method. Our optimized assay method is simple, rapid and accurate with high repeatability. It has the potential for high throughput screening (about 3000–5000 samples/day) of the (R)-HPOPA producing strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantipyrine 3aaryloxyphenoxypropionic acid herbicides 3aculture media 3afungi 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydroxylation 3apropionic acid 3aregioselectivity 3ascreening 0aMicroplate assay 0aRapid throughput screening 0a4-Aminoantipyrine spectrophotometry 0a(R)-2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy) propionic acid1 aZhou, Hai-Yan1 aWang, Mei-Xin1 aWang, Yuan-Shan1 aXue, Ya-Ping1 aZheng, Yu-Guo0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2019 Mar., v. 158 p.44-51dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2019.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245010000174300001400274500001500288520133300303592002801636650002201664650001301686650003301699650002401732650001301756650001101769650001401780650001801794650001601812650001801828650002201846650001001868650001201878653001001890700002501900700002001925700002901945700002501974773012001999856008102119852000902200655001202209IND60119989020221118013546.0150117e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011998902DNAL7 a10.1007/s13562-013-0232-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWannapinpong, Sirinrat10aMolecular cloning and characterization of the CHS gene family in turmeric (Curcuma longa Linn.)  ap. 25-33.  a2019-12-04  aThree chalcone synthase (CHS) genes were isolated from Curcuma longa Linn. using TAIL-PCR. ClCHS1 and ClCHS2 were 1,460 and 1,407 bp in length, respectively, containing 1,191 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encodes 396 amino acids, whereas ClCHS3 was 1,394 bp in length containing 1,170 bp ORF that encodes 389 amino acids. The structure of all three genes comprise two exons and one intron which are consistent with the other CHS gene family. Southern blot analysis using a ClCHS conserved fragment revealed the ClCHS genes belong to a gene family. Phylogenetic analysis showed the three putative ClCHS proteins to be closely related to DCS (diketide-CoA synthase) protein, a product of CHS-like gene in C. longa, which condenses malonyl-CoA with feruloyl-CoA or coumaroyl-CoA as the substrate in curcuminoid synthesis. These results suggest that the interaction of substrate and enzyme between the three putative ClCHS proteins and DCS might be highly similar. Homology modeling and docking analysis were consistent, indicating that the same substrate (coumaroyl-CoA) can be used in the putative ClCHS1 and ClCHS2 proteins. However, the putative ClCHS3 protein seems to have seven amino acids deletion in a loop involved in the binding site formation, suggesting that the binding site with coumaroyl-CoA might be altered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSouthern blotting 3aproteins 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aopen reading frames 3aturmeric 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3aCurcuma longa 3aamino acids 3abinding sites 3amolecular cloning 3aexons 3aintrons 0agenes1 aSrikulnath, Kornsorn1 aThongpan, Amara1 aChoowongkomon, Kiattawee1 aPeyachoknagul, Surin0 tJournal of plant biochemistry and biotechnology.g2015 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.25-33dSpringer-Verlagx0971-78117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13562-013-0232-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006900147245012900216300001200345520108800357592002801445596006401473596006401537596006401601596006401665596006401729650002101793650002001814650001201834650001301846650001101859650001101870650002201881650000901903650000901912650001401921650001101935650001801946650003301964650001001997650001102007650000902018650000902027651002302036651001102059700002802070700002302098700001902121700002302140700002402163700002402187773015202211856008202363852000902445655001202454IND60655793820221120183112.0200502e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065579382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-019-7711-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠinzar-Sekulić, Jasmina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8181-716410aAssessment of trace element accumulation potential of Noccaea kovatsii from ultramafics of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia  ap. 540.  aIn this work, we present the results of the investigation of trace elements (Fe, Mg, Ni, Zn, Cu, Cr, Co, Cd, Pb) accumulation potential of Noccaea kovatsii (Heuff.)

Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reveal relationships of elements in soil, and Pearson’s correlation coefficients for analysing associations of available quantities of elements in soil and those in roots and shoots of N. kovatsii. Uptake and translocation efficiency was assessed by using bioconcentration (BCF) and translocation factors (TF). All the analysed populations of N. kovatsii emerged as strong Ni accumulators, with the highest shoot concentrations of 12,505 mg kg⁻¹. Even thought contents of Zn in plant tissues of N. kovatsii were under the hyperaccumulation level (602 mg kg⁻¹ and 1120 mg kg⁻¹ respectively), BCF was up to 667, indicating that certain surveyed populations have strong accumulative potential for this element.  aPublisher supplied data  a173030cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja  a173030cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja  a173030cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja  a173030cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja  a173030cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja 3aNoccaea kovatsii 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3ahyperaccumulators 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3anickel 3aplant tissues 3aprincipal component analysis 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil 3azinc 3aBosnia-Herzegovina 3aSerbia1 aStamenković, Una Matko1 aTomović, Gordana,1 aTumi, Ahmed F.1 aAndrejić, Gordana1 aMihailović, Nevena1 aLazarević, Maja R.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2019 Sept., v. 191, no. 9 p.540-540dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7711-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245012100162300001600283520168200299592002801981650002402009650002002033650002602053650001402079650002602093650002002119650001002139650002202149650000902171651001002180651001602190653002402206653002702230653002402257653002302281653002102304700001702325700001802342700003102360700001402391700001602405773023502421856008402656852000902740655001202749IND60543639920221118052449.0190411e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054363992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2014.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yang12aA comparative study on population development patterns of Sogatella furcifera between tropical and subtropical areas  ap. 845-851.  aThe White-backed Planthopper (WBPH), Sogatella furcifera (Horváth (Hemiptera: Delphacidae)) has been the most serious pest threatening rice production in Asia since the late 1970s. A series of field experiments using the same research protocol was carried out to compare the effects of main environmental factors on population development of WBPH in tropical (Philippines) and subtropical (China) areas in 2010–2012 and to provide further evidences of ecological mechanisms involved that cause frequent outbreak in subtropical rice. Outcomes showed that WBPH population in subtropical area could be characterized as the higher population growth rates and higher peak densities. The average growth rate (116.60±46.16) in subtropical area was significantly higher than that in tropical area (24.02±11.25). The higher realized fecundity in subtropical area indicated that the higher growth rates and higher peak densities were mainly related to the poor natural regulating forces in subtropical area. Our results showed that resistant variety could significantly reduce the peak density in subtropical areas, but not in tropical areas. We inferred that the reason for not detecting the effect of resistant variety in tropical area was due to the dominant controlling effects provided by natural enemies, which means that the natural regulating effect in tropical area was strong enough to disguise the effects of resistant variety. The significant interactions between plant resistance and location demonstrated that integration of natural enemies and use of plant resistance could play important roles for reducing outbreak frequency of WBPH effectively in subtropical rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSogatella furcifera 3acrop production 3aenvironmental factors 3afecundity 3afield experimentation 3anatural enemies 3apests 3apopulation growth 3arice 3aChina 3aPhilippines 0aSogatella furcifera 0aPopulation development 0aGeographic location 0aNatural regulation 0aPlant resistance1 aCheng, Jiaan1 aZhu, Zengrong1 aHeong, K.

Salicylic acid, which is synthesized through phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and isochorismate synthase, is involved in this response to stress. However, the effects of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and isochorismate synthase on the total flavonoids and desirable isoflavonoids in plants under stress remain unknown. In this study, the effects of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and isochorismate synthase on total flavonoids, daidzein and puerarin in Pueraria thomsonii Benth. under low light stress were investigated. When the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity was inhibited by L-AOPP, the salicylic acid content was not reduced, but gradually increased along with an increase of isochorismate synthase activity. The trends of salicylic acid and total flavonoid content were similarly consistent, but there was no significant positive correlation between phenylalanine ammonia-lyase suppression and total flavonoid production in P. thomsonii under low light stress. However, daidzein synthesis was correlated with the isochorismate synthase pathway, and puerarin with the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPueraria montana var. thomsonii 3adaidzein 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3asalicylic acid 3asecondary metabolites 3astress response1 aJiang, Hu1 aLi, Yuping0 tJournal of plant biochemistry and biotechnology.g2015 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.34-41dSpringer-Verlagx0971-78117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13562-013-0233-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03791naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245022000165300001600385520213400401592002802535650001902563650001702582650002002599650002402619650001502643650002102658650000902679650001702688651001002705653001502715653001702730653001802747653001702765653001802782653000802800700001702808700001402825700001702839700001602856700001402872700001702886700001402903700001802917700001102935700002002946700001802966700001702984700001903001773012503020856008303145852000903228655001203237IND60629738320221121055045.0190523e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062973832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2019.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xiaoxia10aResilience of revegetated grassland for restoring severely degraded alpine meadows is driven by plant and soil quality along recovery time: A case study from the Three-river Headwater Area of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau  ap. 169-177.  aResilience is crucial to promote the ecosystem sustainability and maintain ecosystem functions and services. Clarifying the variation regularity of the resilience can provide a theory foundation for the restoration and management of degraded ecosystems. Grassland cultivation has been largely used to restore extensively distributed “Black Beach”, the severely degraded alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). However, few researchers have documented the resilience of the revegetated grasslands along the succession gradients. In this study, we surveyed the revegetated grasslands on the QTP at different restoration times: 4-year, 6-year, 9-year, 12-year, 13-year, 14-year, 16-year, 18-year by using chronosequence approach to identify the resilience of the revegetated grasslands from the perspectives of plant and soil quality. We treated “Black Beach” as the baseline for restoration, and non-degraded healthy alpine meadow as the target for the restoration. We used the MDS method to identify the appropriate indicators and created an integrated assessment system that quantified the resilience of plant, soil, plant-soil system of the revegetated grasslands at different recovery years. The results showed that the non-linear resilience of revegetated grasslands were identified for the plant, soil and plant-soil systems along the temporal gradients. The plant resilience of the revegetated grasslands peaked at the 12th recovery year. The soil of the revegetated grasslands was superior to severely degraded grasslands after 13 years of revegetation. Asynchrony existed between the resilience of soil and that of the plant along the temporal gradients. The plant-soil system resilience of the revegetated grasslands peaked at the 16th recovery year. From the perspectives of plant, soil, plant-soil system, the recovery time of severely degraded grassland should be at least 16–18 years to reach a relative stable state. Revegetated grassland can be used as an effective restoration approach to improve the quality and resilience of plant and soil in the severely degraded alpine meadow on the QTP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine meadows 3acase studies 3achronosequences 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aland restoration 3asoil 3asoil quality 3aChina 0aResilience 0aRevegetation 0aPlant quality 0aSoil quality 0aRecovery time 0aMDS1 aDong, Shikui1 aXu, Yudan1 aWu, Shengnan1 aWu, Xiaohui1 aZhang, Xi1 aZhi, Yangliu1 aLi, Shuai1 aLiu, Shiliang1 aLi, Yu1 aShang, Zhanhuan1 aDong, Quanmin1 aZhou, Huakun1 aStufkens, Paul0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2019 July 01, v. 279 p.169-177dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2019.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245013200165520177700297592002802074650001602102650001702118650001102135650001202146650001302158650001802171650003302189650001902222700002802241700002102269700002002290773012102310856008002431852000902511655001202520IND60763401420221116204015.0220120e20211225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076340142DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110100262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrotta, Rita 10aSmall Angle X-ray Scattering Sensing Membrane Composition: The Role of Sphingolipids in Membrane-Amyloid β-Peptide Interaction  aThe early impairments appearing in Alzheimer’s disease are related to neuronal membrane damage. Both aberrant Aβ species and specific membrane components play a role in promoting aggregation, deposition, and signaling dysfunction. Ganglioside GM1, present with cholesterol and sphingomyelin in lipid rafts, preferentially interacts with the Aβ peptide. GM1 at physiological conditions clusters in the membrane, the assembly also involves phospholipids, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol. The structure of large unilamellar vesicles (LUV), made of a basic POPC:POPS matrix in a proportion of 9:1, and containing different amounts of GM1 (1%, 3%, and 4% mol/mol) in the presence of 5% mol/mol sphingomyelin and 15% mol/mol cholesterol, was studied using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The effect of the membrane composition on the LUVs–Aβ-peptide interaction, both for Aβ₁–₄₀ and Aβ₁–₄₂ variants, was, thus, monitored. The presence of GM1 leads to a significant shift of the main peak, towards lower scattering angles, up to 6% of the initial value with SM and 8% without, accompanied by an opposite shift of the first minimum, up to 21% and 24% of the initial value, respectively. The analysis of the SAXS spectra, using a multi-Gaussian model for the electronic density profile, indicated differences in the bilayer of the various compositions. An increase in the membrane thickness, by 16% and 12% when 2% and 3% mol/mol GM1 was present, without and with SM, respectively, was obtained. Furthermore, in these cases, in the presence of Aβ₄₀, a very small decrease of the bilayer thickness, less than 4% and 1%, respectively, was derived, suggesting the inhibiting effect that the presence of sphingomyelin has on the GM1–Aβ interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholesterol 3agangliosides 3amodels 3aneurons 3apeptides 3aphospholipids 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asphingomyelins1 aMangione, Maria Rosalia1 aLibrizzi, Fabio 1 aMorán, Óscar,0 tBiology.g2021 Dec. 25, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110100263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012300169520192300292592002802215650000802243650001502251650001202266650001102278650002102289650001702310650002402327650002202351650001502373651001002388653002102398653002302419653002102442653002402463653003102487700001302518700001902531700001502550700002102565700001502586700001502601773010202616856008502718852000902803655001202812IND60754684520221121044532.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075468452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.1014642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Guang-Yao10aModeling the response of negative air ions to environmental factors using multiple linear regression and random forest  aNegative air ion (NAI) plays a vital role in promoting the psychological and physiological functions of the human body and is an essential indicator for measuring the air cleanliness of a given area. In this paper, we presented and compared the results of two methods for identifying the main environmental factors affecting changes of NAI in a warm-temperate region of China. NAI concentration was estimated based on measured data during the main growing season in a warm-temperate forest and was used as the dependent variable in the traditional multiple linear regression and random forest models. Air pollutants and certain weather, radiation, and soil factors were selected as predictors based on their potential influence on NAI. Two methods were applied for the analysis, and the latter was a non-parametric alternative based on an ensemble of classification and regression trees. We compared the precision of the two models, and the variables of each method on the basis of their levels of importance; Independent samples was used in model validation, then we discussed the important environmental factors affecting changes of NAI concentration for both linear and nonlinear perspectives, along with the potential implications of environmental factors on NAI. The random forest model showed a higher accuracy comparison with the multiple linear regression model. Furthermore, the analysis also indicated its better performance by using independent test data for 10-fold cross-validation of the random forest model, and showing that this method has potential for broad-scale application in the assessment of environmental-factor influence on NAI. Certain selected variables that were common to both models (particulate matter 2.5, soil moisture, and relative humidity) appeared to influence NAI to a relatively large extent, demonstrating the decidedly influential role of these parameters on NAI concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalgorithms 3aforests 3ahumans 3amodel validation 3aparticulates 3aregression analysis 3arelative humidity 3asoil water 3aChina 0aNegative air ion 0aEnvironment factor 0aMachine learning 0aRandom forest model 0aMultiple linear regression1 aZhou, Yu1 aSang, Yu-Qiang1 aHuang, Hui1 aZhang, Jin Song,1 aMeng, Ping1 aCai, Lu-Lu0 tEcological informatics.g2021 Dec., v. 66 p.101464-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.1014643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245013000215300001600345520143500361592002801796650002101824650002601845650001301871650001101884650001401895650001601909650001901925650001701944650002301961650004301984650001102027650001102038650002102049650001602070650004402086650002102130650002202151650001302173650000902186650001702195650002702212650001002239700002302249700002202272700002002294700001502314700006002329773017102389856008402560852000902644655001202653IND60634484720221120105048.0190323e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063448472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b010432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColeman, Christina M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5785-742510aArabinoxyloglucan Oligosaccharides May Contribute to the Antiadhesive Properties of Porcine Urine after Cranberry Consumption  ap. 589-605.  aCranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) juice is traditionally used for the prevention of urinary tract infections. Human urine produced after cranberry juice consumption can prevent Escherichia coli adhesion, but the antiadhesive urinary metabolites responsible have not been conclusively identified. Adult female sows were therefore fed spray-dried cranberry powder (5 g/kg/day), and urine was collected via catheter. Urine fractions were tested for antiadhesion activity using a human red blood cell (A+) anti-hemagglutination assay with uropathogenic P-fimbriated E. coli. Components were isolated from fractions of interest using Sephadex LH-20 gel filtration chromatography followed by HPLC on normal and reversed-phase sorbents with evaporative light scattering detection. Active urine fractions were found to contain a complex series of oligosaccharides but not proanthocyanidins, and a single representative arabinoxyloglucan octasaccharide was isolated in sufficient quantity and purity for full structural characterization by chemical derivatization and NMR spectroscopic methods. Analogous cranberry material contained a similar complex series of arabinoxyloglucan oligosaccharides that exhibited antiadhesion properties in preliminary testing. These results indicate that oligosaccharides structurally related to those found in cranberry may contribute to the antiadhesion properties of urine after cranberry consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aVaccinium macrocarpon 3aadhesion 3aadults 3acatheters 3acranberries 3aderivatization 3aerythrocytes 3agel chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ajuices 3alight scattering 3ametabolites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoligosaccharides 3aproanthocyanidins 3asorbents 3asows 3aspray drying 3aurinary tract diseases 3aurine1 aAuker, Kimberly M.1 aKillday, K.

The elicitors include dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), Abscisic acid (ABA) and Salicylic acid (SA). It was observed that ABA, SA and tryptamine stimulated reserpine production in the whole plant cultures of R. serpentina while DMSO had a negative effect. Treatment with tryptamine (1.0 mg L⁻¹) alone resulted in enhanced reserpine production (40.26 mg g⁻¹DW) while highest reserpine production (57.64 mg g⁻¹) was obtained after 36 days of elicitation in cultures treated with 0.1 mmol SA plus 1.0 mg L⁻¹tryptamine. In the presence of ABA, SA or tryptamine alone or when a combination of SA plus tryptamine was used, the biomass production was reduced. Increase in reserpine production may be ascribed to synergistic effects of SA and tryptamine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRauvolfia serpentina 3aabscisic acid 3abiomass production 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aelicitors 3aplant cultural practices 3areserpine 3asalicylic acid 3asynergism 3atryptamine1 aGuru, S.

This paper evaluates an iron nanocatalyst approach, based on Fenton-like oxidation reactions, to regenerate spent GAC within a packed bed configuration after saturation by organic compounds. Specifically, we focus on regenerating GAC packed beds equilibrated with varying influent concentrations of phenol, a model organic compound. Iron nanocatalysts were synthesized using ferric chloride, a chemical already used as a coagulant at municipal WTPs, and reacted with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for the purpose of in-situ regeneration. Up to 95% of phenol adsorption capacity was regenerated for GAC equilibrated with 1000 mg/L of phenol. Using this technique, at least four adsorption–regeneration cycles can be performed sequentially for the same batch of GAC with fresh iron nanocatalysts while achieving a regeneration efficiency of 90 ± 5% between each loading. Moreover, the iron nanocatalyst can be recovered and reused multiple times. Lower initial adsorbate concentrations (10–500 mg/L) resulted in a slightly lower saturated adsorbent-phase concentration of phenol and lower regeneration efficiencies (72 ± 5%). Additionally, this catalytic in-situ regeneration was applied to GAC saturated by NOM. A slightly lower regeneration efficiency (60%) was observed for the Suwannee River NOM adsorption capacity of GAC. The next step is validation in a pilot-scale test that applies this regeneration technique to a GAC adsorber employed in NOM removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aferric chloride 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon oxides 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3aphenol 3apollutants 3arivers 2aAdsorption 2aCarbonxchemistry 2aCatalysis 2aFerric Compoundsxchemistry 2aHydrogen Peroxidexchemistry 2aNanostructures 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhenolsxchemistry 2aRecycling 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistry 2aWater Purificationxmethods 0aFenton-like 0aIron nanocatalysts 0aIn-situ regeneration1 aHristovski, Kiril1 aHuling, Scott1 aWesterhoff, Paul0 tWater research.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 47 p.1596-1603dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2012.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03994naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245006700208300001100275506007600286520207100362592002802433596009302461596009402554596009402648596005702742506003702799650002802836650002102864650001002885650001902895650002102914650002302935650001102958650001702969650002802986650001803014650001203032700003103044700003103075700002003106700001803126700002403144700002103168700005503189773012903244856008203373852000903455655001203464IND60655794120221207090434.0191218e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065579412DNAL7 a10.1186/s40104-019-0370-52doi7 aPMC66814952pmcid7 a313919402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLlavanera, Marc10aGSTM3, but not IZUMO1, is a cryotolerance marker of boar sperm  ap. 61.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cryopreservation is currently the most efficient method for long-term preservation of mammalian gametes and is extensively used in swine artificial insemination (AI) centres. However, it is well-known that cryopreservation procedures induce changes in the water phase in both intra and extracellular compartments, which alter the content and localisation of several proteins and ends up curtailing the structural integrity of functional sperm (i.e., cryoinjuries). Alterations and deficiencies of sperm-oocyte binding proteins during gamete recognition are one of the causes of reproductive failure both in vitro and in vivo. In this sense, characterisation of cryopreservation effects upon oocyte-binding proteins of sperm, such as IZUMO1 and GSTM3, is essential when assessing the impact of this technique in swine reproduction. RESULTS: Cryopreservation was found to induce changes in the localisation of IZUMO1 and GSTM3 in boar sperm. However, the relative content of both proteins was not altered after thawing. Furthermore, whereas IZUMO1 content was found not to be related to the cryotolerance of boar sperm, GSTM3 content was observed to be higher in poor (PFE) than in good (GFE) freezability ejaculates in both pre-frozen (1.00 INT·mm² ± 0.14 INT·mm² vs. 0.72 INT·mm² ± 0.15 INT·mm²; P < 0.05) and post-thawed (0.96 INT·mm² ± 0.20 INT·mm² vs. 70 INT·mm² ± 0.19 INT·mm²; P < 0.05) samples. Moreover, GSTM3 levels were found to be higher in those spermatozoa that exhibited low mitochondrial activity, high reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and high membrane lipid disorder post-thaw (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The difference in GSTM3 content between GFE and PFE, together with this protein having been found to be related to poor sperm quality post-thaw, suggests that it could be used as a cryotolerance marker of boar spermatozoa. Furthermore, both IZUMO1 and GSTM3 relocate during cryopreservation, which could contribute to the reduced fertilising capacity of frozen-thawed boar sperm.  aPublisher supplied data  aRYC-2014-15581cMinisterio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España  aAGL2017-88329-RcMinisterio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España  aFJCI-2017-31689cMinisterio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España  aMSCA-IF-79212cH2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aartificial insemination 3abinding proteins 3aboars 3acold tolerance 3acryopreservation 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3alipids 3amitochondria 3areactive oxygen species 3asperm quality 3athawing1 aDelgado-Bermúdez, Ariadna1 aFernandez-Fuertes, Beatriz1 aRecuero, Sandra1 aMateo, Yentel1 aBonet, S.q(Sergi),1 aBarranco, Isabel1 aYeste, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2209-340X0 tJournal of animal science and biotechnology.g2019 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.61-61dBioMed CentralwJournal:2268x2049-18917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40104-019-0370-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245015200166520170800318592002802026650002102054650003402075650001402109650001502123650002502138650002402163650001602187650003602203650001602239650001602255650001502271650001902286650001102305650001602316650002102332650002102353650002302374650001702397650002002414650001802434700002302452700002902475700002302504700002102527700002202548700002002570773011902590856007702709852000902786655001202795IND60703686920221121144030.0200721e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070368692DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90302982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSperanza, Jasmine 10a<i>Isatis tinctoria</i> L. (Woad): A Review of Its Botany, Ethnobotanical Uses, Phytochemistry, Biological Activities, and Biotechnological Studies  a<i>Isatis tinctoria</i> L. (Brassicaceae), which is commonly known as woad, is a species with an ancient and well-documented history as an indigo dye and medicinal plant. Currently, <i>I. tinctoria</i> is utilized more often as medicinal remedy and also as a cosmetic ingredient. In 2011, <i>I. tinctoria</i> root was accepted in the official European phytotherapy by introducing its monograph in the European Pharmacopoeia. The biological properties of raw material have been known from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Over recent decades, <i>I. tinctoria</i> has been investigated both from a phytochemical and a biological point of view. The modern in vitro and in vivo scientific studies proved anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, antimicrobial, antiviral, analgesic, and antioxidant activities. The phytochemical composition of <i>I. tinctoria</i> has been thoroughly investigated and the plant was proven to contain many valuable biologically active compounds, including several alkaloids, among which tryptanthrin, indirubin, indolinone, phenolic compounds, and polysaccharides as well as glucosinolates, carotenoids, volatile constituents, and fatty acids. This article provides a general botanical and ethnobotanical overview that summarizes the up-to-date knowledge on the phytochemistry and biological properties of this valuable plant in order to support its therapeutic potential. Moreover, the biotechnological studies on <i>I. tinctoria</i>, which mainly focused on hairy root cultures for the enhanced production of flavonoids and alkaloids as well as on the establishment of shoot cultures and micropropagation protocols, were reviewed. They provide input for future research prospects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsatis tinctoria 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aalkaloids 3aanalgesics 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3acarotenoids 3achemical constituents of plants 3aethnobotany 3afatty acids 3aflavonoids 3aglucosinolates 3aindigo 3aingredients 3amedicinal plants 3amicropropagation 3aphenolic compounds 3aphytotherapy 3apolysaccharides 3araw materials1 aMiceli, Natalizia 1 aTaviano, Maria  Fernanda1 aRagusa, Salvatore 1 aKwiecień, Inga 1 aSzopa, Agnieszka 1 aEkiert, Halina 0 tPlants.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90302983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245018700171300001600358520165100374592002802025650001902053650001302072650002702085650001502112650001002127650002402137650002802161650002502189650003002214650001602244650002902260650001502289650001702304650002102321650001402342650002602356650001202382650001302394650001202407650002202419650002902441700002702470700002602497700002402523700002402547700002602571700002702597773010102624856008102725852000902806655001202815IND60440327320221120114524.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044032732DNAL7 a10.1007/s11816-015-0364-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKissoudis, Christos10aMaintenance of metabolic homeostasis and induction of cytoprotectants and secondary metabolites in alachlor-treated GmGSTU4-overexpressing tobacco plants, as resolved by metabolomics  ap. 287-296.  aHerbicides are an invaluable tool for agricultural production scaling up. However, their continuous and intensive use has led to an increased incidence of herbicide resistant weeds and environmental pollution. Plant glutathione transferases (GSTs) are tightly connected with crop and weed herbicide tolerance capacitating their efficient metabolic detoxification, thus GSTs can be biotechnologically exploited towards addressing those issues. However, information on their effects at a “systems” level in response to herbicides is lacking. Here, we aimed to study the effects of the chloroacetanilide herbicide alachlor on the metabolome of wild-type and tobacco plants overexpressing the soybean tau class glutathione transferase GmGSTU4. Alachlor-treated wild-type plants This system, naturally serving the detoxification of endogenous exhibited an abiotic stress-like response with increased abundance of compatible solutes, decrease in TCA cycle intermediates and decreased sugar and amino acid content. Transgenic plants responded distinctly, exhibiting an increased induction of abiotic stress responsive metabolites, accumulation of secondary metabolites and its precursors, and metabolic detoxification by-products compared to wild-type plants. These results suggest that the increased metabolic capacity of GmGSTU4 overexpressing plants is accompanied by pleiotropic metabolic alterations, which could be the target for further manipulation in order to develop herbicide resistant crops, plants with increased phytoremediation potential, as well as efficient management of non-target site, GST induced, herbicide resistance in weeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aalachlor 3aamino acid composition 3abyproducts 3acrops 3agene overexpression 3aglutathione transferase 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicide-resistant weeds 3ahomeostasis 3ametabolic detoxification 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3aphytoremediation 3apollution 3asecondary metabolites 3asolutes 3asoybeans 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants 3atricarboxylic acid cycle1 aKalloniati, Chrysanthi1 aFlemetakis, Emmanouil1 aMadesis, Panagiotis1 aLabrou, Nikolaos E.1 aTsaftaris, Athanasios1 aNianiou-Obeidat, Irini0 tPlant biotechnology reports.g2015 Sept., v. 9, no. 5 p.287-296dSpringer Japanx1863-54667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11816-015-0364-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03563naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008700169300001600256520186400272592002802136650003502164650001402199650001202213650001302225650001102238650002702249650002902276650002402305650001002329650001502339650000902354650001402363650001402377650002102391650001502412650001402427650001002441650001102451650001102462650001702473650000902490651001802499653000702517653000702524653000702531653000702538653000702545653000702552653000702559653000702566653002902573653001502602653001602617700001302633700001302646700001402659700001302673700001602686773009502702856008302797852000902880655001202889IND60479754020221118071710.0160123e20050601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047975402DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.34.2005.2.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzentmihályi, K.10aMedicinal Plant TEAS Recommended as nutritional source for element supplementation  ap. 161-167.  aHerbal teas may be effective in adjuvant therapy for the prevention of complications of diabetes mellitus II. <i>Agrimoniae herba, Betulae folium, Bursae pastoris herba, Foenigraeci semen, Galegae herba, Maydis stigma, Taraxaci radix, Phaseoli fructus sine seminibus, Urticae folium</i>, and their teas were analysed by ICP-OES for element content. Concentration of the elements of crude drug samples obtained are in good agreement with the average concentrations of plants, although some significantly high concentration has been found for manganese (893 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), zinc (275 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and iron (492 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) in <i>Betulae folium</i>, for copper (41.2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) in <i>Galegae herba</i>, for iron (2692 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) in <i>Taraxaci radix</i>, for calcium (41210 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and magnesium (6275 mg kg<sup>-1) in <i>Urticae folium</i>. The common characteristic feature of crude drugs is the relatively high concentration of chromium (0.8-16.3 mg kg-1</sup>). Ion concentrations of teas are relatively low. The quantities of metal ions do not cover the daily needs, nevertheless, they may be important as food supplements. According to U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), the following teas are good sources: <i>Agrimoniae herba</i> for chromium, <i>Betulae folium</i> for manganese, <i>Taraxaci radix</i> for copper and chromium, <i>Urticae folium</i> for potassium and calcium. The dissolution of elements from plant drugs varies: potassium (22.5-74.7%), sodium (1.9-60.5%), calcium (6.6-28.1%), magnesium (12.3-52.5%) and copper (3.7-51.4%) are readily dissolved. The dissolution of manganese (6.8-32.3%) and of zinc (0-31%) is lower.

The use of such tools for detection of amplified nucleic acid (NA) in field and clinical settings is limited by the need for complex instrumentation and trained users. To address these limitations we developed a rapid, robust, and instrument-free colorimetric detection method for nucleic acids using a visible region dye, Nile Blue (NB). NB is a cationic benzophenoxazine dye with well-known binding interactions with NA and has been used in instrumental methods for DNA quantification. When combined with dsDNA, the color of NB shifts from blue to purple. Images of this color shift are collected and are subjected to image analysis. Observed changes in the red and green colorimetric intensities are linked to the ratio of dsDNA to NB. By titrating solutions of dsDNA against a series of NB concentrations, we found it possible to quantitate dsDNA at concentrations ranging from 10–100 μg mL⁻¹ using a k-means cluster analysis method. This range is comparable to that of NA concentrations quantified using gold-standard UV-Visible spectroscopy and to the concentrations of NA in biological samples after amplification. Unknown concentrations of dsDNA from yeast extracts were correctly identified within ±5 μg mL⁻¹ of true concentration. Preliminary experiments demonstrate use of the developed NB method on paper-based analytical devices. As an instrument-free detection method, NB allows for rapid and robust quantification of dsDNA in field settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acluster analysis 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adyes 3agene amplification 3ahuman health 3aimage analysis 3ainstrumentation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3ayeasts1 aLieberman, Marya0 tAnalytical methods.g2022 Feb. 3, v. 14, no. 5 p.574-580dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ay01598b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01598naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245012800158300001200286520046700298592002800765650001500793650001200808650001500820650001200835651001000847653001600857653002000873653001300893653002300906653002400929653003400953700001700987700001901004700001901023773008701042856007401129852000901203655001201212IND60128227520221118132408.0151115e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012822752DNAL7 a10.5358/hsj.33.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Akio14aThe First Prehistoric Record of Mauremys mutica (Testudines: Geoemydidae) from the Yaeyama Islands, Southern Ryukyus, Japan  ap. 1-7.  aSkeletal remains of the geoemydid turtle, Mauremys mutica, were recovered from the lower layer of the Tugurubama archeological site on Yonagunijima Island, which corresponds to the period from the late middle to early late Holocene (ca., 4,000 yBP).

Hence, the power demand of the platform can be met by burning less natural gas, and the CO₂ emissions reduced by up to 25%. However, the weight of the current bottoming cycles must come down to enable widespread implementation. This work presents a thorough weight minimization of a steam bottoming cycle utilizing gas turbine exhaust heat. Unconventional, but feasible designs of heat exchangers, ductwork and structural components are considered along with materials switching. Overall weight reductions of 38% and 52% were achieved for a 16 MW and a 12 MW offshore bottoming cycle respectively when compared to a 16 MW reference system. Key factors in achieving the weight reduction were the use of small steam generator tubes with an inner diameter of only 10 mm, improved condenser design and the use of aluminium structural framework replacing steel. By more than halving the weight of the bottoming cycle, it's implementation potential on offshore platforms has been greatly improved and can move the oil and gas industry towards significantly reduced CO₂ emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3agenerators (equipment) 3aheat 3anatural gas 3aoil and gas industry 3aoils 3asteam 3asteel 3aweight loss1 aHagen, Brede A.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1604-38791 aSkaugen, Geir1 aLindqvist, Karl1 aLundberg, Steinar1 aKristensen, Oddrun A.0 tEnergy.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 230 p.120634-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1206343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03475naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245015100176300001600327520179500343592002802138650002502166650001802191650001702209650002302226650003502249650002302284650001802307650002602325650003302351650001402384650001702398650001602415650005802431650001402489650002602503650002902529650001202558650001202570650002902582650001502611650001002626650003202636700002302668700001502691700002202706700002602728773010102754856008102855852000902936655001202945IND60440327420221120114516.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044032742DNAL7 a10.1007/s11816-015-0367-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlos-Hilario, Luzminda10aScreening Carica papaya native promoters driving stilbene synthase expression in Arabidopsis thaliana for resveratrol glucoside (piceid) synthesis  ap. 307-317.  aThe use of promoters for downstream metabolic engineering in plants requires efficiently screening their transcriptional strength and the resulting levels of the desired metabolite. Carica papaya is a complex slow-growing tropical tree, which is difficult to rapidly screen for promoter activity. Therefore, we used the simple model system, Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia), to compare the effectiveness of two native papaya promoters (Cp9 and Cp29) with a positive control (CaMV35S promoter), in driving transcription of the stilbene synthase gene (Vst1) and production of the phytoalexin trans-resveratrol glucoside (piceid). Single transgene copy numbers were verified via Southern analysis of at least three independent transgenic lines for each promoter construct. The Cp29 and control CaMV35S promoters consistently produced high Vst1 mRNA levels, whereas Vst1 mRNA was 50–60 % less in the Cp9:Vst1 lines. The evolutionarily related chalcone synthase (CHS) gene produced 20 and 40 % less mRNAs relative to WT in the Cp29:Vst1 and 35S:Vst1 lines, respectively, but was unchanged in the Cp9:Vst1 lines. The transgenic lines accumulated piceid as identified through RP-HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. Piceid levels were the highest in the 35S:Vst1 followed by Cp29:Vst1 and Cp9:Vst1 in the studied tissues. No overt deleterious phenotypes were observed in the Cp9:Vst1 and Cp29:Vst1 lines; however, 35S:Vst1 produced smaller plants. The levels of secondary metabolites (anthocyanins) and seed pigments (tannins) decreased in the CaMV35S:Vst1 and Cp29:Vst1 lines, likely due to competition between CHS and stilbene synthase for precursors p-coumaroyl- and malonyl-CoA. The Cp29:Vst1 expression in Arabidopsis produced adequate levels of piceid for future disease-resistance studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCarica papaya 3aanthocyanins 3adisease resistance 3agenetically modified organisms 3amalonyl coenzyme A 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolic engineering 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aphenotype 3aphytoalexins 3aresveratrol 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3ascreening 3asecondary metabolites 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atannins 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenes 3atrees 3atrihydroxystilbene synthase1 aShimshock, Richard1 aNg, Cherie1 aBingham, Jon-Paul1 aChristopher, David A.0 tPlant biotechnology reports.g2015 Sept., v. 9, no. 5 p.307-317dSpringer Japanx1863-54667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11816-015-0367-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245012400196500001900320500002000339520123800359592002801597596006501625596004701690596007201737650001601809650002401825650002101849650002101870650000901891650000901900650001301909650002501922650001601947650001501963650001701978700001901995700005902014700002202073700001802095700002102113700006002134700002002194773012602214856007302340852000902413655001202422IND60722273820221122074550.0201230e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072227382DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.133952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeda, Shiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6231-263810aEffects of whey protein hydrolysate on growth promotion and immunomodulation in mouse pups in artificial rearing system  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study aimed to investigate the effects of whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) on the growth and immunity of mouse pups in artificial rearing (AR) system. Mouse pups were reared in the AR system with artificial milk including 5% WPH (AR with WPH) or not (AR without WPH), and the remaining pups were reared by their mother (dam) for 14 days after birth. The body weight change and body weight gain rates in the AR with WPH group were significantly higher than those observed in the AR without WPH group and similar to those in the dam group. Moreover the feed and protein efficiencies in the AR with WPH group were significantly higher than those of the AR without WPH group. In addition, the supplement of WPH in the AR system was shown to significantly elevate the number of CD3⁺CD8⁺, B220⁺CD19⁺, IA/IE⁺CD11c⁺, and CD11b⁺ in the thymocyte and/or splenocyte, and the thymus weight. Furthermore, MALDI‐TOF/MS analysis identified the amino acid sequences corresponding to some peptides, and indicated that VRTPEVDDE had the highest relative intensity among the peptides from tested WPH. Therefore, WPH would be required to not only promote growth, but also exert immunomodulatory activities in mouse pups in AR system.  aPublisher supplied data  a18K13024cJSPS KAKENHI Grant‐in‐Aid for Young Scientists  cMorinaga Foundation for Health & Nutrition  a19H03109cJSPS KAKENHI Grant‐in‐Aid for Scientific Research (B) 3aamino acids 3abody weight changes 3agrowth promotion 3aimmunomodulation 3amice 3amilk 3apeptides 3aprotein hydrolysates 3asplenocytes 3athymocytes 3awhey protein1 aHarauma, Akiko1 aOkamoto, Mariko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8553-02321 aEnomoto, Hirofumi1 aKudo, Toshiji1 aSuzuki, Takehito1 aMizunoya, Wataru1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2258-19641 aMoriguchi, Toru0 tAnimal science journal =.g2020 Jan., v. 91, no. 1 p.e13395-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867063x1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.133953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002300166245011700189300001400306520129100320592002801611653001101639653001201650653001301662653001201675653001701687700001701704700002001721700001901741700002001760773009601780856011401876852000901990655001201999IND60131227020221117002416.0151127e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013122702DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[49:HEOASO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDempster, Alastair10aHydrogeological evaluation of a southern ontario kettle‐‐hole peatland and its linkage to a regional aquifer  ap. 49-56.  aThis paper examines a southern Ontario kettle-hole peatland (Spongy Lake) to determine its hydrogeological linkage with local and regional water tables. The water table in the peat deposit and lake are perched 6 m above the regional aquifer, and there are strong lateral and downward hydraulic gradients. The horizontal hydraulic gradient (ΔΔh/ΔΔz) measured at the edge of the peatland ranged between 0.15 and 0.23 and the vertical gradient reached −−1.24 (i.e., downward flow). At depths less than 1.0 m, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kₛ) ranged from 10⁻⁻⁷ to 10⁻⁻⁵ m s⁻⁻¹ and increased in magnitude with proximity to the peat surface. In an intermediate zone (1.0––4.0 m depth), Kₛ values ranged from 10⁻⁻⁸ to 10⁻⁻⁷ m s⁻⁻¹, while deeper clay materials had Kₛ values ranging from 10⁻⁻⁹ to 10⁻⁻⁸ m s⁻⁻¹. A clay layer directly below the deep peat limits downward seepage of water (one to two orders of magnitude less than evaporation). During periods of relatively high water, most seepage loss occurs laterally at the interface between mineral sediment and the peat. Spongy Lake is an important recharge zone for the regional aquifer, and the hydrologic and ecological integrity of the system should be protected.  aPublisher supplied data 0akettle 0awetland 0apeatland 0aperched 0aground water1 aEllis, Peter1 aWright, Bradley1 aStone, Michael1 aPrice, Jonathan0 tWetlands.g2006 Mar., v. 26, no. 1 p.49-56dSociety of Wetlands Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F0277-5212%282006%2926%5B49%3AHEOASO%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01817naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012000167506002800287520082500315592002801140506003701168650002401205650001701229650000901246650000801255650001301263700001901276700001901295773009601314856008401410852000901494655001201503IND60753587520221207065057.0211005s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075358752DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202136060262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElena, Panina14aThe condition of the hairline of Chinchilla lanigera after the introduction of a hydrogen antioxidant into the diet  aResource is Open Access  aIt was found that the inclusion of water enriched with molecular hydrogen into the diet of a long-tailed chinchilla changed the fur quality indicators.

In this study, we identified two late pollen-specific rice promoters (ProOsLPS10 and ProOsLPS11) via meta-anatomical expression analysis. We then investigated the expression of both promoters in transgenic rice (a homologous system) and Arabidopsis (a heterologous system) using ProOsLPS10 or ProOsLPS11::GFP-GUS constructs. As predicted by microarray data, both promoters triggered strong GUS expression during the late stages of pollen development in rice, with no GUS signals detected in the examined microspores and sporophytic tissues. Interestingly, these promoters exhibited different GUS expression patterns in Arabidopsis. While in Arabidopsis, the OsLPS10 promoter conferred GUS expression at the uni- and bi-cellular pollen stages, as well as at the shoot apical region during the seedling stage, the OsLPS11 promoter was not active in the pollen at any stage, or in the examined sporophytic tissues. Furthermore, by performing a complementation analysis using a sidecar pollen (scp) mutant that displays developmental defects at the microspore stage, we found evidence that OsLPS10 promoter, which can be applied in Arabidopsis, is useful for directing gene expression in the early stages of pollen development. Our results indicate that the OsLPS10 and OsLPS11 promoters can drive the expression of target genes during the late stages of pollen development in rice, but not in Arabidopsis. Our results also emphasize the necessity of confirming the applicability of an established promoter to heterologous systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aOryza sativa 3agene expression 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3amicrospores 3amutants 3apollen 3arice 3aseedlings 3asporophytes 3atissues 3atransgenic plants1 aOo, Moe Moe1 aMoon, Sunok1 aBae, Hyun-Kyung1 aOh, Sung Aeong1 aSoh, Moon-Soo1 aSong, Jong Tae1 aKim, Jeong Hoe1 aJung, Ki Hong1 aPark, Soon Ki0 tPlant biotechnology reports.g2015 Sept., v. 9, no. 5 p.297-306dSpringer Japanx1863-54667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11816-015-0365-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245011000181300001600291520177200307592002802079650002302107650001802130650001402148650001702162650002102179650001602200650002602216650002502242650001502267650001202282650001202294650001102306650002202317650002402339650002902363650001702392650001102409700004002420700002702460700002902487700002602516700002902542700003002571700002702601773011702628856008102745852000902826655001202835IND60519928520221117065941.0160511e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051992852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-016-0676-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiguel, Paulo Sérgio Balbino10aDiversity and distribution of the endophytic bacterial community at different stages of Eucalyptus growth  ap. 755-771.  aThe relationships between plants and endophytic bacteria significantly contribute to plant health and yield. However, the microbial diversity in leaves of Eucalyptus spp. is still poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the endophytic diversity in leaves of hybrid Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla (Eucalyptus “urograndis”) by using culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches, to better understand their ecology in leaves at different stages of Eucalyptus development, including bacteria with N2 fixation potential. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria (classes alpha-, beta- and gamma-) and Actinobacteria were identified in the Eucalyptus “urograndis” endophytic bacterial community. Within this community, the species Novosphingobium barchaimii, Rhizobium grahamii, Stenotrophomonas panacihumi, Paenibacillus terrigena, P. darwinianus and Terrabacter lapilli represent the first report these bacteria as endophytes. The diversity of the total endophytic bacteria was higher in the leaves from the ‘field’ (the Shannon–Wiener index, 2.99), followed by the indices obtained in the ‘clonal garden’ (2.78), the ‘recently out from under shade (2.68), ‘under shade’ (2.63) and ‘plants for dispatch’ (2.51). In contrast, for diazotrophic bacteria, the highest means of these indices were obtained from the leaves of plants in the ‘under shade’ (2.56), ‘recently out from under shade (2.52)’ and ‘field’ stages (2.54). The distribution of the endophytic bacterial species in Eucalyptus was distinct and specific to the development stages under study, and many of the species had the potential for nitrogen fixation, raising the question of whether these bacteria could contribute to overall nitrogen metabolism of Eucalyptus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aPaenibacillus 3aRhizobium 3aSphingomonas 3aStenotrophomonas 3aTerrabacter 3abacterial communities 3adevelopmental stages 3aendophytes 3agardens 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen metabolism 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3aplant health 3atephra1 ade Oliveira, Marcelo Nagem Valério1 aDelvaux, Júlio César1 ade Jesus, Guilherme Luiz1 aBorges, Arnaldo Chaer1 aTótola, Marcos Rogério1 aNeves, Júlio César Lima1 aCosta, Maurício Dutra0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2016 June, v. 109, no. 6 p.755-771dSpringer International Publishingx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-016-0676-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011300169300001600282520162600298592002801924650001301952650001501965650001301980650001201993650001602005650001502021650001402036650001002050650001802060650001202078650002202090650002602112650002402138650002202162650001502184650002302199650001502222650000902237650001702246650002802263651001102291700002202302700002002324700002002344700002302364700001802387700002102405700002002426700002002446773011002466856008102576852000902657655001202666IND60119989720221118013638.0151123e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011998972DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-014-0215-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenneron, Ludovic10aFourteen years of evidence for positive effects of conservation agriculture and organic farming on soil life  ap. 169-181.  aConventional agriculture strongly alters soil quality due to industrial practices that often have negative effects on soil life. Alternative systems such as conservation agriculture and organic farming could restore better conditions for soil organisms. Improving soil life should in turn improve soil quality and farming sustainability. Here, we have compared for the first time the long-term effects of conservation agriculture, organic farming, and conventional agriculture on major soil organisms such as microbes, nematofauna, and macrofauna. We have also analyzed functional groups. Soils were sampled at the 14-year-old experimental site of La Cage, near Versailles, France. The microbial community was analyzed using molecular biology techniques. Nematofauna and macrofauna were analyzed and classified into functional groups. Our results show that both conservation and organic systems increased the abundance and biomass of all soil organisms, except predaceous nematodes. For example, macrofauna increased from 100 to 2,500 %, nematodes from 100 to 700 %, and microorganisms from 30 to 70 %. Conservation agriculture showed a higher overall improvement than organic farming. Conservation agriculture increased the number of many organisms such as bacteria, fungi, anecic earthworms, and phytophagous and rhizophagous arthropods. Organic farming improved mainly the bacterial pathway of the soil food web and endogeic and anecic earthworms. Overall, our study shows that long-term, no-tillage, and cover crops are better for soil biota than periodic legume green manures, pesticides, and mineral fertilizers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3aarthropods 3abacteria 3abiomass 3acover crops 3aearthworms 3afood webs 3afungi 3agreen manures 3alegumes 3along term effects 3amicrobial communities 3amineral fertilizers 3amolecular biology 3ano-tillage 3aorganic production 3apesticides 3asoil 3asoil quality 3asustainable development 3aFrance1 aBernard, Laetitia1 aHedde, Mickaël1 aPelosi, Céline1 aVillenave, Cécile1 aChenu, Claire1 aBertrand, Michel1 aGirardin, Cyril1 aBlanchart, Eric0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2015 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.169-181dSpringer Parisx1774-07467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-014-0215-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04362naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003200135040001800167100001800185245012500203300001100328506007600339520242000415592002802835506003702863650001702900650003302917650001902950650002102969650002702990650002403017650001603041650002203057650001303079650001903092650001203111650001903123650001103142650001303153650002103166650003803187650001003225650002003235650001803255650001103273650002303284650001403307650001403321650001403335650001203349650001903361650001303380651001803393700001803411700001603429700002003445700001703465700002003482773011003502856007903612852000903691655001203700IND50064332920221207045601.0191003e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006433292DNAL7 aPMC36063692pmcid7 a234975942pmid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-6-652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJose, Christo10aRecombinant Arthrobacter β-1, 3-glucanase as a potential effector molecule for paratransgenic control of Chagas disease  ap. 65.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Chagas disease is most often transmitted to humans by Trypanosoma cruzi infected triatomine bugs, and remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Central and South America. Control of Chagas disease has relied mainly on vector eradication. However, development of insect resistance has prompted us to develop a paratransgenic strategy to control vectorial transmission of T. cruzi. Here, the potential role of recombinant endoglucanases as anti-trypanosomal agents for paratransgenic application is examined. The surface of T. cruzi is covered by a thick coat of mucin-like glycoproteins that have been proposed to play a role in the binding of T. cruzi to the membrane surface of the vector gut. We hypothesize that disruption of these glycoconjugates could arrest parasite development in the vector and abort the transmission cycle. In this work, we examine the effects of recombinant Arthrobacter luteus β-1, 3-glucanase expressed via Rhodococcus rhodnii on T. cruzi Sylvio II strain. METHODS AND RESULTS: The coding sequence for β-1, 3-glucanase was cloned in-frame to a heterologous promoter/signal sequence from the Mycobacterium kansasii alpha antigen gene resident in an E. coli/R. rhodnii shuttle vector. The resulting construct was confirmed by sequencing, and electroporated into R. rhodnii. Expression products from positive clones were purified from log phase cultures followed by dialysis into physiological buffers. Lysates and media were quantitated by ELISA against rabbit antibody specific to β-1,3-glucanase. Glucanase-positive samples were applied to live T. cruzi parasites in culture and viability accessed by spectrophotometric and fluorescent microscopic measurements. R. rhodnii-expressed β-1,3-glucanase exhibited toxicity against T. cruzi compared to controls when applied at 5 and 10% of the total culture volume. The decrease in cell viability ranged from a maximum of 50% for the media treatments to 80% for the filtered lysates. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that recombinant β-glucanase could be a powerful addition to the arsenal of effector molecules for paratransgenic control of Chagas disease. In future studies, the ability of β-glucanase to function in combination with other effector molecules will be explored. Dual targeting of T. cruzi should not only slow resistance but also permit synergistic or additive lethal effects on T. cruzi.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArthrobacter 3aCellulosimicrobium cellulans 3aChagas disease 3aEscherichia coli 3aMycobacterium kansasii 3aRhodococcus rhodnii 3aTriatominae 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aantigens 3abeta-glucanase 3abuffers 3acell viability 3aclones 3adialysis 3adigestive system 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3ainsect development 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aparasites 3arabbits 3asignal peptide 3atoxicity 3aSouth America1 aKlein, Nicole1 aWyss, Sarah1 aFieck, Annabeth1 aHurwitz, Ivy1 aDurvasula, Ravi0 tParasites & vectors.g2013 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.65-65dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-6-653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014500156300001600301520142400317592002801741650001201769650001301781650002501794650001001819650001701829650002001846650001001866650001501876650001201891651001001903700001301913700001601926700001801942773012501960856007502085852000902160655001202169IND60765886820221117104403.0220204e20220203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076588682DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ay01819a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yulai14aThe compositional characterization and coloring mechanism of Tianqing porcelain from the Huangpu kiln based on EDXRF, SEM, and XAFS analyses  ap. 541-548.  aThe Huangpu kiln in northern China plays an important role in studying the origination and development of Tianqing porcelain that was initially produced in the Five Dynasties. In this paper we study the glaze formulae and coloring mechanism of Tianqing porcelain from the Huangpu kiln by analyzing the chemical composition and Fe valence of the samples using EDXRF, SEM and XAFS. We also discuss the formula adjustment and technological innovation in the development from celadon to Tianqing porcelain of the Huangpu kiln during the Five Dynasties. The results indicate that the Tianqing glaze formula promoted the conversion of calcium glaze to calcium-alkali glaze and was conducive to the crystallization of anorthite by changing the fluxing agent components, such as increasing the Ca and K contents and reducing the Si/Al ratios. In the meantime, controlling the reducing atmosphere and gradient cooling technique resulted in the appropriate size of the separated phase to satisfy the Rayleigh scattering and the size of anorthite crystallite to meet the Mie scattering, promoting the appearance of Tianqing color and jade-like texture. The proportion of Fe²⁺ in the glaze accounts for about 1/3 of the total amount of Fe. In Tianqing glaze, 1/3–2/3 Fe is four coordinated with low symmetry of the near neighbor coordination structure of Fe atoms, and Fe atoms are basically in a disordered local environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3aceramics 3achemical composition 3acolor 3acrystallites 3acrystallization 3akilns 3atechnology 3atexture 3aChina1 aWen, Rui1 aWang, Lihua1 aJing, Qinghe,0 tAnalytical methods.g2022 Feb. 3, v. 14, no. 5 p.541-548dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ay01819a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005900137245015200196300001600348520137800364592002801742650001401770650001501784650001901799650001201818650001501830650001001845650001501855650001401870650001201884650001701896650001501913650001401928650001401942650001101956650002201967650001301989650002202002650001502024650000902039650001002048650001002058650001102068650001002079653001502089653002502104700001902129700002202148700002002170700001702190700002102207700002002228700002502248700002502273773012002298856007202418852000902490655001202499IND60655794620221121032141.0190812e20190805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065579462DNAL7 a10.1071/CP190162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Sandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2998-814X10aImprovement of some growth and yield parameters of faba bean (Vicia faba) by inoculation with Rhizobium laguerreae and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  ap. 595-605.  aThe use of improved biofertilisers such as rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in legume crops is a promising technology that can be an alternative source of nitrogen and phosphorus. A common problem when growing faba bean (Vicia faba L.) and other leguminous plants is the low efficiency of native rhizobial strains. Consequently, there is a need to search for efficient nitrogen-fixing inoculant strains able to increase crop productivity. This study aimed to test the effects of single and dual inoculation with Rhizobium laguerreae and AMF on the growth and yield of faba bean plants. Several parameters were evaluated at flowering stage (number of flowers, stems and leaves, shoot and root biomass, leaf area, leaf mass per area and leaf area ratio, and gas-exchange parameters) and at harvesting stage (number and weight of pods and seeds). Plants receiving single inoculation with Rhizobium laguerreae showed a significant increase in number of leaves, leaf area, leaf mass per area and leaf area ratio, as well as in all yield parameters. Single inoculation with AMF also significantly increased the yield parameters of faba bean plants. Co-inoculation presented significant improvements in leaf area ratio and in all productivity parameters compared with the control, but co-inoculation was not significantly different from the individual inoculations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizobium 3aVicia faba 3abiofertilizers 3abiomass 3acrop yield 3acrops 3afaba beans 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agas exchange 3aharvesting 3aleaf area 3aleaf mass 3aleaves 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aphosphorus 3apods 3aroots 3aseeds 3ashoots 3astems 0abroad bean 0atripartite symbiosis1 aMucha, Ângela1 aGonçalves, Berta1 aBacelar, Eunice1 aLátr, Aleš1 aFerreira, Helena1 aOliveira, Irene1 aRosa, E.q(Eduardo),1 aMarques, Guilhermina0 tCrop & pasture science.g2019 Aug. 5, v. 70, no. 7 p.595-605dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl4206942x1836-57957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP190163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245009900165506002800264520160900292592002801901506003701929650001201966650000901978650001301987650002602000650001002026650001102036700001902047700002302066700002302089773009602112856008402208852000902292655001202301IND60753587820221207045238.0211005s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075358782DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202136010102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZezin, N.N.10aSelection of corn hybrids ensuring the production of high-energy feed for modern dairy farming  aResource is Open Access  aThe “line” of hybrids recommended by the Ural Research Institute of Agriculture Ob 140 SV (FAO 140), Ross 130 MV (FAO 130) and Kuban 101 SV (later Kuban 102 SV) (FAO 120) in 2016…2020 occupied 81.8…90.6% in the structure of sown seeds in the Sverdlovsk region.

The research was carried out on the basis of the FSBSI URFANITS UrB RAS as part of the State Task on the topic “Creation and improvement of adaptive technologies for the cultivation and processing of economically significant agricultural crops based on the optimization of biotic and abiotic factors”.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalfalfa 3acorn 3aoilseeds 3aresearch institutions 3asilos 3astarch1 aNamyatov, M.A.1 aSevostyanov, M.Yu.1 aOvchinnikov, P.Yu.0 tBIO web of conferences.g2021, v. 36 p.01010-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202136010103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245009500160300001600255500001500271520152700286592002801813650001601841650001501857650001701872650001101889650001601900650002601916650001201942650002801954650001001982650000901992650001502001650001902016650002302035650001202058650002802070650001902098653001402117700001802131700001802149773011002167856008102277852000902358655001202367IND60119989820221118013555.0151123e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011998982DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-014-0228-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBo Ling,10aPest control by microwave and radio frequency energy: dielectric properties of stone fruit  ap. 233-240.  a2019-12-04  aCurrent pesticides such as methyl bromide are progressively removed from the market due to harmful residues in food. The stone fruit industries are thus seeking alternatives for postharvest control of insect pests. Microwave and radio frequency methods hold potential for postharvest thermal disinfestations of stone fruits to replace chemical fumigation. Knowledge of dielectric properties is essential for understanding the interaction between the electromagnetic fields and the target stone fruits and designing treatment beds in industrial applications. Here, we determined the dielectric properties of nectarine, peach, and plum between 10 and 1,800 MHz over a temperature range of 20–60 °C using an impedance analyzer. Our results show that the dielectric constant generally varied between 60 and 75, accounting for changes of 8–10 % due to temperature effect. But, the loss factor decreased linearly with frequency on the log scale at all temperatures for three stone fruits. The loss factor of Mediterranean fruit fly, nectarine, peach, and plum increased about 106, 108, 110, and 64 %, respectively, when the sample temperature increased from 20 to 60 °C. The penetration depth in all stone fruits decreased with increasing frequency and temperature. The loss factor ratio at 27 MHz of Mediterranean fruit fly to nectarine, peach, and plum was 1.65, 1.66, and 1.87 at 20 °C, respectively, suggesting potential differential heating between insects and host stone fruits in radio frequency treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3afumigation 3ainsect pests 3aenergy 3aradio waves 3adielectric properties 3apeaches 3asustainable development 3aplums 3aheat 3anectarines 3ainsect control 3aCeratitis capitata 3amarkets 3aindustrial applications 3amethyl bromide 0aimpedance1 aTiwari, Gopal1 aWang, Shaojin0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2015 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.233-240dSpringer Parisx1774-07467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-014-0228-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245011600206520116100322592002801483650004401511650002201555650001801577650000901595650001501604650001101619650002901630650001601659650002201675650002401697650000801721650002101729653001501750653002701765653002801792653002501820700001401845700001701859700001701876773009001893856008501983852000902068655001202077IND60735718820221118182855.0220726e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073571882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1206512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Shengli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3724-429010aInhibitory effect and mechanism of l-ascorbic acid combined with tea polyphenols on coal spontaneous combustion  aThe inhibitory effects of compound antioxidants (l-ascorbic acid (VC) and tea polyphenols (TP)) on coal oxidation were studied. The characteristics of coal oxidation was investigated by temperature-programmed experiments. The changes of active groups in coal were confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Quantum chemical theory was used to explore the reaction mechanism. Experimental results showed that compound antioxidants exhibit significant synergistic inhibition effect on coal oxidation. The apparent activation energy of coal oxidation increases by 16.23 kJ/mol for the addition of 6 wt% compound antioxidants (TP:VC = 2:1). The content of aliphatic hydrocarbons, –OH, CO and COOH in the antioxidant-treated coal decreases, while that of ether bond and aromatic bond increases. H15 of VC or H48 of epigallocatechin gallate (the main component of TP) can readily scavenge oxygen-containing radicals and inhibit the production of active groups in coal. Water-soluble antioxidants can be evenly dispersed on the coal surface, which provides an environment-friendly and efficient approach to preventing coal spontaneous combustion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3aascorbic acid 3acoal 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3apolyphenols 3aquantum mechanics 3areaction mechanisms 3atea 3awater solubility 0aMine fires 0aSpontaneous combustion 0aSelf-heating prevention 0aOxidation inhibition1 aYan, Zhuo1 aYuan, Shujie1 aWeile Geng, 0 tEnergy.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 229 p.120651-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1206513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245010900175300001800284520116900302592002801471650003101499650001601530650001501546650002101561650002701582650001301609650002201622650002101644650001501665650002101680650002001701650002101721650000901742650002101751650001101772650001601783700001801799700001901817700002301836700001801859700002301877700002301900700002101923700002701944700002401971773011901995856005502114852000902169655001202178IND4510593520221122234325.0150730e20010701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451059352DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02312.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMetafora, Vittoria10aPhosphorylation of seminal vesicle protein IV on Ser58 enhances its peroxidaseâstimulating activity  ap. 3858-3869.  aIn this study we show that SVâIV, a major immunomodulatory, antiâinflammatory, and sperm immunoprotective protein secreted from the rat seminal vesicle epithelium, acts in vitro as a substrate of protein kinase C (PKC) competing efficiently with H1 histone, a very well known PKC substrate. Electrospray mass spectrometry (ESâMS) analysis demonstrated that approximately 10% of the native SVâIV molecules were phosphorylated by PKC and that such a modification involved only a single serine residue (Ser58) out of the 22 occurring in the protein. Interestingly, this modification produced a substantial enhancement (approximately 50%) of the native SVâIV's ability to stimulate the activity of both horseradish peroxidase (POD) and seleniumâdependent glutathione peroxidase (GPX), an enzyme that is known to protect the mammalian spermatozoa from oxidative stress and loss of motility in the female genital tract following ejaculation. In contrast, the phosphorylation of SVâIV on Ser58 did not produce any effect on the antiâinflammatory properties of SVâIV, as measured by its ability to inhibit the phospholipase A2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aejaculation 3aepithelium 3afemale genitalia 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahistones 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aphospholipase A2 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein kinase C 3arats 3aseminal vesicles 3aserine 3aspermatozoa1 aFranco, Paola1 aMassa, Ornella1 aMorelli, Francesco1 aStiuso, Paola1 aFerranti, Pasquale1 aMamone, Gianfranco1 aMalorni, Antonio1 aStoppelli, M.

The goal of the research was to assess what mutual relationships exist between insufficient drinking water supply and the socio-economic level of municipalities with less than 2000 inhabitants. The basis of the study is formed by data collected via a questionnaire survey of the mayors of 2110 municipalities. For the purposes of the analysis, the Drinking Water Supply Threat Index (DWSTI) composite indicator was established. Subsequently, the effect of selected factors on DWSTI was determined via correlation and regression analysis, and results were compared for two size groups of municipalities indicate water supply problems. The digging of new wells for individual needs is seen to be the most significant signal of problems. The absence of water supply infrastructure results in a heightening of the socio-economic deprivation of small municipalities, as it limits new building and becomes a limitation to their development. A solution is possible based on regional or trans-regional financial and managerial support of development together with an active approach on the part of municipalities.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainfrastructure 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asocioeconomic development 3asocioeconomics 3asurveys 3awater 3awater supply 3aCzech Republic1 aKureková, Lucie 1 aHejduková, Pavlína 1 aVogt, David 1 aHejduk, Tomáš,0 tWater.g2021 July 30, v. 13, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131520983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011100164300001400275500001500289520153600304592002801840650001201868650002701880650001101907650001601918650001901934650000901953650002801962650000901990650001301999650001002012650001302022650003702035650001502072653001002087700001602097700001902113700001602132773009502148856008102243852000902324655001202333IND60439560620221122235538.0151024e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043956062DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-006-9131-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Jifeng10aHomologous analysis of SSR-ESTs and transferability of wheat SSR-EST markers across barley, rice and maize  ap. 87-93.  a2019-12-06  aComparative genetic analysis has shown that different plant species often share orthologous genes for very similar functions, especially for cereal crops. In this study, we focused on analyzing the utility of EST-SSR markers among monocots in silico and by experiment. Based on 423,611 wheat ESTs, 101,299 were found to express commonly in rice, maize and barley ESTs, which accounted for 23.94% of wheat EST data. 1707 SSR-containing ESTs (SSR-ESTs) were mined from the 101,299 homologous ESTs, which accounted for 8.8% of all the 19,434 wheat EST-SSRs. It showed that the number of homologous SSR-ESTs much less than the homologous ESTs among grasses. The number of conserved ESTs and SSR-ESTs were inversely proportional to the evolutionary distance among species. Although these SSR-ESTs were in high similarity, the number of conserved SSRs between wheat and the other three crops decreased with the increased aligning regions, and only 13 types of SSR motifs in 21 ESTs were obtained by aligning sequences over a stretch of more than 40 bp. The variation at a microsatellite came from not only the differences in the numbers of repeat units and its location shift, but also base mutations flanking microsatellite repeats. From the 428 uni-SSR-ESTs universally in the four cereals, 243 primers were designed and tested in two genotypes of each species. 154 (63.4%) primers produced clear amplicons across the four species, which showed a high efficient transferability of wheat EST-SSR markers to the other three cereal crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasses 3amicrosatellite repeats 3abarley 3agrain crops 3aplant breeding 3arice 3aexpressed sequence tags 3acorn 3amutation 3awheat 3agenotype 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aLiliopsida 0agenes1 aGao, Lifeng1 aCao, Yongsheng1 aJia, Jizeng0 tEuphytica.g2006 Sept., v. 151, no. 1 p.87-93dKluwer Academic Publishersx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-006-9131-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02166naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006000168300001600228500001900244520088900263536008901152592002801241596001401269650001101283650002501294650001601319650001101335653001801346653002601364653002301390653002301413653001701436700001601453700001801469700002001487700002701507773012801534856008501662852000901747655001201756IND60704234720221121232331.0200722e20200703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070423472DNAL7 a10.1080/1523908X.2020.17784572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Jongeun10aPolicy conflicts in the siting of natural gas pipelines  ap. 501-517.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResearchers often focus on the most intense conflicts, skewing our perception of the diversity and nature of policy conflicts. The paper examines the discourse engaged in the siting of three pipeline projects under construction, each with varying levels of conflict, and one rejected project of high conflict. We analyze over 700 newspaper articles that span the life of each proposed pipeline and supplement the news media data with interviews. Using these data, we compare differences in actor types, frames, and behaviors in natural gas pipeline siting processes characterized by high, medium, and low conflict.

Little is known about the effect of a short or no DP on milk yield over multiple lactations. Our objectives were (1) to assess the effect of DP length over multiple lactations on milk yield, and (2) to assess if the prediction of milk yield in response to DP length could be improved by including individual cow characteristics before calving. Lactation data (2007 to 2015) of 16 Dutch dairy farms that apply no or short DP were used to compute cumulative milk yield in the 60 d before calving (additional yield) and in the 305 d after calving (305-d yield), and the mean daily yield over the interval from 60 d before calving to 60 d before next calving (effective lactation yield). The DP categories were no (0 to 2 wk), short (3 to 5wk), standard (6 to 8 wk), and long (9 to 12 wk). The effect of current DP and previous DP on yields was analyzed with mixed models (n=1,420 lactations). The highest effective lactation yield of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) was observed for cows with a standard current DP (27.6kg per day); a daily decrease was observed of 0.6kg for a long DP, 1.0kg for a short DP, and 2.0kg for no DP. Previous DP did not significantly affect the effective lactation yield. Thus, cows can be managed with short or no DP over consecutive lactations without a change in quantity of milk losses. Cows that received no DP for consecutive lactations had a lower additional yield before calving (−172kg of FPCM), but a higher 305-d yield (+560kg of FPCM), compared with cows that received no DP for the first time. This could lessen the improvement of the energy balance in early lactation when no DP is applied a second time compared with the first time. For the second objective, a basic model was explored to predict effective lactation yield based on parity, DP length, and first-parity 305-d yield (n=2,866 lactations). The basic model was subsequently extended with data about recent yield, days open, and somatic cell count. Extending the model reduced the error of individual predictions by only 6%. Therefore, the basic model seems sufficient to predict the effect of DP length on effective lactation yield. Other individual cow characteristics can still be relevant, however, to make a practical and tailored decision about DP length.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalving 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3adays open 3aearly lactation 3aenergy balance 3amilk 3amilk yield 3amodels 3aparity (reproduction) 3aprediction 3asomatic cell count 0acontinuous milking 0ayield prediction 0acommercial farms1 avan Knegsel, A.T.M.1 avan Middelaar, C.E.1 aEngel, B.1 aHogeveen, H.1 aKemp, B.1 ade Boer, I.J.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 Jan., v. 100, no. 1 p.739-749dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-109633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245012300155300001600278520157900294592002801873650003501901650001201936650001301948650001101961650001101972650001901983650001702002650001302019650001602032650000902048650000902057650001402066650001102080650001402091650001102105650001402116650001502130650000902145651001002154700003502164700003002199773014202229856007202371852000902443655001202452IND60661860220221119100518.0190904e20040121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066186022DNAL7 a10.1039/b306628b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRawat, Manju10aInventory compilation and distribution of heavy metals in wastewater from small-scale industrial areas of Delhi, India  ap. 906-912.  aDelhi has the highest cluster of small-scale industries (SSI) in India. There are generally less stringent rules for the treatment of waste in SSI due to less waste generation within each individual industry. This results in SSI disposing of their wastewater untreated into drains and subsequently into the river Yamuna, which is a major source of potable water in Delhi, thus posing a potential health and environmental risk to the people living in Delhi and downstream. To study the quantity, quality and distribution of heavy metals in liquid waste from industrial areas, wastewater, suspended materials and bed sediments were collected from industrial areas and from the river Yamuna in Delhi. This study has also focused on the efficiency of production processes in small-scale industries in India. Heavy metals such as Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Cd, Co and Pb were detected using a GBC 902 atomic absorption spectrometer. The concentration of heavy metals observed was as follows: Fe 2–212, Mn 0.3–39, Cu 0.2–20, Zn 0.2–5, Ni 0.6–6, Cr 0.2–53, Cd 0.08–0.2, Co 0.013–0.55, Pb 0.3–0.7 mg L⁻¹ in wastewater; Fe 5842–78 000, Mn 585–10 889, Cu 206–7201, Zn 406–9000, Ni 22–3621, Cr 178–10 533, Co 17–114, Cd 13–141, Pb 67–50 171 mg kg⁻¹ in suspended material; and Fe 30 000–84 000, Mn 479–1230, Cu 378–8127, Zn 647–4010, Ni 164–1582, Cr 139–3281, Co 20–54, Cd 37–65, Pb 228–293 mg kg⁻¹ in bed residues. This indicates that SSI could be one of the point sources of metals pollution in the river system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3adrinking water 3aheavy metals 3aindustry 3ainventories 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3apollution 3arivers 3asediments 3awastewater 3azinc 3aIndia1 aMoturi, Mechah Charles Zuriels1 aSubramanian, Vaidyanathan0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2004 Jan. 21, v. 5, no. 6 p.906-912dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b306628b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245009300173300001600266520090400282592002801186650001501214650001101229650003101240650002101271650001901292650001201311650001101323650001301334650000901347650001101356650000701367650001501374650001301389650001401402650001201416650001601428650002001444650001101464651001601475651000901491653002201500653001901522653001401541653002101555700002001576700001801596700002701614700001901641773010601660856008801766852000901854655001201863IND60589468620221119004821.0200503e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058946862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaleh, Abolfazl10aHydrochemistry and nutrient distribution in southern deep-water basin of the Caspian Sea  ap. 406-411.  aIn this work, the results of hydrochemical studies aboard the R/V Iran Behshahr in southern Caspian Sea in late-winter 2014 were presented.

Part 1: Methodology and Initial Evaluation  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMonitoring coherently the Amazon Water Cycle (WC) using satellite observations is crucial for climate and water resources studies. The SAtellite Water Cycle (SAWC) integration methodology is introduced to optimize the satellite datasets. In this paper, the WC budget is balanced simultaneously over 10 sub‐basins by constraining the horizontal water exchanges between them. Compared to an actual assimilation analysis, SAWC benefits from the use of water storage observations from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment. SAWC corrects the satellite evapotranspiration datasets that tend to under‐estimate the water‐limited evaporation over the central Amazon and to over‐estimate the energy‐limited evaporation over the northern Amazon. The SAWC precipitation estimates are evaluated against gauge measurements and show good overall results with a correlation varying from 0.94 to 0.99 and root‐mean‐square deviation between 16 and 41 mm/month (≃10% of precipitation estimate).  aPublisher supplied data  aN16H06291cMEXT, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic cycle 3aresearch 3asatellites 3awater 3awater storage 3aAmazonia1 aAires, Filipe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9426-866X1 aYamazaki, Dai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6478-18411 aPapa, Fabrice1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6305-62530 tWater resources research.g2021 May, v. 57, no. 5 p.e2020WR028647-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020WR0286473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01409naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013300154300002000287520025500307592002800562650002300590650002300613650001300636650002100649650002100670650001800691650001100709700001600720700001400736700001200750700001900762700001700781700001800798773013600816856007400952852000901026655001201035IND60660975720221121114024.0190827e20150618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066097572DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc02808f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Nan10aOxygen electroreduction promoted by quasi oxygen vacancies in metal oxide nanoparticles prepared by photoinduced chlorine doping  ap. 10620-10623.  aQuasi oxygen-deficient indium tin oxide nanoparticles (ITO NPs) were prepared by photoinduced chlorine doping, and exhibited much enhanced electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, as compared with pristine ITO.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3achlorine 3aelectrochemistry 3aindium tin oxide 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen1 aNiu, Wenhan1 aLi, Ligui1 aLiu, Ji1 aTang, Zhenghua1 aZhou, Weijia1 aChen, Shaowei0 tChemical communications.g2015 June 18, v. 51, no. 53 p.10620-10623dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5cc02808f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245013000172300001600302520165900318592002801977650001302005650001202018650002002030650000902050650001702059650001602076650001502092650001102107650001102118650002102129650002102150650001202171650000902183650001002192653002302202653001502225653001502240700001602255700001702271700001802288700001602306773015202322856007902474852000902553655001202562IND60561731620221117221447.0190318e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056173162DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-112132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillettaz Robichaud, M.10aSystematic early obstetrical assistance at calving: I. Effects on dairy calf stillbirth, vigor, and passive immunity transfer  ap. 691-702.  aA critical time for dairy cattle is the perinatal period. Good calving management is critical to reduce periparturient losses and ensure the health of the offspring. Generally, it has been recommended that cows be allowed to calve unassisted when possible, but very few studies have been published that support or refute this general guideline. To investigate the effect of early assistance, a clinical trial enrolled 257 Holstein cows that were observed through the second stage of calving and assigned randomly to 1 of 2 calving interventions: not assisted (NA) or early assistance (EA) during the second stage of parturition. Early assistance was given 15min after the first sight of both front hooves of the calf and done using only human force. After calving, the animals were classified into 4 actual calving intervention groups: too quick to be assisted (TQ), NA, EA, and late assistance (LA; for cows in the NA group that did not calve unassisted within the 1h maximum time frame allowed). Giving early assistance to cows during calving as a routine management practice (assigned intervention) did not negatively influence calves’ stillbirth risk, vigor at birth, or transfer of passive immunity. Calves in the LA intervention group had significantly greater odds of stillbirth than calves in the NA and EA groups, respectively. Calves in the LA group also had significantly worse vigor at birth than calves in the TQ, NA, or EA groups. Early assistance given at calving to cows that did not present signs of calving difficulties did not adversely affect calves’ likelihood of being stillborn, vigor at birth, or transfer of passive immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3acalving 3aclinical trials 3acows 3adairy calves 3afetal death 3aguidelines 3ahooves 3ahumans 3apassive immunity 3aperinatal period 3aprogeny 3arisk 3avigor 0acalving assistance 0astillbirth 0acalf vigor1 aPearl, D.L.1 aGodden, S.M.1 aLeBlanc, S.J.1 aHaley, D.B.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 Jan., v. 100, no. 1 p.691-702dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-112133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03619naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245016100159300001800320500002000338520218600358592002802544650002702572650001702599650001302616650002702629650002302656650001302679650001802692650001902710650001402729650002102743650001102764650001502775650001402790650001202804650001702816650002502833650001802858700001602876700001802892700001902910773013302929856007803062852000903140655001203149IND60524273720221119173205.0160705e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052427372DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2015002372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Bing10aLifelong diet including common unsaturated fatty acids extends the lifespan and affects oxidation in Caenorhabditis elegans consistently with hormesis model  ap. 1084-1092.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDiets abundant in unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) help to support a longer and healthier life. We evaluated effects of dietary oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LnA), and linolenic acid (ALA) on lifespan and physical activities of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Supplementation at doses per plate of 0.5 mg OA, 0.1 mg LnA, or 0.5 mg ALA extended the lifespan of C. elegans by 10.49, 14.17, or 8.47%, respectively (p < 0.05). At these doses, LnA and ALA significantly inhibited growth, pharyngeal pumping, reproduction, and respiration (p < 0.05), while OA did not influence these physiological activities (p > 0.05). Furthermore, OA significantly increased superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities. Based on results obtained with wild‐type N2, eat‐2, and sod‐2‐mutated C. elegans, OA extended C. elegans lifespan through a hormesis mechanism by activating antioxidant enzymes. In contrast, LnA and ALA acted via a caloric restriction mechanism. Consistent with calorie restriction being a type of stress, however, lifespan was shortened as LnA and ALA doses were further increased. Therefore, the effects of all three fatty acids might be regarded as being consistent with a classic hormesis effect. Practical applications: Oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid are the three most common unsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils. The beneficial effects of oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid supplementation on lifespan, normal physiological activities, and oxidation in our study support consumers choosing vegetable oils in their diets. Supplementation with 0.5 mg OA, 0.1 mg LnA or 0.5 mg ALA extended the lifespan of C. elegans by 10.49%, 14.17% or 8.47%, respectively (p < 0.05). At these doses, LnA and ALA significantly inhibited growth, pharyngeal pumping, reproduction and respiration, while OA did not influence these physiological activities and significantly increased superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities. Using the eat‐2, and sod‐2 mutated strains, the anti‐aging mechanism of OA was hormesis, while LnA and ALA acted via caloric restriction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aantioxidants 3acatalase 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrowth retardation 3ahormesis 3alinoleic acid 3alinolenic acid 3alongevity 3alow calorie diet 3amodels 3aoleic acid 3aoxidation 3apharynx 3areproduction 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avegetable oil1 aZhang, Ming1 aRen, Fa Zheng1 aZhou, Xiao Dan0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2016 July, v. 118, no. 7 p.1084-1092dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2015002373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014700165300001800312520142800330592002801758650001601786650001001802650001601812650001701828650001201845650001901857650003901876650001801915651001201933700001601945700001601961700002201977773013001999856008102129852000902210655001202219IND60645677920221123041932.0190529e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064567792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-018-1692-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHung, Le Dinh14aThe lectin accumulation, growth rate, carrageenan yield, and quality from the red alga Kappaphycus striatus cultivated at Camranh Bay, Vietnam  ap. 1991-1998.  aThe red alga Kappaphycus striatus was cultivated at Camranh Bay of Vietnam. For a 30 day cultivation period, the alga showed the higher growth rates (4.1–5.8% day⁻¹) and lectin contents (747–906 μg g⁻¹ dry alga) from October 2014 to April 2015 and in September 2015, while lower growth rates (2.5–3.1% day⁻¹) and lectin contents (63–324 μg g⁻¹ dry alga) were found from May to August 2015. The bands of 28,000 Da of algal crude extracts from October 2014 to April 2015 and from August to September 2015 were detected for lectin by SDS-PAGE, whereas these bands were not recorded from May to July 2015. The carrageenan quality was determined for a 60-day cultivation period; the carrageenan yield and gel strength showed little variation with the higher values (28.1–28.7% and 855–935 g cm⁻², respectively) obtained from November 2014 to March 2015 and lower ones (25.1–26.7% and 555–758 g cm⁻², respectively) from April to September 2015. The data on moisture content (33.5–36.8%), clean anhydrous algal/salt ratio (0.92–1.07), and carrageenan yield obtained in this study fulfilled those of standards for carrageenophytes. This study shows that the red alga K. striatus can be grown in the tropical waters of the Camranh Bay during the northeast monsoon and a part of the southwest monsoon as a source not only of carrageenan, but also of valuable lectins for application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKappaphycus 3aalgae 3acarrageenan 3agel strength 3alectins 3amonsoon season 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3awater content 3aVietnam1 aHoa, Le Thi1 aHau, Le Nhu1 aTrung, Dinh Thanh0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2019 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.1991-1998dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-018-1692-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010500168300001800273520141200291592002801703650001901731650001301750650001201763650001301775650002201788650002001810650001001830650000901840650001401849650001501863650002301878650001601901650001101917650001201928653004901940653003201989653001902021700001502040700001502055700001502070700001602085700001802101700005402119773014302173856008502316852000902401655001202410IND60682168320221118235829.0200127e20200106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068216832DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b055852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Caiqin10aTolerance of Aceticlastic Methanogenesis Enhanced by Magnetite under the Condition of Ammonia Stress  ap. 1417-1426.  aMagnetite-mediated direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) has been considered as an effective mechanism to proceed the syntrophic methanogenic metabolism. However, the enhancement effect of magnetite on the methanogenesis via DIET is occasionally insignificant. Several clues have shown that the dominant aceticlastic methanogenesis could be a restrictive factor for the DIET enhancement of magnetite. To prove this, ammonia was used to inhibit the aceticlastic methanogenesis, and response of microorganisms to the ammonia stress in the presence of magnetite (2 g Fe/L, group M) and silica (2 g Si/L, group S) was investigated. Results showed that under the low ammonium concentration condition (147.3 mg-NH₄⁺-N/L), aceticlastic methanogenesis was dominant in both groups, and the effect of magnetite addition was insignificant. With increasing ammonium concentration to above 1600 mg-NH₄⁺-N/L, the methanization of acetate in both groups was inhibited. However, the methane production rate of group M was 50% higher than that of group S, and the candidate DIET partner Methanosarcina became more competitive in the presence of magnetite. The increase of key enzyme activities and expression of functional genes involved in the acetoclastic methanogenesis in group M indicated that the tolerance of aceticlastic methanogenesis could be enhanced by the magnetite addition under ammonia stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanosarcina 3aacetates 3aammonia 3aammonium 3aelectron transfer 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3airon 3amagnetite 3ametabolism 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3asilica 3asilicon 0aDirect interspecies electron transfer (DIET) 0aAceticlastic methanogenesis 0aAmmonia stress1 aWang, Chen1 aLiu, Jieyi1 aXu, Qiujin1 aHan, Zixian1 aXu, Xiangyang1 aZhu, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0921-70760 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Jan. 06, v. 8, no. 3 p.1417-1426dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b055853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245013800175300001600313520105000329592002801379650001401407650002301421650002201444650001301466650001301479650001901492650001101511650002101522650001401543650001801557650001401575650001301589650002001602651001301622653001101635653001601646653001901662653001301681653001101694700003001705700002301735700002801758700001801786773010601804856008801910852000901998655001202007IND60589468820221119004914.0200503e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058946882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanapiah, Munirah10aIsolation, characterization, and identification of potential Diuron-degrading bacteria from surface sediments of Port Klang, Malaysia  ap. 453-457.  aDiuron is an alternative biocide suggested to replace organotin in formulating antifouling paints to be applied on water-going vessels hull. However, it is potentially harmful to various non-targeted marine organisms due to its toxic properties. Present study aimed to isolate, screen and identify the potential of Diuron-degrading bacteria collected from the marine sediments of Port Klang, Malaysia. Preliminary screening was conducted by exposing isolated bacteria to 430ng/L (background level), followed by 600ng/L and 1000ng/L of Diuron concentrations. Nine bacteria colonies survived the exposure of the above concentrations. However, only two strains can tolerate to survive up to 1000μg/L, which were then characterised and identified using phenotypic tests and the standard 16S rRNA molecular identification. The strains were identified as Comamonas jiangduensis SZZ 10 and Bacillus aerius SZZ 19 (GenBank accession numbers: KU942479 and KU942480, respectively). Both strains have the potential of Diuron biodegradation for future use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aComamonas 3aantifouling agents 3aaquatic organisms 3abacteria 3abiocides 3abiodegradation 3adiuron 3amarine sediments 3aphenotype 3aribosomal RNA 3ascreening 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 3aMalaysia 0aDiuron 0aAntifouling 0aBiodegradation 0aBacteria 0aMarine1 aZulkifli, Syaizwan Zahmir1 aMustafa, Muskhazli1 aMohamat-Yusuff, Ferdaus1 aIsmail, Ahmad0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2018 Feb., v. 127 p.453-457dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245009600165300001600261520154500277592002801822650002601850650001901876650001501895650002401910650001101934650001801945650001601963650001501979650001601994650001702010653001502027653002602042653003002068653001502098653002702113653001802140700002202158700002302180700002102203700002602224700002202250773010302272856008102375852000902456655001202465IND60130972120221118112214.0151127e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013097212DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-D-13-00174.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVargas, Jose J.10aBiokinetics and Efficacy of Aminocyclopyrachlor-Methyl Ester as Influenced by Diflufenzopyr  ap. 538-547.  aResearch studies evaluated effects of the auxin transport inhibitor, diflufenzopyr, on the biokinetics and efficacy of aminocyclopyrachlor-methyl ester (AMCP-ME) applications to black nightshade and large crabgrass. Absorption, translocation, and metabolism of ¹⁴C-AMCP-ME was quantified with and without diflufenzopyr (35 g ai ha⁻¹). Diflufenzopyr had minimal effects on translocation of radioactivity in either species. Accumulation of radioactivity in aboveground plant sections of black nightshade was greater than or equal to that in large crabgrass by 72 h after treatment (HAT). In both species, metabolism of ¹⁴C-AMCP-ME was rapid, as 60 to 78% of the extracted radioactivity was the free acid metabolite 8 HAT. In the greenhouse, black nightshade and large crabgrass were treated with AMCP-ME (9, 18, and 35 g ai ha⁻¹) alone and in combination with diflufenzopyr (35 g ha⁻¹). Mixtures of AMCP-ME plus diflufenzopyr did not increase large crabgrass control compared with AMCP-ME alone at any time. Diflufenzopyr (35 g ha⁻¹) increased black nightshade control with AMCP-ME (18 and 35 g ha⁻¹) 7 d after treatment (DAT). However, this increase in control was not observed 14 or 28 DAT. All treatments containing AMCP-ME controlled large crabgrass 70 to 79% 28 DAT compared with > 93% for black nightshade at the same time point.Nomenclature: Aminocyclopyrachlor; aminocyclopyrachlor-methyl ester; diflufenzopyr; black nightshade, Solanum nigrum L.; large crabgrass, Digitaria sanguinalis (L.)

This study used the eddy covariance (EC) technique to examine the impact of mountain pine beetle (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak on the gross ecosystem photosynthesis (Pg), ecosystem respiration (Râ) and net ecosystem production (NEP), of two lodgepole pine-dominated stands in the central interior of British Columbia. MPB-06, an 85-year-old stand, was first attacked in 2006 and by 2010 only â¼16% of the trees remained healthy. MPB-03, a 110-year-old stand with a developed secondary structure (tree seedlings and saplings, sub-canopy and canopy trees that survive the attack), was first attacked in 2003 and by 2007 had >95% pine canopy mortality. Annual NEP increased each year at MPB-06, from â81g Cmâ»Â² in 2007 to 64g Cmâ»Â² in 2010, due to an increase in Pg from 440g Cmâ»Â² in 2007 to 576g Cmâ»Â² in 2010. Annual Râ was more conservative, ranging from 512g Cmâ»Â² in 2010 to 557g Cmâ»Â² in 2008. At MPB-03, NEP increased from â57g Cmâ»Â² in 2007 to 3 and 6g Cmâ»Â² in 2008 and 2009 before falling to â26g Cmâ»Â² in 2010. Between 2007 and 2010, Pg and Râ ranged from 430 to 516g Cmâ»Â² and from 487 to 513g Cmâ»Â², respectively. Variation in NEP at both sites was mainly a result of changes in Pg. At MPB-03, Pg was reduced by drought during the 2009 and 2010 growing seasons. An empirical logistic equation best described the relationship between Râ and soil temperature at 5-cm depth (Tâ), and the relationship varied significantly over the four years at both sites. At both sites, over the 4 years the ratio of the growing season totals of modelled Râ using nighttime and daytime NEP data was well within 15% with the exception of 2010 at MPB-06. Growing season averages of foliar net assimilation followed a similar trend as average growing season Pg, increasing from 2007 to 2009 at MPB-06, and decreasing in response to drought in 2009 and 2010 at MPB-03. Growing season water use efficiency (Pg/evapotranspiration) increased from 2.2 to 2.8g C(kg HâO)â»Â¹ from 2007 to 2010 at MPB-06, and ranged from 1.7 to 2.0g C(kg HâO)â»Â¹ between 2007 and 2010 at MPB-03. Spring NEP was an important determinant of the annual C balance at both sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendroctonus ponderosae 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3aannuals 3acanopy 3acarbon 3adrought 3aecosystem respiration 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3aequations 3aevapotranspiration 3aforests 3agrowing season 3amortality 3anet ecosystem production 3aphotosynthesis 3asaplings 3aseedlings 3asoil temperature 3awater use efficiency 3aBritish Columbia1 aBlack, T.

Integrin activation encompasses both increased integrin monomer affinity and increased receptor clustering [6] and depends on integrin-talin interactions [5]. Loss of kindlins results in reduced activation of integrins [7–13]. Kindlins might promote talin binding to integrins through a cooperative mechanism [5, 14–16]; however, kindlins do not increase talin association with integrins [17]. Here, we report that, unlike talin head domain (THD), kindlin-3 has little effect on the affinity of purified monomeric αIIbβ3, and it does not enhance activation by THD. Furthermore, studies with ligands of varying valency show that kindlins primarily increase cellular αIIbβ3 avidity rather than monomer affinity. In platelets or nucleated cells, loss of kindlins markedly reduces αIIbβ3 binding to multivalent but not monovalent ligands. Finally, silencing of kindlins reduces the clustering of ligand-occupied αIIbβ3 as revealed by total internal reflection fluorescence and electron microscopy. Thus, in contrast to talins, kindlins have little primary effect on integrin αIIbβ3 affinity for monovalent ligands and increase multivalent ligand binding by promoting the clustering of talin-activated integrins.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell movement 3aelectron microscopy 3aextracellular matrix 3afluorescence 3ahemostasis 3aintegrins 3ametastasis 3atalin 3athrombosis 2aAnimals 2aBlood Plateletsxmetabolism 2aCytoskeletal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHEK293 Cells 2aHumans 2aLigands 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aNeoplasm Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlatelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complexxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aPetrich, Brian G.1 aAnekal, Praju1 aLefort, Craig T.1 aKasirer-Friede, Ana1 aShattil, Sanford J.1 aRuppert, Raphael1 aMoser, Markus1 aFässler, Reinhard1 aGinsberg, Mark H.0 tCurrent biology.g2013 Nov. 18, v. 23, no. 22 p.2288-2295dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.09.0503Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03466naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245021000159300001600369520209000385592002802475650002102503650001002524650002902534650002002563650000902583650001202592650001402604650001902618650000902637650001302646650000902659650001202668650000902680650001402689650002302703650001102726651001202737700002802749700002002777773014202797856007202939852000903011655001203020IND60661860620221119095248.0190904e20040121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066186062DNAL7 a10.1039/b307140e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGivelet, Nicolas10aPredominant anthropogenic sources and rates of atmospheric mercury accumulation in southern Ontario recorded by peat cores from three bogs: comparison with natural “background” values (past 8000 years)  ap. 935-949.  aPeat cores from three bogs in southern Ontario provide a complete, quantitative record of net rates of atmospheric Hg accumulation since pre-industrial times. For comparison with modern values, a peat core extending back 8000 years was used to quantify the natural variations in Hg fluxes for this region, and their dependence on climatic change and land use history. The net mercury accumulation rates were separated into “natural” and “excess” components by comparing the Hg/Br ratios of modern samples with the long-term, pre-anthropogenic average Hg/Br. The average background mercury accumulation rate during the pre-anthropogenic period (from 5700 years BC to 1470 AD) was 1.4 ± 1.0 µg m⁻² per year (n = 197). The beginning of Hg contamination from anthropogenic sources dates from AD 1475 at the Luther Bog, corresponding to biomass burning for agricultural activities by Native North Americans. During the late 17th and 18th centuries, deposition of anthropogenic Hg was at least equal to that of Hg from natural sources. Anthropogenic inputs of Hg to the bogs have dominated continuously since the beginning of the 19th century. The maximum Hg accumulation rates decrease in the order Sifton Bog, in the City of London, Ontario (141 µg Hg m⁻² per year), Luther Bog in an agricultural region (89 µg Hg m⁻² per year), and Spruce Bog which is in a comparatively remote, forested region (54 µg Hg m⁻² per year). Accurate age dating of recent peat samples using the bomb pulse curve of ¹⁴C shows that the maximum rate of atmospheric Hg accumulation occurred during AD 1956 and 1959 at all sites. In these (modern) samples, the Hg concentration profiles resemble those of Pb, an element which is known to be immobile in peat bogs. The correlation between these two metals, together with sulfur, suggests that the predominant anthropogenic source of Hg (and Pb) was coal burning. While Hg accumulation rates have gone into strong decline since the late 1950's, Hg deposition rates today still exceed the average natural background values by 7 to 13 times.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmerican Indians 3aPicea 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass burning 3abogs 3abromine 3acarbon 14 3aclimate change 3acoal 3aland use 3alead 3amercury 3apeat 3apeatlands 3aradiocarbon dating 3asulfur 3aOntario1 aRoos-Barraclough, Fiona1 aShotyk, William0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2004 Jan. 21, v. 5, no. 6 p.935-949dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b307140e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245012800165300001600293520185200309592002802161650002702189650001702216650001002233650002402243650002302267650001102290650001402301650002302315650001602338650001802354650001002372650000702382650003302389650000902422650001202431650001402443650001102457653001802468653002602486653001802512653002002530700002902550700002302579700002202602700002402624700002902648700002802677773015202705856007902857852000902936655001202945IND60561731920221117221434.0190318e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056173192DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-113152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Marion P.10aConsumer perception, health information, and instrumental parameters of cupuassu (Theobroma grandiflorum) goat milk yogurts  ap. 157-168.  aAlthough the demand for goat milk products has been growing, they have lower consumer acceptability than products derived from cow milk. However, the addition of cupuassu pulp can be used to improve the formulation of these products. For this reason, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of new goat milk yogurt manufactured with cupuassu pulp on physicochemical properties, consumers’ perceptions, and overall consumer acceptance. In addition, the effect of antioxidant health information on consumer acceptance and purchase intention of cupuassu goat milk yogurts was evaluated. The results demonstrated a positive expectation regarding linking and familiarity to goat milk products and products with cupuassu pulp. The pH, total phenolic content, lightness, redness, yellowness, and apparent viscosity were potentially affected by the addition of cupuassu, with the highest concentration of cupuassu (10%) exhibiting the greatest changes in parameters. Based on principal component analysis, partial least squares regression, and just-about-right and penalty analysis, the addition of cupuassu pulp improved some sensory attributes of goat milk yogurt, such as cupuassu aroma, cupuassu flavor, yellow color, consistency, and viscosity, which positively influenced product acceptance. In addition, antioxidant health information increased the acceptance and purchase intention of cupuassu goat milk yogurts. Taking into account the parameters investigated in this study, the best scoring formulation was goat milk yogurt with 10% cupuassu pulp. Our results suggest that cupuassu pulp can be considered a potential ingredient to improve the sensory and texture properties of goat milk yogurt. Furthermore, the antioxidant health information could be a sensory strategy to increase the acceptance of cupuassu goat milk yogurts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTheobroma grandiflorum 3aantioxidants 3acolor 3aconsumer acceptance 3aconsumer attitudes 3aflavor 3agoat milk 3ahealth information 3aingredients 3aleast squares 3aodors 3apH 3aprincipal component analysis 3apulp 3atexture 3aviscosity 3ayogurt 0anovel product 0ainstrumental analysis 0ahealth claims 0aexpected liking1 aMonteiro, Maria Lucia G.1 aFrasao, Beatriz S.1 aSilva, Vitor L.M.1 aRodrigues, Bruna L.1 aChiappini, Claudete C.J.1 aConte-Junior, Carlos A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 Jan., v. 100, no. 1 p.157-168dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-113153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011800172300001600290520075300306592002801059596007201087650002701159650002801186650002701214650001601241650001001257650001501267650001001282650001801292650001101310650002001321650001501341650001801356650001801374651001201392653001501404653001901419653002901438653003101467700001801498700001601516773013501532856008501667852000901752655001201761IND60704235420221121223436.0200722e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070423542DNAL7 a10.1080/1533015X.2019.15865972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarner, Laura A.10aExploring blue space as a tool for promoting good fertilizer practices among Florida residential fertilizer users  ap. 274-286.  aDifferences in attitudes, perceived behavioral control, social norms (i.e., influence of others), and intent to engage in good residential landscape fertilizer practices were examined among people with high- and low-exposure to water bodies (blue space).

The high-exposure group perceived significantly more social pressure and had greater intent to engage in good fertilizer practices. Blue space exposure positively relates to fertilizer practices that can protect water quality. Environmental education professionals should consider integrating exposure to water bodies through in-person or virtual experiences.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Florida Center for Landscape Conservation and Ecology 3aattitudes and opinions 3aenvironmental education 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3alakes 3alandscapes 3aponds 3aprofessionals 3arivers 3asocial behavior 3astormwater 3asurface water 3awater quality 3aFlorida 0aBlue space 0afertilizer use 0ahome landscape practices 0atheory of planned behavior1 aDiaz, John M.1 aGusto, Cody0 tApplied environmental education and communication.g2020 July 2, v. 19, no. 3 p.274-286dRoutledgewJournal:12310x1533-03897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1533015X.2019.15865973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245011100180300001400291520151300305592002801818650002901846650002101875650001301896650001501909650002601924650001801950650001201968650001501980650001601995650001402011650001302025650000902038650001502047650001102062650001402073650001702087651001302104653001302117653001302130653000902143653002402152700001702176700001902193700001702212700001902229700001902248773012702267856008202394852000902476655001202485IND60516390720221121130035.0190727e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051639072DNAL7 a265685572pmid7 a10.1017/S002202991500062X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCha, Elva10aEvidence of no protection for a recurrent case of pathogen specific clinical mastitis from a previous case  ap. 72-80.  aThe objective of this study was to determine whether the occurrence of a previous case of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis (CM) protects Holstein dairy cows against a recurrent case. Pathogens studied were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Klebsiella spp., and Trueperella pyogenes. A total of 40 864 lactations (17 265 primiparous and 23 599 multiparous) from 19 835 cows from 5 large, high milk producing New York State dairy herds were analysed. We estimated the effects of parity, calving diseases, milk yield, current season and number of CM cases in the previous lactation on the risk of a first CM case using generalised linear mixed models with a log link and Poisson error distribution. The aforementioned risk factors and the occurrence of previous cases of pathogen-specific CM within the current lactation were evaluated as risks for second and third cases of pathogen-specific CM. Cows with more CM cases in the previous lactation were at greater risk of pathogen-specific CM in the current lactation. Multiparous cows were at greater risk of a second CM case if they had suffered from a first CM case that was caused by the same pathogen as the second case. In contrast, a second CM case generally put cows at greater risk of a third case, irrespective of whether the third case was caused by the same or a different pathogen. Our results showed that a previous case of pathogen specific CM does not generally protect against a recurrent case.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArcanobacterium pyogenes 3aEscherichia coli 3aHolstein 3aKlebsiella 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus 3acalving 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3alactation 3amastitis 3amilk 3amilk yield 3amodels 3apathogens 3arisk factors 3aNew York 0aMastitis 0apathogen 0arisk 0arecurrent mastitis.1 aHertl, Julia1 aSchukken, Ynte1 aTauer, Loren1 aWelcome, Frank1 aGröhn, Yrjö,0 tJournal of dairy research.g2016 Feb., v. 83, no. 1 p.72-80dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S002202991500062X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012700170300001400297520162600311592002801937650001601965650001301981650002601994650001502020650001102035650001402046650001802060650001602078650001602094650001902110650001702129650001302146650001902159650001702178650001302195700002302208773009102231856008102322990002302403852000902426655001202435IND60096239920221119070541.0141104e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009623992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csr.2013.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhodse, Vishwas B.10aDistribution, origin and transformation of amino sugars and bacterial contribution to estuarine particulate organic matter  ap. 33-42.  aAmino sugars including bacterial biomarker muramic acid (Mur) were investigated in suspended particulate matter (SPM) to understand their distribution, origin, and biogeochemical cycling and the contribution of bacteria to particulate organic matter (POM) of the Mandovi estuary. SPM was collected from 9 sampling stations in the Mandovi estuary during the pre-monsoon (March) and monsoon (August). Total particulate amino sugar (TPAS) concentrations and yields varied spatially and were 2 to 5 times higher during the monsoon than the pre-monsoon. Negative correlation between salinity and TPAS-C yields [TPAS-C/particulate organic carbon (POC)×100] indicates the influence of terrestrial organic matter on the transport of TPAS-carbon. Glucosamine (GlcN), galactosamine (GalN), and mannosamine (ManN) were abundant during the monsoon. Low GlcN/GalN ratios (<3) indicate bacteria as the major source of amino sugars. Higher amino sugar yields and lower GlcN/GalN ratios during the monsoon than the pre-monsoon indicate enhanced transformation and greater bacterial contribution to POM during the former season. Degradation trends observed with TPAS were well supported by those obtained with carbohydrates and amino acids. Based on Mur concentrations, bacteria accounted for 24% to 35% of the POC and 24% to 62% of the total particulate nitrogen (TPN). Intact bacterial cells, however accounted for a small proportion of POC (2.5% to 4%) and TPN (9% to 11%). Our study suggests that POM was subjected to extensive diagenetic transformation, and its composition was influenced by bacteria, especially during the monsoon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomarkers 3acarbon 3aestuaries 3agalactosamine 3aglucosamine 3amannosamine 3amonsoon season 3amuramic acid 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aparticulates 3asalinity1 aBhosle, Narayan B.0 tContinental shelf research.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 68 p.33-42dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2013.08.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04375naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245014300166300001800309500002000327520302300347592002803370650001503398650002503413650000903438650001703447650001403464650002403478650001903502650003303521650001303554650001703567650001603584650001303600650001003613650001503623650001703638650001603655650001603671700002203687773013303709856007803842852000903920655001203929IND60524274220221119173234.0160705e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052427422DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2015001832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiger, Aleksander14aThe long‐term storage of cold‐pressed oil from roasted rapeseed: Effects on antioxidant activity and levels of canolol and tocopherols  ap. 1030-1041.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this study was to determine the oxidative stability of rapeseed oils cold pressed from seeds roasted at 140, 160, or 180°C for 5, 10, or 15 min versus the control (oil from unroasted seeds). The oils were stored for a period of 1 year. After 6 and 12 months of storage, the samples were analyzed to determine their peroxide and acid values, the levels of bioactive substances (tocopherols, plastochromanol‐8, and canolol), as well as antioxidant activity (DPPH test). It was shown that roasting the rapeseeds had a significant effect on the oxidative stability of the oils, which increased by almost 50%. In the case of oils pressed from seeds roasted at 140 and 160°C, it was shown that the longer the seeds were roasted, the smaller the reduction in canolol content. After 6 months of storage, the percentage decrease in the canolol content of oils from roasted seeds was recorded to be at a level comparable to that of the control. After 1 year of storage, the percentage loss of canolol was markedly lower (from 18 to 45%) than in the control (61%). The reduction in tocopherol levels was dependent on the duration of storage and on the type of sample. Principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed that the oxidative stability of oils produced from roasted seeds, particularly from those roasted at 180°C, was markedly higher than that of the other samples obtained from roasted seeds and the control. Practical applications: Studies concerning oxidative stability are most typically conducted by applying so‐called accelerated aging tests performed at high temperatures (Rancimat, Oxidograph test). In practice, this undermines the reliability of the results, since it is difficult to draw conclusions about the actual shelf life of a product, on account of the various mechanisms of the oxidation process. At high temperatures, the primary reactions are connected with polymerization and cyclization, which are not comparable to the reactions taking place under normal conditions. The analysis conducted here made it possible to follow the changes during the storage of the oil and the rate of degradation of bioactive substances reflecting cold‐storage conditions. Rapeseed oils cold pressed from seeds subjected to roasting (140–180°C for 5–15 min) were compared to rapeseed oil that was cold pressed from seeds not exposed to elevated temperatures through an analysis of their oxidative stability, antioxidant activity, and levels of bioactive substances (tocopherols, plastochromanol‐8, and canolol). The oils were stored for a period of 12 months at a temperature reflecting cold storage conditions (4°C). It was shown that the oils produced from seeds roasted at 180°C in particular exhibited greater oxidative stability and the best antioxidant properties. Antioxidant activity was shown to correlate with the levels of canolol (r = 0.9927; p < 0.0001) and g‐T (r = 0.9765; p < 0.0001), as well as with total tocopherols (r = 0.9796; p < 0.0001).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid value 3aantioxidant activity 3acold 3acold storage 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3apolymerization 3aprincipal component analysis 3arapeseed 3arapeseed oil 3areliability 3aroasting 3aseeds 3ashelf life 3astorage time 3atemperature 3atocopherols1 aMichalak, Michał0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2016 July, v. 118, no. 7 p.1030-1041dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2015001833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03575naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003100166245011400197300001400311520169600325592002802021650001302049650001202062650002902074650000902103650001502112650000902127650001702136650002402153650002702177650001202204650002502216650001402241650000902255650001302264650002002277650002102297650001602318650003202334650002602366650001702392653001602409653001802425653001702443653001202460700001802472700003102490700002802521700003002549700002702579700002702606700004102633700002702674700003002701773012702731856008202858852000902940655001202949IND60516390820221121130049.0190727e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051639082DNAL7 a266106952pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299150006312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerutti, Weiler Giacomazza10aFatty acid profiles of milk and Minas frescal cheese from lactating grazed cows supplemented with peanut cake  ap. 42-49.  aMilk and Minas frescal cheese were evaluated from crossbred Holstein × Gir cows that were fed diets enriched with 0, 33, 66 and 100% inclusion levels of palm kernel cake in a concentrated supplement in replace of soybean meal. Eight crossbred lactating cows were distributed (four animals × four treatments × four periods) in the experimental design of double 4 × 4 Latin squares. The capric (C : 10, P = 0·0270), undecylic (C : 11, P = 0·0134), and lauric (C : 12, P = 0·0342) saturated fatty acid concentrations and CLA (C18 : 2c9t11, P = 0·0164) of the milk fat decreased linearly with an increasing percentage of peanut cake in the diet. The increased peanut cake content (100%) in the diet was associated with a linear decrease in C : 10 (P = 0·0447), C : 12 (P = 0·0002), mirystic (C : 14, P < 0·0001) and palmitic (C : 16, P < 0·0001) saturated fatty acid concentrations and an increase in arachidic, lignoceric, palmitoleic and elaidic acid levels in the Minas frescal cheese fat made from the milk. Both the milk and the Minas frescal cheese showed a linear decrease in the concentration of monosaturated fatty acids (P < 0·0001), atherogenicity index, and thrombogenicity index (P < 0·05), while the hypocholesterolaemic: hypercholesterolaemic and omega 6: omega 3 (P > 0·05) ratios were not influenced by the different peanut cake levels. The inclusion of up to 100% peanut cake as a substitution for soybean meal in the concentrate of grazing lactating cows resulted in changes in the nutritional quality of their milk products, as indicated by the increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids and the decrease of saturated fatty acids (lauric, myristic, and palmitic).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3acheeses 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3acows 3acrossbreds 3adiet 3aelaidic acid 3aexperimental design 3afatty acid composition 3agrazing 3ahypercholesterolemia 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk fat 3anutritive value 3apalm kernel cake 3apeanut cake 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3asoybean meal 0aFatty acids 0alipid profile 0aoilseed cake 0aomega 31 aViegas, Julio1 aBarbosa, Analívia Martins1 aOliveira, Ronaldo Lopes1 aDias, Carina Anunciação1 aCosta, Emellinne Souza1 aNornberg, José Laerte1 ade Carvalho, Gleidson Giordano Pinto1 aBezerra, Leilson Rocha1 aSilveira, Alisson Minozzo0 tJournal of dairy research.g2016 Feb., v. 83, no. 1 p.42-49dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299150006313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014500168300001100313520162200324592002801946650001401974650001101988650001701999650001902016650001302035650003402048650001102082650001602093650002502109650002302134650002302157650001202180650001402192650002402206650001102230650001602241700001902257700002102276700002002297700002302317700001902340773009902359856008302458852000902541655001202550IND60744151020221120094448.0211223e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074415102DNAL7 a10.1186/s40795-021-00433-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSekkarie, Ahlia10aAssociations of maternal diet and nutritional status with offspring hepatic steatosis in the Avon longitudinal study of parents and children  ap. 28.  aBACKGROUND: Priming for cardiometabolic diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is hypothesized to begin in utero. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether there is an association between maternal nutritional status and offspring NAFLD. METHODS: Data come from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) in the UK. The analytic sample included 3353 participants who had maternal information on pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain, diabetes, and free sugar intake as percent of total energy and were assessed for mild-severe hepatic steatosis at 24 years by transient elastography (controlled attenuation parameter score ≥ 248 dB/m). Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between maternal factors and offspring hepatic steatosis at 24 years. RESULTS: In confounder-adjusted models the independent associations for each maternal factor with mild to severe vs low hepatic steatosis at 24 years were: pre-pregnancy overweight (OR: 1.84, 95%CL: 1.43–2.38) or obesity (OR: 2.73, 95%CL: 1.84–4.03), more than recommended gestational weight gain (OR: 1.30, 95%CL: 1.04–1.64), diabetes (OR: 1.39, 95%CI: 0.87, 2.21), and high free sugar intake during pregnancy (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.82, 1.33). These associations were largely mediated by BMI at 24 years, but not by birthweight or breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that maternal nutritional status is associated with the development of NAFLD in their adult offspring, although the relationship is largely mediated by offspring BMI in adulthood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulthood 3aadults 3abirth weight 3abreast feeding 3adiabetes 3aelasticity imaging techniques 3aenergy 3afatty liver 3alongitudinal studies 3amaternal nutrition 3anutritional status 3aobesity 3apregnancy 3aregression analysis 3asugars 3aweight gain1 aWelsh, Jean A.1 aNorthstone, Kate1 aStein, Aryeh D.1 aRamakrishnan, Usha1 aVos, Miriam B.0 tBMC nutrition.g2021 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.28-28dBioMed CentralwJournal:27315x2055-09287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40795-021-00433-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245008400209300001800293520068500311592002800996650001001024650001101034650001101045650002001056650002201076650001301098650002301111650002401134650001001158650001701168650001301185650001701198650002301215653002301238653003301261653002401294653001901318700005801337700006401395700006301459773014301522856008501665852000901750655001201759IND60682168720221119000400.0200127e20191112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068216872DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b057412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProdius, Denis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9967-602110aSustainable Urban Mining of Critical Elements from Magnet and Electronic Wastes  ap. 1455-1463.  aA straightforward and environment-friendly process for acid-free leaching of rare-earth elements and cobalt, which are critical materials, from waste magnet materials has been developed. The process also allows for selective leaching of rare-earth elements from magnet-containing electronic wastes, such as end-of-life hard disk drives and electric motors. The use of copper salts eliminates the use of volatile toxic acids in the dissolution and separation processes, which allows for a more eco-friendly approach to recovering critical elements and a safer work environment.

Mitotic chromosome segregation must be coordinated with remodeling of other nuclear components, including the nuclear envelope (NE) and the non-membrane-bound nucleolus. Here, we show that in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, which breaks and reforms the NE during mitosis [1, 2], the evolutionary conserved LEM-domain protein Man1 promotes equal partitioning of the nuclear membrane, nucleolar remodeling, and efficient inheritance of the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) by the daughter nuclei. Analyses of man1 mutants and results obtained using an artificial chromatin-nuclear pore tether suggest that Man1 may exert its function by linking the NPCs to segregating chromatin. By integrating the partitioning of the nuclear membrane and nucleolar material with chromosome segregation, cells build two nearly identical copies of the original nucleus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3acell nucleolus 3acell proliferation 3achromatin 3achromosome segregation 3adaughters 3amitosis 3amutants 3anuclear membrane 3anucleoporins 2aAnaphasexgenetics 2aCell Nucleolusxgenetics 2aChromatinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMitosis 2aMutation 2aNuclear Envelopexgenetics 2aNuclear Porexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSchizosaccharomycesxcytologyxgenetics. 2aSpindle Apparatus1 aGu, Ying1 aOliferenko, Snezhana0 tCurrent biology.g2013 Nov. 18, v. 23, no. 22 p.2303-2310dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.09.0573Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015700165300001600322520165600338592002801994650000802022650001802030650002002048650001302068650002602081650002602107650001002133650003202143650001602175650002502191650002902216650002202245650002602267650001602293650003002309650001802339650000902357650001802366650002202384650001102406650001302417650001702430700001702447700001602464700001902480700001802499700001902517700002002536700001602556700001702572700001802589700001802607773011202625856008102737852000902818655001202827IND60440549820221117111530.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044054982DNAL7 a10.1007/s12374-015-0274-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Yong-Eok10aInvestigation into effects of transgenic glufosinate-resistant Zoysia grasses with herbicide application on bacterial communities under field conditions  ap. 303-310.  aZoysia grass (Zoysia japonica Steud.) is a commercially valuable turfgrass that is popularly cultivated for use in sports and recreational environments. A field study was conducted in 2013 to evaluate the effects of transgenic herbicide-resistant Zoysia grasses in combination with the herbicide glufosinate on microbial communities. We investigated population changes in cultivable total bacteria and glufosinateresistant bacteria using the traditional plate-count method. The results showed that total and glufosinate-resistant bacteria counts decreased in September. Significant differences in the abundance of cultivable bacteria were observed between Zoysia grass lines as well as between March and September samples in both glufosinate-treated and nontreated plots. However, there was no significant difference in the abundance of total cultivable bacteria between Zoysia grass lines in March or between Basta-treated and untreated plots in September. To assess the possible horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of the bar gene across microorganisms, total soil DNAs and genomic DNAs of glufosinate-resistant bacteria isolated from soils and water were analyzed by PCR. No positive DNA bands were found, indicating that HGT did not occur during this experimental period. We also investigated changes in taxonomic distribution of the bacterial community using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries constructed from soil samples. Although bacterial diversities increased in September, there were no significant differences in species richness between genetically modified (GM) and non-GM Zoysia grasses as well as between glufosinatetreated and untreated soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA libraries 3aZoysia japonica 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3afield experimentation 3agenes 3agenetically modified plants 3aglufosinate 3aherbicide resistance 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3amolecular cloning 3apesticide application 3aplate count 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3aspecies diversity 3asports 3ataxonomy 3aturf grasses1 aLee, Sun Hwa1 aRyu, Gil-Do1 aKang, Hong-Gyu1 aKwon, Yong-Ik1 aSun, Hyeon-Jin1 aPark, Kee Woong1 aLee, Bumkyu1 aSong, In-ja,1 aLim, Pyung-Ok1 aLee, Hyo-Yeon0 tJournal of plant biology =.g2015 Oct., v. 58, no. 5 p.303-310dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1226-92397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12374-015-0274-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245007400191300001400265520154600279592002801825650001301853650002201866650001901888650001301907650001901920650001101939650001501950650002001965650001501985650001602000650003002016650001102046651001002057651001002067700002002077700002102097773009402118856005502212852000902267655001202276IND4472259420221118075549.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447225942DNAL7 a214349082pmid7 a10.1111/j.1745-6584.2011.00815.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalter, Gary R.10aEstimating Aquifer Channel Recharge Using Optical Data Interpretation  ap. 68-76.  aRecharge through intermittent and ephemeral stream channels is believed to be a primary aquifer recharge process in arid and semiarid environments. The intermittent nature of precipitation and flow events in these channels, and their often remote locations, makes direct flow and loss measurements difficult and expensive. Airborne and satellite optical images were interpreted to evaluate aquifer recharge due to stream losses on the Frio River in south‐central Texas. Losses in the Frio River are believed to be a major contributor of recharge to the Edwards Aquifer. The results of this work indicate that interpretation of readily available remote sensing optical images can offer important insights into the spatial distribution of aquifer recharge from losing streams. In cases where upstream gauging data are available, simple visual analysis of the length of the flowing reach downstream from the gauging station can be used to estimate channel losses. In the case of the Frio River, the rate of channel loss estimated from the length of the flowing reach at low flows was about half of the loss rate calculated from in‐stream gain‐loss measurements. Analysis based on water‐surface width and channel slope indicated that losses were mainly in a reach downstream of the mapped recharge zone. The analysis based on water‐surface width, however, did not indicate that this method could yield accurate estimates of actual flow in pool and riffle streams, such as the Frio River and similar rivers draining the Edwards Plateau.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aephemeral streams 3aimage analysis 3aplateaus 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asatellites 3astream channels 2aAlgorithms 2aGroundwater 2aRemote Sensing Technology 2aRivers 3aTexas 0aTexas1 aNecsoiu, Marius1 aMcGinnis, Ronald0 tGround water.g2012 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.68-76dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0017-467X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2011.00815.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03722naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245018600170300001800356520179400374592002802168650004402196650002202240650003702262650002102299650002002320650002802340650002102368650001502389650002802404650001302432650001102445650002002456650001402476650001802490650001902508650001802527650003302545650001302578650001602591650003702607650001602644653002602660653002202686653001802708653002702726653002302753653002902776700002802805700005702833700001702890773014302907856008503050852000903135655001203144IND60682168820221119000236.0200127e20200106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068216882DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b057552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaby, Jeena N.10aEffect of Various Deep Eutectic Solvents on the Sustainable Synthesis of MgFe₂O₄ Nanoparticles for Simultaneous Electrochemical Determination of Nitrofurantoin and 4-Nitrophenol  ap. 1479-1486.  aThe innovations in the field of green chemistry have expedited the pace of advances in varied research areas ranging from the development of diverse routes for the material synthesis to designer solvents. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) integrating the metrics and principles of sustainability substitute the traditional hazardous and volatile reagents, which is significantly attracting the attention of research and industrial sectors. In view of that, we introduce deep eutectic-mediated solid-state synthesis of phase-pure magnesium ferrite nanoparticles at a temperature of 500 °C for the simultaneous detection of nitrofurantoin and 4-nitrophenol. The influence of five different DESs on the effectual formation, structure, and composition of magnesium ferrite nanoparticles was investigated through various techniques such as field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques are employed to evaluate the electrochemical behavior of as-synthesized samples toward the electrochemical detection of nitrofurantoin and 4-nitrophenol. Comparatively, the choline chloride and fructose DES-assisted nanometric magnesium ferrite (MgFe₂O₄)-modified electrode exhibits a higher sensitivity, lower detection limits (NFT = 33 nM and 4-NP = 7 nM), a linear range (0–342.6 μM), an excellent selectivity, and a good reproducibility. The practical applicability of the fabricated sensor was studied in water and fruit samples and thus affords satisfactory results for NFT and 4-NP detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acholine chloride 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aferrimagnetic materials 3afructose 3afruits 3agreen chemistry 3amagnesium 3ananoparticles 3anitrofurantoin 3ap-nitrophenol 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avoltammetry 0adeep eutectic solvent 0amagnesium ferrite 0a4-nitrophenol 0asimultaneous detection 0amodified electrode 0aelectrochemical approach1 aSriram, Balasubramanian1 aWang, Sea-Fue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8915-61801 aGeorge, Mary0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Jan. 06, v. 8, no. 3 p.1479-1486dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b057553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011300164300001400277520160000291592002801891650002701919650002201946650003001968650001101998650001402009650001402023650001002037650001602047650001802063650001102081650001902092650001202111650001702123651002402140651001802164700002102182700002002203700002102223700001602244700001902260700001802279773009402297856008102391852000902472655001202481IND60439561420221123015754.0151024e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043956142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-006-9174-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDivis, L. A.10aAgronomic and quality effects in winter wheat of a gene conditioning resistance to wheat streak mosaic virus  ap. 41-49.  aWheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) is one of the most important diseases limiting winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in the western Great Plains of North America. There is no known effective WSMV resistance within the primary gene pool of wheat. However, a resistance gene (Wsm1) has been transferred to wheat from a perennial relative, intermediate wheat-grass [Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & DR Dewey]. Nebraska-adapted winter wheat lines carrying Wsm1 were used to characterize the effects of this alien introgression on agronomic and quality traits. Sister-lines from six breeding populations were evaluated under virus-free conditions, and under a naturally occurring viral infection. In uninfected locations, no significant difference for grain yield was detected between resistant (R) and susceptible (S) lines, when averaged over populations, but resistant lines had significantly higher test weights. Within populations, significantly higher grain yield was observed only in population 1, while significantly higher test weights occurred in populations 1, 2, 5 and 6. At the infected location, resistant lines were significantly higher in yield in five of six populations. In two of six populations, susceptible lines were significantly higher in bread loaf volume and bake mix time, while in the remaining populations, no significant quality differences were observed. As the Wsm1 gene provided yield advantages under viral infection, and there was no yield detriment in the absence of the virus, its deployment in hard winter wheat cultivars merits consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThinopyrum intermedium 3aTriticum aestivum 3aWheat streak mosaic virus 3abreads 3acultivars 3agene pool 3agenes 3agrain yield 3aintrogression 3aloaves 3aplant breeding 3aviruses 3awinter wheat 3aGreat Plains region 3aNorth America1 aGraybosch, R.

This knowledge resource offer many advantages in terms of availability and affordability to the indigenous farming community. Assessment of this precious knowledge resource for its scientific rationality could be a step towards their integration in the formal research system. The study was conducted among 68 pulse researchers for assessment of their perception on indigenous knowledge as well as documented indigenous technical knowledge related to pulse production from Uttar Pradesh state. Majority of the researchers perceived that integration of indigenous knowledge in formal agricultural research could lead to easy adoption of technologies by the farming community (79.41%) and their integration with improved agriculture practices could make agriculture more sustainable (82.35%). More than 71 per cent of the researchers found the four documented indigenous practices related to pulse production to have high scientific base while about 58 per cent of the researchers perceived the indigenous practices relating to forecasting of insect pest to have high scientific base. Majority of the researchers (>75%) recommended the indigenous practices relating to crop protection for scientific validation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3aagricultural research 3acrop production 3afarming systems 3aindigenous knowledge 3ainsect pests 3alegumes 3aplant protection 3aresearchers 3aIndia 0aIndigenous 0aKnowledge 0aPerception 0aPulse production 0aResearchers 0aScientific rationality1 aDubey, Shantanu Kumar1 aSaxena, Hem1 aKumar, Rajesh0 tJournal of Community Mobilization and Sustainable Development.g2019 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.20-24dSociety for Community Mobilization for Sustainable DevelopmentwJournal:2289x2231-67367nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03442naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153100001200162245011500174300001600289500002400305500001500329520155800344650001901902650002201921650001701943650001601960650001901976650001201995650002002007650002802027650001002055650002302065650001002088650003302098650001302131650001902144650001302163650002402176650002602200650001902226653002002245653002402265653002102289653002602310653002602336653001502362653002402377653001902401700001802420700001702438700001302455700001802468773013902486852000902625856007502634930003302709945002502742946001302767655001202780IND4439562420221121043613.0100706e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443956242DNAL7 a10.1603/AN091702doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL400 0aL0011 aHu, Fei10aMorphological Characterization and Distribution of Antennal Sensilla of Six Fruit Flies (Diptera: Tephritidae)  ap. 661-670.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) are important pests of many fruits and vegetables. In this study, the external morphology, types, and distribution of antennal sensilla in both male and female adults of the six fruit fly species, including Bactrocera tau (Walker), Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett), Bactrocera minax (Enderlein), Bactrocera diaphora (Hendel), and Bactrocera scutellata (Hendel), were observed by using scanning electron microscopy. The antennae of the six fruit fly species consist of a basal scape, pedicel, and an elongated flagellum. Arising from the proximal dorsal ridge of flagellum there is an arista consisting of two short basal segments and a long thin distal segment. Six distinct morphological types of sensilla are recorded in both sexes, including microtrichial sensilla, sensilla chaetica, sensilla trichoid, sensilla basiconica, short type of sensilla basiconica, and sensilla coeloconica. The abundance and distribution of these six sensilla types on the antennae of both sexes are recorded. In addition, the possible functions of the above-mentioned sensilla types are discussed in light of previously published literature. The functions include the mechanoreception of microtrichial sensilla, sensilla chaetica, and sensilla trichoid; olfactory functions of sensilla basiconic, and sensilla coeloconica; and thermoreception of the short type of sensilla basiconica. Future functional antennal morphology and electrophysiological studies are needed to confirm these proposed functions. 3ainsect anatomy 3ainsect morphology 3ainsect pests 3amorphometry 3aimage analysis 3afemales 3ainsect behavior 3ainterspecific variation 3amales 3agender differences 3asmell 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensilla 3aultrastructure 3aantennae 3aBactrocera dorsalis 3aZeugodacus cucurbitae 3aZeugodacus tau 0aneurophysiology 0aspecies differences 0aBactrocera minax 0aBactrocera scutellata 0aBactrocera cucurbitae 0aBactrocera 0aBactrocera diaphora 0aBactrocera tau1 aZhang, Guo-Na1 aJia, Fu-Xian1 aDou, Wei1 aWang, Jin-Jun0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2010 July, v. 103, no. 4 p.661-670dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/AN091703Available from publisher's Web site  a20100920b20101001c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/08/20  aOther US 7aarticle03287naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011200163300001600275520171000291592002802001650002102029650001402050650001802064650001702082650001702099650003102116650001002147650003202157650001002189650000902199650002602208650001102234650001902245650002502264653002502289653002202314653002102336653002002357653001102377700001202388700001402400700001502414700001802429700001502447700001602462700001402478700001602492700001302508773012102521856008202642852000902724655001202733IND60528675320221123013007.0160716e20160429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052867532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.03.1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yufeng10aEnriched environment housing enhances the sensitivity of mouse pancreatic cancer to chemotherapeutic agents  ap. 593-599.  aLiving in an enriched housing environment is an established model of eustress and has been consistently shown to reduce the growth of transplanted tumors, including pancreatic cancer. Here, we further investigate the influence of an enriched environment (EE) on the efficacy of chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer. Male C57BL/6 mice were housed in EE or standard environment (SE) conditions and transplanted with syngeneic Panc02 pancreatic cancer cells. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or gemcitabine (GEM) to examine their sensitivities to chemotherapy. The results showed that both 5-FU and GEM exerted the dose dependent inhibition of tumor growth. The tumor inhibition rates of low-dose 5-FU and GEM were improved from 17.7% and 23.6% to 46.3% and 49.9% by EE housing. Importantly, tumor cells isolated from the pancreatic cancer xenografts of EE mice had significantly enhanced sensitivities to both 5-FU and GEM (IC50 for 5-FU: 2.8 μM versus 27.3 μM; IC50 for GEM: 0.8 μM versus 5.0 μM). Furthermore, using microarray analyses, we identified the “ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter” that was overrepresented among EE-induced down-regulated genes in pancreatic cancer. Particularly, the tumoral expression of ABC transporter A8b (ABCA8b) was confirmed to be significantly decreased by EE. Over-expression of ABCA8b in mouse pancreatic cancer cells led to a marked decrease in the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our data indicate that benign stressful stimulation can synergistically boost the efficiency of chemotherapeutics in pancreatic cancer, which suggests a novel strategy for adjuvant cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aadjuvants 3adose response 3adrug therapy 3afluorouracil 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amales 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3apancreatic neoplasms 0aEnriched environment 0aPancreatic cancer 0aChemosensitivity 0aABC transporter 0aABCA8b1 aGan, Yu1 aYuan, Hui1 aWang, Qing1 aFan, Yingchao1 aLi, Guohua1 aZhang, Jian1 aYao, Ming1 aGu, Jianren1 aTu, Hong0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Apr. 29, v. 473 p.593-599dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.03.1283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014900168300001600317520138400333592002801717650002501745650002101770650001101791650001201802700001801814773010301832856008101935990002302016852000902039655001202048IND60093395720221120183132.0141103e20120122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009339572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2011.09.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaleh, Khashayar14aThe spatio-temporal evolution of tribo-electric charge transfer during the pneumatic conveying of powders: Modelling and experimental validation  ap. 120-131.  aThis study considers the tribo-electric charging of materials during the dilute phase pneumatic conveying of powders. The main objective of the work is to develop a phenomenological model capable of describing the spatio-temporal evolution of charges of both the powders and pipe wall. The model is based on a second order kinetic for the charge transfer between the two materials (i.e. the elementary mechanism of charge transfer is considered to be the binary particle−wall collisions). The results show that the excess or lack of chargeability of the wall is the key parameter regarding the charge acquired by the particles. For wall chargeability levels less than that of the powder (excess ratios smaller than unity) the pipe wall becomes almost saturated over time so that the accumulated charge of the particles tends to an asymptotic limit imposed by the chargeability of the wall. For excess ratios greater than one, the particle charge is no longer limited by the charge of the wall but by the intrinsic chargeability of the particles. The accumulated charge of particles varies linearly with time and could potentially tend to saturation. In addition, for initial excess ratios greater than 3, the particle charge varies linearly with time. Finally, a comparison between the experimental and calculated data was carried out and permitted the validation of the model.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3amodel validation 3amodels 3apowders1 aAghili, Arman0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 Jan. 22, v. 68, no. 1 p.120-131dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2011.09.0543Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245009400163520152100257592002801778650001301806650000901819650001801828650001401846650001601860650001001876700002801886700002201914700002301936700001701959773012001976856007302096852000902169655001202178IND60746796120221121150947.0210806e20210731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074679612DNAL7 a10.3390/w131521082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangsefidi, Yousef 10aHydrodynamics and Free-Flow Characteristics of Piano Key Weirs with Different Plan Shapes  aThis paper focuses on Piano Key Weirs (PKWs) as an effective solution for improving the discharge capacity of spillway systems. The flow behavior in inlet and outlet keys is experimentally studied to analyze the discharge capacity of PKWs with different plan shapes (i.e., rectangular, trapezoidal, and triangular). The results show that in outlet keys, the flow aeration regimes extend to higher values of headwater ratios (Hₒ/P) by increasing the length magnification ratio (B/w) and apex width ratio (A/w). In addition, the local submergence length is a decreasing function of A/w, especially in high flow heads. While the total interference length enlarges by reducing A/w in lower Hₒ/P values (Hₒ/P < 0.5), a reverse trend is observed in higher headwater ratios. PKW performance may also be impacted by the flow contraction and recirculation zone in inlet keys, which intensify in higher values of Hₒ/P, B/w, and A/w. According to the obtained results, while the discharge coefficient is a decreasing function of A/w in Hₒ/P > 0.4, it may have a reverse trend in lower head conditions. In addition, a trapezoidal PKW has the highest discharge efficiency in a wide range of the studied domain (Hₒ/P > 0.25 and B/w ≥ 2). It can improve the discharge efficiency by around 5%, while its body volume is almost 7% smaller than the traditional rectangular PKW. However, for low-length and high-head conditions (B/w = 1 and Hₒ/P > 0.5), the efficiency a rectangular PKW exceeds that of the other shapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3ahead 3ahydrodynamics 3aspillways 3asubmergence 3awater1 aTavakol-Davani, Hassan 1 aGhodsian, Masoud 1 aMehraein, Mojtaba 1 aZarei, Reza 0 tWater.g2021 July 31, v. 13, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131521083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011200168300001600280500001900296520133600315536027901651592002801930596001101958650001201969650001201981650002001993650001602013650001502029650002502044650001502069650002102084651001002105653001802115653001602133653001602149653002102165700002102186700001702207700002002224773013102244856008502375852000902460655001202469IND60704235920221121223330.0200722e20200802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070423592DNAL7 a10.1080/17538947.2019.15859792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xiaolin10aMonitoring interannual dynamics of desertification in Minqin County, China, using dense Landsat time series  ap. 886-898.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMinqin County in northwestern China is highly affected by desertification. Campaigns have been initiated in recent decades to combat desertification in Minqin. To assess the effectiveness of these campaigns, this study used a dense Landsat time series from 1987 to 2017 to investigate the interannual dynamics of vegetation coverage and greenness over the past 31 years. First, this study applied an advanced technology to reconstruct a high-quality Landsat annual time series. Specifically, one image in the vegetation-peak season was selected as the base image in each year, and then problematic pixels were interpolated by the neighborhood similar pixel interpolator using ancillary images in the same year. Second, the land cover map and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were derived from all reconstructed images. Third, the change of vegetation coverage and EVI values over the 31 years were analyzed. The results show that the total vegetation coverage and greenness increased during the 31 years. Linking this change trend to other factors suggests that vegetation in Minqin County is highly affected by agriculture and groundwater supply rather than by climate. To mitigate desertification in a sustainable way, agriculture should be well managed to avoid overconsumption of natural resources such as underground water.  aThis study was supported by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong, University Grants Committee (project no. 25222717), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (project no. 41701378), and the research grant number G-YBZB from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.  aPublisher supplied data  aG-YBZB 3aLandsat 3aclimate 3adesertification 3agroundwater 3aland cover 3atime series analysis 3avegetation 3avegetation index 3aChina 0aMinqin County 0aagriculture 0atime series 0avegetation cover1 aLeung, Kwok Huen1 aLi, Wing Sze1 aCheung, Lek Kin0 tInternational journal of digital earth.g2020 Aug. 2, v. 13, no. 8 p.886-898dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12290x1753-89557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2019.15859793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245017800164300001600342500002000358520140400378592002801782650002701810650001801837650001601855650001101871650001001882650001301892650000901905650001201914650001001926650001601936650001501952650001601967650001201983650001001995650001302005700002602018700002302044700002302067700002102090700002202111700002202133773011802155856007302273852000902346655001202355IND60524274620221119173714.0160705e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052427462DNAL7 a10.1111/afe.121522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCagnotti, Cynthia L.10aAcceptability and suitability of Tuta absoluta eggs from irradiated parents to parasitism by Trichogramma nerudai and Trichogramma pretiosum (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)  ap. 198-205.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is one of the most devastating pests of tomato crops. We studied the acceptability and suitability of eggs laid by irradiated T. absoluta pairs to parasitism by the parasitoids Trichogramma nerudai and Trichogramma pretiosum. Trichogramma absoluta pupae were irradiated with X‐radiation (20834 R) and the emerged adults were separated into couples according to the crosses: ♂U × ♀U, ♂I × ♀U, ♂U × ♀I (where ‘U’ is untreated and ‘I’ is irradiated). In a no‐choice experiment, 40 eggs from each cross were exposed to a female parasitoid for 24 h. All T. absoluta eggs were accepted for oviposition by T. nerudai and were suitable for its development. However, eggs from irradiated females were significantly less parasitized than those from untreated females. Trichogramma pretiosum showed low parasitism on eggs from all crosses. In a choice experiment, both T. nerudai and T. pretiosum showed no differences in the parasitism of eggs from irradiated (n = 40) and non‐irradiated female moths (n = 40). These results indicate that eggs laid by irradiated parents were acceptable for oviposition and suitable for the development of these parasitoids, and also support the idea that the inherited sterility technique could be used in an integrated approach with egg parasitoids to control T. absoluta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichogramma pretiosum 3aTuta absoluta 3aX-radiation 3aadults 3acrops 3acrossing 3aeggs 3afemales 3amoths 3aoviposition 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aparents 3apupae 3atomatoes1 aHernández, Carmen M.1 aAndormo, Andrea V.1 aViscarret, Mariana1 aRiquelme, María1 aBotto, Eduardo N.1 aLópez, Silvia N.0 tAgricultural and forest entomology.g2016 Aug., v. 18, no. 3 p.198-205dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-95557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/afe.121523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100003000192245014000222300001600362506007600378520159600454592002802050506003702078650003402115650001202149650002002161650002902181650002502210650001402235650001502249650002202264650001702286650001002303650001502313650001102328650001002339650003202349650002802381650003502409650002302444650001602467653002702483653002302510653002602533653000902559653000902568653000902577700002102586700002702607700002002634700003502654773011102689856008502800852000902885655001202894IND60555194620221207093838.0161026e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055519462DNAL7 a10.1016/S2221-1691(13)60139-22doi7 aPMC37572752pmcid7 a239980072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Shawkat Md.

The antioxidant potential of the crude extract and partitioned fractions were evaluated in terms of total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, DPPH radical scavenging potential, reducing potential and total antioxidant capacity by specific standard procedures. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using disc diffusion method. The cytotoxicity was evaluated by using brine shrimp lethality bioassay and compared with vincristine sulfate. The thrombolytic activity was compared with streptokinase.The methanolic fruit extract exhibited the highest phenolic content, flavonoid content and antioxidant capacity, among the other extracts, with the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity at a concentration of 10 μg/mL (IC50: 1.91 μg/mL) and maximum reducing power at a concentration of 100 μg/mL (EC50: 3.58 μg/mL). Though all extract showed moderate antimicrobial activity against the bacterial strains, weak or no activity against fungus. The range of LC50 value of all extracts was 1.335–14.057 μg/mL which was far lower than the cut off index for cytotoxicity. All extracts exhibited statistically significant (P<0.001) thrombolytic activity.Our study suggested that S. dulcis exhibits antimicrobial activities against a wide variety of strains while it possesses significant antioxidant, cytotoxic and thrombolytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aArtemia 3aSpondias dulcis 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3abioassays 3achloroform 3acomparative study 3acytotoxicity 3adeath 3aflavonoids 3afruits 3afungi 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alethal concentration 50 3amedian effective concentration 3amethylene chloride 3avincristine 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aCytotoxic activity 0aThrombolytic activity 0aDPPH 0aIC50 0aLC501 aAhmed, Kh Tanvir1 aManik, Mohammad Kawsar1 aWahid, Md.

There is an ongoing debate whether a conversion from conventional tillage (CT) to no-till (NT) leads to an increase in (near-)saturated hydraulic conductivity. This is because true effects are often disguised by large spatial and temporal variability, but also by the deficiencies in the measurement technique.In this paper, we measured (near-) saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kₛ and K₋₂) in a long-term tillage trial (26 years) in Germany with three different methods: hood infiltrometer (HI) in the field, tension disc infiltrometer (TI) on undisturbed soil cores and direct simulation (DS) of water flow on X-ray CT images of macropore structure in these soil cores with a Stokes-Brinkmann solver. On average the absolute values varied by two orders of magnitude in the order TI < HI < DS with very low correlation (R² < 0.05) between log₁₀(Kₛ) measurements. The conversion from CT to NT caused an increase in bulk density, a decrease in air capacity and a small but consistent decrease in grain yields. Kₛ was increased with NT when measured with HI but decreased in TI and indifferent when measured with DS. This inconsistency is caused by the proportion at which large biopores that are more frequent in NT soil due to higher earthworm abundance contribute to total flow in each measurement technique. Regression analyses between pore space attributes measured with X-ray CT and Kₛ (and K₋₂) showed very strong agreement with DS values, but poorer agreement with HI and TI, suggesting that those values are afflicted with measurement artifacts like poor contact, entrapped air, different average volumes and so on.The pore metric with highest predictive power (>90%) on simulated Kₛ in NT soil cores was the critical pore diameter because it represents the bottleneck that restricts a large contribution to flow by elongated biopores. However, in plowed soil (CT) pore metrics that best describe flow through the loose soil matrix, like macroporosity and pore connectivity, have a higher predictive power and the critical pore diameter is rendered meaningless. The relative importance of various pore metrics as good predictors of hydraulic conductivity does not only change in a very small pressure range (Kₛ vs. K₋₂) but also between measurement techniques (HI vs. TI vs. DS). These inconsistencies raise the question if and how existing pedo-transfer functions for estimating (near-) saturated hydraulic conductivities can be extended by image-derived pore metrics in a meaningful way.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abulk density 3acomputed tomography 3aconventional tillage 3aearthworms 3aecological function 3agrain yield 3ainfiltrometers 3along term effects 3ano-tillage 3aplowing 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil structure 3atemporal variation 3awater flow 3aGermany 0aX-ray tomography 0aHood infiltrometer 0aTension disc infiltrometer 0aStokes-Brinkmann solver 0aPreferential flow 0aPedo-transfer functions1 aAlbrecht, Lukas1 aSchwärzel, Kai1 aKreiselmeier, Janis0 tGeoderma.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 361 p.114082-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.1140823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245013700167300001400304500001500318520133600333592002801669650001501697650001301712650001001725650001101735650002201746650001901768650001701787650001801804650000901822650001201831650001601843650001201859650002401871650002001895650001101915650001901926650001201945650001801957650001301975650002301988650001402011650001202025651001102037653001902048653001202067653002102079653002102100653001102121700002802132700002202160700003302182700004002215773012002255856007902375852000902454655001202463IND60519186720221121053226.0160421e20160412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051918672DNAL7 a10.1139/cjss-2015-00262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonreal, Carlos M.10aMass spectrometry of organic matter influenced by long-term pedogenesis and a short-term reclamation practice in an Oxisol of Brazil  ap. 64-85.  a2019-12-06  aLittle is known about the influence of soil pedogenesis and reclamation practices on the chemical composition of soil organic matter (SOM) in eroded Oxisol. We examined the long-term influence of pedogenesis and 8 years of a reclamation practice on SOM in the top 5 cm of an artificially eroded Oxisol of Brazil. The experimental site involved replicated treatments established under native vegetation, and an adjacent site whose top 8.6 m had been removed mechanically (eroded reference). The eroded Oxisol was under reclamation with native tree and grass species, and addition of sewage sludge. Pyrolysis field ionization mass spectrometry was used to characterize SOM. The abundance of most classes of SOM and soil carbon decreased in the following order: native > reclaimed >> eroded soil. Relative to the eroded reference, SOM in the native soil was highly humified and stabilized by inorganic colloids of iron, aluminum, and silicon. Humified and thermally stable SOM in the native and reference eroded soils involved mostly alkylaromatics, lipids, phenols+lignin monomers, lignin dimers, and N-heterocyclics. The reclaimed soil SOM was less humified and less stable than the native Oxisol, showing significant contributions of carbohydrates, amino acids, and sterols derived from sewage sludge and plant residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aionization 3acolloids 3atrees 3acarbon 3amass spectrometry 3aplant residues 3aeroded soils 3acarbohydrates 3airon 3aOxisols 3aamino acids 3agrasses 3asoil organic matter 3areclaimed soils 3alignin 3asoil formation 3asilicon 3asewage sludge 3aaluminum 3aindigenous species 3apyrolysis 3asterols 3aBrazil 0aorganic matter 0aerosion 0achemical classes 0asoil reclamation 0aoxisol1 aAlves, Marlene Cristina1 aSchnitzer, Morris1 aFilho, Sebastiao Nilce Souto1 aBatista Bonini, Carolina dos Santos0 tCanadian journal of soil science.g2016 Apr. 12, v. 96, no. 1 p.64-85dCanadian Science Publishingx1918-18417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2015-00263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245010000162520152000262592002801782650001501810650001501825650002701840650002001867650002001887650001801907650001201925700002201937700002201959700001901981700002002000700002102020773012102041856008002162852000902242655001202251IND60763399520221122182959.0220120e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076339952DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110101432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Mithun 10aAstrocyte Control of Zika Infection Is Independent of Interferon Type I and Type III Expression  aZika virus (ZIKV) is a pathogenic neurotropic virus that infects the central nervous system (CNS) and results in various neurological complications. Astrocytes are the dominant CNS cell producer of the antiviral cytokine IFN-β, however little is known about the factors involved in their ability to mediate viral infection control. Recent studies have displayed differential responses in astrocytes to ZIKV infection, and this study sought to elucidate astrocyte cell-specific responses to ZIKV using a variety of cell models infected with either the African (MR766) or Asian (PRVABC59) ZIKV strains. Expression levels of pro-inflammatory (TNF-α and IL-1β) and inflammatory (IL-8) cytokines following viral infection were low and mostly comparable within the ZIKV-resistant and ZIKV-susceptible astrocyte models, with better control of proinflammatory cytokines displayed in resistant astrocyte cells, synchronising with the viral infection level at specific timepoints. Astrocyte cell lines displaying ZIKV-resistance also demonstrated early upregulation of multiple antiviral genes compared with susceptible astrocytes. Interestingly, pre-stimulation of ZIKV-susceptible astrocytes with either poly(I:C) or poly(dA:dT) showed efficient protection against ZIKV compared with pre-stimulation with either recombinant IFN-β or IFN-λ, perhaps indicating that a more diverse antiviral gene expression is necessary for astrocyte control of ZIKV, and this is driven in part through interferon-independent mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZika virus 3aastrocytes 3acentral nervous system 3adisease control 3agene expression 3ainterleukin-8 3aviruses1 aSmith, Monique L.1 aFurihata, Tomomi 1 aSarker, Subir 1 aO’Shea, Ross 1 aHelbig, Karla J.0 tBiology.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110101433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01958naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010200167300001800269520058400287592002800871650001800899650001900917650002100936650002700957700002000984700001801004700005401022700001801076700005501094700005701149700005301206700005701259700005501316773012001371856008401491852000901575655001201584IND60765884320221117103611.0220204e20220121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076588432DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c041292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Shao-Kun10aElectrochemical Cross-Dehydrogenative Aromatization Protocol for the Synthesis of Aromatic Amines  ap. 1011-1016.  aThe introduction of amines onto aromatics without metal catalysts and chemical oxidants is synthetically challenging.

Earlier studies have shown that transporting biomass in horizontal pipelines in the form of water-based slurries significantly reduces transportation costs. The frictional behaviour of water-based chopped wheat straw slurry in a vertical pipeline has not been studied and this is the focus of this study. In situ concentrations of water-based conventional solids of medium sand, glass beads, and fine sand and straw slurry flows were determined by measuring their delivered concentrations in pseudo-homogeneous regimes for prepared concentrations of 1–6% (dry volume of conventional solids) and 5–25% (saturated mass of straw), respectively. Two grades of sand and glass beads with mean particle diameters of 0.103, 0.447, and 0.5 mm, respectively, and straw with a nominal particle length of 19.2 mm were utilised. The delivered concentrations for the straw slurries and fine sand were close to their corresponding prepared concentrations and were homogeneous. There was a large discrepancy between prepared and delivered concentrations for the medium-sized sand and glass beads slurries. The pressure drop of straw slurries over the range of velocities of 0.5–4.2 m s⁻¹ and mass concentrations of 5–25% through the vertical pipe showed a maximum drag reduction of 19% at a concentration of 25% (mass) and at a 3.5 m s⁻¹ velocity. For concentrations of 5–20% (mass), the straw slurries showed drag-reducing capabilities in the mixed and turbulent flow regions for various velocities that were different from horizontal flows.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aglass 3agreenhouse gases 3asand 3aslurries 3atransportation 3aturbulent flow 3awheat 3awheat straw 0aFriction loss 0aBiomass slurry 0aVertical pipeline 0aBiomass transport 0aGreenhouse gas 0aDelivered concentration1 aVaezi, Mahdi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8649-15731 aKurian, Vinoj1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2953-45541 aKumar, Amit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1746-71390 tBiosystems engineering.g2021 Dec., v. 212 p.30-45dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2021.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245012300174520110000297592002801397650001701425650001101442650001201453650001901465650001301484650000901497650002201506650001401528650002401542650000801566650001401574650001101588650001401599650002101613650001701634653001301651653001101664653000801675653000901683653003101692653002201723700002101745773010001766856008701866852000901953655001201962IND60735716520221118182955.0210813e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073571652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1299692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirard, Audrey L.10aImpact of condensed tannin interactions with grain proteins and non-starch polysaccharides on batter system properties  aProanthocyanidins (PA) cross-link wheat gluten proteins and dramatically enhance batter viscosity; PA could similarly affect related grains. This study aimed to determine PA effect on viscosity and pasting properties of barley, rye, and oat flours, and the relative contributions of PA interactions with proteins and non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). PA significantly increased batter viscosity, stability, and RVA peak viscosity in rye and barley flours (2.8× and 1.2×, respectively). Interestingly, viscosity peaked distinctively ~75 °C in PA-treated rye and barley flours, and their isolated protein-starch systems, indicating prolamins unravelled and complexed with PA during heating. Oat was largely unaffected by PA, likely because of its protein composition. Furthermore, water-soluble rye NSP and arabinoxylans, but not barley β-glucans, significantly increased starch pasting viscosity with PA; oxidative gelation was not a factor. Thus, rye flour viscosity dramatically increased through interactive effects of PA on rye proteins and NSP, which could expand its food applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarabinoxylan 3abarley 3abatters 3afood chemistry 3agelation 3aoats 3aproanthocyanidins 3aprolamins 3aprotein composition 3arye 3arye flour 3astarch 3aviscosity 3awater solubility 3awheat gluten 0aProlamin 0aBarley 0aRye 0aOats 0aProtein-tannin interaction 0aProanthocyanidins1 aAwika, Joseph M.0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 359 p.129969-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1299693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245012900175300001800304520144300322592002801765650000801793650002201801650002101823650001601844650001201860650001701872650001601889650001801905650001401923650001101937650001201948650001401960650001701974650001801991650001902009650001302028650001402041653000802055653001802063653002202081653002502103653001902128700001902147700001902166773010102185856009102286852000902377655001202386IND60090508720221120054755.0190321e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009050872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Kyung-mi10aSelf-assembled amphiphilic DNA-cholesterol/DNA-peptide hybrid duplexes with liposome-like structure for doxorubicin delivery  ap. 4183-4190.  aDNA nanoparticles have been proposed for drug encapsulation and intracellular delivery, but it has remained a challenge to rationally design DNA nanoparticles for delivery of drug to human cancer cells, not to normal cells. In this study, we synthesized an amphiphilic DNA hybrid duplex by using Watson–Crick base pairing and DNA bioconjugation with cholesterol or tLyp-1 tumor-homing peptide. The resulting amphiphilic DNA hybrid duplexes can self-assemble in an aqueous solution into liposome-like nanoparticles (c-DNA-p nanoparticles) with the exposure of tLyp-1 peptides to their outside. As a nanocarrier for doxorubicin, c-DNA-p nanoparticles can efficiently intercalate doxorubicin and also show the pH-dependent complexing/dissociation behaviors with doxorubicin, resulting in release of doxorubicin into cytosol after cell uptake. Moreover, tLyp-1 peptides with cell penetrating properties and specific binding ability for Neuropilin-1 receptors enable doxorubicin-loaded c-DNA-p nanoparticles to be delivered into the target cells through the NRP-1-dependent internalization pathway. Here, we demonstrated the targeted delivery of doxorubicin to MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells, compared to HFF normal cells. These results provide an alternative approach to specifically delivering doxorubicin into targeted cells for cancer therapy as well as controlling drug release under the acidic conditions such as endosomes or lysosomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aaqueous solutions 3abreast neoplasms 3acholesterol 3acytosol 3adissociation 3adoxorubicin 3aencapsulation 3aendosomes 3ahumans 3ahybrids 3alysosomes 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3apeptides 3areceptors 0aDNA 0aDrug delivery 0aDNA nanoparticles 0aTumor-homing peptide 0aCancer therapy1 aKwon, Ick Chan1 aAhn, Hyung Jun0 tBiomaterials.g2013 May, v. 34, no. 16 p.4183-4190dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008800163300001600251520169000267592002801957650001901985650000902004650000902013650000902022650001502031650001202046650003102058650001302089650001402102650001602116650001402132650001102146651001902157651001202176700001902188700001702207700001602224700001402240773011202254856004802366852000902414655001202423IND50089603520221120062447.0140514e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008960352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-014-0801-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelotti, E.10aEurasian lynx hunting red deer: is there an influence of a winter enclosure system?  ap. 441-457.  aAs in several Central European areas, in the Bohemian Forest Ecosystem (Germany and the Czech Republic), fenced feeding enclosures are used for the winter management of red deer (Cervus elaphus), which is an important component of the Eurasian lynx’s (Lynx lynx) winter diet. Using GPS telemetry data, we tested whether (1) lynx hunted red deer mainly selecting for high prey densities and environmental characteristics like a good level of habitat heterogeneity, independently of the enclosures’ presence; (2) enclosures attracted lynx and (3) positively influenced their predation on red deer, being predictable and abundant prey sources throughout the winter; or (4) extremely high deer densities inside the enclosures rather negatively influenced lynx predation on this species. We first compared lynx space usage and predation on red deer inside and outside the enclosures. Then, we investigated the effects of the environment, prey densities and the enclosure distance for the area outside of enclosures. Prey densities positively influenced lynx space usage, whilst the probability of predation on red deer was highest at medium to low red deer densities. Habitat heterogeneity and terrain ruggedness influenced both lynx space usage and probability of predation on red deer. Regarding the effect of enclosures, the ratio “area used during night vs. daytime” was larger by a factor of 2 inside compared to outside enclosures, and the probability of predation on red deer was three times higher inside rather than outside of enclosures; however, these differences were not statistically significant, suggesting that the influence of the enclosures is not very pronounced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus elaphus 3aLynx 3adeer 3adiet 3aecosystems 3aforests 3aglobal positioning systems 3ahabitats 3apredation 3aprobability 3atelemetry 3awinter 3aCzech Republic 3aGermany1 aKreisinger, J.1 aRomportl, D.1 aHeurich, M.1 aBufka, L.0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2014 June, v. 60, no. 3 p.441-457dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-014-0801-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012100160300001800281520167500299592002801974650001202002650001502014650001202029650001202041650001902053650001502072650002002087650001502107650001002122650000902132650001102141650002302152650001902175650001102194650000902205650001802214650001502232651001002247700001702257700001802274700001402292773010502306856008102411852000902492655001202501IND60119987420221118013852.0150117e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011998742DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-014-3451-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Wei10aEffect of rainfall variation and landscape change on runoff and sediment yield from a loess hilly catchment in China  ap. 1005-1016.  aThe semiarid Chinese Loess Plateau is notorious for severe drought, water erosion, and environmental degradation. Changes in landscape patterns and rainfall are key drivers that determine the dynamics of runoff loss and sediment yield from catchments. These factors have crucial implications for management of other fragile ecosystems around the globe. In this study, responses of surface runoff and sediment yield to land use and rainfall in a typical loess hilly catchment in 1997, 2005, and 2010 were analyzed. Several major findings are highlighted. First, most rainfall occurred in the growing season from June to September and increased only slightly during the observation years. Second, runoff and soil transport rates at the catchment outlet from June to August were far greater than in other months. A similar trend was observed for seasonal rainfall occurrence, indicating that the intra-annual water erosion patterns were largely dominated by monthly rainfall distribution. Third, compared with the time period 1997–2005, mean runoff and sediment transport modulus in 2005–2010 declined significantly. This can be attributed mainly to changes in land use/land cover, i.e., increases in forests, shrubs, and grasses, and decreases in sloping farmlands. Dam construction is also key in controlling runoff and sediment yield, but more attention must be paid to its possible negative environmental effects. In general, our study indicates that marked changes in landscape patterns and vegetation coverage may contribute to long-term soil loss dynamics, and intra-annual rainfall variation mainly contributes to monthly variation in runoff and sediment yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aforests 3agrasses 3agrowing season 3aland cover 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3aloess 3arain 3arunoff 3asediment transport 3asediment yield 3ashrubs 3asoil 3awater erosion 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aChen, Liding1 aZhang, Handan1 aChen, Jin0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2015 Feb., v. 73, no. 3 p.1005-1016dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3451-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003200145245013500177300001400312520150300326592002801829650001601857650002201873650001601895650001301911650001901924650001701943650002301960650001001983650001201993650001002005650001602015650001702031651001202048651001902060651001302079653001202092653001302104653001602117653001602133653001802149653001902167653001602186653002802202653001302230653001302243653001202256653001702268653001902285700002302304700002102327773011602348856007902464852000902543655001202552IND60519926420221117070648.0160511e20160429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051992642DNAL7 a10.1515/cszma-2016-00052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoháček, J.q(Jindřich),10aNew records of Psilidae, Piophilidae, Lauxaniidae, Cremifaniidae and Sphaeroceridae (Diptera) from the Czech Republic and Slovakia  ap. 51-62.  aRecords of eight rare species of the families Psilidae (4), Piophilidae (1), Lauxaniidae (1), Cremifaniidae (1) and Sphaeroceridae (1) from the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria are presented and their importance to the knowledge of the biodiversity of local faunas is discussed along with notes on their biology, distribution and identification.

Acid treatment of (−)-(3S,4S,6R)-3,6-dihydroxy-1-menthene 3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (1) and (−)-(3S,4R,5R,6S)-3,5,6-trihydroxy-1-menthene 3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (2), from Ageratina glabrata, yielded p-cymene (7) and carvacrol (9). The stable oxidized intermediates (+)-(3S,4S,6R)-3,6-dihydroxy-1-menthene (3), (+)-(1S,4S,6R)-1,6-dihydroxy-2-menthene (4), (+)-(1R,4S,6R)-1,6-dihydroxy-2-menthene (5), (+)-(4S,6R)-yabunikkeol (6), (+)-(4S)-carvotanacetone (8), (+)-(1S,4S,5R,6R)-1,5,6-trihydroxy-2-menthene (15), (+)-(1R,4S,5R,6R)-1,5,6-trihydroxy-2-menthene (16), and the new (+)-(4S,5R,6S)-1(7),2-menthadiene (17) permitted establishment of the reaction mechanisms. The reactivity of the hydroxy groups of 4 and 5, as well as those of 15 and 16, was compared by acetylation reactions and supported by DFT calculations, revealing diminished reactivity in 4 and 15 due to the cis configuration of their hydroxy groups at C-1 and C-6. In addition, p-cymene (7) was detected as one of the major constituents of the essential oil of A. glabrata, which matches well with the biomimetic study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgeratina 3aacetylation 3aacid treatment 3abiomimetics 3acarvacrol 3aessential oils 3aglucosides 3ametabolism 3amonoterpenoids 3aoxidation 3ap-cymene 3areaction mechanisms1 aArreaga-González, Héctor M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3746-01371 aGalván-Gómez, Sinuhé1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6006-85231 aRodríguez-García, Gabriela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9840-99681 adel Río, Rosa E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8932-552X1 aCerda-García-Rojas, Carlos M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5590-79081 aJoseph-Nathan, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3347-39901 aGómez-Hurtado, Mario A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2386-48190 tJournal of natural products.g2019 Feb. 18, v. 82, no. 3 p.485-491dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b008553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010300167506002800270520096400298592002801262506003701290650001101327650002601338650002201364650001301386650000901399650001101408650001101419700001801430700001701448773009601465856008401561852000901645655001201654IND60753584920221207130449.0211005s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075358492DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202136080082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUsanova, Z.I.10aExport-oriented intensification of potato production in the central non-chernozem region of Russia  aResource is Open Access  aThe results of studies (2019-2020) in a two-factor field experiment on sod-podzolic light-loamy well-cultivated soil on the of study the effect of non-root fertilization on the productivity of potato varieties are presented.

With advances in technology, health scientists continue to identify new approaches to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Lost or injured neurons and glial cells can lead to the development of several neurological diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, stroke, and multiple sclerosis. In recent years, neurons and glial cells have successfully been generated from stem cells in the laboratory utilizing cell culture technologies, fueling efforts to develop stem cell-based transplantation therapies for human patients. When a stem cell divides, each new cell has the potential to either remain a stem cell or differentiate into a germ cell with specialized characteristics, such as muscle cells, red blood cells, or brain cells. Although several obstacles remain before stem cells can be used for clinical applications, including some potential disadvantages that must be overcome, this cellular development represents a potential pathway through which patients may eventually achieve the ability to live more normal lives. In this review, we summarize the stem cell-based therapies that have been explored for various neurological disorders, discuss the potential advantages and drawbacks of these therapies, and examine future directions for this field.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acell culture 3acell transplantation 3agerm cells 3ahumans 3amuscles 3asclerosis 3astem cells 3astroke1 aIslam, Mohammad Rezaul1 aIslam, Mohammad Touhidul1 aHarun-Or-Rashid, Mohammad 1 aIslam, Mahfuzul 1 aAbdullah, Sabirin 1 aUddin, Mohammad Borhan1 aDas, Sumit 1 aRahaman, Mohammad Saidur1 aAhmed, Muniruddin 1 aAlhumaydhi, Fahad A.1 aEmran, Talha Bin1 aMohamed, Amany Abdel-Rahman1 aFaruque, Mohammad Rashed Iqbal1 aKhandaker, Mayeen Uddin1 aMostafa-Hedeab, Gomaa 0 tBiology.g2022 Jan. 17, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110101473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005600094040001800150100002000168245004800188300001600236520204700252592002802299653001702327653001802344653001202362653001602374653002102390653002102411700002002432773009802452856011602550852000902666655001202675IND60131224620221117003604.0151127e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013122462DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2005)025[0908:LOCEM]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHavens, Karl E.10aLake okeechobee conceptual ecological model  ap. 908-925.  aWith a surface area of nearly 1,800 square kilometers, Lake Okeechobee is a prominent central feature of the South Florida aquatic ecosystem. The lake provides regional flood protection, supports a prized recreational fishery, provides habitat for migratory waterfowl and regional wading bird populations, and is a source of fresh water for irrigation, drinking, and restoration of downstream ecosystems. The main stressors on Lake Okeechobee are (1) large inputs of phosphorus from agricultural and other anthropogenic land uses in the watershed, (2) unnatural variation in water levels due to channelization of inflows and dike containment, and (3) rapid expansion of non-native plants. Ecological effects are complicated due to three distinct in-lake zones with different water chemistry, physical properties, and biota. A central pelagic zone has turbid, nutrient-rich water and phytoplankton dominance; a shallow south and western near-shore zone has submerged plant or phytoplankton dominance (at low vs. high water levels, respectively); and a western littoral zone is dominated by emergent wetland plants. Changes in water level influence the flow of nutrients between zones, thereby creating a synergistic effect between stressors. Under high water conditions, there is considerable advective transport of nutrients from the pelagic zone into the littoral zone. Under low water conditions, the littoral zone is cut off hydrologically and is a rainfall-driven oligotrophic wetland. Low water also facilitates drying and wildfires in the littoral zone, which in turn has an influence on expansion of non-native plants and recovery of native plants from buried seed banks. All of these factors influence fish, wading birds, and other animals, which depend on littoral and near-shore plant communities for nesting and foraging habitat. This paper describes our current knowledge of these complex processes, the lake's expected responses to ongoing and planned restoration programs, and key areas of uncertainty requiring future research.  aPublisher supplied data 0ashallow lake 0alittoral zone 0awetland 0awater level 0anutrient loading 0aconceptual model1 aGawlik, Dale E.0 tWetlands.g2005 Dec., v. 25, no. 4 p.908-925dSociety of Wetlands Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F0277-5212%282005%29025%5B0908%3ALOCEM%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245017100160300001500331520087900346592002801225650001501253650001101268650001401279650001201293650001201305650001201317650001001329650001601339650001201355650001401367650002201381650002101403650001001424653001401434653002801448653002801476653002701504653002101531653001501552700002001567773009001587856007501677852000901752655001201761IND60128225320221119005907.0151115e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012822532DNAL7 a10.5358/hsj.31.972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKikukawa, Nobuto10aGeometric Morphometric Analysis of Sexual Dimorphism and Allometric Growth in the Skull of the Japanese Grass Lizard, Takydromus tachydromoides (Reptilia: Lacertidae)  ap. 97-106.  aWe investigated sexual size dimorphism (SSD), sexual shape dimorphism (SShD), and allometric growth in the skull of Takydromus tachydromoides using geometric morphometries. We analyzed 40 landmarks on the skull from dorsal, ventral, and lateral views. As a result, significant sexual dimorphisms were recognized in both size and shape of the skull. The analysis of SSD revealed that adult males have larger skull relative to the snout-vent length, and the analysis of SShD indicated that adult males have larger jaw muscle adductor chambers than adult females. Moreover, various allometric shape changes in both sexes were visualized by the thin plate splines. However, only subtle sexual differences in allometric shape changes were observed. The skull size and shape of this species may be influenced by phylogenetic constraints and only weakly driven by sexual selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLacertidae 3aadults 3aallometry 3afemales 3agrasses 3alizards 3amales 3amorphometry 3amuscles 3aphylogeny 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual selection 3askull 0aAllometry 0aGeometric morphometrics 0aSexual shape dimorphism 0aSexual size dimorphism 0aSkull morphology 0aTakydromus1 aHikida, Tsutomu0 tCurrent herpetology.g2012 Nov., v. 31, no. 2 p.97-106dUniBio Pressx1881-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5358%2Fhsj.31.973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003000143245013800173520132700311592002801638650001501666650001101681650001601692650001401708650001501722650002401737650001501761650001901776650001301795650001501808650001301823650001601836650001901852650002001871650000901891700002701900700002301927700001901950700002301969700001801992700001902010773011902029856007802148852000902226655001202235IND60703681720221121015741.0200721e20200210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070368172DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90202272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenjamin, Jenifer  Joseph10aProteomics Revealed Distinct Responses to Salinity between the Halophytes Suaeda maritima (L.) Dumort and Salicornia brachiata (Roxb)  aPlant resistance to salinity stress is one of the main challenges of agriculture. The comprehension of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in plant tolerance to salinity can help to contrast crop losses due to high salt conditions in soil. In this study, Salicornia brachiata and Suaeda maritima, two plants with capacity to adapt to high salinity levels, were investigated at proteome level to highlight the key processes involved in their tolerance to NaCl. With this purpose, plants were treated with 200 mM NaCl as optimal concentration and 500 mM NaCl as a moderate stressing concentration for 14 days. Indeed, 200 mM NaCl did not result in an evident stress condition for both species, although photosynthesis was affected (with a general up accumulation of photosynthesis-related proteins in S. brachiata under salinity). Our findings indicate a coordinated response to salinity in both the halophytes considered, under NaCl conditions. In addition to photosynthesis, heat shock proteins and peroxidase, expansins, signaling processes, and modulation of transcription/translation were affected by salinity. Interestingly, our results suggested distinct mechanisms of tolerance to salinity between the two species considered, with S. brachiata likely having a more efficient mechanism of response to NaCl.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalicornia 3aSuaeda 3acrop losses 3aexpansins 3ahalophytes 3aheat shock proteins 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium chloride 3asoil1 aMiras-Moreno, Begoña 1 aAraniti, Fabrizio 1 aSalehi, Hajar 1 aBernardo, Letizia 1 aParida, Ajay 1 aLucini, Luigi 0 tPlants.g2020 Feb. 10, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90202273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01861naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007000150245005600220300001600276520078700292592002801079650002001107650001101127650001101138650001601149650001301165650002501178650002601203650002501229650001701254773017101271856008401442852000901526655001201535IND60634483620221121004111.0190323e20190228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063448362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b008742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunningham, Christopher W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4468-221310aPlant-Based Modulators of Endocannabinoid Signaling  ap. 636-646.  aExtracts from Cannabis species have aided the discovery of the endocannabinoid signaling system (ECSS) and phytocannabinoids that possess broad therapeutic potential. Whereas the reinforcing effects of C. sativa are largely attributed to CB1 receptor agonism by Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC), the observed medicinal effects of Cannabis arise from the combined actions of various compounds. In addition to compounds bearing a classical cannabinoid structure, naturally occurring fatty acid amides and esters resembling anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol isolated from non-Cannabis species are also valuable tools for studying ECSS function. This review highlights the potential of plant-based secondary metabolites from Cannabis and unrelated species as ECSS modulators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCannabis sativa 3aamides 3aesters 3afatty acids 3aglycerol 3amedicinal properties 3asecondary metabolites 3atetrahydrocannabinol 3atherapeutics0 tJournal of natural products.g2019 Feb. 28, v. 82, no. 3 p.636-646dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b008743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245007200152300001400224520123800238592002801476650001501504650001801519650002701537650001001564650001001574650001201584650001401596650001401610650002101624653001801645653001501663653001901678653002201697653002601719653001501745700001901760700001601779773008901795856007501884852000901959655001201968IND60128225520221119005838.0151115e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012822552DNAL7 a10.5358/hsj.32.262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIto, Ryo12aA Day Gecko Darkens its Body Color in Response to Avian Alarm Calls  ap. 26-33.  aRapid body color change of animals in response to environmental stimuli has at least three biological functions: predation avoidance, thermoregulation, and intraspecific communication. We tested the hypothesis that Phelsuma kochi, a Madagascan giant day gecko that normally has a bright green body color, darkens its color to maximize its level of background matching so as to evade predation. Because recent studies revealed that some lizard species are able to eavesdrop on avian alarm calls and respond with antipredator behavior, we conducted a playback experiment of avian alarm calls to examine whether P. kochi recognizes alarm calls and changes its body color in response to them. We played back alarm calls and songs of a syntopically occurring passerine bird, Terpsiphone mutata, and white noise to free-ranging geckos. The geckos changed their body color quicker and darker in response to alarm calls than songs, and they tended to keep their dark coloration for a longer duration after the playback of alarm calls than that of songs or white noise. This result suggests that P. kochi is able to eavesdrop on alarm calls of syntopic birds and respond by darkening its body color to reduce its conspicuousness to predators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGekkonidae 3aPasseriformes 3aantipredatory behavior 3abirds 3acolor 3alizards 3apredation 3apredators 3athermoregulation 0aEavesdropping 0aGekkonidae 0aPhelsuma kochi 0aBody color change 0aAntipredator behavior 0aMadagascar1 aIkeuchi, Isami1 aMori, Akira0 tCurrent herpetology.g2013 Feb., v. 32, no. 1 p.26-33dUniBio Pressx1881-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5358%2Fhsj.32.263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01706naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010300159300001800262520060700280592002800887650002400915650001200939650001400951650002000965650001200985650002000997650001301017650001901030650001201049700001801061700001501079700001901094700001101113773012501124856007401249852000901323655001201332IND60662754820221120203914.0190906e20140818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066275482DNAL7 a10.1039/c4gc00413b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hongxia10aTiO₂-photocatalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation coupling of primary alkyl alcohols into acetals  ap. 4076-4080.  aPrimary alkyl alcohols can be directly converted into acetals and H₂via TiO₂-photocatalytic dehydrogenation coupling at room temperature, with no need for any hydrogen acceptors.

However, a major hurdle in this treatment is the rapid loss of functional islets during culture and after transplantation. The liver site, currently utilized for transplantation, is suboptimal for achieving long-term insulin independence due to a rapid islet loss followed by a chronic decline in islet function after transplantation. Herein, we report a synthetic saccharide–peptide (SP) hydrogel that allows suspending islets in liquid and injecting for in situ polymerization without forming islet clumps, indicating its potential in extrahepatic islet transplantation. In vitro, rat islets in SP hydrogel maintained a 3D structure and high glucose-stimulated insulin release similar to that observed in freshly isolated islets for 4 weeks, while control islets cultured in suspension lost their 3D structure and insulin release responses by 2 weeks. Biocompatibility of SP hydrogel was shown by the absence of cytokine mRNA activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to hydrogel in vitro and by the absence of cellular infiltrates in and around the hydrogel implanted subcutaneously. Syngeneic Lewis rat islets transplanted in SP hydrogel in various extrahepatic sites stained strongly for insulin, and more effectively reversed diabetes than unencapsulated islets when transplanted in an omental pocket. In conclusion, the SP hydrogel is non-cytotoxic and supports normal islet structure and function both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, the ability of the hydrogel to separate individual islets after transplantation is important for maintaining their function in vivo. This important property, combined with the versatility and biocompatibility, makes our SP hydrogel a promising synthetic scaffold that can facilitate transplantation of organized heterogeneous cells to preserve their micro-structure and function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiocompatibility 3acytokines 3aencapsulation 3ahydrocolloids 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amononuclear leukocytes 3apolymerization 3arats 0aHydrogel 0aExtrahepatic islet transplantation 0aTissue engineering 0a3D islet culture 0aDiabetes1 aRawson, Jeffrey1 aOmori, Keiko1 aIshiyama, Kohei1 aMozhdehi, Davoud1 aOancea, Alina R.1 aIto, Taihei1 aGuan, Zhibin1 aMullen, Yoko0 tBiomaterials.g2013 May, v. 34, no. 16 p.3984-3991dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014800162300001600310520151300326592002801839650001501867650002701882650001401909650002301923650000901946650001301955650001801968650002401986650001702010650001302027650002402040650002202064700001302086700001702099773012902116856008102245852000902326655001202335IND60440325620221121094540.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044032562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-015-0774-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Man10aCatalytic activity of noble metal nanoparticles toward hydrodechlorination: influence of catalyst electronic structure and nature of adsorption  ap. 888-896.  aIn this study, stabilized Pd, Pt and Au nanoparticles were successfully prepared in aqueous phase using sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as a capping agent. These metal nanoparticles were then tested for catalytic hydrodechlorination toward two classes of organochlorinated compounds (vinyl polychlorides including trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and alkyl polychlorides including 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA), and 1,1,1,2-tetrachloroethane (1,1,1,2- TeCA)) to determine the rate-limiting steps and to explore the reaction mechanisms. The surface area normalized reaction rate constant, k SA, showed a systematic dependence on the electronic structure (the density of states at the Fermi level) of the metals, suggesting that adsorption of organochlorinated reactants on the metal catalyst surfaces is the rate-limiting step for catalytic hydrodechlorination. Hydrodechlorination rates of 1,1,1-TCA and 1,1,1,2-TeCA agreed with the bond strength of the first (weakest) dissociated C-Cl bond, suggesting that C-Cl bond cleavage, which is the first step for dissociative adsorption of the alkyl polychlorides, controlled the catalytic hydrodechlorination rate. However, hydrodechlorination rates of TCE and PCE correlated with the adsorption energies of their molecular (non-dissociative) adsorption on the noble metals rather than with the first C-Cl bond strength, suggesting that molecular adsorption governs the reaction rate for hydrodechlorination of the vinyl polychlorides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3agold 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3areaction mechanisms 3asurface area 3asurfaces 3atetrachloroethylene 3atrichloroethylene1 aHe, Feng1 aZhao, Dongye0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2015 Oct., v. 9, no. 5 p.888-896dHigher Education Pressx2095-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-015-0774-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245011300165500001900278500001100297520133100308592002801639596003301667596004701700596003701747596003201784650001701816650001901833650001801852650001801870650002301888650001301911650001401924650001601938650001801954650002001972650001401992650001402006650004002020700002002060700005902080773012602139856007302265852000902338655001202347IND60722272420221121053408.0201230e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072227242DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.133332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBillhaq, Dody Houston14aThe potential function of endometrial‐secreted factors for endometrium remodeling during the estrous cycle  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aUterine has a pivotal role in implantation and conceptus development. To prepare a conducive uterine condition for possibly new gestation during the estrous cycle, uterine endometrium undergoes dramatic remodeling. In addition, angiogenesis is an indispensable biological process of endometrium remodeling. Furthermore, essential protein expressions related to important biological processes of endometrium remodeling, which are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), myoglobin (MYG), collagen type IV (COL4), fucosyltransferase IV (FUT4), and cysteine‐rich protein 2 (CRP2), were detected in the endometrial tissue reported in many previous studies and recently discovered in histotroph substrates during the estrous cycle. Those proteins, which are liable for provoking new vessel development, cell proliferation, cell adhesion, and cell migration, were expressed higher in the histotroph during the luteal phase than follicular phase. Histotroph proteins considerably contribute to endometrium remodeling during the estrous cycle. To that end, the following review will discuss and highlight the relevant information and evidence of the uterine fluid proteins as endometrial‐secreted factors that adequately indicate the potential role of the uterine secretions to be involved in the endometrial remodeling process.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Research Foundation  a2018R1D1A3B07048167cMinistry of Education  a520170021cMinistry of Education  cKangwon National University 3aangiogenesis 3aanimal science 3acell adhesion 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3acollagen 3aconceptus 3aendometrium 3aestrous cycle 3amenstrual cycle 3amyoglobin 3apregnancy 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aLee, Sang‐Hee1 aLee, Seunghyung1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5862-36630 tAnimal science journal =.g2020 Jan., v. 91, no. 1 p.e13333-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867063x1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.133333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245013100206300001600337500001900353500002000372520087700392592002801269650002001297650002201317650001801339650001801357650001101375651001101386700006101397700005401458773015701512856007901669852000901748655001201757IND60704954920221120195117.0200728e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070495492DNAL7 a10.1111/1467-8489.123872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcosta, Alejandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0546-054610aAnimal disease outbreaks and food market price dynamics: Evidence from regime‐dependent modelling and connected scatterplots  ap. 960-976.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe economic impacts of animal disease outbreaks have been widely discussed in the literature. Most authors have centred their attention on estimating the direct costs. Recent studies have shown that the indirect economic effects might lead to equal or even higher welfare losses. This study aims to contribute to this field of research by assessing the effect of an animal disease outbreak on food market price dynamics in Mexico, accounting for the potential effect of an antitrust intervention. We employ a regime‐dependent vector error correction model and a connected scatterplot analysis. The results show that both the outbreak and the antitrust intervention caused structural breaks in food market price dynamics between producers and consumers, reflected in an increase in the absolute component of the marketing margin, with serious food security implications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal diseases 3adisease outbreaks 3afood security 3amarket prices 3amodels 3aMexico1 aBarrantes, Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0615-37671 aIhle, Rico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7970-70540 tAustralian journal of agricultural and resource economics.g2020 July, v. 64, no. 3 p.960-976dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl55734x1364-985X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.123873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01545naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245010800162300001800270520060700288592002800895650002000923650001400943650001300957650001600970650001300986650001300999773015401012856008001166852000901246655001201255IND60624203420221120093926.0190722e199703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062420342DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10185622028762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMEDINA, S.

Using torsion tests, the statically recrystallized fraction has been determined for three Nb, V and Ti micro-alloyed steels at different temperatures and strains. When precipitation starts, the recrystallized fraction deviates from Avrami’s equation, making it possible to identify the moment at which precipitation starts (Ps) and finishes (Pf). In this way precipitation–time–temperature(PTT) curves can be drawn, showing the precipitation kinetics in graph form.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3aequations 3afinishes 3atemperature 3atitanium 3avanadium0 tJournal of materials science.g1997 Mar., v. 32, no. 6 p.1487-1492dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10185622028763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011400164520156100278592002801839650002801867650001301895650001301908650002001921650002001941650001201961650002101973653001801994653000902012653000902021700001702030700001902047700001402066700001302080773012102093856008202214852000902296655001202305IND60743705820221119165444.0210812e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074370582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2021.1041972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Mingkui10aATF6-DGAT pathway is involved in TLR7-induced innate immune response in Ctenopharyngodon idellus kidney cells  aDGAT1 and DGAT2 are two acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes that catalyze the final step in triglyceride (TG) synthesis. TGs are the primary constituents of lipid droplets (LDs). Although it has been demonstrated that LDs modulate immune and inflammatory responses in CIK cells, little is known about whether DGAT1 and DGAT2 involve in this process. Firstly, grass carp DGAT2 was isolated and characterized, encoding 361 amino acids, and all DGAT2 proteins in genomic structures are conserved in vertebrates. Then, using TLR7 agonist, we induced LDs accumulation in CIK cells. Only DGAT1b and DGAT2 were upregulated in forming TLR7 agonist induced-LDs. Next, we utilized small-molecule inhibitors of DGAT1 and DGAT2. The results indicated that DGAT1 inactivation attenuated TG content and the relative expressions of IFNα3, NF-κB, IL-1β, and TNFα genes, whereas DGAT2 inhibition decreased TG content and the relative expressions of MyD88, IRF7, IFNα3, NF-κB, IL-1β, and TNFα genes, implying that DGAT1-generated LDs and DGAT2-generated LDs contribute to TLR7-induced immune response via different signaling pathways. Finally, inhibiting ATF6 effectively decreased DGAT-generated LDs accumulation and the expression of TLR7 signaling-related genes induced by TLR7 agonist, implying that ATF6 UPR pathway may mediate the role of DGAT-generated LDs in TLR7 signaling. Overall, we demonstrate that DGAT1 and DGAT2-catalyzed TAG synthesis may generate different LDs to provide distinct signaling platforms for innate TLR7 signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aagonists 3agenomics 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3akidneys 3atriacylglycerols 0aLipid droplet 0aDGAT 0aTLR71 aHuang, Tong,1 aBian, Chenchen1 aSun, Jian1 aJi, Hong0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2021 Nov., v. 124 p.104197-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2021.1041973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007200150245013600222300001300358500001900371520151700390592002801907650000901935650001401944650001101958650001901969650001401988650002302002650001102025650001502036651001702051651002002068653001802088653002302106653002102129653002602150653001602176700005502192773010502247856008502352852000902437655001202446IND60736457420221119164723.0210603e20210810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073645742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2021.04.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiwarungrueangkul, Thanakorn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9220-937810aEast Asian monsoon and sea-level controls on clay mineral variations in the southern South China Sea since the Last Glacial Maximum  ap. 1-11.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aClay minerals preserved in marine sediments carry important information about sediment transport processes from sources to sinks. To reveal the dynamic transport processes of clay minerals and related controlling factors in the southern South China Sea, spatiotemporal variations of clay mineral assemblages from previous studies (Cores MD05-2893, CG2, SO18287-3, MD01-2393, SO18383-3, and MD97-2150) are integrated to assess their controlling factors over the past 30 ka. Based on the smectite/(illite + chlorite) ratio in six cores, we found that the clay mineral variations on the continental slope off Sunda Shelf (Cores MD05-2893, CG2, and SO18287-3) have been controlled by the sea-level changes during the last glacial sea-level lowstand and by the East Asian monsoon during the Holocene sea-level highstand periods. Meanwhile, the clay mineral variations on the continental slope off the Mekong River (Cores MD01-2393, SO18383-3, and MD97-2150) have been driven by the chemical weathering in the Mekong River basin that associates with the East Asian summer monsoon evolution. Accordingly, we conclude that the glacial-interglacial variation of clay minerals in an integrated picture of the southern South China Sea region since the Last Glacial Maximum has been mainly controlled by sea-level change and East Asian monsoon evolution. However, these controlling factors play independent roles in different parts of the southern South China Sea, which appears more heterogeneous than generally expected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aevolution 3aillite 3amonsoon season 3asea level 3asediment transport 3asummer 3awatersheds 3aMekong River 3aSouth China Sea 0aClay minerals 0aEast Asian monsoon 0aSea-level change 0aSedimentary processes 0aSunda shelf1 aLiu, Zhifei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5202-62830 tQuaternary international.g2021 Aug. 10, v. 592 p.1-11dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2021.04.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011100165300001800276520114200294592002801436650004401464650002201508650002401530650001401554650001401568650004301582650002501625650002201650650004401672650001501716650001601731650002401747650002201771650003701793700001201830700001601842700001701858700001601875700001701891773011201908856008202020852000902102655001202111IND60675120520221119032916.0191104e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067512052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02691-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Liqiong10aInteraction and mechanism of nitrocellulose and N-methyl-4-nitroaniline by isothermal decomposition method  ap. 9021-9033.  aThe influence of N-methyl-4-nitroaniline (MNA) on the thermal stability of nitrocellulose (NC) was investigated via an isothermal decomposition dynamics research method. The Arrhenius equation and model-fitting were used to calculate the thermal decomposition kinetic parameters of NC and MNA/NC (3 wt%) composite. Results showed that the thermal decomposition activation energy of NC/MNA (3 wt%) was significantly increased compared with that of pure NC, indicating that the thermal stability of NC was increased with stabilizer MNA addition. Subsequently, the storage life of NC and MNA/NC (3 wt%) composite was estimated using Berthelot equation. It was found that if the decomposition extent reaches 0.1% as the end of life criterion, 3 wt% stabilizer MNA addition significantly extended the storage life of NC from 10.57 to 24.9 years at ambient temperature (298.15 K) with the life extension rate reaching 135.6%. Furthermore, the intermediate product produced by MNA and NC action was extracted and characterized via UV–Vis, HPLC, ¹H NMR, FT-IR, and LC–MS, and a possible stabilization mechanism of MNA to NC was proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3aambient temperature 3acellulose 3aequations 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aintermediate product 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ashelf life 3astabilizers 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aJin, Bo1 aChai, Zuohu1 aHuang, Qiong1 aChu, Shijin1 aPeng, Rufang0 tCellulose.g2019 Nov., v. 26, no. 17 p.9021-9033dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02691-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245011800215300001800333500001900351520160800370592002801978650001102006650001802017650002102035650002402056650001002080650001302090650001602103650001902119650001202138650002202150650002102172650001002193700007302203700002602276773013602302856008202438852000902520655001202529IND60707135620221120063345.0200814e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070713562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-020-02267-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Thuwaini, Tahreer M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4534-296312aA novel T177P missense variant in the HSPA8 gene associated with the low tolerance of Awassi sheep to heat stress  ap. 2405-2416.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study was conducted to identify the association of coding variations in the HSPA8 gene with heat stress in two different breeds of sheep. All the coding regions of the HSPA8 gene of Awassi and Arabi sheep were covered by amplifying nine exons. A single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) was utilized to assess the genetic variations in both breeds. The possible association of the observed genotypes with rectal temperature (RT), respiratory rate (RR), and heat tolerance coefficient (HTC) was analyzed in different seasons. While all the coding regions of both sheep were monomorphous, a remarkable heterogeneity was observed in exon 4, of which two SSCP patterns, a normal TT and a mutant TG, were detected. The TG genotype was characterized by a missense variant of T177P with frequencies of 77% in Awassi and 54% in Arabi. Cumulative in silico tools indicated extremely deleterious consequences for T177P on protein structure, function, and stability. Results indicated that sheep with the TT genotype had significantly (P < 0.05) lower RT, RR, and HTC values than sheep with the TG genotype. Therefore, a significant association of T177P with a lower tolerance of Awassi to higher temperature conditions was revealed. In conclusion, the identified T177P may have damaging effects in the HSPA8, which affects the ability of Awassi sheep to cope up with elevated temperatures compared with Arabi sheep. This manuscript describes a novel description of a highly deleterious missense variant in the HSPA8 gene that may reduce the ability of sheep to withstand high-temperature conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAwassi 3aanimal health 3abody temperature 3acomputer simulation 3aexons 3agenotype 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3amutants 3aprotein structure 3arespiratory rate 3asheep1 aAl-Shuhaib, Mohammed Baqur S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6458-20681 aHussein, Zainab Manji0 tTropical animal health and production.g2020 Sept., v. 52, no. 5 p.2405-2416dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-020-02267-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011300174500002200287520137600309592002801685650002101713650001701734650001201751650001901763650002401782650001001806650001801816650001401834650001101848650002201859650001601881653002301897653003701920653002501957653003201982700001802014700002002032700002102052700001702073773007702090856008702167852000902254655001202263IND60568562520221122030929.0170628s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056856252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2017.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCha, Hyun-Myoung10aCo-overexpression of Mgat1 and Mgat4 in CHO cells for production of highly sialylated albumin-erythropoietin  aPre-press version  aTerminal sialic acids on N-glycan of recombinant human erythropoietin are very important for in vivo half-life, as this glycoprotein has three N-glycosylation sites. N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases I, II, IV, and V (i.e. Mgat1, Mgat2, Mgat4, and Mgat5) catalyze the formation of a glycan antennary structure. These enzymes display different reaction kinetics for a common substrate and generally show low expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Therefore, genetic control of Mgat expression is an effective method to increase sialic acid contents by enhancing glycan antennarity. To produce highly sialylated albumin-erythropoietin (Alb-EPO), we co-overexpressed the Mgat1 and Mgat4 genes in CHO cells and determined the optimal ratio of Mgat1:Mgat4 gene expression. All transfected cell lines showed increased gene expression of Mgat4, including Mgat1 overexpressing cell line. Sialic acid content of Alb-EPO was highest in co-transfected cells with excess Mgat4 gene, and these cells showed a higher tri- and tetra-antennary structure than control cells. Based on these results, we suggest that co-transfection of the Mgat1 and Mgat4 genes at a ratio of 2:8 is optimal for extension of antennary structures. Also, regulation of Mgat gene expression in the glycan biosynthesis pathway can be a novel approach to increase the terminal sialic acids of N-glycans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese hamsters 3abiosynthesis 3aenzymes 3aerythropoietin 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglycosylation 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3areaction kinetics 3asialic acid 0aGlycan antennarity 0aN-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases 0aTerminal sialic acid 0aChinese hamster ovary cells1 aLim, Jin-Hyuk1 aYeon, Jung-Heum1 aHwang, Jeong-Min1 aKim, Dong-Il0 tEnzyme and Microbial Technology.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2017.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01954naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245008800178300001600266500001900282520063800301592002800939650001800967650001400985650002300999650001001022650001201032650001701044650004401061650001001105650000701115650000901122650001601131650003701147653002201184653002301206653002001229700002101249700002601270773013001296856008501426852000901511655001201520IND60696815820221116154140.0200601e20200602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069681582DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2019.16745422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKabir, Shekh Md.

These reportedly probiotic Lactobacillus strains were obtained from probiotic supplements and food products. Probiotic Lactobacillus species have been found to have several potential health benefits and technological properties which may be strain-dependent. It was deemed necessary to investigate molecular techniques for the identification and discrimination between closely related isolates. The 16S rRNA, pheS, and rpoA genes were amplified in a polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotide pairs 27F/1492R, pheS -21-F/ pheS -23-R, and rpoA -21-F/ rpoA -23-R. The PCR amplicons were separated using gel agarose electrophoresis and observed by the Bio-Rad Gel Doc ᵀᴹ XR+ Imaging system transilluminator. Sequencing of the PCR amplicons was done in an ABI PRISM ᵀᴹ 3100 genetic analyzer. MEGA 5.05 software was employed in doing the phylogenetic analysis. Identification by 16S rRNA gene sequencing was confirmed by pheS and rpoA gene sequencing. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis and concatenation showed that interspecies and intraspecies degrees of diversity and similarity were better enabled by pheS and rpoA primers. Overall, findings revealed cases of inaccurate identification of Lactobacillus strains in probiotic supplements on the market, highlighting the relevance of the multigenic approach in more accurately identifying Lactobacillus strains.

Such applications depend on knowledge of the factors controlling the characterization of the n-alkane paleoproxies of aquatic plants. This study analyzed the molecular distributions and carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions of n-alkanes of aquatic plant samples collected from the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR). In this collection, the n-alkane distributions of submersed/floating plants and emersed plants are distinctly different. By combining their Pₐq and n-alkane δ¹³C values, the n-alkane contributions from submersed plants and emersed plants in the MLYR can be differentiated. It is also noteworthy that the hydrogen isotope fractionation (εₐₗₖ/wₐₜₑᵣ; avg. −166‰) between the n-C₂₃ alkane of submersed plants in the MLYR and in precipitation agrees well with previous studies, suggesting a nearly constant εₐₗₖ/wₐₜₑᵣ for the submersed plants. Moreover, compared to C₃ dicots growing in a similar climate, submersed plants in the humid MLYR have lower n-alkane δ²H values. This feature may arise from isotopic differences in the evapotranspiration of lake water versus leaf water and in the biosynthetic fractionations of leaf waxes of these two plant groups. These results aid interpretations of the hydrogen isotope offset of the δ²H values of n-alkanes between aquatic and terrestrial plants in humid climates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnoliopsida 3aalkanes 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3aevapotranspiration 3afreshwater 3ageochemistry 3aisotope fractionation 3aleaves 3apaleoclimatology 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0an-Alkanes 0aAquatic plants 0aCarbon isotope 0aHydrogen isotope 0aFractionation1 aLu, Xiaoxia,1 aMeyers, Philip A.1 aHuang, Xianyu0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2021 Aug., v. 158 p.104270-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11790x0146-63807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2021.1042703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008300176300001600259500001900275520143600294592002801730650000901758650001201767650001501779650002101794650001501815653001901830653002601849653002101875653001901896653002001915653002301935700002701958700002001985773013002005856008502135852000902220655001202229IND60696816020221122054443.0200601e20200602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069681602DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2019.16769932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChauhan, Vinay Kumar10aInvestigation on filtration properties of polyester needle-punched dust filter  ap. 897-905.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn nonwoven filter fabrics, virgin polyester fibre is mostly used. Therefore, this study has been conducted with the use of virgin polyester fibre and recycled polyester fibre which is obtained after recycling of post-consumer bottle flakes to reduce the cost of filter fabric. The study is concerned to examine the effect of fabric GSM (grams/m²), needling density and depth of needle penetration on filtration efficiency and also to see the suitability of recycled polyester fibre in place of virgin polyester fibre. The study has shown that the increase in fabric weight resulted in increase in the filtration efficiency percentage. The increase in the depth of needle penetration resulted in increase in the extent of filtration efficiency initially; subsequently, it decreased. Similar trends were observed in case of both recycled polyester filter fabrics and virgin polyester filter fabrics. Though the filtration efficiency of filter fabrics prepared from virgin polyester fibre was slightly higher, the filtration efficiency of fabrics prepared from recycled polyester fibre was lower by only 2 to 3 per cent due to close difference in values of molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI). Therefore, looking to the filtration efficiency percentage, it may be suggested that recycled polyester fibre can be used in place of virgin polyester fibre for the manufacturing of needle-punched nonwoven filter fabrics.  aPublisher supplied data 3adust 3afabrics 3afiltration 3amolecular weight 3apolyesters 0aFilter fabrics 0afiltration efficiency 0aneedling density 0aneedle-punched 0anonwoven fabric 0arecycled polyester1 aSingh, Jitendra Pratap1 aDebnath, Sanjoy0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2020 June 2, v. 111, no. 6 p.897-905dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2019.16769933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245010700211520178700318592002802105650001302133650002202146650001302168650002002181651001002201653003102211653002202242653002102264653002202285653001802307653001702325700006602342700005202408773011302460856008602573852000902659655001202668IND60768907320221120060126.0220523e20220410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076890732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1310862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaracevic, Selma1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7528-261010aHow normative appeals influence pro-environmental behavior: The role of individualism and collectivism  aThe relationship between social norms and pro-environmental consumer behavior is well established, but what moderates this norm-sustainability relationship is much less clear. Previous studies reported inconclusive results regarding the effects of culture. This paper aims to shed light on the reported discrepancies by conducting an in-depth investigation on the effect of two central cultural dimensions, individualism, and collectivism, both on a macro (national culture) and a micro (individual self-construal) level. Specifically, the normative influence on pro-environmental behavioral intentions is analyzed for two different countries, the US and China, and insights are provided into the importance of descriptive and injunctive normative appeals in relation to the activated self-construal level. The quantitative results confirm that injunctive and descriptive normative appeals are stronger motivators of pro-environmental behavioral intentions in collectivistic (e.g., China) than in individualistic (e.g., the US) cultures. To clarify the discrepancies in previous research on norm-sustainability, how the effect of injunctive and descriptive normative appeals changes depending on the activated selfconstrual level in different cultures is demonstrated. The findings from this study are important from a theoretical perspective in that they improve the understanding of the effects of social norms on pro-environmental behavior. From a managerial perspective, it is demonstrated how individualism and collectivism on the one hand, and selfconstrual on the other hand, separately and in combination, can strengthen the effect of normative appeals on pro-environmental behavioral intentions. In conclusion, the study also identifies some promising new research avenues.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleaning 3aconsumer behavior 3ajournals 3asocial behavior 3aChina 0aPro-environmental behavior 0aNormative-appeals 0aInjunctive-norms 0aDescriptive-norms 0aIndividualism 0acollectivism1 aSchlegelmilch, Bodo B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8886-955X1 aWu, Tong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2535-14670 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Apr. 10, v. 344 p.131086-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1310863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010900172300001800281520156000299592002801859650002001887650001801907650002301925650001401948650001701962650002401979650001202003650001202015650001802027650001502045653002202060653003202082653003302114653003802147700001702185773012402202856008402326852000902410655001202419IND60408507020221119064049.0150916e20150902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040850702DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2014.9484432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaẓhar, ʻAlī,10aAvailability and performance of sediment detachment and transport functions for overland flow conditions  ap. 1550-1565.  aSoil erosion is a global environmental problem. To quantify water erosion rates at the field, hillslope or catchment scale, several spatially-distributed soil erosion models have been developed. The accuracy of those models depends largely on the sediment detachment and transport functions used, many of which were developed from empirical research. In this paper, the physical basis of the available sediment detachment and transport functions is reviewed, and their application boundaries determined. Well-known and widely-used sediment detachment and transport functions are discussed on the basis of composite force predictors, i.e. shear stress, stream power, unit stream power and effective stream power, and their suitability is elucidated based on information in the literature. It was found that only a few sediment detachment functions are available, and those have been poorly tested. Most erosion models ignore direct calculation of sediment detachment, but use the sediment transport capacity deficit approach to estimate detachment rate. Many more sediment transport functions are available that also tested better for overland flow conditions. However, our tests did not result in a single function that appeared to perform best under a range of experimental conditions. The unit stream power-based functions developed by Govers seem to be the most promising ones for water erosion modelling. It is therefore recommended to evaluate the performance of existing sediment transport functions with more detailed field and laboratory datasets.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aoverland flow 3asediment transport 3asediments 3ashear stress 3asoil erosion models 3astreams 3atesting 3awater erosion 3awatersheds 0aliterature review 0asediment transport function 0asediment detachment function 0aperformance of sediment functions1 aSterk, Geert0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2015 Sept. 2, v. 60, no. 9 p.1550-1565dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2014.9484433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04214naa a2200889 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245012600210506010400336506007600440520176400516592002802280506003702308650003402345650002002379650002402399650001902423650001502442650001202457650002102469650001502490650001202505650001602517650001002533650001102543650001002554650001302564650000902577650001402586650001302600650001002613650001302623650002002636650001502656651001502671653002402686653001402710653001702724653001602741653001302757653001002770653000802780653000802788653000802796653000802804653000802812653000702820653000902827653000702836653000902843653000802852653000802860653000702868653001102875653000902886653000802895653000902903653000902912653000802921653000702929653000802936653000802944653000902952653000802961700007002969700002103039700002603060700002803086773010503114856008403219852000903303655001203312IND60790611420221207100846.0220914e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079061142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prmcm.2022.1001532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohankumar, Ramar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2047-980810aEvaluation of analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic activities of Ziziphus mauritania Lam leaves in animal models  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aZiziphus mauritiana (Rhamnaceae), commonly known as Ziziphus jujuba Mill, is in traditional Chinese medicine enriched with high medicinal values. In Indian and Chinese traditional medicine, a decoction of Ziziphus mauritiana leaves was used to cure insomnia, amnesia, pain, and vertigo. The study aims to determine the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic activities of Ziziphus mauritiana Lam leaves to establish a rationale for their use. We studied analgesic activity by writhing and the hot plate methods in mice, whereas mechanical allodynia in rats. Also, rats were used in carrageenan anti-inflammatory and brewer's yeast-caused pyrexia. MEZ were tested at 250 and 500 mg/kg orally. Molecular docking studies between 3 inflammatory pathway proteins and natural molecules are planned and carried out. CHARMm was used for docking, and the smart minimizer algorithm was used to reduce energy. Acute toxicity testing up to 5000 mg/kg showed no deaths. Both UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis and phytochemical analysis supported the presence of flavonoids, terpenoids and saponins. At a dose of 500 mg/kg, MEZ significantly (p<0.001) reduces the perception of pain brought on by thermal, mechanical, and chemical pain models. Paw edema is dramatically reduced at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after carrageenan injection by MEZ at 500 mg/kg. Similarly, MEZ at 500 mg/kg showed a gradual drop in rectal temperatures from 3 to 9 h. The docking result illustrated that the quercetin and rutin exposed a better binding with inflammatory protein through multiple hydrogen bonds and π interactions. The findings showed that the MEZ has potential analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties at the levels studied, supporting the traditional use claim.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aZiziphus jujuba 3aZiziphus mauritiana 3aacute toxicity 3aalgorithms 3aamnesia 3aanalgesic effect 3aanalgesics 3aanimals 3acarrageenan 3aedema 3aenergy 3afever 3ahydrogen 3apain 3aquercetin 3aresearch 3arutin 3asaponins 3asleep disorders 3aterpenoids 3aMauritania 0aZiziphus mauritiana 0aAnalgesic 0aInflammation 0aCarrageenan 0aToxicity 0aANOVA 0aCAT 0aCMC 0aCOX 0aESI 0aFDA 0aIL 0aiNOS 0aLC 0aLTB4 0aMEZ 0aMRM 0aMS 0aNSAIDs 0aOECD 0aPDB 0aPGE2 0aQSAR 0aTOF 0aRT 0aSOD 0aTNF 0aUPLC 0aWHO1 aPrakash, Soosai Eugine Leo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7399-66601 aIrfan, Navabshan1 aMohanraj, Subramanian1 aKumarappan, Chidambaram0 tPharmacological research.g2022 Sept., v. 4 p.100153-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:28563x2667-14257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prmcm.2022.1001533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245011400212520211200326592002802438650001502466650002002481650001102501650001602512650001702528650001902545650001502564650002202579650002402601651001002625653002902635653001902664653002102683653004402704653002202748773011302770856008602883852000902969655001202978IND60768907420221120043305.0220523e20220410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076890742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1310872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCristiano, Silvio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8817-422914aThe “price” of saved time, the illusion of saved fuel: Life-Cycle Assessment of a major highway expansion  aThe road transport sector is a major responsible for pollutant greenhouse emissions. Airborne and other types of environmental impacts involve much more than just the most addressed driving activity and its combustion residues. Building upon a previous work rooted in systems thinking and emergy accounting, Life-Cycle Assessment is applied to transport studies in order to evaluate the environmental performances of a civil infrastructure in Italy before and after major expansion and deviation works: altogether, these methods are used as comprehensive tools to measure sustainability, while including resource consumption and requirements, direct and indirect environmental impacts, and their effects on human health, all depicted by a wide selection of 30 standard indicators. The expansion project, completed in recent years, is compared with the no-build option as well as with the results from the previous cost-benefit and emergy-based systemic assessments, thus shedding novel light on road construction and appraisal compared to purely economic and purely ecological tools only. Life-Cycle Impact Assessment results are expressed in terms of impact indicators per full highway section, but results per road length unit (km), and per transport service unit (p-km and t-km) can be derived. Unlike the claims by managing authority and policy-makers, an overall worsening is found in all of the adopted environmental indicators, although differences exist among them (from +47% up to +244%, with most indicators doubling or even tripling after the renovation works). Expected on-road fuel savings, where applicable, just mitigate an overall negative situation: such savings are overcome by the effects of the fuels indirectly required to obtain them, and by the overall impacts following the expansion, albeit normalised through relevant amortisation. The only stable saving, i.e. travel time, stays structurally out of a Life-Cycle Assessment, whose clear results can serve as a basis for possibly long-sighted design, planning, and decision-making in an era of urgently needed environmental actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3adecision making 3aemergy 3agreenhouses 3ahuman health 3ainfrastructure 3apollutants 3aroad construction 3aroad transportation 3aItaly 0aEnvironmental assessment 0aSustainability 0aProblem shifting 0aAppraisal and evaluation of civil works 0aRegional planning0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Apr. 10, v. 344 p.131087-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1310873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005900149245007700208520135000285592002801635650001501663650001501678650001201693650001201705650001201717650001301729650001101742650001101753650001501764650001101779650002201790650000901812650001901821650001201840650001901852650001401871650001101885650001601896650001101912650001301923650001201936650001501948653001701963653001601980653002401996700001702020700002202037700002502059700001902084773012402103856008402227852000902311655001202320IND60754845620221120153700.0211218e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075484562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indic.2021.1001552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Mahendra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7245-765410aRemediation strategies for heavy metals contaminated ecosystem: A review  aIndustries and anthropogenic activities around us engender our natural resources with their noxious discharge, untreated waste water or sludge containing variety of heavy metals. These toxic metals in turn are emerging health risks for living beings triggering allergies, infection, defects and diseases. Consequently, there is evolving needs for ecologically safe, systematic and novel approach to remediate these toxic heavy metals. Physical, chemical and biological methods have not been much effective in dealing of contaminated ecosystem. These conventional approaches have limitation in terms of higher cost, energy consumption and less efficiency. Overcoming their drawbacks, adsorption, a physico-chemical surface phenomenon came to light which is a way cheaper, effective, flexible, reactive and efficient technique for eliminating heavy metals like cobalt, chromium, lead, nickel, mercury, arsenic, uranium, cadmium, copper etc. Modulating chemical and physical characteristics of microbes, lignocellulosic material, industrial waste biomass, nanotubes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and nanocomposite material, escorts in fabricating a magnificent adsorbent. This review critically evaluates various type of adsorbents, their application and adsorption efficiency. It also analysed the parameters affecting the adsorption processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3abiomass 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aindustrial wastes 3alead 3alignocellulose 3amercury 3ananocomposites 3ananotubes 3anickel 3aremediation 3asludge 3atoxicity 3auranium 3awastewater 0aHeavy metals 0aBiosorption 0aAdsorption capacity1 aSeth, Aparna1 aSingh, Alak Kumar1 aRajput, Manish Singh1 aSikandar, Mohd0 tEnvironmental and sustainability indicators.g2021 Dec., v. 12 p.100155-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27272x2665-97277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indic.2021.1001553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245008500153300001600238520105300254592002801307650001501335650001501350650002101365650001501386650001601401650002501417650002001442650002201462650002201484650000901506650001701515650001901532650001301551650001401564650001601578700002101594700002001615700001801635700001501653700001501668700001601683700001301699700001701712700001201729700001601741773012401757856007401881852000901955655001201964IND60656698520221121235845.0190814e20131205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065669852DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay41233d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Cui10aColorimetric screening of β-glucosidase inhibition based on gold nanocomposites  ap. 312-315.  aThis article presents a simple gold–cellobiose nanocomposites based colorimetric assay for the screening of β-glucosidase inhibitors. The nanocomposites are composed of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), particular cellobiose substrates, and 6-mercapto-1-hexanol. After β-glucosidase digestion, the AuNPs become more exposed and the attractive force between AuNPs is increased by the modified 6-mercapto-1-hexanol. Consequently, the aggregation of nanocomposites and the red shift of surface plasmon absorption can be observed. The absorbance ratio at 650 nm and 520 nm (A₆₅₀/A₅₂₀) of nanocomposites can be used to estimate the β-glucosidase activity. This technology could serve an alternative platform for the efficient screening of β-glucosidase inhibitors. Both the inhibition effect of heavy metals and surfactants on β-glucosidase could be analyzed by the detection of β-glucosidase activity. To summarize, the goal of this technical note is to develop a simple colorimetric method for the screening of β-glucosidase inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3abeta-glucosidase 3acellobiose 3acolorimetry 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme inhibitors 3agold 3aheavy metals 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3ascreening 3asurfactants1 aZeng, Guang-Ming1 aHuang, Dan-Lian1 aZhao, Mei-Hua1 aChen, Ming1 aWei, Chen,1 aHuang, Chao1 aXu, Piao1 aLi, Ning-Jie1 aLi, Xue1 aZhang, Chen0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Dec. 5, v. 6, no. 1 p.312-315dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay41233d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245011300177300001400290520186300304592002802167650001102195650001402206650001102220650001102231650001302242650001502255650002202270650002402292650001702316650002102333653002302354653003002377653003102407653002202438653001502460653003402475700002502509700002002534700002302554700001702577700002002594700002102614700001702635773010802652856009002760852000902850655001202859IND60084080720221116204355.0190318e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008408072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2012.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaquet, Catherine10aAre accessibility and characteristics of public open spaces associated with a better cardiometabolic health?  ap. 70-78.  aThis study investigated the associations between the accessibility, greenness, size, and type (active vs. passive) of public open spaces (POS) and clinical risk markers for cardiometabolic diseases and whether such associations could be explained (mediated) by physical activity and psychological well-being. Adult participants (n=3754) provided clinical, self-reported, and residential location data. Cardiometabolic risk was defined as the sum of six anthropometric and biochemical risk markers. POS accessibility was defined as the number and proportion of POS within a 1000-m road distance from participants’ residences. Greenness, size and type were respectively defined as the median Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, median size, and proportion of POS with a sporting land use for all accessible POS. Physical activity and psychological well-being were self-reported. Associations were tested using Poisson regression models accounting for spatial clustering of observations and participants’ age, gender, education, income and area-level socioeconomic disadvantage. The number and proportion of POS were not found to be statistically significantly related to cardiometabolic health; however, greenness, size, and type (active) of available POS were inversely related to cardiometabolic risk. The association between POS and cardiometabolic health was partially mediated by physical activity. Psychological well-being was not implicated in the associations tested. These results suggest that the characteristics, not the number or proportion, of locally accessible POS are related to cardiometabolic health and, to some degree, physical activity. Maintaining or improving the quality of locally available POS might be a more effective urban design strategy to support cardiometabolic health than efforts to increase the accessibility of POS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aeducation 3agender 3aincome 3aland use 3aopen space 3aphysical activity 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3avegetation index 0aPublic open spaces 0aResidence characteristics 0aCardiovascular risk factor 0aPhysical activity 0aWell-being 0aGeographic Information System1 aOrschulok, Thomas P.1 aCoffee, Neil T.1 aHoward, Natasha J.1 aHugo, Graeme1 aTaylor, Anne W.1 aAdams, Robert J.1 aDaniel, Mark0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2013 Oct., v. 118 p.70-78dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2012.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245017600203520111700379592002801496650001801524650001901542650001901561650001601580650001301596650001801609650001801627650002001645650001901665650000701684650001501691653001301706653002401719653001601743700002501759700002001784700005801804700005901862773012001921856008302041852000902124655001202133IND60754845720221120153632.0211218e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075484572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jafr.2021.1002212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Bowen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8499-841514aThe manufacturing of lactobacillus microcapsules by freezing with egg yolk: The analysis of microstructure and the preservation effect against freezing and acid treatments  aEncapsulation is an effective strategy to prevent probiotics from environmental damages.

The results showed that freezing with the addition of egg yolk improved Lactobacillus survivability. It was confirmed that freezing increased the number of egg yolk aggregates, and those aggregates coated Lactobacillus after freezing. The encapsulated Lactobacillus was treated at pH 2.5 for 10 min, and the results showed that the encapsulation process increased the acid resistance of Lactobacillus. These results indicate that freezing-induced encapsulation with egg yolk could effectively protect Lactobacillus against freezing and acid treatment. This finding could be useful for the design and preservation of probiotics-based food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3aacid tolerance 3aacid treatment 3aagriculture 3aegg yolk 3aencapsulation 3afood research 3aliquid egg yolk 3amicrostructure 3apH 3aprobiotics 0aFreezing 0aMicro-encapsulation 0aAggregation1 aWatanabe, Hironoshin1 aIsobe, Kazuhiro1 aHanda, Akihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9139-70121 aNakagawa, Kyuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9139-429X0 tJournal of agriculture and food research.g2021 Dec., v. 6 p.100221-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27273x2666-15437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafr.2021.1002213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03885naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011600171520203900287592002802326650002202354650002402376650001602400650001602416650001902432650001502451650001602466650001802482650001802500650001602518650001602534650002602550650002502576650001502601650002102616650002102637650001502658650001802673650002202691650001802713650001702731650002502748651001002773651001102783653001802794653002002812653001302832653002802845653002502873700006102898700002602959700006102985700002503046773012003071856008303191852000903274655001203283IND60754845820221120143237.0211218e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075484582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jafr.2021.1002222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdekaldu, Emmanuel10aResponse of chilli pepper to different irrigation schedules and mulching technologies in semi-arid environments  aThe impacts of climate change on food security have increased interest in research and investments in irrigation technologies and agricultural water management. Agricultural practices such as mulching help to conserve soil moisture by reducing evaporation and mitigate the adverse effects of water stress on crops, especially in semi-arid environments. This study investigated the combined effects of irrigation schedules and different mulching technologies on the growth and yield of two varieties of chilli pepper – Legon 18 (Capsicum frutescens L.) and Kpakpo shito (Capsicum chinense) – in the Guinea Savannah agro-ecological zone of Ghana. Soil temperature and moisture content as well as plant growth parameters were collected over the growth period. The number of days taken for first and 50% flowering and fruiting were also recorded. Total fruit yield and crop water productivity were estimated after harvest. Results show that the combination of irrigation at 100% ETcrop every three days and rice straw mulch ensured optimal soil temperature and moisture content that improved vegetative growth, shortened the number of days to flowering and fruiting, and significantly improved yield and water use efficiency compared to the other treatment combinations. Fruit yield for this treatment combination was up to 19,042.2 kg/ha and 19,074.6 kg/ha whereas crop water productivity was up to 6.08 kg/m³ and 6.09 kg/m³ for Legon 18 and Kpakpo shito, respectively. Plastic film mulch under each irrigation schedule produced higher growth and yield-related parameters than no mulch treatments. Although findings from this study cannot be directly generalized for the entire Guinea Savannah agro-ecological zone of Ghana due to spatial variability of soil and other climatic variables, the combination of irrigation schedule at 100% ETcrop every three days and rice straw mulch is recommended for improved yield and water use efficiency in dry season chilli pepper production in semi-arid environments with sandy loam soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum chinense 3aCapsicum frutescens 3aagriculture 3aagroecology 3aclimate change 3adry season 3aevaporation 3afood research 3afood security 3afruit yield 3ahot peppers 3airrigation scheduling 3aplastic film mulches 3arice straw 3asandy loam soils 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3astraw mulches 3avegetative growth 3awater content 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3aGhana 3aGuinea 0aChilli pepper 0aDrip irrigation 0aMulching 0aCrop water productivity 0aGuinea Savannah zone1 aAmponsah, William1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1010-12061 aTuffour, Henry Oppong1 aAdu, Michael Osei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5243-74721 aAgyare, Wilson Agyei0 tJournal of agriculture and food research.g2021 Dec., v. 6 p.100222-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27273x2666-15437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafr.2021.1002223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245012000208300001600328520116300344592002801507650002001535650002301555650000901578650003101587650001801618650002001636650001301656650001901669650001401688650002401702653001401726653002001740653002201760653002401782653002701806653002301833700002201856700001801878700001701896700006501913773011301978856008202091852000902173655001202182IND60736458320221119164822.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073645832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2021.04.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Debabrata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4953-301410aIdentification and characterization of novel microRNAs in disease-resistant and disease-susceptible Penaeus monodon  ap. 347-372.  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs), known as a translational regulator, are evolutionary conserved, small, and noncoding RNA. They have played a vital role in disease biology through the host-virus-miRNA-interaction. In this study, novel miRNAs of naturally occurring, virus-free disease-resistant and disease-susceptible Penaeus monodon were identified and characterized. In disease-susceptible samples, 45 homologous mature miRNAs and 28 homologous precursor miRNAs were identified. In disease-resistant samples, 52 homologous mature miRNAs and 87 homologous precursor miRNAs were identified. In disease-susceptible samples, 33 novel mature miRNAs and 33 novel precursor miRNAs were identified. In disease-resistant samples, 523 novel mature miRNAs and 141 novel precursor miRNAs were identified. Differential expression study revealed the up-regulated and down-regulated miRNAs in disease-resistant and disease-susceptible P. monodon. Gene ontology pathway of known and novel miRNAs revealed that P. monodon miRNAs might have a potential and specific role in signal transduction, cell-to-cell signaling, innate immune response and defense response to different pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenaeus monodon 3adisease resistance 3afish 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3ainnate immunity 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3ashellfish 3asignal transduction 0aMicroRNAs 0aPenaeus monodon 0aDisease-resistant 0aDisease-susceptible 0aInnate immune response 0aAntiviral response1 aChakrabarty, Usri1 aDutta, Sourav1 aMallik, Ajoy1 aMandal, Nripendranath1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8733-35660 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2021 Dec., v. 119 p.347-372dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2021.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03806naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245011700204300001600321500001900337500002000356520201600376592002802392650003002420650002102450650002002471650002202491650002102513650001102534650001302545650001402558650000902572650001702581650001002598650002002608650001602628650003002644650002102674651001102695700003202706700006702738700002202805700002302827700004702850700003102897700002002928700002202948700003502970700002703005773013703032856007403169852000903243655001203252IND60704955920221119204505.0200728e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070495592DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.133902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguiar, Daniel Moura1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8631-522X10aUncommon Ehrlichia canis infection associated with morulae in neutrophils from naturally infected dogs in Brazil  ap. 135-141.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEhrlichia and Anaplasma species are the most common tick‐borne disease (TBD) pathogens in dogs worldwide. Ehrlichia canis, the aetiological agent of the Canine Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (CME), is known to replicate within the cytoplasm of mononuclear cells into clusters of organisms called morulae. However, detection of morulae in neutrophils is commonly observed in dogs infected by Ehrlichia ewingii or Anaplasma phagocytophilum. We report uncommon clinical cases of canine ehrlichiosis presenting morulae compatible with E. ewingii and A. phagocytophilum in dogs from two distinct regions of Brazil. Eight dogs were admitted to two veterinary teaching hospitals from Brazil, showing clinical or haematological signs suggestive of TBD. Blood or peritoneal fluid was withdrawn for haematological and cytologic analysis. All samples were evaluated by PCR assays for Ehrlichia and Anaplasma using genus‐specific primers for dsb, 16S rRNA and groEL genes, followed by sequencing. Samples were also evaluated by nested PCR assays for the 16S rRNA gene of E. ewingii and groEL gene of A. phagocytophilum and Anaplasma platys. Seven dogs revealed thrombocytopenia, six dogs had monocytosis and five presented lymphopenia and anaemia. All dogs showed morulae structures compatible with Ehrlichia spp. in neutrophils and were PCR‐positive for the dsb and 16S rRNA gene fragments of Ehrlichia, with sequences showing 100% identity with multiple E. canis sequences deposited in the GenBank™. Sequencing of 16S rRNA and groEL gene fragments from one PCR‐positive dog showed 100% identity with A. platys. Overall, our data suggest that in endemic regions for E. canis, that is Brazil, the presence of morulae in neutrophils may indicate infection by this bacterium. Herein, morulae were also found in neutrophils present in the peritoneal fluid of a dog. Also, this is the first report of E. canis and Hepatozoon canis co‐infection in neutrophils from naturally infected dogs confirmed by DNA sequencing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma phagocytophilum 3aAnaplasma platys 3aEhrlichia canis 3aEhrlichia ewingii 3aHepatozoon canis 3aanemia 3abacteria 3acytoplasm 3adogs 3aehrlichiosis 3agenes 3amixed infection 3aneutrophils 3apolymerase chain reaction 3athrombocytopenia 3aBrazil1 aRodrigues, Fernanda Panseri1 aRibeiro, Márcio Garcia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2682-93891 ados Santos, Bruna1 aMuraro, Livia Saab1 aTaques, Isis Indaiara Gonçalves Granjeiro1 aCampos, Amanda Noeli Silva1 aDutra, Valéria1 aNakazato, Luciano1 ada Costa Vieira, Rafael Felipe1 aTakahira, Regina Kiomi0 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2020 July, v. 67 Suppl S2 p.135-141dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.133903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015300169520144400322592002801766650001101794650001101805650001101816650001601827650001701843651001401860651001001874651001501884651001301899651001201912651001101924651000901935651002101944651001001965651002401975651001701999651001502016653003202031653001402063653001902077653001002096700001502106700005102121700001502172773011302187856008602300852000902386655001202395IND60768907820221120070151.0220509e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076890782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1310932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Kongchao10aMeasuring the natural gas supply security performance of China's natural gas suppliers: A comprehensive framework using FAHP-Entropy-PROOTHEE method  aThe increasing dependence on foreign natural gas has brought severe challenges to China's natural gas supply security. Hence, choosing secure and reliable natural gas suppliers is crucial. This paper first proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework for the natural gas supply security of natural gas suppliers from two aspects: suppliers' own factors and the interaction factors between importers and suppliers based on the risk factors of the natural gas supply chain. On this basis, the PROOTHEE model based on the combination weight method is introduced to measure the supply security performance of China's 15 natural gas suppliers from 2015 to 2019. The results show that the supply security performance of China's natural gas suppliers varies greatly and the gap widened. Australia, Russia and the United States are the top three countries in terms of the overall supply security. Qatar, Norway, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Uzbekistan show moderate supply security. Oman, Papua New Guinea, Trinidad and Tobago and Nigeria demonstrate poor supply security. Most suppliers have medium and low supply security and China's natural gas imports from suppliers do not match their supply security levels to some extent, which results in China's natural gas imports facing a relatively high supply risk. Considering risk controllability, China should focus more on interaction factors, especially to strengthen energy diplomacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRussia 3aenergy 3amodels 3anatural gas 3asupply chain 3aAustralia 3aChina 3aKazakhstan 3aMalaysia 3aNigeria 3aNorway 3aOman 3aPapua New Guinea 3aQatar 3aTrinidad and Tobago 3aTurkmenistan 3aUzbekistan 0aNatural gas supply security 0aSuppliers 0aPROOTHEE model 0aChina1 aZhao, Yuan1 aXu, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4611-81701 aHao, Lisha0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 345 p.131093-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1310933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03777naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009100168506007600259520222800335592002802563506003702591650002002628650001802648650001502666650002102681650001702702650002602719650003002745650001702775650002502792650001702817650001002834650001402844651001702858651002002875653001402895653001402909653001602923653001302939653001802952700001902970700002402989700001503013700002503028773012503053856008403178852000903262655001203271IND60736458420221207110435.0220606e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073645842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2021.1071952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTovar, Juan D.10aPhylogenetics and historical biogeography of Solanum section Brevantherum (Solanaceae)  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPatterns of diversification in Neotropical plants have been studied intensively over the past decades. Most studies have focused on groups that migrated to and radiated into the Neotropics, however, with little focus on understanding diversification patterns in indigenous Neotropical groups. This study focuses on Solanum section Brevantherum Seithe (Solanaceae), a group of Neotropical nightshade shrubs or treelets defined mostly by terminal inflorescences with long peduncles, plurifoliate sympodial units and porrect-stellate, dendritic-echinoid, or lepidote trichomes. We generated sequences from two nuclear (ITS, waxy) and one plastid marker (trnT-F) to infer phylogenetic relationships under Bayesian and Maximum likelihood approaches. We reconstructed a time-calibrated tree to estimate both the ages of main splits and the ancestral ranges of the lineages. Finally, we carried out a biogeographic stochastic mapping (BSM) analysis to determine the main processes driving current distributions of the group. Results show the non-monophyly of the section as previously recognized and the homoplasy of morphological characters traditionally used to circumscribe it. Two main clades that encompass most species formerly recognized in section Brevantherum are recovered and named as the Erianthum and Abutiloides clades. Divergence time estimates suggest that the Erianthum and Abutiloides clades split around 5.7 Mya in the upper Miocene. Two main dispersal events from the Atlantic rainforest are supported in the Erianthum clade: one dispersal to Mesoamerica and a second dispersal to the Northern Andes. Within the Abutiloides clade, cladogenetic events were restricted to the Andean region. Our BSM analysis suggests within-area speciation and range expansion as the main processes shaping the extant distribution of species of both clades. As no putative morphological synapomorphies can yet be assigned to what could correspond to a new circumscription of Solanum section Brevantherum (with the exclusion of Solanum bullatum Vell. and inclusion of S. inelegans Rusby and four species described since the group last revision) we discourage the continued use of what would be an ambiguous sectional nomenclature.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3aMiocene epoch 3aNeotropics 3aSolanum bullatum 3abiogeography 3abiological speciation 3ageographical distribution 3arain forests 3astatistical analysis 3asynapomorphy 3atrees 3atrichomes 3aAndes region 3aCentral America 0aDispersal 0aEvolution 0aNightshades 0aPatterns 0aSouth America1 aAndré, Thiago1 aWahlert, Gregory A.1 aBohs, Lynn1 aGiacomin, Leandro L.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2021 Sept., v. 162 p.107195-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2021.1071953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245015800175520155100333592002801884650001501912650001601927650001501943650002601958650001601984650001802000650001602018650002202034650001702056650001802073650001002091650001202101650001702113650001902130650001602149650001702165650001802182650001702200651001502217653001702232653001502249653001602264653001502280700005902295700002102354700002302375700002302398700002802421700002202449773012002471856008302591852000902674655001202683IND60754846020221122233309.0211218e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075484602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jafr.2021.1002242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabby, Md Raisul Islam10aComparative analysis of bacteriological hazards and prevalence of Salmonella in poultry-meat retailed in wet- and super-markets in Dhaka city, Bangladesh  aCommercial poultry meat is a well-recognized food vehicle for Salmonellosis worldwide. This study intended to determine bacteriological hazards and the Salmonella prevalence in poultry meat sold in retail shops in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. A total of 52 poultry meat samples were tested for Salmonella prevalence and biological hazards. The safety status of wet markets and supermarkets was also determined using aerobic plate count (APC) and total coliform count (TCC). Presumptively identified Salmonella isolates were tested for the presence of the Salmonella-specific gene invA. Antibiotic susceptibility test of Salmonella isolates was done with ten antimicrobial agents using antibiotic disk diffusion assays. The poultry meat sample of the four wet markets contained significantly higher (P < 0.001) APC and TCC than three super shops. From the safety point of view, only 8.18% samples and 60% samples collected from retail markets and super shops, respectively, were within safety limit for consumption (χ² = 15.784, P < 0.001). The overall Salmonella prevalence was 13.46%. All seven Salmonella isolates were resistant to erythromycin, ampicillin, cloxacillin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim, and sensitive to levofloxacin. Among them, 14.18%, 28.57%, and 71.42% were resistant to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone, respectively. So, this study recommends proper sanitary and hygienic conditions, improved meat processing, and storage in chilled/frozen conditions to prevent Salmonella contamination in raw poultry meat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3aagriculture 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3aceftriaxone 3aciprofloxacin 3acloxacillin 3acoliform bacteria 3aerythromycin 3afood research 3agenes 3ahygiene 3alevofloxacin 3anitrofurantoin 3aplate count 3apoultry meat 3asalmonellosis 3atrimethoprim 3aBangladesh 0aPoultry-meat 0aWet market 0aSupermarket 0aBiohazards1 aShah, SM Tanjil1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8010-33651 aMiah, Md Ibrahim1 aIslam, Md Shariful1 aKhan, Md Abu Sayem1 aRahman, Mohammad Saydur1 aAbdul Malek, Md.,0 tJournal of agriculture and food research.g2021 Dec., v. 6 p.100224-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27273x2666-15437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafr.2021.1002243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03555naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245008600202300001800288500002000306520152400326592002801850596007001878596013901948596006902087596005902156596005902215596006102274650002502335650001302360650002602373650001802399650001902417650001602436650002602452650003302478650001802511650002102529650001702550650005202567650001602619650003002635650001102665700002002676700002102696700001202717700001902729700001402748700001202762700001202774773011902786856007502905852000902980655001202989IND60790612620221119182952.0220826e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079061262DNAL7 a10.1002/agj2.209752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zheng‐Ting1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9953-008410aNAC062 acts as an upstream regulator of NAC103 under endoplasmic reticulum stress  ap. 1981-1994.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEnvironmental stresses may trigger the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus leading to ER stress in plants. Endoplasmic reticulum stress, harmful to plant growth, can be alleviated by upregulating unfolded protein response (UPR) initiated by transcription factors. NAC062 and NAC103, as reported in previous studies, both play significant roles in upregulating UPR genes to promote cell survival under ER stress in Arabidopsis. It is still unclear, however, which one of them acts as an upstream regulator in the ER stress pathway. Results of the current study demonstrated that NAC062 acts as an upstream regulator to directly regulate the expression of NAC103 to mediate ER stress in mouse‐ear cress [Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh]. The expression of NAC103 is upregulated by the overexpression of NAC062D (the nuclear localization form of NAC062). Through subsequent dual‐luciferase reporter assay and yeast one‐hybrid (YIH) assay, NAC062D was found directly bound to the NAC103 promoter. The results of real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR) showed that NAC062 and NAC103 are both upregulated in biotic stress (jasmonic acid [JA] treatment) and abiotic stress (such as salt stress, oxidation stress, and cold stress) pathways. Studying the relationship between NAC062 and NAC103 is beneficial to understand their function in biotic and abiotic stress pathways, so as to enhance plants tolerance under environmental stresses.  aPublisher supplied data  a[2017]5726cThe Initial Fund Key Laboratories of Guizhou Province  aU1812401cThe Joint Fund of the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Karst Science Research Center of Guizhou Province  a[2017]1418cGuizhou Provincial Science and Technology Foundation  a31600214cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31760138cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a[2015]cDoctoral Foundation of Guizhou Normal University 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aagronomy 3abioluminescence assay 3abiotic stress 3acell viability 3acold stress 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3ajasmonic acid 3aoxidative stress 3aplant growth 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalt stress 3aunfolded protein response 3ayeasts1 aGuo, Zi‐Qiang1 aWang, Shun‐Sha1 aAn, Yin1 aFan, Si‐Xian1 aJian, Yan1 aLi, Kun1 aYi, Yin0 tAgronomy journal.g2022 July, v. 114, no. 4 p.1981-1994dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.209753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03776naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015100159300001400310500001900324500002000343520196800363592002802331596008102359596011602440650002202556650002602578650001202604650002302616650001802639650001002657650003502667650001002702650001102712650001202723650002202735650002402757650001902781651001902800651002602819700002102845700002502866700002102891700004402912700001902956700003102975700002203006773013503028856007403163852000903237655001203246IND60704956220221119204542.0200728e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070495622DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.131912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsi, Ting‐En10aSeroepidemiological and molecular investigation of spotted fever group rickettsiae and Coxiella burnetii in Sao Tome Island: A One Health approach  ap. 36-43.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSpotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR) and Coxiella burnetii are intracellular bacteria that cause potentially life‐threatening tick‐borne rickettsioses and Q fever respectively. Sao Tome and Principe (STP), small islands located in the Gulf of Guinea, recently experienced a dramatic reduction in the incidence of malaria owing to international collaborative efforts. However, unexplained febrile illnesses persist. A One Health approach was adopted to investigate exposure to SFGR and C. burnetii in humans and examine the diversity of these bacteria in ticks parasitizing domestic ruminants. A cross‐sectional human serological study was conducted in Agua Grande district in Sao Tome Island from January to March 2016, and ticks were collected from farmed domestic ruminants in 2012 and 2016. In total, 240 individuals varying in age were randomly screened for exposure to SFGR and C. burnetii by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Twenty of 240 individuals (8.3%) were seropositive for SFGR (4 for Rickettsia africae and 16 for R. conorii) and 16 (6.7%) were seropositive for C. burnetii. Amblyomma astrion were collected exclusively in 2012, as were A. variegatum in 2016 and Rickettsia spp. were detected in 22/42 (52.4%) and 49/60 (81.7%) respectively. Sequence analysis of multiple gene targets from Rickettsia spp. detected in ticks suggests the presence of a single divergent R. africae strain (Sao Tome). While no ticks were found positive for C. burnetii, Coxiella‐like endosymbionts were detected in nearly all ticks. This is the first study in STP to provide serological evidence in humans of SFGR and C. burnetii and additional molecular evidence in ticks for SFGR, which may be responsible for some of the unexplained febrile illnesses that persist despite the control of malaria. Future epidemiological studies are needed to confirm the occurrence and risk factors associated with SFG rickettsioses and Q fever in both humans and animals.  aPublisher supplied data  a103‐2314‐B‐002‐036‐MY2cMinistry of Science and Technology Council  cMinistry of Health and Welfare and National Taiwan University Infectious Diseases Research and Education Center 3aCoxiella burnetii 3aOne Health initiative 3aQ fever 3aRickettsia africae 3aendosymbionts 3afever 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3ahumans 3amalaria 3asequence analysis 3aserological surveys 3aseroprevalence 3aGulf of Guinea 3aSao Tome and Principe1 aHsiao, Sui‐Wen1 aMinahan, Nicholas T.1 aYen, Tsai‐Ying1 ade Assunção Carvalho, Arlindo Vicente1 aRaoult, Didier1 aFournier, Pierre‐Edouard1 aTsai, Kun‐Hsien0 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2020 July, v. 67 Suppl S2 p.36-43dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.131913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011800169300001600287520098600303592002801289650001801317650000801335650001701343650001801360650001101378650001901389650001301408650001301421650003601434650002301470650001601493650002101509650001001530650001301540650001101553653001701564653001701581653001601598653001101614653002301625653001201648653001001660700002401670700002001694773008901714856008401803852000901887655001201896IND60086726220221118023358.0160903e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008672622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2012.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumari, Sumita10aImpact of elevated CO2 and elevated O3 on Beta vulgaris L.: Pigments, metabolites, antioxidants, growth and yield  ap. 279-288.  aThe present study was conducted to assess morphological, biochemical and yield responses of palak (Beta vulgaris L. cv Allgreen) to ambient and elevated levels of CO2 and O3, alone and in combination. As compared to the plants grown in charcoal filtered air (ACO2), growth and yield of the plants increased under elevated CO2 (ECO2) and decreased under combination of ECO2 with elevated O3 (ECO2 + EO3), ambient O3 (ACO2 + AO3) and elevated O3 (EO3). Lipid peroxidation, ascorbic acid, catalase and glutathione reductase activities enhanced under all treatments and were highest in EO3. Foliar starch and organic carbon contents increased under ECO2 and ECO2 + EO3 and reduced under EO3 and ACO2 + AO3. Foliar N content declined in all treatments compared to ACO2 resulting in alteration of C/N ratio. This study concludes that ambient level of CO2 is not enough to counteract O3 impact, but elevated CO2 has potential to counteract the negative effects of future O3 level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeta vulgaris 3aair 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalase 3acharcoal 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3alipid peroxidation 3ametabolites 3anitrogen content 3aozone 3apigments 3astarch 0aAntioxidants 0aElevated CO2 0aElevated O3 0aGrowth 0aLipid peroxidation 0aPigment 0aYield1 aAgrawal, Madhoolika1 aTiwari, Supriya0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 Mar., v. 174 p.279-288dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2012.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03743naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245009100188300001800279520177200297592002802069650001202097650001702109650001102126650002102137650001502158650002402173650001402197650001002211650001702221650002902238650002102267650001502288650001502303650001202318650001602330650004302346650002002389650001602409650000902425650001902434650001302453650004702466650004802513650003102561650002302592650001602615650002902631650002202660650002402682650002502706650001602731700002202747700002202769700001802791700001902809700002202828700002002850700001502870773011502885856004803000852000903048655001203057IND50074378020221120173017.0140401e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007437802DNAL7 a242018922pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-013-5328-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArends, Jan B. A.10aGreenhouse gas emissions from rice microcosms amended with a plant microbial fuel cell  ap. 3205-3217.  aMethane (CH₄) release from wetlands is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions. Gas exchange occurs mainly through the aerenchyma of plants, and production of greenhouse gases is heavily dependent on rhizosphere biogeochemical conditions (i.e. substrate availability and redox potential). It is hypothesized that by introducing a biocatalyzed anode electrode in the rhizosphere of wetland plants, a competition for carbon and electrons can be invoked between electrical current-generating bacteria and methanogenic Archaea. The anode electrode is part of a bioelectrochemical system (BES) capable of harvesting electrical current from microbial metabolism. In this work, the anode of a BES was introduced in the rhizosphere of rice plants (Oryza sativa), and the impact on methane emissions was monitored. Microbial current generation was able to outcompete methanogenic processes when the bulk matrix contained low concentrations of organic carbon, provided that the electrical circuit with the effective electroactive microorganisms was in place. When interrupting the electrical circuit or supplying an excess of organic carbon, methanogenic metabolism was able to outcompete current generating metabolism. The qPCR results showed hydrogenotrophic methanogens were the most abundant methanogenic group present, while mixotrophic or acetoclastic methanogens were hardly detected in the bulk rhizosphere or on the electrodes. Competition for electron donor and acceptor were likely the main drivers to lower methane emissions. Overall, electrical current generation with BESs is an interesting option to control CH₄ emissions from wetlands but needs to be applied in combination with other mitigation strategies to be successful and feasible in practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aOryza sativa 3acarbon 3aelectric current 3aelectrodes 3aelectronic circuits 3aelectrons 3afuels 3agas exchange 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aharvesting 3ametabolism 3amethane 3amethanogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aredox potential 3arhizosphere 3arice 3awetland plants 3awetlands 2aArchaeaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBacteriaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBioelectric Energy Sources 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aElectricity 2aElectrodesxmicrobiology 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aMethanexmetabolism 2aOryzaxmicrobiology. 2aRhizosphere1 aSpeeckaert, Jonas1 aBlondeel, Evelyne1 aDe Vrieze, Jo1 aBoeckx, Pascal1 aVerstraete, Willy1 aRabaey, Korneel1 aBoon, Nico0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Apr., v. 98, no. 7 p.3205-3217dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-5328-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001800150245004800168300001600216520150900232592002801741650002201769650002201791650001501813651001801828653001701846653002101863653003001884653001401914653001801928653002301946700002101969700001701990700002102007700001502028773010302043852000902146856008702155655001202242IND2204853520220402000000.0220402e19990101quc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220485352DNAL7 a10.1080/11956860.1999.116825352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaeem, Shahid10aPlant neighborhood diversity and production  ap. 355-365.  aWe examined the role of species and functional-group diversity in the performance of model plant assemblages at the level of the plant neighborhood (a central, focal, or “target” plant and its neighbors). Three hundred and sixty plant neighborhoods were constructed with one to four species (drawn from a pool of six) and one to three functional groups. Our assemblages were modeled after prairie grassland communities typical of the Midwestern regions of North America. The three functional groups were legumes (Vicia villosa and Astragalus canadensis), grasses (Panicum virgatum and Bouteloua gracilis), and non-leguminous forbs (Rudbeckia hirta and Achillea millefolium) known to co-occur in nature and common to Cedar Creek Natural History Area, Anoka County, Minnesota. We measured total above- and belowground biomass, soil moisture, canopy cover, CO₂ photosynthetic drawdown, and rate of decomposition. Performance of neighborhoods, as measured by these six variables, showed significant associations with both species and functional-group richness, with greatest magnitude of response variables occurring when both species and functional-group richness were high. Specifically, all variables except decomposition showed significant associations with both species and functional-group richness. We suggest that spatially well-mixed, functionally diverse, and species-rich grassland assemblages may outproduce aggregated, depauperate (poor in either functional groups or species) assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant communities 3aspecies diversity 3agrasslands 3aNorth America 0aBiodiversity 0aSpecies richness 0aFunctional-group richness 0aCommunity 0aPlant ecology 0aPlant neighborhood1 aTjossem, Sara F.1 aByers, Diane1 aBristow, Charles1 aLi, Shibin0 tÉcoscience.g1999 Jan. 1, v. 6, no. 3 p.355-365dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.1999.116825353Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02320naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245015200174300001600326520102900342592002801371650001401399650001301413650001201426650001301438650001701451650001201468650001401480650001101494650001301505650001901518650001101537650001601548651001601564651001001580651001401590700002601604700001801630700003001648700002401678773008201702856008101784852000901865655001201874IND60631658320221119045531.0190312s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063165832DNAL7 a10.1163/15685403-000038492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe los Ríos, Patricio10aMonthly variations in crustacean zooplankton abundances in Sundarapandian Pattinam and Manamelkudi in the Palk Strait, India (9-10°N, Arabian Sea)  ap. 295-306.  aThe present investigation has been made to study the distribution of crustacean zooplankton, and its qualitative and quantitative composition, as well as for making an assessment of species abundances and of the evenness of zooplankton in two habitats along the Palk Strait, between the east coast of Tamil Nadu (India) and Sri Lanka. The sampling programme was executed from July 2005 to June 2006. The two sampling sites, Sundarapandian Pattinam (Station I) and Manamelkudi (Station II), respectively, are located in one of the most productive marine zones of the world. The various groups of crustacean zooplankton were Ostracoda, Copepoda, Amphipoda, Isopoda, Cumacea, Euphausiacea, and Decapoda. Maximum occurrences were observed during the summer and the pre-monsoon seasons, and minimum occurrences were observed during the monsoon months. The present study showed that the distribution pattern of total zooplankton fluctuated at both stations. Station II is richer in absolute abundance in comparison with Station I.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aCopepoda 3aCumacea 3aDecapoda 3aEuphausiacea 3aIsopoda 3aOstracoda 3acoasts 3ahabitats 3amonsoon season 3asummer 3azooplankton 3aArabian Sea 3aIndia 3aSri Lanka1 aKalaiarasi, Mariadoss1 aPaul, Packiam1 aLathasumathi, Chelladurai1 aStella, Chelladurai0 tCrustaceana.g, v. 92, no. 3 p.295-306dBrillwJournal:21399x0011-216X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685403-000038493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010800166300001600274520079200290592002801082650002301110650001401133650002001147650002401167650001901191650003701210650001201247650002001259650003701279650001101316650001301327653001001340653000801350653002301358653001701381653000901398653000801407653000801415653000901423653000801432653000801440653000801448653000901456653000701465653000801472700002001480700002001500773014501520856008301665852000901748655001201757IND60593286720221116153615.0201125e20180523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059328672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamaoka, Yuho10aTyrosine kinase activity of EphA2 promotes its S897 phosphorylation and glioblastoma cell proliferation  ap. 920-926.  aEphA2, a member of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases, has been reported to promote tumor malignancy through phosphorylation of serine 897 (S897). Here, we found that overexpression of wild-type EphA2 induced S897 phosphorylation through ERK activation without growth factors or cytokines and promoted glioblastoma cell proliferation. However, overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of EphA2 failed to induce ERK activation, S897 phosphorylation, and promotion of glioblastoma cell proliferation. These data suggest that when overexpressed, EphA2 induces ERK activation through its tyrosine kinase activity, leading to S897 phosphorylation and promotion of glioblastoma cell proliferation. Our findings provide a new insight into how EphA2 mediates glioblastoma progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell proliferation 3acytokines 3aenzyme activity 3agene overexpression 3agrowth factors 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutants 3aphosphorylation 3areceptor protein-tyrosine kinase 3aserine 3atyrosine 0aEphA2 0aERK 0aCell proliferation 0aGlioblastoma 0aBrdU 0aEGF 0aICD 0aPI3K 0aPKA 0aRSK 0aRTK 0aS897 0aWT 0aTKI1 aNegishi, Manabu1 aKatoh, Hironori0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 May 23, v. 499, no. 4 p.920-926dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02113naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245016200164300001800326500001400344520066100358592002801019650002101047650001301068650001801081650002501099650001701124650001501141650002101156650001301177650003001190650001301220650001201233653001901245653003301264653003101297653001601328653001201344700002001356700002301376773018401399856007501583852000901658655001201667IND60691886520221121045750.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069188652DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.12022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTAKENAKA, Yasuyuki10aIntroduction of a Low Molecular Weight Agonist Peptide for Complement C3a Receptor into Soybean Proglycinin A₁ₐB₁b Subunit by Site-directed Mutagenesis  ap. 1202-1205.  aNAL-light  aLPLPR, a complement C3a agonist peptide, with hypocholesterolemic activity was introduced into the homologous site of soybean proglycinin A₁ₐB₁b subunit by site-directed mutagenesis.

Both compounds showed aggregation-induced emission behaviors and bright red emission in neat films. Benefited from the rigid and large planar conjugated structure of TAT and DBPZ, TAT–DBPZ and TAT–FDBPZ realized high photoluminescence quantum yields in solid states. Meanwhile, the large steric hindrance between TAT and DBPZ segments produced small singlet–triplet energy splitting (ΔEST), leading to short delayed fluorescence lifetimes and high reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rate (>10⁶ s–¹) for both compounds. The solution-processable doped organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on TAT–DBPZ achieved a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.4% with a red emission peak at 604 nm, which was one of the highly efficient solution-processable red TADF OLEDs. TAT–FDBPZ-based doped devices also showed a red emission peak at 611 nm with a maximum EQE of 9.2% and low-efficiency roll-off ratios of 1.0% at 100 cd m–² and 19% at 1000 cd m–². Furthermore, their solution-processable nondoped devices displayed EQEs of 5.6 and 2.9% with the red-shifted emission peaks at 626 and 641 nm, respectively. These results indicate the huge potential of utilization of TAT as the donor unit to achieve highly efficient and low-efficiency roll-off solution-processable red TADF OLEDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3alight emitting diodes 3aphotoluminescence 0aorganic light-emitting diodes 0athermally activated delayed fluorescence 0atriazatruxene 0ared OLEDs 0asolution processing1 aChen, Yonghong1 aLi, Hua1 aWang, Shuai1 aWu, Xiaofu1 aTong, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7734-95321 aWang, Lixiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4676-19270 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 June 15, v. 12, no. 27 p.30652-30658dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c079063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01618naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100002100163245005400184300001400238500000900252520061000261592002800871650002100899650001000920650001200930650001300942650001300955650001200968650001100980650002100991650001201012700001901024773011801043856009801161852000901259655001201268IND60665375020221119140703.0191122e196901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066537502DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1969.0011183X000900010025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Ronald H.10aEffect of Boron on White Clover Nectar Production  ap. 75-76.  aepub  aThe nectar total sugar concentration of white clover flowers was increased by addition of 0.2 and 0.5 ppm boron and was inversely related to the quantity of nectar produced.

New understandings about this disease are urgently required to guide clinical therapies. In this study, we focused on the effects of the small molecule PMN on CRC cells. PMN dose-dependently inhibited CRC cell proliferation through inducing mitotic arrest and apoptosis. PMN induced mitotic arrest via the disruption of spindle apparatus by inhibiting microtubule polymerization. PMN-induced mitotic arrest resulted in apoptosis and p53 upregulation. Furthermore, p53 upregulation sensitized PMN-induced mitotic cells to apoptosis. This study deepens the understanding of the effects of p53 on the response of CRC cells to PMN, providing the basis for the potential development of PMN as a lead compound of microtubule-destabilizers for p53-positive CRC treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3acolorectal neoplasms 3amicrotubules 3amitosis 3aneoplasm cells 3apolymerization 3atubulin 0aPMN 0aColorectal cancer 0aMitotic arrest 0aMicrotubule 0aApoptosis 0ap531 aShen, Yuemao0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 May 23, v. 499, no. 4 p.927-933dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002000150245012400170300001600294520215700310592002802467650001302495650001302508650001802521650001102539651001402550653001202564653001602576653001402592653002302606653002302629653001702652653001302669653002002682653001302702700002802715773010302743852000902846856008702855655001202942IND2204855520220402000000.0220402e19990101quc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220485552DNAL7 a10.1080/11956860.1999.116825362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrace, James B.14aThe effects of landscape position on plant species density: Evidence of past environmental effects in a coastal wetland  ap. 381-391.  aHere we propose that an important cause of variation in species density may be prior environmental conditions that continue to influence current patterns. In this paper we investigated the degree to which species density varies with location within the landscape, independent of contemporaneous environmental conditions. The area studied was a coastal marsh landscape subject to periodic storm events. To evaluate the impact of historical effects, it was assumed that the landscape position of a plot relative to the river’s mouth (“distance from sea”) and to the edge of a stream channel (“distance from shore”) would correlate with the impact of prior storm events, an assumption supported by previous studies. To evaluate the importance of spatial location on species density, data were collected from five sites located at increasing distances from the river’s mouth along the Middle Pearl River in Louisiana. At each site, plots were established systematically along transects perpendicular to the shoreline. For each of the 175 plots, we measured elevation, soil salinity, percent of plot recently disturbed, percent of sunlight captured by the plant canopy (as a measure of plant abundance), and plant species density. Structural equation analysis ascertained the degree to which landscape position variables explained variation in species density that could not be explained by current environmental indicators. Without considering landscape variables, 54% of the variation in species density could be explained by the effects of salinity, flooding, and plant abundance. When landscape variables were included, distance from shore was unimportant but distance from sea explained an additional 12% of the variance in species density (R² of final model = 66%). Based on these results it appears that at least some of the otherwise unexplained variation in species density can be attributed to landscape position, and presumably previous storm events. We suggest that future studies may gain additional insight into the factors controlling current patterns of species density by examining the effects of position within the landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3awetlands 3asalinity 3aplant density 3acoasts 3aLouisiana 0aCoastal 0aDisturbance 0aDiversity 0aHistorical effects 0aLandscape position 0aProductivity 0aSalinity 0aSpecies density 0aWetlands1 aGuntenspergen, Glenn R.0 tÉcoscience.g1999 Jan. 1, v. 6, no. 3 p.381-391dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.1999.116825363Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03439naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245007500199300001600274500002000290520198800310592002802298596001202326596002802338596004502366650002502411650001102436650001102447650001202458650002002470650002302490650001302513650001402526650001202540650001302552650001402565650000902579650001102588650001602599650001102615700001702626700002402643700001802667700006302685773011502748856007302863852000902936655001202945IND60696733620221119021444.0200529e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069673362DNAL7 a10.1111/aec.128752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaniell, Tara L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1487-407810aTranslocation for conservation: Neonates are less suitable than adults  ap. 468-477.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAnimal behaviour can affect the outcome of conservation translocations. It is important to understand the behaviour of the species being considered for translocation and how its behaviour varies over life stages. There may be uncertainty about what life stages are best as founders for release back into wild populations. A technique called head‐starting whereby juvenile life stages are raised in captivity and then released is one potential pre‐release strategy. However, juveniles of many species have a dispersive role in the life cycle, potentially raising difficulties for establishing new populations due to dispersal from the intended habitat following release. For this study, we compared aspects of the behaviour of captive adult and neonate pygmy bluetongue lizards (Tiliqua adelaidensis) – an endangered species for which translocation is likely to be an important management strategy – to determine if neonate behavioural characteristics are appropriate for their translocation. We filmed adult and neonate pygmy bluetongue lizards and compared their behaviour. We also filmed adults over an activity season to compare seasonal behaviour. Behavioural parameters measured included basking time, burrow exits, burrows occupied and walking the perimeter wall. Neonates basked significantly more than adults in summer and autumn. Neonates are likely to be basking more than adults because they are in a stage of rapid growth and need to gain body mass before the winter inactivity period. Neonates exited burrows more often than adults and used a greater number of burrows. These results indicate neonate lizards are actively exploring their habitat. Neonates are unlikely to be as suitable for translocation as they are actively moving about and more likely to be predated upon or disperse from the translocation site. Our finding can be applied to other species that have active juvenile life stages and are at particular risk of predation due to their small size.  aPublisher supplied data  cZoos SA  cNature Foundation of SA  aLP120100426cAustralian Research Council 3aTiliqua adelaidensis 3aadults 3aautumn 3aburrows 3acaptive animals 3aendangered species 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3alizards 3aneonates 3apredation 3arisk 3asummer 3auncertainty 3awinter1 aBaring, Ryan1 aHutchinson, Mark N.1 aAinsley, Phil1 aGardner, Michael G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8629-354X0 tAustral ecology.g2020 June, v. 45, no. 4 p.468-477dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59958x1442-99857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.128753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003000154245009400184300001600278520164000294592002801934650001801962650001501980650001201995650001102007650001502018650001402033650002202047650001002069653000902079653002902088653001002117653001802127653001802145653001802163700001702181700002402198700001902222773013402241856008902375852000902464655001202473IND60781142620221118085320.0220623e20220614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078114262DNAL7 a10.1600/036364422X165125648015602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMortimer, Sebastian M. E.10aSynthesizing Existing Phylogenetic Data to Advance Phylogenetic Research in Orobanchaceae  ap. 533-544.  aTo date, no comprehensive phylogenetic analyses have been conducted in Orobanchaceae that include both a wide sampling of genera and a large sampling of species. In addition, a lack of fossil evidence in the clade precludes the use of primary fossil calibrations for divergence time estimation, preventing the establishment of a comprehensive temporal framework for use in macroevolutionary studies. Here, we use a recently developed set of tools for synthesizing publicly available data, apply these to reconstruct a comprehensive timetree for Orobanchaceae, and then investigate diversification dynamics in this clade of mostly parasitic plants using two model based methods. The assembled supermatrix included more than 900 species, representing approximately 40% of the known species diversity of the family, and the resulting phylogeny largely confirmed relationships revealed in earlier studies; however, we identified ten non-monophyletic genera that will require focused systematic attention to resolve. Diversification rate analyses found substantial support for character-dependent diversification, with elevated rates in hemiparasitic clades, and evidence for a number of speciation rate changes throughout the tree that are likely linked to other traits. Importantly, our multi-state HiSSE (Hidden State Speciation and Extinction) analysis revealed that transitions to a parasitic lifestyle only occur when there is a prior transition in an unobserved precursor state. For Orobanchaceae, our study provides a new comprehensive framework for the clade that can serve as a stepping-stone for future macroevolutionary studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrobanchaceae 3aextinction 3afossils 3amodels 3aparasitism 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 0aBAMM 0adiversification dynamics 0aHiSSE 0aholoparasitic 0ahemiparasitic 0amegaphylogeny1 aBoyko, James1 aBeaulieu, Jeremy M.1 aTank, David C.0 tSystematic botany.g2022 June 14, v. 47, no. 2 p.533-544dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364422X165125648015603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01524naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245012100163300001800284500001900302520037600321592002800697650002500725650001800750650001400768650001600782650001600798650001600814653001500830700002300845700001900868700001900887773018400906856007501090852000901165655001201174IND60691886720221121045753.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069188672DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.12112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYOSHIDA, Hiroyuki10aGlycitein Effect on Suppressing the Proliferation and Stimulating the Differentiation of Osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 Cells  ap. 1211-1213.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGlycitein, as one of the three major isoflavones in soybeans, directly but significantly (about 50%) suppressed the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 and stimulated bone-related protein (alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OC)) expression.

In this study we performed extensive field measurements for the quantification of the emission factors from different types of road in the city of Paris, and investigated the causes of their variability and the contributions to the ambient air PM10 observed across one year at one traffic monitoring site in the ring road of Paris. Results show agreement between lower road dust loadings (RD10: 0.7–2.2 mg m⁻²) and emission factors (5.4–9.0 mg vehicle⁻¹ km⁻¹) at inner-roads of Paris, compared to the ring road (2.4 mg m⁻² and 17 mg vehicle⁻¹ km⁻¹, respectively), where the two parameters are estimated independently. The higher values in the ring road were likely caused by the poor state of pavement and higher share of heavy duty vehicles. Road wear, brake wear and a carbonaceous source, were almost equally responsible for 96% of RD10. At the traffic monitoring site located at the ring road (220,000 vehicle/day), the contributions of road dust emissions were estimated by receptor modeling to be 13% of PM10 on an annual mean (6.3 μg m⁻³), while the sum of vehicle exhaust and wear accounted for 47% resulting in a total traffic contribution of 60% of PM10. Road salting resulted to be a minor contributor (1% of annual mean) also in winter time (2%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3adust 3adust emissions 3aemissions factor 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aparticulates 3apavements 3aroads 3asalting 3atraffic 3awinter 0aRoad dust 0aRoad salt 0aWear 0aPMF 0aPM10 apportionment 0aBiomass1 aFavez, O.1 aPandolfi, M.1 aAlastuey, A.1 aQuerol, X.1 aMoukhtar, S.1 aBruge, B.1 aVerlhac, S.1 aOrza, J.A.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7362-18741 aBonnaire, N.1 aLe Priol, T.1 aPetit, J.-F.1 aSciare, J.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 Mar., v. 129 p.114-124dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245011100170300002000281520175200301592002802053650001302081650001302094650001402107650002502121650002602146650002402172650001302196650001302209650002602222650001502248650001102263650001402274650001302288650001702301650002202318653002302340653002602363653002302389653001802412700006202430700006202492700006302554700005902617773014202676856007802818852000902896655001202905IND60701222620221117010826.0200708e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070122262DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c079712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRinehart, Samantha J.10aQuantitative Evaluation of the Hierarchical Porosity in Polyimide Aerogels and Corresponding Solvated Gels  ap. 30457-30465.  aAerogels are promising materials for many aerospace applications, including high-performance antennae and flexible insulation, because of their inherent low density and high surface areas. Polymer aerogels, especially polyimide aerogels, provide excellent mechanical properties beyond traditional silica aerogels while maintaining the required thermal stability. Polyimide aerogel surface area, porosity, and pore volume are important properties; however, these measurements are traditionally conducted on the aerogel after removal of the solvent. Because of this, the impact of synthetic control and solvent presence on the nanoscale to mesoscale structure of polyimide aerogels in functional applications is unclear. In this report, we use small-angle neutron scattering to determine the dry and solvated skeletal strut size and composition of polyimide aerogels to deduce the impact of solvation on the structure of complex aerogel struts. Our results show that the aerogel contains a hierarchical assembly of pores, with pores present both within and between the supporting struts. This translates to a material with solvent in the larger pores, as well as absorbed in the supporting polyimide skeleton. The amount of solvent uptake in the struts varies with the solvent and polyimide properties. The insight from these results provides pathways to determine the correlations between aerogel nano- and mesoscale structural characteristics, fabrication processes, and their performance in functional applications such as polymeric battery separators. These results also broaden the characterization tools of polymeric aerogels that differentiate between dry and solvated nano- and mesoscale structures that exist in common operating conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3aantennae 3abatteries 3ainsulating materials 3amechanical properties 3aneutron diffraction 3apolymers 3aporosity 3aquantitative analysis 3aseparators 3asilica 3asolvation 3asolvents 3asurface area 3athermal stability 0aneutron scattering 0ahierarchical porosity 0apolyimide aerogels 0aionic liquids1 aNguyen, Baochau N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0330-42801 aViggiano, Rocco P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7538-67001 aMeador, Mary Ann B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2513-73721 aDadmun, Mark D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4304-60870 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 June 15, v. 12, no. 27 p.30457-30465dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c079713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245011500171300001600286520141500302592002801717650001101745650002301756650002101779650001501800650001001815650001701825650002801842650001401870650001801884650001201902650001701914650001201931650001201943650001001955650000901965650001801974650001901992650002102011700002302032700002902055700002002084700002302104700001902127700001902146700002502165700002202190700002202212773009902234856008502333852000902418655001202427IND4469648920221121053121.0141111e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446964892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2012.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCryne, Candice N.10aSpray-dried pulse consumption does not affect cardiovascular disease risk or glycemic control in healthy males  ap. 131-139.  aPulses, including beans, chickpeas, lentils and peas, are high in dietary fiber, protein, and folate, and low in fat. Although beneficial effects of pulse consumption related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been reported in previous studies, many of them have focused on single pulse types in hypercholesterolemic adults, thus creating rationale to extend investigation into multiple pulse types in healthy adults. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of chickpeas, lentils and peas on markers of CVD risk and glycemic control in healthy males. Twenty-one healthy adult males participated in a randomized crossover study involving four treatment periods in which they consumed 100g of spray-dried chickpeas, lentils and peas, and a control (50g of dehydrated potato flakes) for 28days each, separated by 28-day washout periods. Fasting blood was collected on days 1 and 29 of each treatment period for analysis of total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein A-I, homocysteine, glucose and insulin. Consumption of chickpea, lentil or pea for 28days did not significantly affect serum lipids, homocysteine or glycemic parameters in a sample of 21 healthy adult males. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of different pulse types on traditional biomarkers of cardiovascular disease as a preventative measure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aapolipoprotein A-I 3aapolipoprotein B 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3ablood lipids 3acardiovascular diseases 3achickpeas 3adietary fiber 3aglucose 3ahomocysteine 3ainsulin 3alentils 3amales 3apeas 3apotato flakes 3arisk reduction 3atriacylglycerols1 aVeenstra, Jesse M.1 aDeschambault, Branden R.1 aBenali, Marzouk1 aMarcotte, Michelle1 aBoye, Joyce I.1 aTosh, Susan M.1 aFarnworth, Edward R.1 aWright, Amanda J.1 aDuncan, Alison M.0 tFood research international.g2012 Aug., v. 48, no. 1 p.131-139dElsevier Ltdx0963-99697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2012.02.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015000172300001600322520178100338592002802119650002002147650002402167650001202191650001102203650002302214650003102237650001002268650001802278650001502296650002202311650001302333650002102346650002902367650001402396650000902410653001902419653001202438653002402450653001002474653001402484700001502498700001802513700001802531700001602549700002102565700002702586700001902613700002002632773010302652856008602755852000902841655001202850IND60535887820221121225548.0190318e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053588782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Chang-Bum10aFunctional characterization of P-glycoprotein in the intertidal copepod Tigriopus japonicus and its potential role in remediating metal pollution  ap. 135-147.  aThe intertidal copepod Tigriopus japonicus has been widely used in aquatic toxicity testing for diverse environmental pollutants including metals. Despite relatively well-characterized in vivo physiological modulations in response to aquatic pollutants, the molecular mechanisms due to toxicity and detoxification are still unclear. To better understand the mechanisms of metal transport and further detoxification, T. japonicus P-glycoprotein (TJ-P-gp) with conserved motifs/domains was cloned and measured for protein activity against the transcript and protein expression profiles in response to metal exposure. Specifically, we characterized the preliminary efflux activity and membrane topology of TJ-P-gp protein that supports a transport function for chemicals. To uncover whether the efflux activity of TJ-P-gp protein would be modulated by metal treatment, copepods were exposed to three metals (Cd, Cu, and Zn), and were observed for both dose- and time-dependency on the efflux activity of TJ-P-gp protein with or without 10μM of P-gp-specific inhibitors verapamil and zosuquidar (LY335979) for 24h over a wide range of metal concentrations. In particular, treatment with zosuquidar induced metal accumulation in the inner body of T. japonicus. In addition, three metals significantly induced the transporting activity of TJ-P-gp in a concentration-dependent manner in both transcript and protein levels within 24h. Together these data indicate that T. japonicus has a conserved P-gp-mediated metal defense system through the induction of transcriptional up-regulation of TJ-P-gp gene and TJ-P-gp protein activity. This finding provides further understanding of the molecular defense mechanisms involved in P-glycoprotein-mediated metal detoxification in copepods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aP-glycoproteins 3aTigriopus japonicus 3acadmium 3acopper 3adefense mechanisms 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alittoral zone 3apollutants 3aprotein synthesis 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3atranscription (genetics) 3averapamil 3azinc 0aP-glycoprotein 0aCopepod 0aTigriopus japonicus 0aMetal 0aPollution1 aKim, Bo-Mi1 aKim, Rae-Kwon1 aPark, Heum Gi1 aLee, Su-Jae1 aShin, Kyung-Hoon1 aLeung, Kenneth Mei Yee1 aRhee, Jae-Sung1 aLee, Jae-seong,0 tAquatic toxicology.g2014 Nov., v. 156 p.135-147dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01653naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002800154245013000182300001600312520045500328592002800783650001400811650001900825650001600844651001100860653002000871653002100891653001200912653001100924653001300935653001300948700002700961700003500988700002401023773013401047856008901181852000901270655001201279IND60781142820221118085324.0220623e20220614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078114282DNAL7 a10.1600/036364422X165125648015882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza Soares, Arthur de10aNovelties in Oocephalus (Hyptidinae, Lamiaceae) from Central Brazil: Two New Species from Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park  ap. 525-532.  aTwo new species of Oocephalus (Ocimeae: Hyptidinae), O. griseus and O. campestris, from the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park (CVNP), in Goiás state, Brazil, are proposed.

The aim of this study was preparing pH-sensitive and plasma stable liposomes in order to enhance the selectivity and antiproliferative effect of Rapamycin. In the present study we used PEG-poly (monomethylitaconate)-CholC6 (PEG-PMMI-CholC6) copolymer and Oleic acid (OA) to induce pH-sensitive property in Rapamycin liposomes. pH-sensitive liposomal formulations bearing copolymer PEG-PMMI-CholC6 and OA were characterized in regard to physicochemical stability, pH-responsiveness and stability in human plasma. The ability of pH-sensitive liposomes in enhancing the cytotoxicity of Rapamycin was evaluated in vitro by using colon cancer cell line (HT-29) and compared with its cytotoxicity on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) line. Both formulations were found to release their contents under mild acidic conditions rapidly. However, unlike OA-based liposomes, the PEG-PMMI-CholC6 bearing liposomes preserved their pH-sensitivity in plasma. Both types of pH-sensitive Rapamycin-loaded liposomes exhibited high physicochemical stability and could deliver antiproliferative agent into HT-29 cells much more efficiently in comparison with conventional liposomes. Conversely, the antiproliferative effect of pH-sensitive liposomes on HUVEC cell line was less than conventional liposomes. This study showed that both OA and PEG-PMMI-CholC6-based vesicles could submit pH-sensitive property, however, only PEG-PMMI-CholC6-based liposomes could preserve pH-sensitive property after incubation in plasma. As a result pH-sensitive PEG-PMMI-CholC6-based liposomal formulation can improve the selectivity, stability and antiproliferative effect of Rapamycin.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acomposite polymers 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aendosomes 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3aneoplasm cells 3aoleic acid 3atissues 0aCopolymer 0apH-sensitive liposome 0aPlasma stability 0aRapamycin 0aCancer1 aArami, Sanam1 aPourmoazzen, Zhaleh1 aKhorrami, Arash0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 115 p.323-330dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2013.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03857naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009700169300001600266520232200282592002802604650002302632650001502655650001002670650002302680650001402703650001202717650001402729650002002743650001202763650001902775650002402794650000902818650001302827650001402840650001302854650001602867653001502883653001202898653002002910653002302930653001002953653002102963700002402984700001903008700001503027700001703042700002703059700001903086773010303105856008603208852000903294655001203303IND60535887920221121221708.0190318e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053588792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagellan, Kit10aBehavioural and physical effects of arsenic exposure in fish are aggravated by aquatic algae  ap. 116-124.  aArsenic contamination has global impacts and freshwaters are major arsenic repositories. Arsenic toxicity depends on numerous interacting factors which makes effects difficult to estimate. The use of aquatic algae is often advocated for bioremediation of arsenic contaminated waters as they absorb arsenate and transform it into arsenite and methylated chemical species. Fish are another key constituent of aquatic ecosystems. Contamination in natural systems is often too low to cause mortality but sufficient to interfere with normal functioning. Alteration of complex, naturally occurring fish behaviours such as foraging and aggression are ecologically relevant indicators of toxicity and ideal for assessing sublethal impacts. We examined the effects of arsenic exposure in the invasive mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, in a laboratory experiment incorporating some of the complexity of natural systems by including the interacting effects of aquatic algae. Our aims were to quantify the effects of arsenic on some complex behaviours and physical parameters in mosquitofish, and to assess whether the detoxifying mechanisms of algae would ameliorate any effects of arsenic exposure. Aggression increased significantly with arsenic whereas operculum movement decreased non-significantly and neither food capture efficiency nor consumption were notably affected. Bioaccumulation increased with arsenic and unexpectedly so did fish biomass. Possibly increased aggression facilitated food resource defence allowing fish to gain weight. The presence of algae aggravated the effects of arsenic exposure. For increase in fish biomass, algae acted antagonistically with arsenic, resulting in a disadvantageous reduction in weight gained. For bioaccumulation the effects were even more severe, as algae operated additively with arsenic to increase arsenic uptake and/or assimilation. Aggression was also highest in the presence of both algae and arsenic. Bioremediation of arsenic contaminated waters using aquatic algae should therefore be carried out with consideration of entire ecosystem effects. We highlight that multidisciplinary, cross-taxon research, particularly integrating behavioural and other effects, is crucial for understanding the impacts of arsenic toxicity and thus restoration of aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGambusia holbrooki 3aaggression 3aalgae 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3abioaccumulation 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3achemical speciation 3afish 3aforaging 3amortality 3atoxicity 3aweight gain 0aAggression 0aArsenic 0aBioaccumulation 0aGambusia holbrooki 0aAlgae 0aNutrient cycling1 aBarral-Fraga, Laura1 aRovira, Marona1 aSrean, Pao1 aUrrea, Gemma1 aGarcía-Berthou, Emili1 aGuasch, Helena0 tAquatic toxicology.g2014 Nov., v. 156 p.116-124dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01976naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011700171300001600288520083200304592002801136650000801164650003401172650002801206650002001234650001701254650001001271650001401281650001801295650001801313650002401331650001201355653001601367653001401383653002301397773008001420856008101500852000901581655001201590IND60631658920221119045347.0190312s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063165892DNAL7 a10.1163/15685411-000032102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubbotin, Sergei A.10aRecombinase polymerase amplification assay for rapid detection of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne enterolobii  ap. 243-251.  aRapid diagnosis tools for detection of root-knot nematodes play an important role in the disease control and eradication programme. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays were developed targeting the IGS rRNA gene of the pacara earpod tree root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne enterolobii. The RPA assays using TwistAmp® Basic and TwistAmp® exo kits allowed detection of M. enterolobii from gall tissues and crude nematode extracts of all stages of target species without a DNA extraction step. The results of real-time RPA assays using a real-time fluorescent detection of a series of crude nematode extracts showed reliable detection with sensitivity of 1/10 of a second-stage juvenile in a RPA reaction tube after 15-20 min. The RPA assay provides affordable, simple, fast and sensitive detection of M. enterolobii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEnterolobium contortisiliquum 3aMeloidogyne enterolobii 3adisease control 3afluorescence 3agenes 3ajuveniles 3arapid methods 3aribosomal RNA 3aroot-knot nematodes 3atissues 0adiagnostics 0aexo probe 0apacara earpod tree0 tNematology.g, v. 21, no. 3 p.243-251dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685411-000032103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245018800207300001800395520136200413592002801775650001501803650003401818650001201852650004801864650001901912650001901931650001001950650001001960650001901970650000901989650002001998650002602018650002702044650001602071650002302087650001502110653004102125653003002166653001502196653004002211700002302251700002202274700002102296700002502317700001702342700006202359700002202421700002102443700001902464773014802483856008202631852000902713655001202722IND60628034720221116195307.0190129e20180219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062803472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.01.1812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkuda, Shinichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2639-537310aCaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of RyR2 plays a crucial role in aberrant Ca2+ release as an arrhythmogenic substrate in cardiac troponin T-related familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  ap. 1250-1256.  aCardiac Troponin T (TnT) mutation-linked familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) is known to cause sudden cardiac death at a young age. Here, we investigated the role of the Ca2+ release channel of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), ryanodine receptor (RyR2), in the pathogenic mechanism of lethal arrhythmia in FHC-related TnT-mutated transgenic mice (TG; TnT-delta160E).In TG cardiomyocytes, the Ca2+ spark frequency (SpF) was much higher than that in non-TG cardiomyocytes. These differences were more pronounced in the presence of isoproterenol (ISO; 10 nM). This increase in SpF was largely reversed by a CaMKII inhibitor (KN-93), but not by a protein kinase A inhibitor (H89). CaMKII phosphorylation at Ser2814 in RyR2 was increased significantly in TG. Spontaneous Ca2+ transients (sCaTs) after cessation of a 1–5 Hz pacing, frequently observed in ISO-treated TG cardiomyocytes, were also attenuated by KN-93, but not by H89. The RyR2 stabilizer dantrolene attenuated Ca2+ sparks and sCaTs in ISO-treated TG cardiomyocytes, indicating that the mutation-linked aberrant Ca2+ release is mediated by destabilized RyR2.In FHC-linked TnT-mutated hearts, RyR2 is susceptible to CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation, presumably because of a mutation-linked increase in diastolic [Ca2+]i, causing aberrant Ca2+ release leading to lethal arrhythmia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarrhythmia 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3acalcium 3acalcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 3acardiomyocytes 3acardiomyopathy 3adeath 3afeces 3aisoproterenols 3amice 3aphosphorylation 3aproteinase inhibitors 3asarcoplasmic reticulum 3astabilizers 3atransgenic animals 3atroponin T 0aFamilial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 0aRyanodine receptor type 2 0aTroponin T 0aCa2+/calmodulin dependent kinase II1 aSufu-Shimizu, Yoko1 aKatō, Takayoshi,1 aFukuda, Masakazu1 aNishimura, Shigehiko1 aOda, Tetsuro1 aKobayashi, Shigeki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5407-29991 aYamamoto, Takeshi1 aMorimoto, Sachio1 aYano, Masafumi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Feb. 19, v. 496, no. 4 p.1250-1256dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.01.1813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03610naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245010000188300001600288520175400304592002802058650002802086650001602114650001602130650001002146650001802156650001402174650001402188650001002202650001102212650002202223650001102245650001702256650001102273650001402284650001602298650001102314650001402325650001602339650001202355650001602367650004102383650001102424650001402435650003202449650003102481650002202512650000902534650001702543650003002560650005602590650001702646650001402663700001402677700001502691700001502706700001902721700001802740773011402758856005502872852000902927655001202936IND4475420120221121033717.0120418e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447542012DNAL7 a223565412pmid7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02474.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMENNERAT, A.10aLife history and virulence are linked in the ectoparasitic salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis  ap. 856-861.  aModels of virulence evolution for horizontally transmitted parasites often assume that transmission rate (the probability that an infected host infects a susceptible host) and virulence (the increase in host mortality due to infection) are positively correlated, because higher rates of production of propagules may cause more damages to the host. However, empirical support for this assumption is scant and limited to microparasites. To fill this gap, we explored the relationships between parasite life history and virulence in the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, a horizontally transmitted copepod ectoparasite on Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. In the laboratory, we infected juvenile salmon hosts with equal doses of infective L. salmonis larvae and monitored parasite age at first reproduction, parasite fecundity, area of damage caused on the skin of the host, and host weight and length gain. We found that earlier onset of parasite reproduction was associated with higher parasite fecundity. Moreover, higher parasite fecundity (a proxy for transmission rate, as infection probability increases with higher numbers of parasite larvae released to the water) was associated with lower host weight gain (correlated with lower survival in juvenile salmon), supporting the presence of a virulence–transmission trade‐off. Our results are relevant in the context of increasing intensive farming, where frequent anti‐parasite drug use and increased host density may have selected for faster production of parasite transmission stages, via earlier reproduction and increased early fecundity. Our study highlights that salmon lice, therefore, are a good model for studying how human activity may affect the evolution of parasite virulence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepeophtheirus salmonis 3aSalmo salar 3acorrelation 3adrugs 3aectoparasites 3aevolution 3afecundity 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aintensive farming 3alarvae 3alife history 3amodels 3amortality 3aprobability 3asalmon 3avirulence 3aweight gain 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aCopepodaxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aFertility 2aFish Diseasesxparasitology 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aMale 2aReproduction 2aSalmo salarxparasitology 2aSkin Diseases, Parasiticxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aTime Factors 2aVirulence1 aHAMRE, L.1 aEbert, D.,1 aNILSEN, F.1 aDÁVIDOVÁ, M.1 aSkorping, A.,0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2012 May, v. 25, no. 5 p.856-861dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02474.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245014800175300001600323520123500339592002801574650000801602650001201610650001501622650001301637650002401650650001001674650003001684650002601714650001401740650001401754650001601768653003501784653002701819653001801846653001101864700002501875700002801900700002601928700002301954773013401977856008902111852000902200655001202209IND60781143020221118085236.0220623e20220614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078114302DNAL7 a10.1600/036364422X165125648016052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTreiber, Erin L.10aMolecular Systematics, Species Concepts, and Myrmecophytism in Cecropia (Cecropieae: Urticaceae): Insights from Restriction-Site Associated DNA  ap. 457-466.  aCecropia is a group of fast-growing pioneer trees that are important in forest regeneration and a common ant-plant mutualism in the Neotropics. To investigate the evolution of mutualism between Cecropia and associated ants, a phylogenetic framework is necessary. Cecropia species are difficult to distinguish morphologically and conventional genetic markers are insufficiently variable to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among species. Our study aimed to compare the phylogenetic utility of restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to prior work based on commonly sequenced gene regions. RAD sequence data resolved and supported species-level relationships better than previous studies. We identified a deeply divergent non-myrmecophytic clade including C. sciadophylla and African Musanga. Results from geographically widespread and morphologically heterogenous C. obtusifolia and C. angustifolia suggest that current synonymy has lumped phylogenetically divergent lineages. Reconstruction of ant associations on the highly supported Cecropia phylogeny inferred equal probability of the ancestor of Cecropia being myrmecophytic or not. More intensive genetic study is needed to refine species concepts in Cecropia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMusanga 3aNeotropics 3aancestry 3aforest regeneration 3agenes 3ageographical distribution 3amolecular systematics 3amutualism 3aphylogeny 3aprobability 0aAncestral state reconstruction 0aant-plant associations 0apioneer trees 0aRADseq1 aZalamea, Paul-Camilo1 aTorres, María Fernanda1 aMadriñán, Santiago,1 aWeiblen, George D.0 tSystematic botany.g2022 June 14, v. 47, no. 2 p.457-466dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364422X165125648016053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01761naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245013500162300001800297500001900315520053600334592002800870650001700898650001800915650001800933650001800951650001100969653002700980653001501007653003801022653002401060700002101084700002601105773018401131856007501315852000901390655001201399IND60691887420221121212139.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069188742DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.12402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAJISAKA, Katsumi10aEfficient Synthesis of O-Linked Glycopeptide by a Transglycosylation Using Endo α-N-Acetylgalactosaminidase from Streptomyces sp.  ap. 1240-1243.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGalβ-(1→3)-GalNAc-linked hexapeptide was synthe-sized by a transglycosylation using Galβ-(1→3)-Gal-NAcβ-pNP as a donor and a serine-containing hexapeptide as an acceptor using endo GalNAc-ase from Streptomyces sp..

Our previous study demonstrated that substance P (SP) preserves β-cell populations in mice with streptozotocin-induced T1D. Here, we demonstrated that chronic systemic treatment with SP restored the mass of β-cells both in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice with T1D or db/db mice with T2D. SP delayed the onset of T1D in NOD mice via immune modulation. SP inhibited immune infiltration into islets and the salivary glands of NOD mice. In db/db mice, SP treatment rescued glucose intolerance. Moreover, SP inhibited apoptosis, as well as the activation of pancreatic stellate cells in pancreatic islets of db/db mice. SP downregulated the number of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expressing cells in db/db pancreatic islets. Cleaved-caspase-3 expression was reduced in islets of SP-treated db/db mice compared to that in the control. Therefore, these results suggested that SP may preserve pancreatic β-cells through immune modulation and protection from the stimulated activation of pancreatic stellate cells and apoptosis in T1D and T2D, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aanimal disease models 3aapoptosis 3aglucose 3aimmunomodulation 3aislets of Langerhans 3amice 3amuscles 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3asalivary glands 3asubstance P 0aSubstance P 0aType 1 diabetes 0aType 2 diabetes 0aPancreatic β-cells1 aJung, Nunggum1 aKim, Dongjin1 aChoi, Sanghyuk1 aLee, Sang-Ho1 aSon, Youngsook1 aPark, Ki-Sook0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 May 23, v. 499, no. 4 p.960-966dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245009200191300001800283520186800301592002802169650002002197650002302217650001602240650002802256650001102284650001102295650001002306650001202316650001502328650001202343650001402355650001502369650001502384650001002399650004202409650001802451650001102469650001102480650001102491650005502502650000902557650001602566650001602582653001602598653001202614653001602626653001502642653002802657653002002685700002402705700001802729700002202747700002002769700002102789700002202810773012102832856008102953852000903034655001203043IND4462655420221116145719.0160325e20111128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446265542DNAL7 a217367902pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145110020542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaljaars, P.

Animal data suggest that the length of the small intestine exposed to fat is also relevant. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether increasing the areas of intestinal fat exposure and the way it is exposed would affect satiety parameters and food intake. In the present single-blind, randomised, cross-over study, fifteen volunteers, each intubated with a naso-ileal tube, received four treatments on consecutive days. The oral control (control treatment) was a liquid meal (LM) containing 6 g fat ingested at t = 0 min, with saline infusion at t = 30–120 min. Experimental treatments were a fat-free LM at t = 0 min, with either 6 g oil delivered sequentially (2 g duodenal, t = 30–60 min; 2 g jejunal, t = 60–90 min; 2 g ileal, t = 90–120 min), simultaneously (2 g each to all sites, t = 30–120 min) or ileal only (6 g ileal, t = 30–120 min). Satiety parameters (hunger and fullness) and cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY) secretion were measured until t = 180 min, when ad libitum food intake was assessed. Only the ileum treatment reduced food intake significantly over the control treatment. The ileum and simultaneous treatments significantly reduced hunger compared with the control treatment. Compared with control, no differences were observed for PYY, CCK and GLP-1 with regard to 180 min integrated secretion. Ileal fat infusion had the most pronounced effect on food intake and satiety. Increasing the areas of intestinal fat exposure only affected hunger when fat was delivered simultaneously, not sequentially, to the exposed areas. These results demonstrate that ileal brake activation offers an interesting target for the regulation of ingestive behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholecystokinin 3across-over studies 3afood intake 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3ahumans 3ahunger 3aileum 3ajejunum 3apeptide YY 3asatiety 3asecretion 3avolunteers 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHunger 2aIntestine, Smallxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aYoung Adult 0aIleal brake 0aSatiety 0aFood intake 0aPeptide YY 0aGlucagon-like peptide-1 0aCholecystokinin1 aPeters, Harry P.

A clear understanding of the colonization process of the human neonatal gut in developing countries is lacking because the few available studies were mostly performed using culture techniques. Using molecular approaches, this study analyzed the fecal microbiota of children of low socioeconomic status in São Paulo, Brazil, during their first year of life. We collected fecal samples of healthy children at 3, 6, and 12 months of life. Total DNA was extracted directly from feces, and the bacteria-specific primers 27F-1492R were used to construct 16S rRNA libraries. Clones were randomly selected and partially sequenced. The main phylogenetic groups identified at 3 months were Streptococcus, unidentified bacteria, and Escherichia. At 6 months, Escherichia remained predominant, while the unidentified bacterial population increased significantly. At 12 months, a more complex composition of fecal microbiota was observed, represented by unidentified bacteria and microorganisms found at low rates at earlier ages. The genus Escherichia remained the most abundant microorganism (34 % relative abundance and 75 % prevalence). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed changes in the composition of the microbiota at 6 months and an increase of diversity at 12 months of life. Bifidobacterium was identified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and showed a high incidence in the microbiota at 3 months. The present results corroborate the global observation of inter-individual variability with an early establishment of microbial complexity at the end of the first year of life and highlight the presence of the Escherichia as abundant in microbiota composition of this group of children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium 3aDNA 3aEscherichia 3aStreptococcus 3abacteria 3achildren 3aclones 3adeveloping countries 3afeces composition 3agastrointestinal system 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asocioeconomic status 2aBifidobacteriumxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aBrazil 0aBrazil1 aOliveira, Fernanda F.1 aDuarte, Rubens T.

This study was conducted in an effort to better understand the effects of these two plant growth regulators (PGRs) on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) flowering when applied alone or used in sequential applications. Field experiments conducted in 1996 and 1997 at the Texas A&M University Agricultural Experiment Station near College Station, TX, contained the following treatments: an untreated control, MC, PGR-IV, and a combination of both MC and PGR-IV applied sequentially (PGR-IV + MC). The MC and PGR-IV + MC treatments caused plants to have a season-long average of 0.55 and 0.48 more flowers m⁻¹ of row d⁻¹, respectively, than the untreated plants. All PGR treatments resulted in a higher rate of flowering than untreated plants between the 16th and 20th d of flowering. The MC treated plants also had 19.1 more total flowers per meter than PGR-IV treated plants by the 40th d of flowering. Treatment effect on flower survival was different only for flowers that bloomed between the 36th and 40th d of flowering. At this time, the PGR-IV + MC treated plants had a greater flower survival than plants treated with only PGR-IV. All PGR treatments resulted in increased yields and boll numbers. These studies indicate that the application of MC and PGR-IV, either in sequential applications or alone, increases both the rate of flowering and the number of flowers per meter of row, but does not impact the ability of flowers to survive to maturity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aagricultural experiment stations 3achlorides 3acotton 3afield experimentation 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agibberellic acid 3aindole butyric acid 3amepiquat 3aTexas1 aCothren, J.

The production capacity for SGW fibres is however still available in many paper mills, which could be exploited for alternative applications, like for example medium density fibreboards (MDF). Thin SGW MDF of 800 kg/m³ in density, 2 mm in thickness and bonded with polydiphenilmethan-4,4′-diisocyanate (PMDI) or urea–formaldehyde (UF) adhesives were produced with varying resin contents, raw fibres moisture content and hot-pressing parameters. Their mechanical characteristics, dimensional stability and optical properties were investigated and compared to MDF made of coarser Asplund fibres. SGW MDF bonded with PMDI adhesive showed higher internal bonding (IB = 1.5–2.6 N/mm²), lower thickness swelling (TS = 22–24%) and whiter surfaces (distance from white E = 28–30) than Asplund MDF (IB = 1.3, TS = 42%, E = 42). The possible development of covalent links between SGW fibres and PMDI adhesive was indicated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Bending properties of SGW MDF remained however inferior to Asplund MDF. SGW MDF might represent a suitable product for non-load bearing applications requiring low moisture susceptibility and the possibility for surface decoration, for example flooring and furniture elements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadhesives 3abending strength 3adimensional stability 3afloors 3afurniture 3amanufacturing 3amedium density fiberboards 3aoptical properties 3apaper 3apapermaking 3apulp 3apulp and paper mills 3arecycling 3aurea formaldehyde 3awater content1 aThömen, Heiko1 aJunginger, Stefan1 aPichelin, Frédéric0 tEuropean journal of wood and wood products.g2019 Jan., v. 77, no. 1 p.71-77dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl17107x0018-37687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00107-018-1367-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04996naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245016700172300001600339520283900355592002803194650002603222650001603248650000903264650002203273650001103295650002003306650001203326650000903338650002103347650001603368650002003384650001003404650001303414650002703427650001603454650001703470650001503487650001203502650001803514650002203532650002103554650001603575650001403591650001403605650001203619650002403631651001003655653000803665653000803673653001003681653001103691653001103702653000903713653000803722653002603730653001603756653001003772653001203782653002403794653001203818700001303830700001203843700001503855700001503870700001303885700001703898700001603915700001803931700001403949700001703963773009903980856009004079852000904169655001204178IND60532387120221121042932.0190318e20151101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053238712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Fangjun10aMolecular cloning of a proglucagon in a cyprinid fish (Schizothorax prenanti): mRNA tissue distribution and quantification during periprandial changes and fasting  ap. 250-255.  aProglucagon is the precursor for several peptides: glucagon, glicentin, oxyntomodulin and at least one glucagon-like peptide. Previous reports indicated that proglucagon-derived peptides are important in regulating feeding and energy homeostasis in both mammals and fish. In the present study, a 504bp cDNA fragment encoding a highly conserved proglucagon in a cyprinid fish (Schizothorax prenanti) was amplified by homologous cloning. Tissue expression profiles of proglucagon showed that S. prenanti proglucagon had a broad tissue distribution, but was expressed primarily in the intestine and brain. Proglucagon mRNA levels significantly increased after feeding in the hypothalamus and intestine, while levels were dramatically reduced during a week of food deprivation and increased upon refeeding. Proglucagon mRNA expression changes in the hypothalamus and intestine responded to the altered feeding status and suggest that proglucagon is involved in the regulation of feeding and energy in S. prenanti.In the present study, we deal with the molecular, distribution expressions and mRNA quantification during periprandial, fasting and refeeding in lower vertebrate Ya-fish (S. prenanti). S. prenanti is an endemic cold temperate fish in the southwest of China valuable in both aquaculture and research. However, slow growth rate has been recognized as a major problem in S. prenanti farming, increasing the final production cost. Studies concerning the expression of genes related to feeding and growth regulation have been conducted for this species in our laboratory. Recently, a growing number of homologues of mammalian appetite-regulating peptides and their receptors have been characterized in fish. Proglucagon is the precursor for several peptides: glucagon, glicentin, oxyntomodulin and at least one glucagon-like peptide. These peptides are derived in a tissue-specific manner via post-translational proteolytic processing. Previous reports in mammals indicated that proglucagon-derived peptides are important in regulating feeding and energy homeostasis. However, there is scarce information about their physiological roles in fish.Here, we cloned a 504bp cDNA fragment of a single proglucagon gene, that is mainly expressed in the intestine and brain and responded to changes of feeding status. These suggest that proglucagon acts as a satiety factor involved in the regulation of food intake in S. prenanti. Our findings of this study provide a basis for future research to better understand the functions and mechanisms of actions of proglucagon and will be helpful in dealing with feeding and growth issues in fishes.We believe that something in this manuscript would be of interest to the journal's readers and hope that this paper is suitable for publication in Aquaculture (Physiology and Endocrinology: Fish).  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchizothorax prenanti 3aaquaculture 3acold 3acomplementary DNA 3aenergy 3afarming systems 3afasting 3afish 3afood deprivation 3afood intake 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucagon 3aglucagon-like peptides 3ahomeostasis 3ahypothalamus 3aintestines 3amammals 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3aproduction costs 3aproteolysis 3areceptors 3arefeeding 3asatiety 3atissue distribution 3aChina 0aCNS 0aGLP 0aPGDPs 0aMS-222 0aRT-PCR 0aqPCR 0aORF 0aSchizothorax prenanti 0aProglucagon 0aGLP-1 0aCloning 0aTissue distribution 0aFasting1 aChen, Hu1 aLiu, Ju1 aGao, Yundi1 aZhang, Xin1 aHao, Jin1 aChen, Defang1 aWu, Hongwei1 aYuan, Dengyue1 aWang, Tao1 aLi, Zhiqiong0 tAquaculture.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 448 p.250-255dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245009400214300001600308520074800324592002801072650002101100650002801121650001501149650002301164650001101187650001201198650002901210650002501239650002501264653002101289653002401310653001701334653002601351700002801377700006701405700002901472700002301501700002301524773014501547856008301692852000901775655001201784IND60593287420221116153606.0201125e20180523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059328742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMokhonov, Vladislav V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8542-572310aSlyD-deficient Escherichia coli strains: A highway to contaminant-free protein extraction  ap. 967-972.  aBinding of native bacterial protein SlyD to metal affinity matrices remains a major problem in affinity purification of His-tagged recombinant proteins from Escherichia coli cells. In this study, four novel E. coli strains that lack the expression of SlyD/SlyX, were engineered using λ-red mediated chromosomal deletion. The resultant mutant E. coli strains allow us to obtain SlyD-free proteins immediately after metal affinity chromatography, and eliminate additional purification processes. As a model protein, bispecific antibodies composed of anti-F4/80 VHH module and anti-TNF VHH module (MYSTI-2) were used.

In this study, we quantified the compatibility among Magnolia stellata, M. salicifolia, and their hybrids in a hybrid zone using gene dispersal modeling. METHODS: After determining the genealogical classes of adult trees in the hybrid zone, the paternity of 574 open‐pollinated seeds from 37 known maternal trees was analyzed with microsatellite markers. A neighborhood‐based Bayesian gene dispersal model developed by us for estimating compatibility was then applied to the paternity data. KEY RESULTS: When M. stellata or M. salicifolia were mothers, interspecific mating to produce F₁ hybrids yielded significant incompatibility, but backcrossing with F₁ hybrids did not. Furthermore, when F₁ hybrids became mothers, no significant incompatibility resulted from backcrossing to parental species or intra‐F₁ mating to produce F₂ hybrids. The estimated proportion of F₁ hybrids in the outcrossed seeds (1.7%) in the hybrid zone was much lower than that in the adult trees (14.0%). CONCLUSIONS: While it is difficult to obtain F₁ hybrids, their low incompatibility makes it easy to produce advanced generation hybrids, once they have been successfully obtained. Although the production of F₁ seeds is rare, heterosis and/or weak selection pressure in an empty niche between the parental species’ niches may have contributed to the increased proportion of adult F₁ hybrids in the hybrid zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMagnolia stellata 3aadults 3abackcrossing 3agene flow 3agenes 3aheterosis 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3aopen pollination 3apaternity 3aselection pressure1 aTani, Saori1 aSetsuko, Suzuki1 aUeno, Saneyoshi1 aWadasaki, Naotaka1 aTomaru, Nobuhiro0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2017 Oct., v. 104, no. 10 p.1546-1555dBotanical Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44651x0002-91227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.17001383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009200161300002000253520127900273592002801552650001901580650001501599650002501614650002201639650003101661650000901692650000901701650001301710650001401723650002201737650002301759653003101782653002201813653002901835653001801864653003101882700005301913700001701966700005701983700002102040700001502061700005602076700001502132700001702147700005802164773014202222856007802364852000902442655001202451IND60701223120221117011556.0200708e20200617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070122312DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c083522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Tingting10aEfficient Gold Recovery from E-Waste via a Chelate-Containing Porous Aromatic Framework  ap. 30474-30482.  aExtracting gold from wastes of electronic equipment (e-waste) is a sustainable strategy for the recovery of the precious metal, reducing environmental pollution, and addressing the growing demands for gold resources. In this work, we synthesized a thiourea-modified porous aromatic framework (PAF-1-thiourea) with exceptional gold-extraction ability. The optimum adsorption capacity for PAF-1-thiourea to gold reaches up to 2629.87 mg g–¹. The adsorption process can be well fitted according to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir model, featuring strong affinity caused by strong soft–soft interactions between Au(III) and the S and N donor atoms of the modified PAF and the electrostatic interactions between protonated amino groups and AuCl₄–. PAF-1-thiourea was especially capable of extracting gold rapidly and efficiently (capturing 98.73% of gold within 5 min) from a central processing unit (CPU) in extremely acidic conditions. It is found that PAF-1-thiourea captures gold ions and simultaneously converts it to a Au(0) solid, obtaining gold with purity up to 23.5 karat. PAF-1-thiourea with its high acid resistance and anti-interference against cheap metals in the recovery process presents a practical means to extract gold from e-waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid tolerance 3aadsorption 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectronic wastes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agold 3aions 3akinetics 3apollution 3apollution control 3asorption isotherms 0aporous aromatic frameworks 0apost-modification 0asoft−soft interactions 0agold recovery 0aelectronic equipment waste1 aZhao, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2909-85611 aLi, Zhangnan1 aJing, Xiaofei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2289-83551 aFaheem, Muhammad1 aSong, Jian1 aTian, Yuyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-25351 aLv, Xijuan1 aShu, Qinghai1 aZhu, Guangshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5794-38220 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 June 17, v. 12, no. 27 p.30474-30482dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c083523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003200155245007100187500002200258500002200280520135700302592002801659650002201687650001801709650001901727650002301746650002001769650001301789650001201802650002301814650002001837650001901857650001201876650001501888650001101903650000901914650000901923650001101932651001201943651003701955651001001992651001502002651000902017653002002026653000902046653001002055653001002065653001702075653001202092700002502104700002202129700002702151700002402178700002602202700002402228700002202252773007602274856008902350852000902439655001202448IND60610300820221117080821.0180828s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061030082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.07.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahelinirina, Soanandrasana10aRisk of maritime introduction of plague from Madagascar to Mayotte  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aPlague is a rodent-borne disease caused by Yersinia pestis. Most human infections are bubonic plague, as a result of being bitten by infected rodent fleas. Madagascar, Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru are the three most affected countries. Plague was introduced into eastern Madagascar in 1898 by boat from India. It is estimated that the risk of introduction of plague from Madagascar to neighboring islands is very high due to the maritime links.We conducted a study of plague reservoirs and vectors in Longoni Port in Mayotte and Mahajanga Port in Madagascar during two seasons to highlight a non-negligible risk of introduction of Y. pestis to Mayotte. The results showed that two main reservoirs of plague in Madagascar Suncus murinus and Rattus rattus and the main flea vector Xenopsylla cheopis exists in and surrounding the port of Longoni. Y. pestis was isolated from Rattus norvegicus captured close to the port of Mahajanga during this study.Plague bacteria circulate within populations of rodent without causing rodent die-off in Mahajanga. The risk of introduction of plague from Madagascar to Mayotte exists due to the regular exchanges. Continuous surveillance of rat, shrew and flea populations is therefore necessary in all the surrounding countries that have regular exchanges with Madagascar to prevent the spread of the plague.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRattus norvegicus 3aRattus rattus 3aSuncus murinus 3aXenopsylla cheopis 3aYersinia pestis 3abacteria 3adie-off 3adisease reservoirs 3adisease vectors 3ahuman diseases 3aislands 3amonitoring 3aplague 3arats 3arisk 3ashrews 3aComoros 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo 3aIndia 3aMadagascar 3aPeru 0aYersinia pestis 0arats 0ashrew 0afleas 0aIndian Ocean 0aseaport1 aHarimalala, Mireille1 aMargueron, Thomas1 aRamihangihajason, Tojo1 aMansotte, François1 aRajerison, Minoarisoa1 aPagès, Frédéric,1 aBoyer, Sébastien0 tActa tropica.g2018, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.07.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007500172300001600247520071800263592002800981650004401009650002201053650001601075650001801091650004401109650001501153650001601168653002601184653004301210653001701253653001901270653001601289700001901305700001901324773010801343856008601451852000901537655001201546IND60626479120221122195904.0210112e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062647912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.12.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWürfel, Hendryk10aNon-aqueous solvent for efficient dissolution of polygalacturonic acid  ap. 791-795.  aThe ionic liquid 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) was found to be a non-aqueous solvent for the fast and efficient dissolution of polygalacturonic acid.

We established a 7-day enclosure experiment in situ to simulate the effects of the Zhikong scallop on the microbial food web in the bay. The results showed that scallop cultivation increased the concentration of PO43− (from 0.04μM at the initial to 0.26μM at the end of the enclosure experiment) and the abundance of picoplankton (heterotrophic bacteria, Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes), total nanoflagellates and ciliates. Following the enclosure experiment, the 6-day P-enrichment (~0.3μM) and 3-hour feeding experiments were conducted in field to study why scallop cultivation strengthened the microbial food web. The results showed that P-enrichment stimulated the growth of major microbial components when their predators were removed or suffered grazing pressure. The scallops did not efficiently retain picoplankton. The retention efficiency of the Zhikong scallop dropped with decreasing prey size, and the retention efficiencies for ciliates, 5–10μm nanoflagellates and <5μm nanoflagellates were 83.22%, 63.27% and 22.62%, respectively. It was suggested that P release by scallops may increase the abundance of main assemblages in the microbial food web, but the influence of the nutrient release into natural water may be partially diminished by trophic cascades within the microbial food web. However, the different retention efficiencies of the scallop on the different components of the microbial food web may weaken the strength of trophic cascades.This paper may be helpful for the improvement of the commercial scallop aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzumapecten farreri 3aCiliophora 3aSynechococcus 3abacteria 3afood webs 3agrazing intensity 3amariculture 3amollusc culture 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apredators 3ascallops 3aChina 0aChlamys farreri 0aHeterotrophic bacteria 0aSynechococcus 0aPicoeukaryotes 0aNanoflagellates 0aCiliates 0aMicrobial food web 0aNutrients 0aSanggou Bay1 aHuang, Lingfeng1 aXiao, Tian1 aJiang, Zengjie1 aZhang, Wuchang0 tAquaculture.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 448 p.341-349dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03641naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013500165300001800300520171000318592002802028650001302056650001102069650002602080650001402106650001102120650002402131650002502155650001702180650003502197650001602232650002602248650001602274650004302290650001302333650001602346650001902362650002202381650001302403650001702416650002902433653001102462653002802473653002502501653003402526653002502560700001302585700001802598700001602616700001502632700001602647700001602663700001702679700001702696700001202713700001402725700001302739773014802752856008202900852000902982655001202991IND60628035120221116195138.0190129e20180219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062803512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.01.1882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Liyuan10aPlasma metabolic profile reveals PGF2α protecting against non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes  ap. 1276-1283.  aDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most frequent microvascular complications of diabetes and the leading cause of blindness in adults worldwide. Non-proliferative DR (NPDR) is the first stage of DR but currently has few recommended intervention. Eicosanoids play important roles in maintaining vessel homeostasis. However, the functions of eicosanoids in NPDR are still unknown. In this study, we investigated the eicosanoids profile difference in plasma between type 2 diabetes with NPDR or not. A total of 50 patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited and divided into non-DR (NDR) group and NPDR group based on fundus photographs. The eicosanoids profiles in plasma were determined by LC-MS/MS. Adhesion and transwell assay were used to detect the adhesion and migration effects of metabolites on primary bovine retinal pericyte cells (BRPC), respectively. Streptomycin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model was used to test the protective effects of selected metabolites according to retinal immunofluorescence staining and fluorescence confocal microscopy. Prostaglandin 2α (PGF2α) was decreased significantly in NPDR group compared to NDR group and negatively correlated with NPDR. In vitro, PGF2α was found to accelerate adhesion and migration by activating prostaglandin F receptor (FP receptor) and subsequent increasing RhoA activity in primary bovine retinal pericyte. Administration of PGF2α analogue diminished the damage on retinal capillary in an STZ-induced diabetic mouse model. Our results suggested that PGF2α may be a protective factor in the progression of NPDR in T2D patients. The protective mechanism of PGF2α was to increase pericyte mobility through FP receptor/RhoA pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadults 3aanimal disease models 3ablindness 3acattle 3aconfocal microscopy 3adiabetic retinopathy 3afluorescence 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahomeostasis 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aphotographs 3aprostaglandins 3aprotective effect 3astaining 3astreptomycin 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aPGF2α 0aEicosanoid metabolomics 0aDiabetic retinopathy 0aBovine retinal pericyte cells 0aDiabetic mouse model1 aSun, Bei1 aLiu, Mingming1 aHuang, Jing1 aLiu, Yajin1 aXie, Zipeng1 aHe, Jinlong1 aChen, Liming1 aWang, Daowen1 aZhu, Yi1 aZhang, Xu1 aAi, Ding0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Feb. 19, v. 496, no. 4 p.1276-1283dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.01.1883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245008500165300001600250520105300266592002801319650001201347650001401359650001401373650001801387650001401405650001501419650001701434650001401451650001401465653002301479653002601502653002301528653001301551700001401564700002001578700001601598700001601614700001801630700001701648700005701665773010801722856008601830852000901916655001201925IND60626479220221120132340.0210112e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062647922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.12.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiang10aOil-in-water Pickering emulsions from three plant-derived regenerated celluloses  ap. 755-763.  aRegenerated cellulose (RC) has attracted interest for stabilizing emulsions effectively via both Pickering and networking mechanisms. In this study, RCs were prepared from three plant-derived celluloses (wood pulp, bamboo pulp and cotton fabric). The three RCs had similar morphological networks, but their viscosities were 0.55 Pa s, 1.47 Pa s and 2.29 Pa s, respectively. The properties of Pickering emulsions stabilized by the RCs were investigated. The results revealed that the droplet sizes and viscosities of the three emulsions varied. After seven days of storage, the droplet sizes of the emulsions remained unchanged, but the viscosities of the emulsions from wood pulp, bamboo pulp and cotton fabric increased by 163%, 115% and 9%, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the source of RC plays an important role in determining the properties of the resulting suspensions and emulsions, thereby providing guidelines for the preparation of RC-based green emulsions for applications in cosmetics and related formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abamboos 3acellulose 3acosmetics 3acotton fabric 3aemulsions 3aguidelines 3astorage time 3aviscosity 3awood pulp 0aCellulose resource 0aRegenerated cellulose 0aPickering emulsion 0aRheology1 aDing, Lei1 aZhang, Yunchong1 aWang, Bijia1 aJiang, Yang1 aFeng, Xueling1 aMao, Zhiping1 aSui, Xiaofeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0051-28690 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 207 p.755-763dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01598naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245010400165300001800269500001400287520047100301592002800772650002300800650001800823650002100841650001500862650002200877653002300899653003600922653001400958700002000972773018400992856007501176852000901251655001201260IND60691887920221121212046.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069188792DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.12582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYASOHARA, Yoshihiko10aMicrobial Resolution of 2-Hydroxy-3-nitropropionic Acid for Synthesis of Optically Active Isoserine  ap. 1258-1260.  aNAL-light  aThe biocatalytic stereoselective hydrolysis of 2-hydroxy-3-nitropropionic acid esters was studied.

Numerous interactions of multiple stressors causing synergistic or antagonistic effects have been described. However, limited information is available on combined effects of emerging pharmaceuticals and natural stressors. This study investigated the joint effects of the antidepressant sertraline and salinity on Carcinus maenas. To improve knowledge about interactive effects and potential vulnerability, experiments were performed with organisms from two estuaries with differing histories of exposure to environmental contamination. Biomarkers related to mode of action of sertraline were employed to assess effects of environmentally realistic concentrations of sertraline at two salinity levels. Synergism and antagonism were identified for biomarkers of cholinergic neurotransmission, energy production, anti-oxidant defences and oxidative damage. Different interactions were found for the two study sites highlighting the need to account for differences in tolerance of local ecological receptors in risk evaluations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarcinus maenas 3aantidepressants 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3aenergy 3aenvironmental exposure 3aestuaries 3amechanism of action 3apollution 3areceptors 3arisk 3asalinity 3asynergism 0aSertraline 0aSalinity 0aInteractive effects 0aAcetylcholinesterase 0aOxidative damage1 aSantos, Lúcia H.M.L.M.1 aOliva-Teles, Maria Teresa1 aDelerue-Matos, Cristina1 aGuimarães, Laura0 tAquatic toxicology.g2014 Nov., v. 156 p.169-178dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245007500177300001600252520176900268592002802037650001102065650000802076650001502084650002202099650001602121650001302137650001102150650001102161650001102172650002202183650001402205650001502219653001402234653002402248700002102272773013402293856008902427852000902516655001202525IND60781143620221118085130.0220623e20220614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078114362DNAL7 a10.1600/036364422X165125648016782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabin, Courtney H.10aEvolution of Chromosome Number in Wild Onions (Allium, Amaryllidaceae)  ap. 335-346.  aPolyploidy has been shown to be a significant driver of diversification among land plants. In addition to whole-genome duplication, other common mechanisms of chromosome number evolution include increases by a multiple of 1.5 in chromosome number due to the fusion of gametes with different ploidy levels (demi-polyploidy), gains or losses of single chromosomes that alter the DNA content of an organism (aneuploidy), or chromosome fission or fusion (ascending dysploidy or descending dysploidy, respectively). Considering the high variability in chromosome number transitions across multiple clades within angiosperms and the ancient genome duplication events responsible for their diversity, more studies of large polyploid systems are necessary to close the gaps in understanding chromosomal evolution in polyploid plants. Allium L. (Amaryllidaceae) is an ideal candidate for polyploid research because it is a large clade that includes numerous natural populations of diploid and polyploid species. Species of Allium mainly occupy temperate climates in the Northern Hemisphere and include economically important ornamentals and cultivated crops such as leeks, garlic, chives, and onions. Here, we used a molecular phylogeny of Allium to examine chromosomal evolution with chromEvol v. 2.0 which uses likelihood-based methods for inferring the pattern of chromosome number change across a phylogeny. The best-fit model of chromosomal evolution indicated that chromosome transitions within Allium occurred through the constant gains and losses of single chromosomes as well as demi-polyploidization events, with the rate of chromosome gain events being approximately 2.5 to 4.5 times more likely to occur than demi-polyploidization and loss events, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium 3aDNA 3aaneuploidy 3achromosome number 3achromosomes 3adiploidy 3agarlic 3agenome 3amodels 3aornamental plants 3aphylogeny 3apolyploidy 0adysploidy 0amolecular phylogeny1 aBell, Charles D.0 tSystematic botany.g2022 June 14, v. 47, no. 2 p.335-346dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364422X165125648016783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245003800168300001300206520250000219592002802719653002102747653002302768653002402791653001902815773008402834856008202918852000903000655001203009IND60631659720221119045349.0190312s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063165972DNAL7 a10.1163/1568568077827538952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoncato, Sergio10aPiranesi and the infinite prisons  ap. 3-18.  aSpatial Vision , Vol. 21, No. 1–2, pp. 3 – 18 (2007)  Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2007.

He spent his lifetime recording the magnificent buildings and ruins of ancient Rome. In his earlier work, he developed architectural fantasies and dark visions of imaginary prisons, the Carceri d’Invenzione (Imaginary Prisons) , which have fascinated people ever since they first appeared. They also made an impact in later artistic and literary contexts. Today they are considered the best expression of bewilderment, of the world’s massive oppression of man. How did Piranesi generate such a powerful source of meaning? I have reviewed a number of contributions by art essayists in the search for what lies behind the fascination of the ‘ Carceri ’. Analysis of these texts provides a rich set of aesthetic and psychological attributes as well as detailed indications of where to seek the source of the meanings. I suggest here a fruitful integration of this analysis, developed by considering various particular perceptual and geometric cues. I discuss three possible sources of meaning: the combination of architectural elements out of proportion; the difficulty of building a unitary space; and the ‘bottom perspective’ that gives rise to a sensation of floating. Keywords : Space perception; art perception; feature integration; impossible figures. OVERVIEW OF PIRANESI’S WORK Giovanni Battista Piranesi was born in Mogliano near Treviso in 1720 and died in Rome in 1778. Son of a Venetian stonemason, his first teacher was an uncle, Matteo Lucchesi, who taught him to draw and design architectural structures as well as theatrical sets. His uncle also imparted an appreciation of Palladium’s work. In 1740 he left for Rome where he remained almost all his life. He became a draftsman in the entourage of the Venetian ambassador Marco Foscarini, but the city itself offered him the opportunity of developing an interest in classical antiquities. In these years in Rome, he also studied perspective and stage design under Giuseppe Valeriani, and engraving under Giuseppe Vasi. ∗ E-mail: sergio.roncato@unipd.it  aPublisher supplied data 0aSPACE PERCEPTION 0aIMPOSSIBLE FIGURES 0aFEATURE INTEGRATION 0aART PERCEPTION0 tSpatial vision.g, v. 21, no. 1-2 p.3-18dBrillwJournal:26958x1568-56837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568568077827538953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007500169300001400244520218900258592002802447653001402475653001402489653002702503653002302530773008502553856008202638852000902720655001202729IND60631659820221119045438.0190312s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063165982DNAL7 a10.1163/1568568077827538592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchirillo, James10aGender's effect on the hemispheric laterality of Rembrandt's portraits  ap. 19-26.  aSpatial Vision , Vol. 21, No. 1–2, pp. 19 – 26 (2007)  Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2007.

This asymmetry is consistent with viewers rating Rembrandt’s left-cheeked male portraits as likely to be avoided, which may reflect that aggressive displays of dominance are governed by the contralateral right-hemisphere, while rating left-cheeked female faces as likely to be approached may indicate sexual attractiveness. Rembrandt’s exposed-cheek gender difference paints both sexual selection and dominance as being governed by the right cerebral hemisphere. Keywords : Rembrandt; portraits; hemispheric laterality; gender differences. INTRODUCTION A comprehensive survey of 1474 portraits (of both genders) painted in Western Europe from the sixteenth to the twentieth century revealed that ∼ 68% of the women were painted with their left-cheek exposed while only ∼ 56% of the men exposed their left-cheek (Grusser et al ., 1988; McManus, 1983; McManus and Humphrey, 1973; Schirillo, 2000). Interestingly, in 64% of Rembrandt’s female portraits the left-cheek faces the viewer while this is the case for only 33% of his male portraits (Bredius, 1969). This exaggerated portrait gender difference makes studying Rembrandt’s works especially enticing. Researchers have postulated that humans’ more intense emotions are controlled by their right hemisphere (Davidson, 1995; Nestor and Safer, 1990) which fMRI evidence concurs is specialized for social and emotional functions (Tabert et al ., 2001). This has resulted in having greater emotional expression displayed predominantly on the left-side of the face, which researchers have demonstrated repeatedly (Moscovitch and Olds, 1982; Sackeim et al ., 1978).

Using zebrafish as a model, we demonstrated for the first time in fish that cGMP is involved in oocyte maturation, and its functional model in oocyte maturation is different from that of mammals. The intracellular cGMP could be regulated by nitric oxide (NO), we found that all three NO synthase enzymes and four soluble guanylyl cyclases (sGC) are expressed in the zebrafish ovary. Intriguingly, either the activation or inhibition of the NO/sGC/cGMP pathway in fully grown follicles could lead to oocyte maturation. During oocyte maturation, cGMP levels increased in the follicular cell layer but decreased in oocytes, while NO levels increased in follicular cells but remained constant in oocytes. Based on these findings in zebrafish, we propose a hypothetical model on the dual role of cGMP in oocyte maturation: in follicular cells the LH signal could increase the level of NO and cGMP which induces oocyte maturation, while in the oocyte the decreased cGMP level can also induce oocyte maturation. These findings help us to understand the molecular mechanism of fish oocyte maturation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3acyclic GMP 3afish 3aluteinizing hormone 3amammals 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3aoocytes 0aOocyte maturation 0aOvary 0aZebrafish 0acGMP 0aNitric oxide 0aLuteinizing hormone1 aZhou, Wenni1 aWang, Yamei1 aNiu, Caiyan0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 May 23, v. 499, no. 4 p.998-1003dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003300152245008100185300001600266520167200282592002801954650002201982650002202004650001902026650001202045650001202057650001302069650002302082650003902105650002102144650001502165650001302180650001902193650001902212650001102231650001402242650003702256650001902293650000902312653000902321653000802330653000902338653000802347653000802355653000802363653001002371653000802381653000902389653001002398653001402408653001302422653002302435653001502458653003102473700001802504700001702522700001802539773010802557856008602665852000902751655001202760IND60553011020221119023107.0170607e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055301102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2013.12.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArutchelvi, Josephirudayaraj10aSelf-assembly of surfactin in aqueous solution: Role of divalent counterions  ap. 396-402.  aMyriad applications of surfactin in environmental and biomedical field prompt understanding the self-assembly behaviour of surfactin in aqueous solution as well as its interaction with counterions. Effect of four divalent counterions namely, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Ca2+ on the self-assembly of the surfactin, a biosurfactant isolated from Bacillus subtilis YB7 is studied by fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, optical and electron microscopic studies. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) and aggregation number (Nagg) of surfactin are 96.76±15.49μM and 101.12±2.53, respectively. The degree of counterion association increases as its ionic radius decreases. Ni2+ exhibits the highest and Ca2+ the least degree of counterion association. Addition of counterion reduces the size of the microstructures, aggregation number (Nagg) and zeta potential. The reduction in the zeta potential indicates the neutralization of the negative charges on the electrical double layer of the microstructures. Differential interference contrast (DIC) and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images of surfactin show the presence of vesicles and large aggregates including giant vesicles. On the addition of Ca2+, fusion of vesicles into large aggregates is predominantly observed. Ni2+ induces the transition of large spherical vesicles into small spherical, worm-like vesicles and multicompartment-like structures (vesosome). Such structures are the evidences for metal ion coordinated intervesicular interactions. This study reveals that the self-assembly process of surfactin can be controlled by the addition of metal ions according to the requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aaqueous solutions 3abiosurfactants 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acolloids 3aelectrical charges 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3alight scattering 3ametal ions 3amicelles 3amicrostructure 3aneutralization 3anickel 3asurfactin 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential 3azinc 0acAMP 0aDIC 0aNagg 0aTEM 0aDDS 0aDLS 0aCMC/s 0aSDS 0aSANS 0aANOVA 0aSurfactin 0aVesosome 0aAggregation number 0aCounterion 0aIntervesicular interaction1 aSangeetha, J.1 aPhilip, John1 aDoble, Mukesh0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 116 p.396-402dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2013.12.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245014000211300001800351506007600369520106400445592002801509506003701537650001101574650002001585650001501605650001601620650001701636650000901653650001101662650001401673650001601687650002301703653003901726653002801765653001801793653002901811653001101840653002001851700002301871700001601894700006001910773014801970856008202118852000902200655001202209IND60628035520221207063108.0190129e20180219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062803552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.0042doi7 aPMC58166942pmcid7 a294101762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamagami, Takashi10aTransient activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling reporter in fibrotic scar formation after compression spinal cord injury in adult mice  ap. 1302-1307.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAfter traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), a scar may form with a fibrotic core (fibrotic scar) and surrounding reactive astrocytes (glial scar) at the lesion site. The scar tissue is considered a major obstacle preventing regeneration both as a physical barrier and as a source for secretion of inhibitors of axonal regeneration. Understanding the mechanism of scar formation and how to control it may lead to effective SCI therapies. Using a compression-SCI model on adult transgenic mice, we demonstrate that the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling reporter TOPgal (TCF/Lef1-lacZ) positive cells appeared at the lesion site by 5 days, peaked on 7 days, and diminished by 14 days post injury. Using various representative cell lineage markers, we demonstrate that, these transiently TOPgal positive cells are a group of Fibronectin(+);GFAP(−) fibroblast-like cells in the core scar region. Some of them are proliferative. These results indicate that Wnt/β-catenin signaling may play a key role in fibrotic scar formation after traumatic spinal cord injury.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aanimal injuries 3aastrocytes 3afibroblasts 3afibronectins 3amice 3amodels 3asecretion 3aspinal cord 3atransgenic animals 0aTraumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) 0aSpinal cord compression 0aFibrotic scar 0aWnt/β-catenin signaling 0aTOPgal 0aTransgenic mice1 aPleasure, David E.1 aLam, Kit S.1 aZhou, Chengji J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8592-46800 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Feb. 19, v. 496, no. 4 p.1302-1307dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245013000160300001800290500001400308520114500322592002801467650002201495650001801517650002501535650001701560650001801577650001601595650001601611650001501627650001701642650002001659650001001679650002501689650002001714650001901734650001201753650001201765653001401777653002501791653002801816653002601844700002101870700001901891700002101910700001801931700002001949773018401969856007502153852000902228655001202237IND60691888420221122154205.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069188842DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.12752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKIMURA, Takuma10aCytokinin-induced Gene Expression in Cultured Green Cells of Nicotiana tabacum Identified by Fluorescent Differential Display  ap. 1275-1283.  aNAL-light  aThe cell growth and plastid development of cultured green tobacco cells were maintained by the phytohormone cytokinin. After subculture into cytokinin-free medium, when cytokinin treatment was resumed, physiological changes induced by cytokinin were analyzed. Changes in chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthetic gene expression were observed 1 week after cytokinin induction, and changes in cell growth were observed 2 weeks after cytokinin induction. Two cytokinin-induced genes (cig) were isolated from these cells using the fluorescent differential display technique. Northern analysis confirmed that expression of these cig was induced by both natural and synthetic cytokinins. The expression of cig1 was also induced by abscisic acid, and its cDNA sequence was similar to the proline dehydrogenase gene. The expression of cig2 is specific to cytokinin and is not induced by other phytohormones. The amino acid sequence encoded by cig2 is similar to the GDP/GTP exchange factor eIF2B, which regulates translation initiation. The expression of these cig suggests a complex induction system involving cytokinin and other phytohormones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aabscisic acid 3aamino acid sequences 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acell growth 3achlorophyll 3acytokinins 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aoxidoreductases 3aphotosynthesis 3aproline 3atobacco 0acytokinin 0adifferential display 0aGDP/GTP exchange factor 0aproline dehydrogenase1 aNakano, Takeshi,1 aTAKI, Noriyuki1 aISHIKAWA, Mayuko1 aAsami, Tadao,1 aYOSHIDA, Shigeo0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2001 Jan. 1, v. 65, no. 6 p.1275-1283dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.65.12753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245008500159300001800244500002000262520186600282592002802148596006802176596003902244650001102283650002102294650001902315650001402334650002402348650002602372650001202398650001202410650001102422650001102433650001602444700002202460700001902482700002902501773013602530856007602666852000902742655001202751IND60786381420221118204716.0220803e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078638142DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.17000902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoquet, Laura10aNectar foragers contribute to the pollination of buzz‐pollinated plant species  ap. 1451-1463.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE OF THE STUDY: Pollination performance may depend on the type of floral resource (pollen or nectar) foraged by visitors. In buzz‐pollinated plant species, the poricidal anthers release pollen during active pollen collection that induces flower vibrations. These buzz‐pollinated species generally do not produce nectar. Nevertheless, several Ericaceae are buzz‐pollinated and produce nectar. We estimated the relative effectiveness of visitors according to the type of resource collected, nectar or pollen (buzzing). METHODS: We compared the relative performance of pollen removal, transport, and deposition (effectiveness) of the main insect visitors on four ericaceous species: three buzz‐pollinated species with different pore sizes, Erica tetralix, Vaccinium myrtillus, and V. vitis‐idaea; and one non‐buzz‐pollinated species, Calluna vulgaris. KEY RESULTS: Bumblebees were the main pollinators for the three buzz‐pollinated species, whereas hoverflies were the main pollinators for the non‐buzz‐pollinated generalist C. vulgaris. For the studied plant species, we observed no difference in pollination effectiveness among bumblebee species. Buzzing bumblebees were the most effective visitors for pollination per flower visit for the two Vaccinium species, whereas nectar foragers were the most effective visitors for pollination of E. tetralix. In the case of Vaccinium myrtillus, nectar foragers contributed the most to pollination success because they were more abundant than pollen foragers. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that consideration of the resource collected by visitors and their behavior is necessary to compare their relative performance. The combination of visitation rate and effectiveness per visit reveals that nectar foragers make a substantial contribution to pollination of the buzz‐pollinated ericaceous species.  aPublisher supplied data  cFonds spéciaux de recherche, Université catholique de Louvain  cFonds de la Recherche Scientifique 3aBombus 3aCalluna vulgaris 3aErica tetralix 3aSyrphidae 3aVaccinium myrtillus 3aVaccinium vitis-idaea 3aflowers 3ainsects 3anectar 3apollen 3apollination1 aBruyère, Lydiane1 aPirard, Benoit1 aJacquemart, Anne‐Laure0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2017 Oct., v. 104, no. 10 p.1451-1463dBotanical Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44651x0002-91227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.17000903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245001900167300001400186520262000200592002802820653003402848653002202882653002102904653001402925653002302939653002102962653000802983653001002991653002003001773008503021856008203106852000903188655001203197IND60631659920221119045542.0190312s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063165992DNAL7 a10.1163/1568568077827539672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWade, Nicholas10aArtful visions  ap. 27-53.  aSpatial Vision , Vol. 21, No. 1–2, pp. 27 – 53 (2007)  Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2007.

WADE ∗ School of Psychology, University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 4HN, UK Received 20 May 2006; accepted 26 December 2006 Abstract —Visual artists and visual scientists are often concerned with examining the same spatial phenomena, but the methods they adopt differ radically. Scientists try to discover new facts regarding old phenomena; they rarely discover new phenomena but different conditions under which the old ones operate (perhaps using some novel apparatus for generating stimuli). Artists are concerned with arranging phenomena in a manner that has not been seen before, or perhaps to increase the spectators’ awareness of the phenomena. This typically involves complicating the effects rather than simplifying pattern elements. Thus, scientists rarefy and isolate phenomena to control them in the laboratory, whereas artists embrace complexity and manipulate phenomena intuitively. The differences in method have resulted in divergent vocabularies for describing similar effects, and the two approaches can appear more disparate than their phenomenal commonality would suggest. It could be argued that for spatial vision, prior to the advent of computer graphics, visual scientists have not represented adequately the subject matter of their own enquiry; this want was supplied by visual artists. Not only have artists provided more engaging examples of spatial phenomena, but they have also enhanced their range in ways that are scientifically novel. The opposite argument applies to motion perception, where scientists developed techniques that were eagerly adopted in the arts. The interactions between art and both spatial and motion vision were influenced by instruments invented in the early nineteenth century for manipulating the representation of space and time — the stereoscope and the stroboscopic disc. Keywords : Visual allusions; ambiguity; apparent motion; art; depth; history of vision; visual illusions; picture perception; two- and three-dimensionality. 1. INTRODUCTION Colour and contour are the elements of art and science. Pigments have been employed to represent objects for tens of thousands of years (Breuil, 1952) and rules for the combinations of colours have a shorter but still considerable history. With this legacy it is surprising that the science of colour did not materially influence the practice of art until the nineteenth century (see Kemp, 1990; Werner, 1998). ∗ E-mail: n.j.wade@dundee.ac.uk  aPublisher supplied data 0aTWO- AND THREE-DIMENSIONALITY 0aHISTORY OF VISION 0aVISUAL ILLUSIONS 0aAMBIGUITY 0aPICTURE PERCEPTION 0aVISUAL ALLUSIONS 0aART 0aDEPTH 0aAPPARENT MOTION0 tSpatial vision.g, v. 21, no. 1-2 p.27-53dBrillwJournal:26958x1568-56837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568568077827539673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245007900174300001400253500001500267520129900282592002801581650001401609650001701623650000901640650001301649650001401662650001401676650001201690650002301702650000901725650001501734650001101749650001101760650001501771650002501786650001301811650001901824650002001843650001401863650002001877650001101897650001901908650001301927653002401940653001401964653002701978653002202005653000902027700002002036700003002056773010602086856008602192852000902278655001202287IND60553011120221119023120.0170607e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055301112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2013.12.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Anil Kumar10aSurfactin restores and enhances swarming motility under heavy metal stress  ap. 26-31.  a2019-12-06  aThe present work reports the importance of lipopeptide biosurfactant on swarming motility of multi-metal resistant (MMR) bacterium under heavy metal stress. The MMR bacteria strain CM100B, identified as Bacillus cereus, was isolated from the coal mine sample. The strain was able to grow and reduce several metals namely Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+ and Pb2+ ions which are common environmental pollutants. Presence of toxic heavy metal ions in the swarming medium significantly altered the motility of CM100B. Presence of Cd2+ and Pb2+ ions inhibited development of peritrichous flagella, thus inhibiting swarming motility. However, the addition of anionic biosurfactant surfactin restored (in case of Cd2+ and Pb2+ ions) or enhanced (in case of Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+ and Mn2+) the swarming ability of CM100B. Zeta potential studies for determining bacterial cell surface charge indicated that surfactin provided a suitable swarming environment to bacteria even under metal stress by chelating to cationic metal ions. Non-ionic surfactant Triton X-100 was unable to restore swarming under Cd2+ and Pb2+ ion stress. Thus, suggesting that surfactin can aid in motility not only by reducing the surface tension of swarming medium but also by binding to metal ions in the presence of metal ions stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3aheavy metals 3alead 3acolloids 3aoctoxynol 3aflagellum 3acadmium 3abacterial motility 3acoal 3ametal ions 3acobalt 3acopper 3apollutants 3anonionic surfactants 3atoxicity 3abiosurfactants 3asurface tension 3asurfactin 3aBacillus cereus 3anickel 3azeta potential 3abacteria 0aCell surface charge 0aSurfactin 0aMulti-metal resistance 0aSwarming motility 0aions1 aDhanjal, Soniya1 aCameotra, Swaranjit Singh0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 116 p.26-31dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2013.12.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007800166300001800244500000900262520156200271592002801833650001701861650001901878650001401897650002701911650001101938650002201949650001401971650001601985650001802001650001202019650000902031650000902040650002502049650002402074650001902098700001902117773012302136856008502259852000902344655001202353IND60665376620221119140801.0191228e199911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066537662DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1999.3961636x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrey, K.

Nine cycles of recurrent phenotypic selection for high groat-oil content were conducted in a genetically broad-based oat population that included germplasm from the wild relative A. sterilis L. Our objectives in this experiment were to determine if selection for high groat-oil content was effective and if selection reduced genetic variation for oil content; to identify agronomically acceptable lines with high groat-oil content; and to document the indirect effects of selection on grain yield, groat fraction, and oil yield. We evaluated 100 random lines from the base (C0) population and each of the nine selection cycle populations in three environments. Mean groat-oil content increased linearly during nine cycles of selection at a rate of 6.6 g kg⁻¹ cycle⁻¹ (equivalent to 6.7% of C0 population mean cycle⁻¹) from a mean of 98.2 g kg⁻¹ in C0 to 158.5 g kg⁻¹ in C9. The rate of gain from selection did not decrease in later cycles. Oil yield increased at a rate equivalent to 1.9% of C0 population mean cycle⁻¹, while mean groat fraction did not change and mean grain yield decreased at a rate equivalent to 3.2% of C0 population mean cycle⁻¹ For all traits, genetic variation did not decrease during selection cycles. Selected S₀-derived lines from the population with groat-oil contents >150 g kg⁻¹ exhibited lower yield, greater lodging, and greater disease susceptibility compared with the best check cultivar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aAvena sterilis 3acaryopsis 3adisease susceptibility 3aenergy 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3agrain yield 3alipid content 3alodging 3aoats 3aoils 3aphenotypic selection 3arecurrent selection 3awild relatives1 aHolland, J.

Firstly, experiments were conducted on the effect of processing conditions on the mechanical properties of injection moulded Vectra specimens and an optimum injection pressure and melt temperature was specified. Blends of nylon 6,6 with Vectra were then injection moulded under the previously specified optimum processing conditions. During microstructural studies it was observed that the skin contained highly oriented fibrillar domains of Vectra, the density and texture of which changed with blend composition which was varied between 20–30 Vol% Vectra. A 25 Vol% composition of Vectra displayed the best reinforcing properties and at this composition the fibrils in the skin were arranged into thick bundles. Above a 25 Vol% Vectra content the start of fibril coalescence was observed which reduced the self-reinforcing character of the blend.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainjection molding 3aliquids 3amechanical properties 3amelting 3anylon 3atexture1 aCowley, J.,1 aDICKINSON, C.

Extensive research in urban watersheds has broadened our knowledge about point and non-point pollutant sources, but the fate of nutrients is not completely understood. For example, it is not known how long-term nutrient cycling processes in turfgrass landscapes influence nitrogen retention rates or the relative atmospheric contribution to urban nitrogen exports. The effect of prolonged reclaimed water irrigation is also unknown. Stable isotopes have been used to trace pollutants, but distinguishing sources (e.g., fertilizers, wastewater, etc.) can be difficult. Identifying pollutant sources may aid our understanding of harmful algal blooms because the extent of the relationship between urban nutrient sources and algal blooms is unclear. Further research on the delivery and fate of nutrients within urban watersheds is needed to address manageable water quality impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3abiogeochemical cycles 3afertilizers 3aland use 3alandscapes 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3astable isotopes 3aturf grasses 3awastewater 3awastewater irrigation 3awater quality 3awatersheds 2aCities 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFertilizersxstatistics & numerical data 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aWastewaterxanalysisxstatistics & numerical data. 2aWater Supplyxstatistics & numerical data 0aPoint source 0aNon-point source 0aReclaimed water 0aSeptic systems 0aWastewater treatment facilities 0aIsotopic analyses 0aStormwater1 aHochmuth, George J.1 aMartinez, Christopher J.1 aBoyer, Treavor H.1 aDukes, Michael D.1 aToor, Gurpal S.1 aCisar, J.

We examined the impact of nutrient and water availability on stem volume, leaf area, transpiration per unit ground area (EC) and canopy conductance per unit leaf area (GS) of a pine plantation during its 8th and 9th growing seasons. Treatments consisted of a factorial combination of throughfall reduction (30% reduction in throughfall versus ambient) and fertilization (a complete suite of essential nutrients) beginning in April 2012. Overall, our results indicate that despite unusually high rainfall in the study period and a lack of leaf area index (LAI) response, both EC and GS decreased in response to fertilization and throughfall reduction. Fertilization increased stem volume increment 21% in 2013. Treatment differences were greatest in the growing season of 2013, when EC was on average 19%, 13% and 29% lower in the throughfall reduction (D), fertilization (F) and combined treatment (FD) than the control (C), respectively. The responses of GS to volumetric soil water content (VWC) indicate that lower EC in F was associated with a decrease relative to C in GS at high VWC. Decreases of GS in D relative to C were associated with lower VWC, but little change in the response of GS to VWC. Decreases observed in FD resulted from a combination of these two factors. The pattern of GS responses in the different treatments suggests that structural or physiological changes underlie this fertilization response, possibly in fine root area or hydraulic conductivity. In the short term, this led to large increases in the water use efficiency of stem production, which could suggest greater resiliency to minor water stress. However, impacts on long-term sensitivity to drought remain a concern, as the EC reduction triggered by the fertilization treatment was of comparable magnitude to the 30% throughfall exclusion treatment and the greatest reductions were found in the combined treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus taeda 3acanopy 3aconiferous forests 3adrought 3afine roots 3agrowing season 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aleaf area index 3anutrients 3arain 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3astomatal conductance 3athroughfall 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 0aFertilization 0aDrought 0aGas exchange 0aLoblolly pine 0aSap flux 0aTranspiration1 aDomec, Jean-Christophe1 aLaviner, Marshall A.1 aFox, Thomas R.1 aSun, Ge1 aMcNulty, Steve1 aKing, John1 aNoormets, Asko0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 355 p.72-82dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03910naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005400144245017400198300001800372520155400390592002801944650002601972650002001998650001502018650002702033650003102060650001002091650001302101650001502114650001202129650002002141650001702161650002702178650001002205650000902215650001902224650002202243650001402265650002802279650002202307650001802329650001802347650001102365653001002376653001302386653002302399653002402422653001102446700001802457700005502475700005402530700005902584700005302643700005302696700006002749700005802809700005602867700001802923700005302941773015402994856007903148852000903227655001203236IND60688966920221119033519.0200614e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068896692DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2019-176122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeimes, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0638-059610aCows selected for divergent mastitis susceptibility display a differential liver transcriptome profile after experimental Staphylococcus aureus mammary gland inoculation  ap. 6364-6373.  aInfection and inflammation of the mammary gland, and especially prevention of mastitis, are still major challenges for the dairy industry. Different approaches have been tried to reduce the incidence of mastitis. Genetic selection of cows with lower susceptibility to mastitis promises sustainable success in this regard. Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 18, particularly the region between 43 and 59 Mb, harbors quantitative trait loci (QTL) for somatic cell score, a surrogate trait for mastitis susceptibility. Scrutinizing the molecular bases hereof, we challenged udders from half-sib heifers having inherited either favorable paternal haplotypes for somatic cell score (Q) or unfavorable haplotypes (q) with the Staphylococcus aureus pathogen. RNA sequencing was used for an in-depth analysis of challenge-related alterations in the hepatic transcriptome. Liver exerts highly relevant immune functions aside from being the key metabolic organ. Hence, a holistic approach focusing on the liver enabled us to identify challenge-related and genotype-dependent differentially expressed genes and underlying regulatory networks. In response to the S. aureus challenge, we found that heifers with Q haplotypes displayed more activated immune genes and pathways after S. aureus challenge compared with their q half-sibs. Furthermore, we found a significant enrichment of differentially expressed loci in the genomic target region on BTA18, suggesting the existence of a regionally acting regulatory element with effects on a variety of genes in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abovine mastitis 3adairy cows 3adisease susceptibility 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahaplotypes 3aheifers 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aliver 3aloci 3amammary glands 3anatural selection 3apathogens 3aquantitative trait loci 3asequence analysis 3asomatic cells 3atranscriptome 3audders 0aBTA18 0amastitis 0asomatic cell score 0aliver transcriptome 0aRNAseq1 aBrodhagen, J.1 aWeikard, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0308-99661 aBecker, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0425-62841 aMeyerholz, M.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1720-65931 aPetzl, W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7931-26421 aZerbe, H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7972-48581 aSchuberth, H.-J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5904-57511 aHoedemaker, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8154-26421 aSchmicke, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7218-293X1 aEngelmann, S.1 aKühn, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0216-424X0 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 July, v. 103, no. 7 p.6364-6373dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-176123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2201093 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245007100165520086500236592002801101650001601129650001101145650001401156650001601170650001201186650001301198650001901211653000701230653000701237653000901244653000701253653000801260653000801268653000801276653000801284653001101292653000901303653000801312653000801320653000901328653000801337653000901345653000901354653000801363653000801371653000701379653000901386653000701395653000901402653000801411653000801419653000801427653000901435653000801444653000901452653000801461653000701469653000801476653000801484653001101492653000801503653000901511653000801520653000901528653000801537653000801545653000901553653001301562653001401575653000801589653001001597653000801607653001101615653000801626653000801634653000901642653000801651653000801659653000701667653000801674653000701682653000801689653001001697653000801707653000801715653000701723653000801730653002001738653002201758700001501780700001701795700001801812700001501830700001301845700001601858773010801874856008601982852000902068655001202077IND60743704220221119165155.0210812e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074370422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1183852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zixiu10aGreen and sustainable cellulose-derived humidity sensors: A review  aCellulose, as the most abundant natural polysaccharide, is an excellent material for developing green humidity sensors, especially due to its humidity responsiveness as a result of its rich hydrophilic groups.

This study proposes a hybrid approach integrated with the Geographical information system (GIS) and Bayesian network (BN) to deal with the location selection problem for EVs. GIS serves for capturing spatial and geographical data, which provides dynamic and visual information for selecting charging sites. BN is employed to process various criteria and demonstrate the cause-effect relationship in alternative site selection. A BN model consisting of nine criteria from three aspects is established to determine the most suitable locations for charging stations of EVs. A total of ten alternative locations in Singapore is used to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the developed hybrid approach. Results indicate that (1) Criteria, including the number of MRT stations, household units, and charging efficiency, are identified as the most sensitive factors to the location selection; (2) The transportation efficiency has the strongest linkage with the location selection (with an average value of the strength of 0.445), revealing that the transportation efficiency is more important than the social and economic efficiency. The novelty of this research lies in the development of the hybrid GIS-based BN approach that is more accurate and stable under noise interruption compared to the traditional decision-making method (e.g., TOPSIS). The developed approach can be used as a decision tool to identify the major contributing factors and update the optimal decisions given new observation data in GIS in an automatic manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aSingapore 3adecision making 3ageographic information systems 3amodels 3aspatial data 3atransportation 3aurban development 0aElectric vehicles (EVs) 0aGIS 0aBayesian network 0aLocation selection 0aSensitivity analysis1 aTeoh, Bak Koon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7513-42791 aZhang, Limao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7245-37410 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Apr. 10, v. 344 p.131049-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1310493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245009600176300001600272520164100288592002801929650001501957650001101972650002501983650001902008650002202027650000902049650001202058650001602070650001902086650001502105650001902120650001502139650002602154650001102180650001502191650002002206653002602226653002102252653002602273653001602299653001902315653002902334653003102363700002202394700002402416700002602440700002102466773012702487856008402614852000902698655001202707IND60121847220221120025228.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012184722DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2014.8682802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBottrel, Sue Ellen C.10aDegradation of ethylenethiourea pesticide metabolite from water by photocatalytic processes  ap. 263-270.  aIn this study, photocatalytic (photo-Fenton and H ₂O ₂/UV) and dark Fenton processes were used to remove ethylenethiourea (ETU) from water. The experiments were conducted in a photo-reactor with an 80 W mercury vapor lamp. The mineralization of ETU was determined by total organic carbon analysis, and ETU degradation was qualitatively monitored by the reduction of UV absorbance at 232 nm. A higher mineralization efficiency was obtained by using the photo-peroxidation process (UV/H ₂O ₂). Approximately 77% of ETU was mineralized within 120 min of the reaction using [H ₂O ₂] ₀ = 400 mg L ⁻¹. The photo-Fenton process mineralized 70% of the ETU with [H ₂O ₂] ₀ = 800 mg L ⁻¹ and [Fe ²⁺] = 400 mg L ⁻¹, and there is evidence that hydrogen peroxide was the limiting reagent in the reaction because it was rapidly consumed. Moreover, increasing the concentration of H ₂O ₂ from 800 mg L ⁻¹ to 1200 mg L ⁻¹ did not enhance the degradation of ETU. Kinetics studies revealed that the pseudo-second-order model best fit the experimental conditions. The k values for the UV/H ₂O ₂ and photo-Fenton processes were determined to be 6.2 × 10 ⁻⁴ mg L ⁻¹ min ⁻¹ and 7.7 × 10 ⁻⁴ mg L ⁻¹ min ⁻¹, respectively. The mineralization of ETU in the absence of hydrogen peroxide has led to the conclusion that ETU transformation products are susceptible to photolysis by UV light. These are promising results for further research. The processes that were investigated can be used to remove pesticide metabolites from drinking water sources and wastewater in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3acarbon 3adeveloping countries 3adrinking water 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3amercury 3ametabolites 3amineralization 3apesticides 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3aultraviolet radiation 3avapors 3awastewater 3awater treatment 0aPesticide metabolites 0aethylenethiourea 0aphoto-Fenton reaction 0adegradation 0amineralization 0aphotocatalytic processes 0aadvanced oxidation process1 aAmorim, Camila C.1 aLeão, Mônica M.D.1 aCosta, Elizângela P.1 aLacerda, Igor A.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 49, no. 4 p.263-270dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2014.8682803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04182naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245012600212300001600338520222900354592002802583650002402611650000902635650001202644650001502656650001302671650001502684650001702699653002202716653001502738653001302753653001302766653001102779653002702790700002002817700006302837700002002900700002202920700001602942700001602958700001702974700002202991700005703013700005703070700006303127700002103190700001903211700001703230700002003247700002203267700001703289700001903306700002403325773011403349856008303463961001303546852000903559655001203568IND60754842920221120225918.0211213e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075484292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rama.2021.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhlering, Marissa A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3913-428X12aA Synthesis of Ranch-Level Sustainability Indicators for Land Managers and to Communicate Across the US Beef Supply Chain  ap. 217-230.  aWhile increasing numbers of ranchers are striving to demonstrate sustainable ranching operations geared toward a healthy landscape, companies are seeking to advance sustainability along beef supply chains and consumers are making more environmentally oriented purchasing choices. Yet there is a need for greater clarity on which indicators are most effective for assessing and monitoring sustainable management and continuous improvement of ranching operations. Our objective was to synthesize existing guidance on monitoring and assessing ranch-scale sustainability in the United States and to identify core ecological, social, and economic indicators that could identify well-managed ranching, support adaptive management, and demonstrate producers’ sustainability and continuous improvement to retailers and consumers. We evaluated 21 range and pastureland assessments from nongovernmental organizations, agencies, and academics that totaled 180 indicators. From this, we selected 20 commonly used “core” indicators (12 ecological and 8 socioeconomic). We identified indicators that are designed to detect change over time for management practices, common among many approaches, and/or critical indicators for outcomes of common interest to producers, companies, and consumers. The synthesis of indicators across many guidance documents offers insight into what a diverse set of range professionals and institutions see as critical to demonstrate and track ranch-level sustainability, and producers, consumers, and companies may find a subset of these indicators to be relevant for their operation and region, values, and/or company sustainability goals. The synthesis also highlights the need for more integration and agreement on socioeconomic indicators of ranch sustainability. We acknowledge that socioeconomic indicators are context dependent and discuss the pitfalls of not integrating them into ranch assessments. Finally, we identified four issues to consider in operationalizing widespread use of common indicators: 1) who bears the cost, 2) agreement on simple and robust standardized protocols, 3) developing region-specific thresholds, and 4) issues of data privacy and sharing agreements for data use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive management 3abeef 3aecology 3alandscapes 3apastures 3arangelands 3asupply chain 0abeef supply chain 0aecological 0aeconomic 0ameasures 0asocial 0asustainable rangelands1 aKazanski, Clare1 aLendrum, Patrick E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9804-77921 aBorrelli, Pablo1 aBurnidge, William1 aClark, Lexi1 aEllis, Chad1 aGadzia, Kirk1 aGelbard, Jonathan1 aGennet, Sasha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6338-53371 aGoodwin, Jeff1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1592-05771 aHerrick, Jeffrey E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1731-41561 aKachergis, Emily1 aKnapp, Corrine1 aLabbe, Nancy1 aMaczko, Kristie1 aPorzig, Elizabeth1 aRizzo, David1 aSpiegal, Sheri1 aWilson, Christopher0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2021 Nov., v. 79 p.217-230dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2021.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245012500180300001400305500001500319520155000334592002801884650002401912650002001936650001101956650002201967650001901989650001502008650001502023650001202038650000902050650001602059650001302075650001402088650002302102650001302125650001102138650001702149650001202166650001502178653001402193653001802207653001602225653002102241653001002262653001002272653001902282700002302301700001902324700001602343700002402359773010802383856009002491852000902581655001202590IND60084078420221119175246.0190318e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008407842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2013.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardilini, Adam P.A.10aSurviving in sprawling suburbs: Suburban environments represent high quality breeding habitat for a widespread shorebird  ap. 72-80.  a2019-12-06  aThroughout the world, urban sprawl converts agricultural land to urban environments, however, little is known of the influence of such landscape change on the reproductive success of native species. We predicted that reproductive success would be suppressed by urban sprawl through habitat degradation and indirectly through compromised quality of parental care from human disturbance. We studied the masked lapwing, Vanellus miles, a common ground-nesting species that occurs in both agricultural and suburban landscapes. Contrary to our predictions, parents in suburban environments invested more in defence of eggs (aggression and distraction) yet suburban female lapwings were in better condition (7% heavier) and laid 2% longer eggs than agricultural female lapwings, suggesting greater access to food resources in suburban than agricultural environments. Lapwings had higher hatching success in suburban compared with agricultural environments, leading to greater reproductive success; a similar rate of chick mortality was evident between environments. The conversion of land from agriculture to suburbia results in species which are winners and losers, some of which (e.g., for species such as the ground-nesting lapwing) are difficult to predict a priori. Despite an overall trend of decreasing avian diversity with increasing urbanisation world-wide, suburban environments have the capacity to act as high quality breeding habitat for species such as the masked lapwing, although such species may be the exception rather than the rule.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahabitat destruction 3aland use change 3ahumans 3aagricultural land 3abreeding sites 3aaggression 3alandscapes 3aparents 3aeggs 3aurban areas 3ahatching 3amortality 3aindigenous species 3aVanellus 3achicks 3aurbanization 3afemales 3aprediction 0aPredation 0aAnthropogenic 0aDisturbance 0aHatching success 0abirds 0aRural 0aChick survival1 aWeston, Michael A.1 aNimmo, Dale G.1 aDann, Peter1 aSherman, Craig D.H.0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2013 July, v. 115 p.72-80dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2013.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002400169245007200193300001600265520104400281592002801325650002501353650002001378650001201398650001601410650002401426650003501450650001301485650000901498650001101507650001801518650001601536650005101552650001201603650002801615650004401643650002801687650004301715653002501758653002001783653002001803653001801823653001801841700001801859700002401877700002601901700002201927700001801949700001701967700001901984700002002003700002102023700002002044700002002064700001902084700002502103773008902128856008402217852000902301655001202310IND60086724320221118023541.0160903e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008672432DNAL7 a232620702pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2012.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarusenko, Yevgeniy10aBioavailability of nanoparticulate hematite to Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 150-156.  aThe environmental effects and bioavailability of nanoparticulate iron (Fe) to plants are currently unknown. Here, plant bioavailability of synthesized hematite Fe nanoparticles was evaluated using Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) as a model. Over 56-days of growing wild-type A. thaliana, the nanoparticle-Fe and no-Fe treatments had lower plant biomass, lower chlorophyll concentrations, and lower internal Fe concentrations than the Fe-treatment. Results for the no-Fe and nanoparticle-Fe treatments were consistently similar throughout the experiment. These results suggest that nanoparticles (mean diameter 40.9 nm, range 22.3–67.0 nm) were not taken up and therefore not bioavailable to A. thaliana. Over 14-days growing wild-type and transgenic (Type I/II proton pump overexpression) A. thaliana, the Type I plant grew more than the wild-type in the nanoparticle-Fe treatment, suggesting Type I plants cope better with Fe limitation; however, the nanoparticle-Fe and no-Fe treatments had similar growth for all plant types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abioavailability 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3agene overexpression 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahematite 3airon 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aproton pump 2aArabidopsisxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBiomass 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aFerric Compoundsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aNanoparticlesxanalysis 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxmetabolism. 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aBioavailability 0aIron limitation 0aNanomaterials 0aNanoparticles1 aShipp, Jessie1 aHamilton, George A.1 aMorgan, Jennifer L.L.1 aKeebaugh, Michael1 aHill, Hansina1 aDutta, Arnab1 aZhuo, Xiaoding1 aUpadhyay, Nabin1 aHutchings, James1 aHerckes, Pierre1 aAnbar, Ariel D.1 aShock, Everett1 aHartnett, Hilairy E.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 Mar., v. 174 p.150-156dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2012.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014500163300001600308506011100324506007600435520117300511592002801684506003701712650001601749650001101765650001901776650001901795650001101814650001401825651001001839653003001849653002201879653001801901653002701919653003701946653001901983653002202002653001602024653002102040653002702061700001302088700001502101700001702116700001502133700001902148700001602167700001402183700001602197700001202213700001802225700002002243700001802263700005302281773009902334856005102433852000902484655001202493IND60790609020221207065812.0220824e20220819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079060902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.oneear.2022.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wu10aCarbon neutrality of China’s passenger car sector requires coordinated short-term behavioral changes and long-term technological solutions  ap. 875-891.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe passenger car sector accounts for nearly half of all transport-related emissions. Rapid decarbonization is therefore important but challenging, particularly in China, where, despite recent emission peak (by 2030) and carbon-neutrality (by 2060) pledges, car ownership and associated emissions are increasing. Successful emissions reduction will require a rapid transition of both technology (e.g., toward electrification) and demand (e.g., driving less). However, how to successfully deploy these twin strategies for optimal outcomes remains unclear. Here, we develop an integrated fleet dynamics model that considers emissions associated with car manufacturing, operation, end-of-life recycling, and energy supply alongside socioeconomic changes. Our analyses reveal that optimal short-term results will be achieved through demand-oriented strategies, which can reduce emissions by 22% and achieve 2030 emissions peak targets. Technology-oriented strategies are more optimal when deployed in the longer term and can result in emission reductions of 91%. A successfully coordinated strategy could reduce China’s passenger cars CO₂ emissions to 0.05 Gt by 2050.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautomobiles 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adynamic models 3aenergy 3aownership 3aChina 0aclimate change mitigation 0acarbon nuetrality 0apassenger car 0ademand-side mitigation 0atransport sector decarbonization 0afleet dynamics 0aelectric vehicles 0alightweight 0aindustry ecology 0amaterial flow analysis1 aSun, Xin1 aLiu, Litao1 aLiu, Xiaojie1 aZhang, Rui1 aZhang, Shaohui1 aXue, Jinjun1 aSun, Qian1 aWang, Minxi1 aLi, Xin1 aYang, Jianxin1 aHertwich, Edgar1 aGe, Quansheng1 aLiu, Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7613-19850 tOne earth.g2022 Aug. 19, v. 5, no. 8 p.875-891dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27390x2590-33227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2022.07.005  aDNAL 7aarticle05330naa a2200913 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135024004500173040001800218100002700236245011200263300001400375506002800389506003600417506007600453506003100529520248600560592002803046596005203074596006703126596008303193596004503276596005003321506003703371650001603408650001303424650001203437650001103449650001503460650002203475650002303497650001203520650001303532650002503545650001303570650001203583650001003595650002203605650001503627650002303642650002203665650002203687650001103709650001803720650001003738650001603748650001903764650001703783650001703800650001003817651001903827653001503846653001203861653001903873653000903892653001003901653001803911700001803929700001503947700002603962700001903988700002004007700001804027700001804045700002104063700002304084700002204107700001204129700001904141773011404160856008504274903002404359961001204383852000904395655001204404IND60542589220221207063302.0190403e20151101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054258922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.04.0122chorus7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.04.0122doi7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.04.0122chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomec, Jean-Christophe10aConversion of natural forests to managed forest plantations decreases tree resistance to prolonged droughts  ap. 58-71.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThroughout the southern US, past forest management practices have replaced large areas of native forests with loblolly pine plantations and have resulted in changes in forest response to extreme weather conditions. However, uncertainty remains about the response of planted versus natural species to drought across the geographical range of these forests. Taking advantage of a cluster of unmanaged stands (85–130year-old hardwoods) and managed plantations (17–20year-old loblolly pine) in coastal and Piedmont areas of North Carolina, tree water use, cavitation resistance, whole-tree hydraulic (Ktree) and stomatal (Gs) conductances were measured in four sites covering representative forests growing in the region. We also used a hydraulic model to predict the resilience of those sites to extreme soil drying. Our objectives were to determine: (1) if Ktree and stomatal regulation in response to atmospheric and soil droughts differ between species and sites; (2) how ecosystem type, through tree water use, resistance to cavitation and rooting profiles, affects the water uptake limit that can be reached under drought; and (3) the influence of stand species composition on critical transpiration that sets a functional water uptake limit under drought conditions. The results show that across sites, water stress affected the coordination between Ktree and Gs. As soil water content dropped below 20% relative extractable water, Ktree declined faster and thus explained the decrease in Gs and in its sensitivity to vapor pressure deficit. Compared to branches, the capability of roots to resist high xylem tension has a great impact on tree-level water use and ultimately had important implications for pine plantations resistance to future summer droughts. Model simulations revealed that the decline in Ktree due to xylem cavitation aggravated the effects of soil drying on tree transpiration. The critical transpiration rate (Ecrit), which corresponds to the maximum rate at which transpiration begins to level off to prevent irreversible hydraulic failure, was higher in managed forest plantations than in their unmanaged counterparts. However, even with this higher Ecrit, the pine plantations operated very close to their critical leaf water potentials (i.e. to their permissible water potentials without total hydraulic failure), suggesting that intensively managed plantations are more drought-sensitive and can withstand less severe drought than natural forests.  aPublisher supplied data  cDOE BER-TESdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006206  cDivision of Earth Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000160  cDivision of Integrative Organismal Systemsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000154  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSDA NIFAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus taeda 3abranches 3adrought 3adrying 3aecosystems 3aforest management 3aforest plantations 3aforests 3ahardwood 3aleaf water potential 3apiedmont 3arooting 3aroots 3asimulation models 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aspecies diversity 3astomatal movement 3asummer 3atranspiration 3atrees 3auncertainty 3avapor pressure 3awater stress 3awater uptake 3axylem 3aNorth Carolina 0aCavitation 0aDrought 0aNatural stands 0aPine 0aRoots 0aTranspiration1 aKing, John S.1 aWard, Eric1 aChristopher Oishi, A.1 aPalmroth, Sari1 aRadecki, Andrew1 aBell, Dave M.1 aMiao, Guofang1 aGavazzi, Michael1 aJohnson, Daniel M.1 aMcNulty, Steve G.1 aSun, Ge1 aNoormets, Asko0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 355 p.58-71dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245016800163300001600331500001900347520161600366592002801982650002102010650001102031650001102042650003102053650001802084650001602102650003702118650001902155650002102174650005202195650001002247650001502257650001602272650001902288650002202307650002402329650002002353650002002373653002702393653001602420653001502436653002702451653001202478653000902490653000702499653000902506653000802515653000802523653000802531653000902539653000902548700002002557700001502577700001802592700001802610700001802628773012402646856008502770852000902855655001202864IND60736456120221119164821.0210603e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073645612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2021.04.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuqi10aComparative transcriptome analysis of NaCl and KCl stress response in Malus hupehensis Rehd.

It is sensitive to salt stress, which seriously affects the growth and productivity of apple trees by destroying the homeostasis of Na⁺ and K⁺. Previous studies focused on the molecular mechanism underlying NaCl stress. However, signaling transduction under KCl stress has not been thoroughly studied.We comprehensively analyzed the salt tolerance of Malus hupehensis Rehd., which is a widely used rootstock in apple orchards, by using RNA-Seq. Roots and leaves were treated with NaCl and KCl. Based on mapping analyses, a total of 762 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to NaCl and KCl stress in the roots and leaves were identified. Furthermore, we identified seven hub genes by WGCNA Analysis. The Gene Ontology (GO) terms were enriched in ion transmembrane transporter and oxidoreductase activity under NaCl and KCl stress. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways focused on the plant hormone signal transduction and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. We also screened out 28 candidate genes from 762 DEGs and verified their expression by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). All of these enriched genes were closely related to NaCl and KCl stress and take part in mediating the Na⁺ and K⁺ homeostasis in M. hupehensis.This transcriptome analysis provides a valuable resource for elucidating the signaling pathway of NaCl and KCl stress and is a substantial genetic resource for discovering genes related to the NaCl and KCl stress response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus hupehensis 3aapples 3afruits 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3ahomeostasis 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aplant hormones 3aplant physiology 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3arootstocks 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3astress response 3atranscriptomics 0aMalus hupehensis Rehd. 0aNaCl stress 0aKCl stress 0aNa+ and K+ homeostasis 0aRNA-Seq 0aDEGs 0aGO 0aKEGG 0aROS 0aSOS 0aIBA 0a6-BA 0aFPKM1 aZheng, Xiaodong1 aTian, Yike1 aMa, Changqing1 aYang, Shaolan1 aWang, Caihong0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2021 July, v. 164 p.101-114dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2021.04.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245008500212520164100297592002801938650002301966650001701989650002102006650001202027650002202039650001302061650001302074650002402087650001202111650001902123653001302142653003102155653001902186653001502205653002102220653001502241700006102256700005602317773011302373856008602486852000902572655001202581IND60768904820221121225835.0220523e20220410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076890482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1310532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiurca, Alexandru1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1573-355X10aExploring transformative policy imaginaries for a sustainable Post-COVID society  aThe COVID-19 crisis and its underlying health, socio-economic and environmental challenges warrants a discussion about transformative policies for a more sustainable, post-pandemic world. At EU level, policy packages and initiatives such as the European Green Deal (EGD), the Bioeconomy Strategy (BES) or the Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) may have the prerequisites to support a sustainable socio-economic transformation. But can these initiatives live up to public imaginaries of a sustainable post-pandemic world? To answer this question, we conducted a qualitative media analysis in order to outline emerging public imaginaries, as well as different policy suggestions put forth by different media outlets. We then grouped these imaginaries into seven major themes ranging from finance to resource management and city planning. With the help of the Delphi approach, we discussed these themes with a panel of ten international experts in order to scope for different transformative policy options. The public imaginaries we identified represent a mix of imaginaries underpinned by different political ideologies, economic philosophies and sustainability rationales. The highest expectations were connected to the EGD, although none of the EU policy packages can singlehandedly tackle the urgent sustainability challenges posed by the pandemic. However, the current trajectory of the EGD is geared towards the business-as-usual. We discuss how EU policies can overcome this limitation and imagine more radical transformation pathways in order to jumpstart a sustainable post-COVID recovery that goes beyond pursuing green growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3abioeconomics 3acircular economy 3afinance 3aissues and policy 3apandemic 3apolitics 3aresource management 3asociety 3asocioeconomics 0aCOVID-19 0aSustainability imaginaries 0aMedia analysis 0aBioeconomy 0aCircular economy 0aGreen deal1 aBéfort, Nicolas,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3283-03511 aTaylor, Amos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7193-38580 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Apr. 10, v. 344 p.131053-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1310533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010800174300001400282520151400296592002801810650002501838650001401863650002401877650002201901650001301923650001201936650001201948650001201960650001701972650001201989650002102001651001302022651003702035651001002072653001302082653002002095653001202115653001302127653001002140653001002150700003302160700006302193700003302256700002002289773011402309856008502423852000902508655001202517IND60542589320221119051729.0190403e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054258932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLescuyer, Guillaume10aPromoting Multiple-use Forest Management: Which trade-offs in the timber concessions of Central Africa?  ap. 20-28.  aDespite its inclusion in the forest laws and the support of the international community, Multiple-use Forest Management (MFM) remains poorly implemented in tropical forests. Two specific barriers limit the effectiveness of this approach in the timber concessions of Central Africa. On one hand, formal attempts at MFM are poorly conceived either because they promote forest uses, such as ecological functions or tourism, that have little relevance to direct stakeholders, or because they rely on the legal definition of local users’ rights, which is disconnected to customary rules and practices. The article develops an alternative approach for six timber concessions in Cameroon, Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo, in which the foremost purpose of MFM is to solve or reduce actual conflicts of uses, notably regarding agriculture, hunting, chainsaw milling and firewood collection. On the other hand, the costs of implementing MFM measures are rarely estimated and assigned to concerned actors. The costs of resolving conflicts of use were evaluated in the same concessions, based on consensual solutions elaborated by the logging companies, the forestry and agriculture administrations and the local people. In half of these concessions, the cost of MFM equals or exceeds 1.5 million dollars in the next fifteen years. Several trade-offs are possible between these stakeholders, combining tax relief, technical and financial support to local development, and reduction of some illegal practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3achainsaws 3aecological function 3aforest management 3afuelwood 3afunding 3alogging 3amilling 3astakeholders 3atourism 3atropical forests 3aCameroon 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo 3aGabon 0aConflict 0aSocial forestry 0aLogging 0aCameroon 0aGabon 0aCongo1 aMvongo-Nkene, Mikhail Nelson1 aMonville, Guillaume1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1854-137X1 aElanga-Voundi, Marcien Boris1 aKakundika, Tito0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 349 p.20-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03958naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245018000159300001800339520241100357592002802768650001302796650001502809650002202824650002302846650002102869650001202890650001202902650002202914650001402936650000902950650002002959650002102979650002803000650002103028650001403049650000703063650001203070650001003082650002303092650001103115653002203126653002303148700005103171773015403222856007903376852000903455655001203464IND60688967320221119033642.0200614e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068896732DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2019-176982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaisan, J.14aThe effects of feeding a high-fiber or high-starch pellet at two daily allocations on feed intake patterns, rumen fermentation, and milk production of mid-lactation dairy cows  ap. 6135-6144.  aThe objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of pellet type and feeding amount on feeding behavior, dry matter intake, rumen fermentation, and milk production of lactating dairy cows. An experimental diet was formulated to provide an adequate amount of nutrients to a 650-kg cow producing 40 kg of milk per day, with a portion of the diet removed as a high-fiber (33.2% neutral detergent fiber; F) or high-starch (56.8% starch; S) pellet. Pellets were fed at a low (1 kg; L) or high (3 kg; H) amount twice per day alongside a partial mixed ration (PMR). Four complementary PMR were formulated for each pellet treatment such that the overall diet (pellet + PMR) offered to the cows was the same among all treatments. Eight ruminally cannulated cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 14-d periods. Cows were fed PMR once daily at 1200 h, and pellet twice daily at 0600 and 1800 h. Data and samples were collected on d 11 to 14 of each period. By design there was a difference in pellet intake between the H and L treatments (5.31 vs. 1.81 kg/d), and PMR intake was reduced when H pellet was fed (22.9 vs. 25.3 kg/d); however, feeding H tended to increase total dry matter intake. Feed disappearance, which was measured as the amount of PMR consumed every 3 h following PMR delivery, was affected by the nutrient composition of the PMR as cows fed S (with high-fiber PMR) consumed 28.6% of their PMR intake within 3 h of delivery, whereas cows fed F (with high-starch PMR) consumed 33.5%. Duration that pH was below 5.8 tended to be lower when cows were fed the S pellet (270 vs. 125 min/d) compared with F. In addition, feeding the S pellet (with high-fiber PMR) decreased plasma concentrations of glucose (66.0 vs. 70.0 mg/dL) and insulin (1.90 vs. 2.25 ng/mL) compared with F. These results suggest that the composition of the PMR dictates rumen fermentation to a greater extent than composition of pellets. The S pellet was fed alongside a high-fiber PMR, which was more filling in the rumen, less fermentable, and contained more neutral detergent fiber. Although no difference was observed in milk production among treatments, the fact that feed intake pattern and rumen fermentation are better explained by nutrient composition of the PMR should be considered when formulating diets for lactating cows fed pellet and PMR, such as those milked with automated milking systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acannulas 3adairy cows 3adry matter intake 3aexperimental diets 3afeeding behavior 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3alactating females 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk production 3amilking machines 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3apH 3apellets 3arumen 3arumen fermentation 3astarch 0ahigh-fiber pellet 0ahigh-starch pellet1 aOba, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8057-35000 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 July, v. 103, no. 7 p.6135-6144dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-176983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245009900207300001600306520107300322592002801395650001201423650001201435650001101447700006001458700006001518700002801578700002301606700006501629700006201694700002001756700002201776700006101798700001801859700001701877700002801894700005401922700001901976700001801995773011402013856005102127852000902178655001202187IND60790609220221122222200.0220824e20220819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079060922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.oneear.2022.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, Rachel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8364-183610aEmpowering young people with climate and ocean science: Five strategies for adults to consider  ap. 861-874.  aYoung people are the leaders of the future. Many young people are concerned and overwhelmed about the impacts of climate and ocean change and are emerging as advocates for action. However, challenges including social injustice, climate anxiety, nature disconnectedness, and fake news limit their ability to protect their future from the impacts of climate and ocean change. The conventional dissemination of new scientific knowledge alone is not enough to prepare and empower young people to cope with these challenges. Here, we present five actionable strategies to engage and empower young people with climate and ocean science in support of long-term sustainability: inclusion of diverse voices, active dialogue-based science learning, connection to nature, critical thinking skills, and co-created visions of a sustainable future. These strategies can help to strengthen young people’s engagement and agency to meet climate and ocean challenges. Together, the strategies can synergistically empower young people to have a say in shaping their sustainable future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3aclimate 3apeople1 aElsler, Laura G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5515-08561 aPolejack, Andrei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3549-08691 aVan der Linden, Sander,1 aTönnesson, Kajsa,1 aSchoedinger, Sarah E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2847-08191 aSantoro, Francesca1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5487-56871 aPecl, Gretta T.1 aPalmgren, Michael1 aMariani, Patrizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8015-15831 aGlithero, Diz1 aEvans, Karen1 aCvitanovic, Christopher1 aCook, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8488-67661 aBartram, James1 aWisz, Mary S.0 tOne earth.g2022 Aug. 19, v. 5, no. 8 p.861-874dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:27390x2590-33227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2022.07.007  aDNAL 7aarticle01988naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245022400162300001800386520070700404592002801111650001301139650001701152650004901169650001101218650004401229650001301273650001401286650002001300700001601320700001701336700001401353700001601367773015401383856008001537852000901617655001201626IND60624201920221120093904.0190722e199703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062420192DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10185771115362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMARTIN, H.-P10aConversion process of chlorine containing polysilanes into silicon carbide: Part I Synthesis and crosslinking of poly(chloromethyl)silanes–carbosilanes and their transformation into inorganic amorphous silicon carbide  ap. 1381-1387.  aSynthesis of chlorine containing polysilanes by catalytic redistribution is described and the obtained polymers are characterized by infrared (IR)-, magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR)-spectroscopy and elemental analysis.

We have evaluated some of the factors which may be important for the effectiveness of an antisense CHS gene. Antisense CHS genes encoding half-length or quarter-length RNA complementary to the 3' half of CHS mRNA are able to affect flower pigmentation, while a gene encoding RNA complementary to the 5' half of CHS mRNA did not show phenotypic effects in transgenic petunia plants. We demonstrate that the RNA encoded by the latter gene has a much lower average steady-state level in leaf tissue than the RNAs encoded by the other antisense gene constructs. We have compared the CaMV 35S and endogenous CHS promoter strengths and intrinsic stabilities of sense and antisense CHS RNAs. From the data we conclude that the constitutive antisense CHS genes are not likely to provide an excess of antisense RNA compared to the CHS mRNA derived from the endogenous genes. Effective inhibition of flower pigmentation is also observed when the antisense CHS gene is under control of the homologous CHS promoter. The results indicate that the mechanism of antisense inhibition cannot solely operate via RNA duplex formation between sense and antisense RNA. 3agenetic transformation 3agenetically modified organisms 3amessenger RNA 3aantisense RNA 3apigmentation 3aPetunia hybrida 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aflowers 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3apromoter regions 2aAcyltransferasesxgenetics 2aAntisense Elements (Genetics) 2aGene Expression 2aGenetic Engineering 2aPhenotype 2aPigmentationxgenetics 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 0aPetunia 0ainhibition 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0aantisense genes1 aMur, L.A.1 aLange, P. de.1 aMol, J.N.M.1 aStuitje, A.R.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1990 Apr., v. 14, no. 4 p.457-466x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03128naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245009100146300001400237520150400251650002501755650001201780650001601792650000901808650001901817650002001836650001101856650001401867650002301881650002601904650001801930650001201948650002301960650003701983650004302020650003102063650001002094650002302104650002302127650001602150650001402166650003402180650005502214650003702269653001102306653001402317653001602331653001902347653001602366700001802382700002402400773006102424852000902485939003302494946001102527655001202538IND9105074520221118033231.0911206e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910507452DNAL7 a18960212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoornneef, M.12aA genetic and physiological analysis of late flowering mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 57-66.  aMonogenic mutants of the early ecotype Landsberg erecta were selected on the basis of late flowering under long day (LD) conditions after treatment with ethyl methanesulphonate or irradiation. In addition to later flowering the number of rosette and cauline leaves is proportionally higher in all mutants, although the correlation coefficient between the two parameters is not the same for all genotypes. Forty-two independently induced mutants were found to represent mutations at 11 loci. The mutations were either recessive, intermediate (co locus) or almost completely dominant (fwa locus). The loci are located at distinct positions on four of the five Arabidopsis chromosomes. Recombinants carrying mutations at different loci flower later than or as late as the later parental mutant. This distinction led to the assignment of eight of the loci to three epistatic groups. In wild type, vernalization promotes flowering to a small extent. For mutants at the loci fca, fve, fy, and fpa, vernalization has a large effect both under LD and short day (SD) conditions, whereas co, gi, fd and fwa mutants are almost completely insensitive to this treatment. SD induces later flowering except for mutants at the co and gi loci, which flower with the same number of leaves under LD and SD conditions. This differential response of the mutants to environmental factors and their subdivision into epistatic groups is discussed in relation to a causal model for floral initiation in Arabidopsis thaliana. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amutants 3amutagenesis 3aloci 3aphotoperiodism 3arecessive genes 3aleaves 3aepistasis 3alinkage (genetics) 3agenetic recombination 3avernalization 2aAlleles 2aChromosome Mapping 2aEthyl Methanesulfonatextoxicity 2aGene Expression Regulationxphysiology 2aGenes, Recessivexgenetics 2aLight 2aModels, Biological 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPeriodicity 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aPlantsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aRecombination, Geneticxgenetics 0agroups 0adominance 0asegregation 0aflowering date 0aleaf number1 aHanhart, C.J.1 aVeen, J.H. van der.0 tMGG.g1991 Sept., v. 229, no. 1 p.57-66x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03574naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245015200143300001400295500001500309520145600324650001701780650000901797650002401806650002801830650002601858650002801884650001601912650002501928650001501953650001201968650002701980650002502007650001202032650003202044650001702076650002302093650003302116650002402149650006302173650001802236650002102254650003502275650002802310650002102338650002902359650002402388650003702412650002302449650003602472650004202508650003702550653001202587653003102599653001602630653002802646653001702674653003702691700001702728700001702745773006102762852000902823939003302832946001102865655001202876IND9105074420221118033413.0911206e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910507442DNAL7 a18960202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZimmer, W.10aRelationship between tryptophan biosynthesis and indole-3-acetic acid production in Azospirillum: identification and sequencing of a trpGDC cluster  ap. 41-51.  a2019-12-04  aScreening the tryptophan (Trp)-dependent indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production of different Azospirillum species revealed that A. irakense KA3 released 10 times less IAA into the medium than A. brasilense Sp7. A cosmid library of strain Sp7 was transferred into A. irakense KA3 with the aim of characterizing genes involved in IAA biosynthesis. Trp-dependent IAA production was increased in two transconjugants which both contained an identical 18.5 kb HindIII fragment from Sp7. After Tn5 mutagenesis, cosmids carrying Tn5 insertions at 36 different positions of the 18.5 kb fragment were isolated and transferred into strain KA3. IAA production by the recipient strains was screened by HPLC. The Tn5 insertions of 4 clones with decreased IAA production were mapped on a 2kb SalI-SphI fragment. Recombination of Tn5 insertions at this locus into the genome of strain Sp7 led to Trp auxotrophic mutants. A 5.2 kb EcoRI - SalI fragment including the 2 kb SalI - SphI fragment was sequenced and six open reading frames were identified. Three of them were clustered and their deduced amino acid sequences showed significant similarity to TrpG, TrpD and TrpC, which are enzymes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis. One of the remaining open reading frames probably encodes an acetyltransferase. The region responsible for the enhanced Trp-dependent IAA production in strain KA3 corresponded to trpD, coding for the phosphoribosyl anthranilate transferase. 3abiosynthesis 3aloci 3arestriction mapping 3aAzospirillum amazonense 3aAzospirillum irakense 3aAzospirillum brasilense 3amutagenesis 3aamino acid sequences 3atryptophan 3aligases 3aAzospirillum lipoferum 3anucleotide sequences 3amutants 3aAzospirillum halopraeferens 3atransferases 3aindole acetic acid 2aAcetyltransferasesxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAzospirillum brasilensexenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aRecombination, Geneticxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTryptophanxbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aortho-Aminobenzoatesxmetabolism 0acloning 0aglutamine amidotransferase 0aembl/x57853 0amolecular sequence data 0aAzospirillum 0aindoleglycerolphosphate synthase1 aAparicio, C.1 aElmerich, C.0 tMGG.g1991 Sept., v. 229, no. 1 p.41-51x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02118naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012800126300001800254500001500272520122100287650001401508650001501522650002201537650001101559653001101570700001701581700001801598700001801616700001501634773009001649852000901739939003301748946001101781655001201792IND9105091820221118033401.0911213e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910509182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrussow, H.10aCattle develop neutralizing antibodies to rotavirus serotypes which could not be isolated from faeces of symptomatic calves  ap. 1559-1567.  a2019-12-04  aNeutralizing antibodies against 10 serotypes of rotavirus were measured in sera from different age groups of German cattle.

From these calves, sera 54, 26, 51, 24, 12, 10 and 37, in neutralized addition, the heterologous serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9, respectively. Thirty-eight of 46 rotavirus isolates from Bavarian calves with diarrhoea were serotyped by neutralization: 22, 2 and 14 isolates were typed as serotype 6, serotype 10 (B223) and a newly defined subtype of serotype 10 (V1005), respectively. All serotype 6 isolates and none of the serotype 10 or V1005-like viruses tested hybridized to a NCDV-specific cDNA probe. Eight isolates gave equivocal results by neutralization. We failed however to identify serotype 1, 2, 3, 4 or 8 bovine rotavirus isolates by neutralization with hyperimmune sera and dot blot hybridization with serotype-specific cDNA probes. Thus cross-reacting antibodies in cattle might not represent an anamnestic response, but the recognition of a cross-reacting neutralization epitope shared by many rotavirus serotypes. 3aRotavirus 3aantibodies 3agenetic variation 3acalves 0acattle1 aEichhorn, W.1 aRohwedder, A.1 aSnodgrass, D.1 aSidoti, J.0 tJournal of general virology.g1991 July, v. 72, no. pt.7 p.1559-1567x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04396naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245011700184300001600301500002400317500001500341520209300356650003702449650000902486650002302495650002302518650001402541650002402555650001202579650001002591650002002601650001902621650001402640650001602654650002702670650001402697650001002711650002102721650002002742650001102762650001102773650005302784650002702837650004202864650001502906650001502921650003202936650002002968650003002988650001303018650002903031650003103060650002403091650001603115651002503131653001603156700002303172700001703195700001203212700001603224700001303240700001603253700001703269700001503286700002203301700002303323700003403346700002503380700001803405773011003423852000903533856004803542655001203590IND4426309520221118033052.0090918e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442630952DNAL7 a193377722pmid7 a10.1007/s00394-009-0016-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuyang, Fengxiu10aAssociation of surrogate and direct measures of adiposity with risk of metabolic syndrome in rural Chinese women  ap. 323-332.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBackground Most studies linking obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS) have used body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) to measure obesity. While BMI is correlated with direct measures of total and central adiposity, it is influenced by lean body and bone mass. We hypothesize that direct measures of adiposity may help develop further insight into the link between obesity and MS, thus more accurately identifying individuals at high risk for MS. Aim of the study We examined how surrogate and direct measures of adiposity were associated with MS risk and if direct adiposity measures enhanced BMI and WC identification of MS risk. Methods 3,734 Chinese female twins aged 20-39 years were studied. Percent body fat (%BF) and proportion of trunk fat to total BF (%TF) were assessed by DEXA. Graphic plots and generalized estimating equations were used to examine the associations of adiposity measures with MS and its components. Concordance of adiposity measures and MS abnormalities between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs were compared. Results The prevalence of MS increased for high BMI (>=23 kg/m²), %BF (>=32), WC (>=80 cm), and (to a lesser degree) %TF (>=50). Below those thresholds, the prevalence of MS was low (0-5.3%). %TF was independently associated with higher risk of MS and its components even after adjusting for BMI and WC. As a result, among women with normal BMI and WC, high %TF was associated with 1.3-2.0-fold elevated risk of MS components. In contrast, women with high BMI but normal WC and %TF neither have significantly increased risk of MS, nor for any component other than high BP. MZ twins showed higher concordance for MS and its components than DZ twins. Conclusions In this lean Chinese rural female sample, BMI >= 23 and WC >= 80 were associated with a markedly increased risk of MS, which was further enhanced by elevated %TF. Even in women with a normal BMI and WC, %TF was independently associated with MS and its components. Twin analysis findings suggest that adiposity measurements and MS risk are influenced by genetics. 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3arisk 3ametabolic syndrome 3aat-risk population 3aequations 3awaist circumference 3aobesity 3atwins 3abody mass index 3alean body mass 3aadiposity 3arural women 2aAbsorptiometry, Photon 2aAdiposity 2aAdult 2aBody Composition 2aBody Mass Index 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMetabolic Syndromexcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aObesityxcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aOdds Ratio 2aPrevalence 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Assessment 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 2aThinness 2aTwins, Dizygoticxblood. 2aTwins, Monozygoticxblood. 2aWaist Circumference 2aYoung Adult 0aChinaxepidemiology. 0arisk groups1 aNecheles, Jonathan1 aWang, Binyan1 aMa, Wei1 aLi, Zhiping1 aLiu, Xue1 aTang, Genfu1 aXing, Houxun1 aXu, Xiping1 aVenners, Scott A.1 aBrickman, Wendy J.1 aChristoffel, Katherine Kaufer1 aZimmerman, Donald E.1 aWang, Xiaobin0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2009 Sept., v. 48, no. 6 p.323-332dD.

The tolerance of the P. interpunctella stocks ranged from quite low to very high, the most tolerant individuals requiring a ct product of 280 mg hr/l. for complete kill. Some changes were evident in the individual tolerances of six stocks of this species over a 6 yr period, probably as a result of a set laboratory rearing procedure. The two stocks of E. cautella both showed a moderate degree of tolerance, all larvae dying at concentration time (ct) products of 150 mg hr/l. or above at 15 degrees C. Taking all results together, a significant direct correlation was established between either mean or maximum duration of diapause and the LD50, 90 or 99, obtained for methyl bromide. Thus the longer the duration of diapause in these moths, the higher was the tolerance shown to methyl bromide. An increase in the mean duration of diapause from < 50 to > 80 days was accompanied by an increase in the LD99 from < 130 to > 210 mg hr/l. 3aPlodia interpunctella 3aCadra cautella 3adiapause 3alarvae 3amortality 3astorage pests 3ainsect control 3amethyl bromide 0atolerance1 aSavvidou, N.0 tJournal of stored products research.g1991 Apr., v. 27, no. 2 p.109-114x0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02115naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245014000131300001500271520102600286650001701312650002001329650000801349650001401357650001801371650001901389650003401408650001101442650002201453650001601475650001201491650001901503653003001522700001701552700001501569773009201584852000901676939003301685946001101718655001201729IND9105025720221118033111.0911210e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910502572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoderstrom, E.L.10aResponses of Cydia pomonella (L.)

At 25 degrees C and 95% r.h., O2, concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5% (in nitrogen) produced LT95s of 1.2, 1.7, 1.6, 1.7, and 24.4 days, respectively. Pure nitrogen was significantly more effective than the other O2 deficient atmospheres. Carbon dioxide concentrations of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% (in air) produced LT95s of 3.6, 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.4 days, respectively. Only 20% CO2 induced significantly less mortality than the higher concentrations. Regression parameters for each atmosphere are given. Combining O2 deficient with CO2 enriched atmospheres did not increase C. pomonella egg mortality over that of the atmospheres used alone. Sublethal concentrations of CO2 enriched atmospheres altered C. pomonella reproductive capacity. Carbon dioxide concentrations of 40% or more reduced adult survival and reduced surviving adults ability to mate. 3areproduction 3aCydia pomonella 3aova 3amortality 3astorage pests 3ainsect control 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3aoxygen 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3awalnuts 3acarbon dioxide 0acarbon dioxide enrichment1 aBrandl, D.G.1 aMackey, B.0 tJournal of stored products research.g1991 Apr., v. 27, no. 2 p.95-101x0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01901naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008500128300001600213500001500229520089800244650002801142650001501170650001301185650002501198650001001223650002701233650001401260650001401274650002301288653001901311653002401330653001101354700001601365773009301381852000901474939003301483946001101516655001201527IND9105026020221118032828.0911210e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910502602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHocking, A.D.10aEffects of phosphine fumigation on survival and growth of storage fungi in wheat  ap. 115-120.  a2019-12-04  aWheat of 0.80 water activity (aw) (16.2% m.c.) and 0.86 aw (18.3% m.c.) was inoculated with Eurotium chevalieri, Aspergillus flavus or A. parasiticus and exposed to 0.1 g phosphine m-3 for 2 weeks at 28 degrees C. Control samples were exposed to air under the same conditions. The fungal flora was determined before and after all treatments. Storage of the moist grain in phosphine rather than air led to a less rapid development of most storage fungi, but did not prevent growth completely. The level of inhibition observed suggests that phosphine may be useful in retarding fungal spoilage during short-term storage of high moisture grain (15-19% m.c. for wheat). Phosphine at 0.1 g m-3 caused only a slight decrease in populations of fungi that were unable to grow at the aw of the stored grain, indicating that phosphine has only a small effect on non-growing mycelium and dormant conidia. 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3afumigation 3aEurotium 3apostharvest diseases 3awheat 3aAspergillus chevalieri 3aphosphine 3amortality 3aAspergillus flavus 0afungus control 0aEurotium chevalieri 0agrowth1 aBanks, H.J.0 tJournal of stored products research.g1991 Apr., v. 27, no. 2 p.115-120x0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02342naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245008200210506007600292520097200368506003701340650001101377650001301388650001201401650001001413650001501423650001601438650001601454650002001470650001701490650001201507700001801519700002801537700003001565700002101595700002101616700002101637700001701658773005401675852000901729856008801738930003301826946001301859655001201872IND4438279120221207121042.0100610e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443827912DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00107382doi7 aPMC28770812pmcid7 a205208132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWikelski, Martin10aLarge-Range Movements of Neotropical Orchid Bees Observed via Radio Telemetry  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNeotropical orchid bees (Euglossini) are often cited as classic examples of trapline-foragers with potentially extensive foraging ranges. If long-distance movements are habitual, rare plants in widely scattered locations may benefit from euglossine pollination services. Here we report the first successful use of micro radio telemetry to track the movement of an insect pollinator in a complex and forested environment. Our results indicate that individual male orchid bees (Exaerete frontalis) habitually use large rainforest areas (at least 42–115 ha) on a daily basis. Aerial telemetry located individuals up to 5 km away from their core areas, and bees were often stationary, for variable periods, between flights to successive localities. These data suggest a higher degree of site fidelity than what may be expected in a free living male bee, and has implications for our understanding of biological activity patterns and the evolution of forest pollinators.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aApidae 3aforaging 3ainsects 3amales 3aphilopatry 3apollination 3apollinators 3aradio telemetry 3arain forests 3atropics1 aMoxley, Jerry1 aEaton-Mordas, Alexander1 aLopez-Uribe, Margarita M.1 aHolland, Richard1 aMoskowitz, David1 aRoubik, David W.1 aKays, Roland0 tPloS one.g2010 May, v. 5, no. 5x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00107383Available from publisher's Web site  a20100610b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03126naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100001500189245010600204506007600310520172000386506003702106650002202143650001202165650001802177650002002195650001402215650002202229650003302251650001402284650002502298650001702323651001002340700001902350700001602369700001502385700002002400700002202420700001702442773005402459852000902513856008802522930003302610946001302643655001202656IND4438281320221207121045.0100610e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443828132DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00106842doi7 aPMC28726712pmcid7 a205026962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mochan10aGenetic Diversity of Dahongjun, the Commercially Important “Big Red Mushroom” from Southern China  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: In southern China, a wild ectomycorrhizal mushroom commonly called “Dahongjun” or “Big Red Mushroom” by the local residents, has been harvested, consumed, and/or exported as an exotic food for many years. Although ecologically and economically important, very little is known about this mushroom, including its diversity and population structure. Methodology and Principal Findings: In this study, we analyzed 122 samples from five local populations representing the known distribution ranges of this mushroom in southern China. We investigated the genetic diversity and geographic structure of this mushroom using sequences from four DNA fragments. Our analyses identified that this mushroom contained at least three divergent lineages: one corresponds to a recently described species Russula griseocarnosa from southern China and the remaining two likely represent two novel species. While these lineages were prominently structured geographically based on ITS sequences, evidence for ancient and/or recent gene flow was also identified within individual lineages. In addition, a local population from Ailaoshan in central Yunnan Province where 85 of our 122 specimens came from showed clear evidence of recombination. Conclusion and Significance: The ectomycorrhizal mushroom “Dahongjun” from southern China is a species complex with at least three divergent lineages. These lineages are largely geographically structured and there is evidence for recombination in nature. Our results indicate mature Dahongjun mushrooms with abundant basidiospores are important for the reproduction of this mushroom in nature and that individual populations of this species should be managed separately.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA fragmentation 3aRussula 3abasidiospores 3aectomycorrhizae 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amushrooms 3apopulation structure 3areproduction 3aChina1 aLiang, Junfeng1 aLi, Yanchun1 aFeng, Bang1 aYang, Zhu-Liang1 aJames, Timothy Y.1 aXu, Jianping0 tPloS one.g2010 May, v. 5, no. 5x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00106843Available from publisher's Web site  a20100610b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02389naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100002500189245009600214506007600310520106000386506003701446650002201483650001201505650001001517650001501527650001201542650001901554650001201573650001301585650002401598650001401622650001801636650001101654650001101665700001901676700001801695700002101713773005401734852000901788856008801797930003301885946001301918655001201931IND4438281720221207121043.0100610e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443828172DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00107032doi7 aPMC28726742pmcid7 a205026992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDieterle, Michael G.10aCharacterization of the Temperature-Sensitive Mutations un-7 and png-1 in Neurospora crassa  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa has been studied for over fifty years and many temperature-sensitive mutants have been generated. While most of these have been mapped genetically, many remain anonymous. The mutation in the N. crassa temperature-sensitive lethal mutant un-7 was identified by a complementation based approach as being in the open reading frame designated NCU00651 on linkage group I. Other mutations in this gene have been identified that lead to a temperature-sensitive morphological phenotype called png-1. The mutations underlying un-7 result in a serine to phenylalanine change at position 273 and an isoleucine to valine change at position 390, while the mutation in png-1 was found to result in a serine to leucine change at position 279 although there were other conservative changes in this allele.

Even so, Polistes colonies have a temporal pattern in which most female larvae reared by the foundress become workers, and most reared by workers become future-reproductive gynes. This pattern is hypothesized to reflect development onto two pathways, which may utilize mechanisms that regulate diapause in other insects. Using expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for Polistes metricus we selected candidate genes differentially expressed in other insects in three categories: 1) diapause vs. non-diapause phenotypes and/or worker vs. queen differentiation, 2) behavioral subcastes of worker honey bees, and 3) no a priori expectation of a role in worker/gyne development. We also used a non-targeted proteomics screen to test for peptide/protein abundance differences that could reflect larval developmental divergence. We found that foundress-reared larvae (putative worker-destined) and worker-reared larvae (putative gyne-destined) differed in quantitative expression of sixteen genes, twelve of which were associated with caste and/or diapause in other insects, and they also differed in abundance of nine peptides/proteins. Some differentially-expressed genes are involved in diapause regulation in other insects, and other differentially-expressed genes and proteins are involved in the insulin signaling pathway, nutrient metabolism, and caste determination in highly social bees. Differential expression of a gene and a peptide encoding hexameric storage proteins is especially noteworthy. Although not conclusive, our results support hypotheses of 1) larval developmental pathway divergence that can lead to caste bias in adults and 2) nutritional differences as the foundation of the pathway divergence. Finally, the differential expression in Polistes larvae of genes and proteins also differentially expressed during queen vs. worker caste development in honey bees may indicate that regulatory mechanisms of caste outcomes share similarities between primitively eusocial and advanced eusocial Hymenoptera.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asignal transduction 3apeptides 3aworker honey bees 3aPolistes metricus 3aadults 3aphenotype 3adiapause 3asocial behavior 3agene expression regulation 3afemales 3astorage proteins 3acaste determination 3amodels 3ainsulin 3alarvae 3aproteomics 3aprotein synthesis 3arearing 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aApoidea 0agenes1 aWolschin, Florian1 aHenshaw, Michael T.1 aNewman, Thomas C.1 aToth, Amy L.1 aAmdam, Gro V.0 tPloS one.g2010 May, v. 5, no. 5x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00106743Available from publisher's Web site  a20100610b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03315naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100003200189245014500221506007600366520158300442506003702025650002202062650000802084650001302092650002002105650001302125650002002138650001002158650001802168650002402186650001902210650001102229650001202240650000902252650001402261650001302275650002102288650001802309650005202327650001602379650001302395650001202408700002402420700002802444700001702472700002402489700002702513773005402540852000902594856008802603930003302691946001302724655001202737IND4438282120221207121058.0100610e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443828212DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00106452doi7 aPMC28710372pmcid7 a204987172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornelissen, Lisette A.H.M.12aA Single Immunization with Soluble Recombinant Trimeric Hemagglutinin Protects Chickens against Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus H5N1  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 causes multi-organ disease and death in poultry, resulting in significant economic losses in the poultry industry. In addition, it poses a major public health threat as it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans with very high (60%) mortality rate. Effective vaccination against HPAI H5N1 would protect commercial poultry and would thus provide an important control measure by reducing the likelihood of bird-to-bird and bird-to-human transmission. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study we evaluated the vaccine potential of recombinant soluble trimeric subtype 5 hemagglutinin (sH53) produced in mammalian cells. The secreted, purified sH53 was biologically active as demonstrated by its binding to ligands in a sialic acid-dependent manner. It was shown to protect chickens, in a dose-dependent manner, against a lethal challenge with H5N1 after a single vaccination. Protected animals did not shed challenge virus as determined by a quantitative RT-PCR on RNA isolated from trachea and cloaca swabs. Also in mice, vaccination with sH53 provided complete protection against challenge with HPAI H5N1. Conclusions/Significance: Our results demonstrate that sH53 constitutes an attractive vaccine antigen for protection of chickens and mammals against HPAI H5N1. As these recombinant soluble hemagglutinin preparations can be produced with high yields and with relatively short lead time, they enable a rapid response to circulating and potentially pandemic influenza viruses.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfluenza A virus 3aRNA 3aantigens 3aavian influenza 3achickens 3acontrol methods 3adeath 3adose response 3afinancial economics 3ahemagglutinins 3ahumans 3aligands 3amice 3amortality 3apandemic 3apoultry industry 3apublic health 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviruses1 aVries, Robert P. de1 aBoer-Luijtze, Els A. de1 aRigter, Alan1 aRottier, Peter J.M.1 aHaan, Cornelis A.M. de0 tPloS one.g2010 May, v. 5, no. 5x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00106453Available from publisher's Web site  a20100610b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03490naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100001400189245014000203506007600343520186200419506003702281650001002318650000802328650002202336650002502358650001702383650002502400650001202425650001702437650001302454650001002467650001702477650001202494650001402506650002102520650001702541650002202558650000902580650001002589700001902599700002402618700002302642700002202665700002302687700002902710773005402739852000902793856008802802930003302890946001302923655001202936IND4438282920221207120114.0100610e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443828292DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00105722doi7 aPMC28680252pmcid7 a204855032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jinze10aBeneficial Effects of a Q-ter Based Nutritional Mixture on Functional Performance, Mitochondrial Function, and Oxidative Stress in Rats  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are central mechanisms underlying the aging process and the pathogenesis of many age-related diseases. Selected antioxidants and specific combinations of nutritional compounds could target many biochemical pathways that affect both oxidative stress and mitochondrial function and, thereby, preserve or enhance physical performance. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we evaluated the potential anti-aging benefits of a Q-ter based nutritional mixture (commercially known as Eufortyn) mainly containing the following compounds: terclatrated coenzyme Q10 (Q-ter), creatine and a standardized ginseng extract. We found that Eufortyn supplementation significantly ameliorated the age-associated decreases in grip strength and gastrocnemius subsarcolemmal mitochondria Ca2+ retention capacity when initiated in male Fischer344 x Brown Norway rats at 21 months, but not 29 months, of age. Moreover, the increases in muscle RNA oxidation and subsarcolemmal mitochondrial protein carbonyl levels, as well as the decline of total urine antioxidant power, which develop late in life, were mitigated by Eufortyn supplementation in rats at 29 months of age. Conclusions/Significance: These data imply that Eufortyn is efficacious in reducing oxidative damage, improving the age-related mitochondrial functional decline, and preserving physical performance when initiated in animals at early midlife (21 months). The efficacy varied, however, according to the age at which the supplementation was provided, as initiation in late middle age (29 months) was incapable of restoring grip strength and mitochondrial function. Therefore, the Eufortyn® supplementation may be particularly beneficial when initiated prior to major biological and functional declines that appear to occur with advancing age.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPanax 3aRNA 3aRattus norvegicus 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiochemical pathways 3acalcium 3acoenzyme Q10 3acreatine 3amales 3amitochondria 3amuscles 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3aphysical activity 3arats 3aurine1 aSeo, Arnold Y.1 aVorobyeva, Darya A.1 aCarter, Christy S.1 aAnton, Stephen D.1 aLezza, Angela M.S.1 aLeeuwenburgh, Christiaan0 tPloS one.g2010 May, v. 5, no. 5x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00105723Available from publisher's Web site  a20100610b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03367naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100002600189245014600215506007600361520208100437506003702518650000802555650001402563650001202577650001002589650001002599650001302609650001602622650002502638650001002663650001402673651001802687700002402705700001902729773005402748852000902802856008802811930003302899946001302932655001202945IND4438283520221207121059.0100610e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443828352DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00103882doi7 aPMC28665372pmcid7 a204798842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDerkarabetian, Shahan10aRepeated and Time-Correlated Morphological Convergence in Cave-Dwelling Harvestmen (Opiliones, Laniatores) from Montane Western North America  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Many cave-dwelling animal species display similar morphologies (troglomorphism) that have evolved convergent within and among lineages under the similar selective pressures imposed by cave habitats. Here we study such ecomorphological evolution in cave-dwelling Sclerobuninae harvestmen (Opiliones) from the western United States, providing general insights into morphological homoplasy, rates of morphological change, and the temporal context of cave evolution. Methodology/Principal Findings: We gathered DNA sequence data from three independent gene regions, and combined these data with Bayesian hypothesis testing, morphometrics analysis, study of penis morphology, and relaxed molecular clock analyses. Using multivariate morphometric analysis, we find that phylogenetically unrelated taxa have convergently evolved troglomorphism; alternative phylogenetic hypotheses involving less morphological convergence are not supported by Bayesian hypothesis testing. In one instance, this morphology is found in specimens from a high-elevation stony debris habitat, suggesting that troglomorphism can evolve in non-cave habitats. We discovered a strong positive relationship between troglomorphy index and relative divergence time, making it possible to predict taxon age from morphology. Most of our time estimates for the origin of highly-troglomorphic cave forms predate the Pleistocene. Conclusions/Significance: While several regions in the eastern and central United States are well-known hotspots for cave evolution, few modern phylogenetic studies have addressed the evolution of cave-obligate species in the western United States. Our integrative studies reveal the recurrent evolution of troglomorphism in a perhaps unexpected geographic region, at surprisingly deep time depths, and in sometimes surprising habitats. Because some newly discovered troglomorphic populations represent undescribed species, our findings stress the need for further biological exploration, integrative systematic research, and conservation efforts in western US cave habitats.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aOpiliones 3aanimals 3acaves 3agenes 3ahabitats 3amorphometry 3anucleotide sequences 3apenis 3aphylogeny 3aUnited States1 aSteinmann, David B.1 aHedin, Marshal0 tPloS one.g2010 May, v. 5, no. 5x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00103883Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01839naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245010900213506007600322520073700398506003701135650001501172650002301187650002001210650002001230650001801250650001301268700002001281700002201301773005601323852000901379856008801388946001301476655001201489IND4438983920221207101148.0100625e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443898392DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00080632doi7 aPMC27781292pmcid7 a199566832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShepherd, Andrew K.10aNotch mRNA Expression in Drosophila Embryos Is Negatively Regulated at the Level of mRNA 3′ Processing  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNotch receptor regulates differentiation of almost all tissues and organs during animal development. Many mechanisms function at the protein level to finely regulate Notch activity. Here we provide evidence for Notch regulation at an earlier step - mRNA 3′ processing. Processing at the Notch consensus polyadenylation site appears by default to be suppressed in Drosophila embryos. Interference with this suppression, by a mutation, results in increased levels of polyadenylated Notch mRNA, excess Notch signaling, and severe developmental defects. We propose that Notch mRNA 3′ processing is negatively regulated to limit the production of Notch protein and render it a controlling factor in the generation of Notch signaling.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aanimal development 3aembryo (animal) 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3amutation1 aSingh, Ravinder1 aWesley, Cedric S.0 tPloS one.g2009 Nov., v. 4, no. 11x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00080633Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03206naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245013800212506007600350520188100426506003702307650001802344650002102362650002002383650002102403650001202424650001902436650000702455650002402462650001402486700001802500700001202518700001902530700001702549700002002566700002002586773005602606852000902662856008802671946001302759655001202772IND4438984020221207101240.0100625e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443898402DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00080062doi7 aPMC27785532pmcid7 a199566312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeite, Ney Ribeiro10aStructure of an Odorant-Binding Protein from the Mosquito Aedes aegypti Suggests a Binding Pocket Covered by a pH-Sensitive “Lid”  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: The yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is the primary vector for the viruses that cause yellow fever, mostly in tropical regions of Africa and in parts of South America, and human dengue, which infects 100 million people yearly in the tropics and subtropics. A better understanding of the structural biology of olfactory proteins may pave the way for the development of environmentally-friendly mosquito attractants and repellents, which may ultimately contribute to reduction of mosquito biting and disease transmission. Methodology: Previously, we isolated and cloned a major, female-enriched odorant-binding protein (OBP) from the yellow fever mosquito, AaegOBP1, which was later inadvertently renamed AaegOBP39. We prepared recombinant samples of AaegOBP1 by using an expression system that allows proper formation of disulfide bridges and generates functional OBPs, which are indistinguishable from native OBPs. We crystallized AaegOBP1 and determined its three-dimensional structure at 1.85 Å resolution by molecular replacement based on the structure of the malaria mosquito OBP, AgamOBP1, the only mosquito OBP structure known to date. Conclusion: The structure of AaegOBP1 (=AaegOBP39) shares the common fold of insect OBPs with six α-helices knitted by three disulfide bonds. A long molecule of polyethylene glycol (PEG) was built into the electron-density maps identified in a long tunnel formed by a crystallographic dimer of AaegOBP1. Circular dichroism analysis indicated that delipidated AaegOBP1 undergoes a pH-dependent conformational change, which may lead to release of odorant at low pH (as in the environment in the vicinity of odorant receptors). A C-terminal loop covers the binding cavity and this “lid” may be opened by disruption of an array of acid-labile hydrogen bonds thus explaining reduced or no binding affinity at low pH.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3abinding capacity 3adisulfide bonds 3ahydrogen bonding 3ainsects 3aodor compounds 3apH 3apolyethylene glycol 3areceptors1 aKrogh, Renata1 aXu, Wei1 aIshida, Yūko.1 aIulek, Jorge1 aLeal, Walter S.1 aOliva, Glaucius0 tPloS one.g2009 Nov., v. 4, no. 11x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00080063Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02610naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100001500189245010600204506007600310520142200386506003701808650002601845650002801871650001801899650002201917650001901939650002201958650001101980700001601991700001702007700001602024700001802040773005602058852000902114856008802123946001302211655001202224IND4438983820221207101154.0100625e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443898382DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00080612doi7 aPMC27788702pmcid7 a199566402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Junbin14aThe Crystal Structures of Yeast Get3 Suggest a Mechanism for Tail-Anchored Protein Membrane Insertion  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTail-anchored (TA) proteins represent a unique class of membrane proteins that contain a single C-terminal transmembrane helix. The post-translational insertion of the yeast TA proteins into the ER membrane requires the Golgi ER trafficking (GET) complex which contains Get1, Get2 and Get3. Get3 is an ATPase that recognizes and binds the C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) of the TA proteins. We have determined the crystal structures of Get3 from two yeast species, S. cerevisiae and D. hansenii, respectively. These high resolution crystal structures show that Get3 contains a nucleotide-binding domain and a “finger” domain for binding the TA protein TMD. A large hydrophobic groove on the finger domain of S. cerevisiae Get3 structure might represent the binding site for TMD of TA proteins. A hydrophobic helix from a symmetry-related Get3 molecule sits in the TMD-binding groove and mimics the TA binding scenario. Interestingly, the crystal structures of the Get3 dimers from S. cerevisiae and D. hansenii exhibit distinct conformations. The S. cerevisiae Get3 dimer structure does not contain nucleotides and maintains an “open” conformation, while the D. hansenii Get3 dimer structure binds ADP and stays in a “closed” conformation. We propose that the conformational changes to switch the Get3 between the open and closed conformations may facilitate the membrane insertions for TA proteins.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abinding sites 3acrystal structure 3ahydrophobicity 3amembrane proteins 3ayeasts1 aLi, Jingzhi1 aQian, Xinguo1 aDenic, Vlad1 aSha, Bingdong0 tPloS one.g2009 Nov., v. 4, no. 11x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00080613Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02768naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100001800189245009100207506007600298520158200374506003701956650002201993650001402015650001302029650001502042650002302057650002202080650002102102650002302123650001902146700002002165773005402185852000902239856008802248930003302336946001302369655001202382IND4438285220221207101239.0100610e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443828522DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00104292doi7 aPMC28627062pmcid7 a204546582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLind, Eric M.10aNovel Weapons Testing: Are Invasive Plants More Chemically Defended than Native Plants  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Exotic species have been hypothesized to successfully invade new habitats by virtue of possessing novel biochemistry that repels native enemies. Despite the pivotal long-term consequences of invasion for native food-webs, to date there are no experimental studies examining directly whether exotic plants are any more or less biochemically deterrent than native plants to native herbivores. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a direct test of this hypothesis using herbivore feeding assays with chemical extracts from 19 invasive plants and 21 co-occurring native plants, we show that invasive plant biochemistry is no more deterrent (on average) to a native generalist herbivore than extracts from native plants. There was no relationship between extract deterrence and length of time since introduction, suggesting that time has not mitigated putative biochemical novelty. Moreover, the least deterrent plant extracts were from the most abundant species in the field, a pattern that held for both native and exotic plants. Analysis of chemical deterrence in context with morphological defenses and growth-related traits showed that native and exotic plants had similar trade-offs among traits. Conclusions/Significance: Overall, our results suggest that particular invasive species may possess deterrent secondary chemistry, but it does not appear to be a general pattern resulting from evolutionary mismatches between exotic plants and native herbivores. Thus, fundamentally similar processes may promote the ecological success of both native and exotic species.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical analysis 3afood webs 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3aplant biochemistry 3aplant extracts1 aParker, John D.0 tPloS one.g2010 May, v. 5, no. 5x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00104293Available from publisher's Web site  a20100610b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02152naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245008000209506007600289520080900365506003701174650001601211650002801227650001101255650002301266650002201289650002001311650001001331650001201341650001101353650001201364650001301376650004301389650001401432700001701446700002001463700002101483700002401504773005601528852000901584856008801593946001301681655001201694IND4438984420221207101229.0100625e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443898442DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00080302doi7 aPMC27775092pmcid7 a199466252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgura, Takehiko10aIdentification and Expression Analysis of Ras Gene in Silkworm, Bombyx mori  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRas proteins play important roles in development especially for cell proliferation and differentiation in various organisms. However, their functions in the most insect species are still not clear. We identified three ras cDNAs from the silk worm, Bombyx mori. These sequences corresponded to three Ras of Drosophila melanogaster, but not to three mammalian Ras (H-Ras, K-Ras, N-Ras). Subsequently, the expression profiles of ras were investigated by quantitative real-time PCR using whole body of individuals from the embryonic to adult stages, and various tissues of 4th and 5th instar larvae. Each of three Bombyx ras showed different expression patterns. We also showed membrane localization of their products. These results indicate that the three Bombyx Ras are functional and have different roles.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBombyx mori 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aadults 3acell proliferation 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amammals 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asilkworms1 aTan, Anjiang1 aTsubota, Takuya1 aNakakura, Takayo1 aShiotsuki, Takahiro0 tPloS one.g2009 Nov., v. 4, no. 11x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00080303Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02718naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245014500212506007600357520122000433506003701653650002201690650002301712650001301735650001001748650000901758650002601767650002201793650001901815650001201834650001101846650001401857650002201871650001501893700002201908700002001930700002501950700002101975700001801996700002102014700002302035773005602058852000902114856008802123946001302211655001202224IND4438985920221207101240.0100625e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443898592DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00078962doi7 aPMC27759112pmcid7 a199362492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPennetier, Cédric10aSynergy between Repellents and Organophosphates on Bed Nets: Efficacy and Behavioural Response of Natural Free-Flying An. gambiae Mosquitoes  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Chemicals are used on bed nets in order to prevent infected bites and to kill aggressive malaria vectors. Because pyrethroid resistance has become widespread in the main malaria vectors, research for alternative active ingredients becomes urgent. Mixing a repellent and a non-pyrethroid insecticide seemed to be a promising tool as mixtures in the laboratory showed the same features as pyrethroids. Methodology/Principal Findings: We present here the results of two trials run against free-flying Anopheles gambiae populations comparing the effects of two insect repellents (either DEET or KBR 3023, also known as icaridin) and an organophosphate insecticide at low-doses (pirimiphos-methyl, PM) used alone and in combination on bed nets. We showed that mixtures of PM and the repellents induced higher exophily, blood feeding inhibition and mortality among wild susceptible and resistant malaria vectors than compounds used alone. Nevertheless the synergistic interactions are only involved in the high mortality induced by the two mixtures. Conclusion: These field trials argue in favour of the strategy of mixing repellent and organophosphate on bed nets to better control resistant malaria vectors.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aactive ingredients 3abed nets 3ablood 3adeet 3afield experimentation 3ainsect repellents 3ainsect vectors 3amalaria 3amixing 3amortality 3apirimiphos-methyl 3apyrethrins1 aCostantini, Carlo1 aCorbel, Vincent1 aLicciardi, Séverine1 aDabiré, Roch K.1 aLapied, Bruno1 aChandre, Fabrice1 aHougard, Jean-Marc0 tPloS one.g2009 Nov., v. 4, no. 11x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00078963Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03798naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100002500189245015200214506007600366520214200442506003702584650001302621650001302634650001302647650002302660650002402683650002102707650002402728650002402752650000902776650001102785650002102796650001602817650001202833650001302845650001702858650001402875650002102889650001402910650003502924700001902959700002302978700002303001700001803024700001403042700002203056773005603078852000903134856008803143946001303231655001203244IND4438987120221207101142.0100625e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443898712DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00077962doi7 aPMC27713592pmcid7 a199076582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntão, Esther-Maria10aSignature-Tagged Mutagenesis in a Chicken Infection Model Leads to the Identification of a Novel Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli Fimbrial Adhesin  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe extraintestinal pathogen, avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), known to cause systemic infections in chickens, is responsible for large economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. In order to identify genes involved in the early essential stages of pathogenesis, namely adhesion and colonization, Signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) was applied to a previously established lung colonization model of infection by generating and screening a total of 1,800 mutants of an APEC strain IMT5155 (O2:K1:H5; Sequence type complex 95). The study led to the identification of new genes of interest, including two adhesins, one of which coded for a novel APEC fimbrial adhesin (Yqi) not described for its role in APEC pathogenesis to date. Its gene product has been temporarily designated ExPEC Adhesin I (EA/I) until the adhesin-specific receptor is identified. Deletion of the ExPEC adhesin I gene resulted in reduced colonization ability by APEC strain IMT5155 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, complementation of the adhesin gene restored its ability to colonize epithelial cells in vitro. The ExPEC adhesin I protein was successfully expressed in vitro. Electron microscopy of an afimbriate strain E. coli AAEC189 over-expressed with the putative EA/I gene cluster revealed short fimbrial-like appendages protruding out of the bacterial outer membrane. We observed that this adhesin coding gene yqi is prevalent among extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) isolates, including APEC (54.4%), uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) (65.9%) and newborn meningitic E. coli (NMEC) (60.0%), and absent in all of the 153 intestinal pathogenic E. coli strains tested, thereby validating the designation of the adhesin as ExPEC Adhesin I. In addition, prevalence of EA/I was most frequently associated with the B2 group of the EcoR classification and ST95 complex of the multi locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme, with evidence of a positive selection within this highly pathogenic complex. This is the first report of the newly identified and functionally characterized ExPEC adhesin I and its significant role during APEC infection in chickens.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesins 3aadhesion 3achickens 3acolonizing ability 3aelectron microscopy 3aepithelial cells 3afinancial economics 3agene overexpression 3aloci 3amodels 3amultigene family 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aneonates 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3apoultry industry 3ascreening 3auropathogenic Escherichia coli1 aEwers, Christa1 aGürlebeck, Doreen1 aPreisinger, Rudolf1 aHomeier, Timo1 aLi, Ganwu1 aWieler, Lothar H.0 tPloS one.g2009 Nov., v. 4, no. 11x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00077963Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03017naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245005800213506007600271520182400347506003702171650000802208650002002216650002902236650001702265650001602282650001102298650001102309650002302320650002902343650001102372700002202383700002102405700001602426773005502442852000902497856008802506946001302594655001202607IND4439197320221207101228.0100628e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443919732DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00102032doi7 aPMC28605122pmcid7 a204369192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpiesser, Thomas W.10aWhat Influences DNA Replication Rate in Budding Yeast  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: DNA replication begins at specific locations called replication origins, where helicase and polymerase act in concert to unwind and process the single DNA filaments. The sites of active DNA synthesis are called replication forks. The density of initiation events is low when replication forks travel fast, and is high when forks travel slowly. Despite the potential involvement of epigenetic factors, transcriptional regulation and nucleotide availability, the causes of differences in replication times during DNA synthesis have not been established satisfactorily, yet. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we aimed at quantifying to which extent sequence properties contribute to the DNA replication time in budding yeast. We interpreted the movement of the replication machinery along the DNA template as a directed random walk, decomposing influences on DNA replication time into sequence-specific and sequence-independent components. We found that for a large part of the genome the elongation time can be well described by a global average replication rate, thus by a single parameter. However, we also showed that there are regions within the genomic landscape of budding yeast with highly specific replication rates, which cannot be explained by global properties of the replication machinery. Conclusion/Significance: Computational models of DNA replication in budding yeast that can predict replication dynamics have rarely been developed yet. We show here that even beyond the level of initiation there are effects governing the replication time that can not be explained by the movement of the polymerase along the DNA template alone. This allows us to characterize genomic regions with significantly altered elongation characteristics, independent of initiation times or sequence composition.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA replication 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aactive sites 3aepigenetics 3agenome 3amodels 3areplication origin 3atranscription (genetics) 3ayeasts1 aDiener, Christian1 aBarberis, Matteo1 aKlipp, Edda0 tPloS one.g2010 Apr., v. 5, no. 4x1932-62037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00102033Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02161naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100001800174245007900192300001600271500002400287520083300311650001001144650002101154650001001175650001401185650004101199650001901240650002301259650002201282650001201304650004601316650002101362650002601383650001001409653001501419700001801434773008701452852000901539856008601548930003301634945002501667946001101692655001201703IND4399564620221118033420.0071231e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439956462DNAL7 a171850142pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2006.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aMcElroy, M.C.14aThe development of oral lesions in lambs naturally infected with orf virus  ap. 663-664.  aIncludes references  aStomatitis in sheep caused by orf virus can be confused with lesions of more economically significant diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, but there is no published account of the sequential development of oral orf lesions in the sheep. This report describes the clinical appearance of such lesions during a natural outbreak of the disease in young lambs. Lesions were seen on the gingiva, the tongue and the dental pad/hard palate, and progressed from small erythematous papules to larger, often coalescing papules that in some cases were ulcerated. Resolution started within seven days and was complete within 22 days. The lambs continued to suck and thrive throughout the infection. Lesions at all stages were proliferative, providing a major differentiating factor between orf and other causes of stomatitis in sheep. 3amouth 3alesions (animal) 3alambs 3aOrf virus 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3asheep diseases 3adisease prevalence 3adisease diagnosis 2aAnimals 2aEcthyma, Contagiousxpathologyxvirology. 2aMouthxpathology 2aOrf virusxphysiology 2aSheep 0astomatitis1 aBassett, H.F.0 tVeterinary journal.g2007 Nov., v. 174, no. 3 p.663-664dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2006.10.0243Available from publisher's Web site  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/03/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02804naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001700195245012100212300001600333500002400349500001500373520135000388650002101738650001901759650001701778650002801795650001701823650001601840650001801856650001901874650001701893650002301910650001001933650002001943650002501963650002301988653001602011700001602027773008802043852000902131856008902140930003302229945002502262946001102287655001202298IND4399566420221118033424.0071231e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439956642DNAL7 a220619332pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.04.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ103 0aQ403 0aQ5041 aSammel, L.M.10aCalcium chloride and tricalcium phosphate effects on the pink color defect in cooked ground and intact turkey breast  ap. 492-498.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCalcium chloride (250, 500 ppm) was examined for its ability to reduce the pink color defect induced by sodium nitrite (10 ppm) and nicotinamide (1.0%) in cooked ground turkey in the presence and absence of sodium tripolyphosphate (0.25, 0.5%) and sodium citrate (0.5, 1.0%). The ability of tricalcium phosphate (0.1-0.5%) to reduce pink cooked color also was evaluated in ground turkey and both calcium chloride and tricalcium phosphate were tested for their effects on pink cooked color in whole breast muscle. The combination of calcium chloride and sodium tripolyphosphate, not calcium chloride alone, was necessary for a reduction in pink cooked color induced by nicotinamide. Subsequently, in the presence of phosphate, both calcium chloride and sodium citrate reduced pink cooked color and were most effective in combination. Tricalcium phosphate also was capable of reducing pink cooked color in ground turkey, however substituting tricalcium phosphate for sodium tripolyphosphate resulted in lower pH and cooking yields. Neither calcium chloride nor tricalcium phosphate was capable of reducing pink cooked color in whole turkey breast. Currently, a combination of sodium tripolyphosphate, calcium chloride, and sodium citrate represents the most suitable means for reducing or preventing the pink color defect in uncured ground turkey. 3acalcium chloride 3asodium nitrite 3anicotinamide 3asodium tripolyphosphate 3acooked foods 3acured meats 3abreast muscle 3asodium citrate 3ameat quality 3aground turkey meat 3acolor 3acooking quality 3atricalcium phosphate 3afood preservatives 0aturkey meat1 aClaus, J.R.0 tMeat science.g2007 Dec., v. 77, no. 4 p.492-498dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.04.0253Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/02/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02961naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176100001500185245017000200300001600370500002400386500001500410520138300425650002501808650001301833650001901846650002001865650001701885650001601902650001601918650002101934650001101955650002001966650000901986650002301995650002402018650001502042650001402057653002202071700001502093700001502108700001502123700001402138773008802152852000902240856008902249930003302338945002502371946001102396655001202407IND4399565820221118033434.0071231e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439956582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL500 0aL600 0aQ5021 aWang, W.J.10aEffects of vitamin A supplementation on growth performance, carcass characteristics and meat quality in Limosin x Luxi crossbreed steers fed a wheat straw-based diet  ap. 450-458.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThree experiments were conducted to examine the effects of dietary vitamin A supplementation on performance and carcass parameters in Limosin x Luxi crossbreed finishing steers fed a wheat straw-based diet. Sixteen 12-month old (301 ± 22 kg) steers, 16 12-month old (309 ± 15 kg) steers and 16 24-month old (411 ± 20 kg) steers were used in experiment 1 for 6 months feeding period, in experiment 2 for three months feeding period and in experiment 3 for three months feeding period, respectively. Sixteen steers of each experiment were randomly divided into the four groups of four animals. Treatments consisted of four vitamin A supplementation levels (0, 1100, 2200 and 4400IU/kg DM). The growth rate was affected by dietary vitamin A level in experiment 1 and 2, revealing that the suitable amount of vitamin A supplementation increased the growth rate; excessive vitamin A in the ration decreased the growth rate of 12-month-old finishing steers. The marbling deposition decreased with the increment of vitamin A supplementation level, but possibly associated with vitamin A supplementing duration. Furthermore, the suitable dietary vitamin A level probably decreased lipid and pigment oxidation, and increased the tenderness of beef meat. Vitamin A supplementation had no significant effect on chemical composition of gluteus medius muscle and longissimus dorsi muscle. 3achemical composition 3amarbling 3acattle feeding 3afeed conversion 3abeef quality 3abeef cattle 3awheat straw 3aslaughter weight 3asteers 3ameat tenderness 3abeef 3alongissimus muscle 3avitamin supplements 3acrossbreds 3avitamin A 0alongissimus dorsi1 aWang, S.P.1 aGong, Y.S.1 aWang, J.Q.1 aTan, Z.L.0 tMeat science.g2007 Dec., v. 77, no. 4 p.450-458dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.04.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080220b20080301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/02/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03320naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100001500204245011400219300001600333500002400349500001500373520142600388650002701814650001701841650001801858650001501876650001801891650003201909650002401941650001001965650001901975650001601994650002502010650001702035650002302052650001502075650001502090650002102105650001802126650001402144650002402158650001702182650001402199650002002213650002002233650000702253650001002260653001402270653002202284653001702306700001402323700001402337700001602351773008802367852000902455856008902464930003302553945002502586946001102611655001202622IND4399566320221118033301.0071231e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439956632DNAL7 a220619322pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.04.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL600 0aQ502 0aQ1021 aPark, B.Y.10aEffect of fiber type on postmortem proteolysis in longissimus muscle of Landrace and Korean native black pigs  ap. 482-491.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe current study was conducted to characterize objective meat quality, fiber type and their relations to postmortem proteolysis in longissimus muscle of Landrace and Korean native black (KNP) pigs. Longissimus muscles from each 10 market-weighted male pigs were removed after conventional slaughtering and chilling procedures, and aged for 1 or 7 days at 4 °C to determine WB-shear force, objective meat color, proportion of myosin heavy chain I (MyHC I), intramuscular fat content and rate of proteolysis by a proteomics approach. KNP had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher content of MyHC I, and that concurred with greatly (p < 0.05) higher intramuscular fat content and Hunter a* value, and significantly (p < 0.05) lower drip loss than those seen in Landrace. One-dimension SDS-PAGE indicated that GAPDH, troponin I and creatine kinase were prominent proteolytic products during chiller ageing. By applying a gel-based proteome analysis, 26 proteins were identified, which showed different degradation properties during ageing between the breeds. Biopsied sample revealed that myosin regulatory light chain 2, myosin light chain isotype v/sb, fatty acid-binding protein and albumin were expressed at a greatly higher level for KNP, but their relation to fiber type (or genetic background) is unclear. It was particular noticeable that different actin isoforms showed various degradation behavior during ageing time. 3afatty acid composition 3aswine breeds 3apig carcasses 3aprecooling 3aserum albumin 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3amyosin light chains 3aactin 3ashear strength 3aproteolysis 3aappearance (quality) 3astorage time 3alongissimus muscle 3aproteomics 3ameat aging 3aage at slaughter 3alipid content 3adrip loss 3amyosin heavy chains 3arigor mortis 3atroponins 3acreatine kinase 3ameat tenderness 3apH 3acolor 0aslaughter 0alongissimus dorsi 0ameat quality1 aKim, N.K.1 aLee, C.S.1 aHwang, I.H.0 tMeat science.g2007 Dec., v. 77, no. 4 p.482-491dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.04.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/02/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02930naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001600195245010500211300001600316500002400332520153400356650000901890650001701899650001901916650001501935650002601950650002801976650001102004650001402015650001402029650001902043650002202062650002402084653002102108700001602129700002002145700001602165773008802181852000902269856008902278930003302367945002502400946001102425655001202436IND4399566720221118033317.0071231e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439956672DNAL7 a220619362pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ502 0aX1001 aDamez, J.L.10aDielectric behavior of beef meat in the 1-1500 kHz range: Simulation with the Fricke/Cole-Cole model  ap. 512-519.  aIncludes references  aThe electrical properties of biological tissues have been researched for many years. Impedance measurements observed with increasing frequencies are mainly attributed to changes in membrane conductivity and ion and charged-molecule mobility (mainly Na+, K+, CL- ions). Equivalent circuits with passive electrical components are frequently used as a support model for presentation and analyses of the behavior of tissues submitted to electrical fields. Fricke proposed an electrical model where the elements are resistive and capacitive. The model is composed of a resistive element (Rp) representing extracellular fluids (ECF) placed in parallel with a capacitive element (Cs) representing insulating membranes in series and a resistive element (Rs) representing intracellular fluids (ICF). This model is able to describe impedance measurements: at lower frequencies, most of the current flows around the cells without being able to penetrate them, while at higher frequencies the membranes lose their insulating properties and the current flows through both the extracellular and intracellular compartments. Since meat ageing induces structural change, particularly in membrane integrity, the insulating properties of membranes decrease, and intracellular and extracellular electrolytes mix, thus driving changes in their electrical properties. We report a method combining the Fricke and Cole-Cole models that was developed to monitor and explain tissues conductivity changes in preferential directions during beef meat ageing. 3abeef 3abeef quality 3abeef carcasses 3ameat aging 3adielectric properties 3aelectrical conductivity 3asodium 3apotassium 3adrip loss 3amuscle tissues 3amembrane fluidity 3amathematical models 0amuscle structure1 aClerjon, S.1 aAbouelkaram, S.1 aLepetit, J.0 tMeat science.g2007 Dec., v. 77, no. 4 p.512-519dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.04.0283Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/02/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03161naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100001400186245017200200300001600372500002400388520113200412650001301544650002701557650001701584650002001601650001501621650003001636650002601666650001301692650001701705650002301722650002701745650002801772650001901800650001801819650001501837650002701852650004001879650001601919650002001935650002001955650003301975651001302008651002502021653002702046700001502073700001502088700001402103700001602117700001702133700001902150700001602169700001602185700001902201773008802220852000902308856008902317930003302406945002502439946001102464655001202475IND4399567420221118033348.0071231e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439956742DNAL7 a220619432pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ2021 aTalon, R.10aTraditional dry fermented sausages produced in small-scale processing units in Mediterranean countries and Slovakia. 1: Microbial ecosystems of processing environments  ap. 570-579.  aIncludes references  aMicrobial ecosystems were surveyed in 314 environmental samples from 54 Southern and Eastern European small-scale processing units (PUs) manufacturing traditional dry fermented sausages. The residual microflora contaminating the surfaces and the equipment were analysed after cleaning and disinfection procedures. All the PU environments were colonised at various levels by spoilage and technological microflora with excessive contamination levels in some of the PUs. Sporadic contamination by pathogenic microflora was recorded. Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes were detected in 4.8% and 6.7% of the samples, respectively, and Staphylococcus aureus was enumerated in 6.1% of the samples. Several critical points were identified, such as the machines for S. aureus and the tables and the knives for L. monocytogenes; this knowledge is crucial for the improvement of hygiene control systems in small and traditional meat processing industries. The variability of the residual contamination emphasized the different cleaning, disinfecting and manufacturing practices routinely followed by these small-scale processing units. 3asausages 3atraditional technology 3afermentation 3afermented foods 3adried meat 3afood processing equipment 3afood contact surfaces 3acleaning 3adisinfection 3afood contamination 3abacterial colonization 3abacterial contamination 3afood pathogens 3afood spoilage 3aSalmonella 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aStaphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus 3aplate count 3afood sanitation 3aquality control 3agood manufacturing practices 3aSlovakia 3aMediterranean region 0asporadic contamination1 aLebert, I.1 aLebert, A.1 aLeroy, S.1 aGarriga, M.1 aAymerich, T.1 aDrosinos, E.H.1 aZanardi, E.1 aIanieri, A.1 aFraqueza, M.J.0 tMeat science.g2007 Dec., v. 77, no. 4 p.570-579dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.05.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/02/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02503naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100001600186245013800202300001600340500002400356500001500380520085100395650001501246650001601261650003101277650001401308650002801322650003701350650002301387650004201410650001501452650000801467650002601475650001901501650001501520651001001535653002401545653003501569653001401604653002001618700002101638700002101659700001401680773008801694852000901782856008901791930003301880945002501913946001101938655001201949IND4399567220221118033414.0071231e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439956722DNAL7 a220619412pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ2021 aLandeta, G.10aScreening of biogenic amine production by coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated during industrial Spanish dry-cured ham processes  ap. 556-561.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe potential to produce biogenic amines was investigated for 56 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated during industrial Spanish dry-cured ham processes. The presence of biogenic amines from bacterial cultures was determined by thin-layer chromatography. The percentage of strains that decarboxylated amino acids was very low (3.6%). The only staphylococci with aminogenic capacity were an histamine-producing Staphylococcus capitis strain, and a Staphylococcus lugdunensis strain that simultaneously produced putrescine and cadaverine. In both strains, PCR was used to confirm the presence of the genes encoding the amino acid decarboxylases responsible for the synthesis of these amines. This study reveals that production of biogenic amines is not a widely distributed property among the staphylococci isolated from Spanish dry-cured hams. 3adried meat 3acured meats 3aStaphylococcus lugdunensis 3ahistamine 3abacterial contamination 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3afood contamination 3aStaphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis 3acadaverine 3aham 3asecondary metabolites 3afood pathogens 3aputrescine 3aSpain 0aaminogenic capacity 0aamino acid decarboxylase genes 0aisolation 0abiogenic amines1 aRivas, B. de las1 aCarrascosa, A.V.1 aMunoz, R.0 tMeat science.g2007 Dec., v. 77, no. 4 p.556-561dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.05.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/02/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02555naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176072000900185100001600194245010200210300001600312500002400328520089800352650001401250650001501264650002101279650000901300650001101309650001901320650002601339650001701365650001901382650001701401650001501418650002401433650002301457650001401480650001701494650001601511650001401527650002001541650002001561650001701581653002001598700001601618700001601634700002001650700001601670773008801686852000901774856008901783930003301872945002501905946001101930655001201941IND4399567320221118033411.0071231e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439956732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aQ102 0aQ402 0aQ112 0aQ5021 aStika, J.F.10aFozen storage stability of antioxidant-treated raw restructured beef steaks made from mature cows  ap. 562-569.  aIncludes references  aPrevious research has shown that beef quality decreased with the age of cattle. In this study, beef trimmings from nine mature cows (n = 9), equally representing three animal age groups (2-4, 6-8, and 10-12 yr), were restructured into steaks formulated with propyl gallate, alone or in combination with a beefy flavoring agent, to enhance palatability and stability during 6 months of frozen storage at -29 °C. Lipid oxidation, rancidity, and loss of beefy flavor in restructured steaks during extended storage were reduced by propyl gallate. The beefy flavoring agent inclusion masked mature, forage-fed beef off-flavors, intensified beefy flavor, and improved steak tenderness, juiciness and cooking yield. Thus, the combination of propyl gallate and beefy flavoring offers an effective means to enhance the palatability and storage stability of restructured beef prepared from mature cows. 3abeef cows 3aanimal age 3aage at slaughter 3abeef 3asteaks 3apropyl gallate 3aartificial flavorings 3afood storage 3afrozen storage 3astorage time 3ashelf life 3aoxidative stability 3alipid peroxidation 3arancidity 3abeef quality 3aoff flavors 3ajuiciness 3acooking quality 3ameat tenderness 3apalatability 0alipid oxidation1 aXiong, Y.L.1 aSuman, S.P.1 aBlanchard, S.P.1 aMoody, W.G.0 tMeat science.g2007 Dec., v. 77, no. 4 p.562-569dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.05.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/02/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03722naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001300163245016000176300001600336500002400352500001500376520186600391650001902257650001302276650002202289650001702311650002502328650002002353650002102373650001902394650002402413650001202437650001802449650001602467650002102483650000902504650001902513650002402532650001202556650002602568653001802594653002102612653002802633653004002661653002702701653002302728700001402751700001502765700001402780700001302794700001402807773010002821852000902921856008502930930003303015945002503048946001103073655001203084IND4399568320221118033253.0071231e20080104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439956832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2007.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aJu, J.B.10aComparison between ethanolic and aqueous extracts from Chinese juniper berries for hypoglycaemic and hypolipidemic effects in alloxan-induced diabetic rats  ap. 110-115.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAim of the study: Hypoglycaemic and hypolipidemic properties of the ethanolic and aqueous extracts, respectively, from Chinese juniper (Juniperus chinensis L.) berries were investigated in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Materials and methods: After oral administration of each extract singly or repeatedly to alloxan-induced diabetic rats, the blood glucose, glutamate-pyruvate transferase (GPT), glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels were assayed. Results: The blood glucose levels after a single oral administration of the ethanolic extract significantly reduced in a time-dependent manner, which is much faster and more than that of glibenclamide. The blood glucose levels of alloxan-induced diabetic rats treated with the ethanolic extract were reduced to 94, 81%, 66%, 45% and 40% at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9h, respectively (p <0.05), while the aqueous extract had no effect at all. Repeated oral administration of the ethanolic extract also effectively reduced the GPT value to 58% of the diabetic rats, but slightly reduced the GOT value to 87% of the diabetic rats (p <0.05). On the other hand, the repeated oral administration of aqueous extract effectively reduced the GOT value to 43% of the diabetic rats, without affecting the GPT level. Effects of both extracts on the TC and TG levels were different. There was no significant difference in the TC and TG levels between diabetic control and diabetic groups when repeatedly administered orally with ethanolic extract. On the other hand, the aqueous extract brought down the TC value to 57% and the TG value to 37% of the diabetic control rats (p <0.05). Conclusions: The results suggested that the ethanolic extract of Chinese juniper berries possesses a potential hypoglycaemic effect while the aqueous extract has a potential hypolipidemic effect. 3ahuman diseases 3adiabetes 3aaqueous solutions 3asmall fruits 3aalanine transaminase 3aglycemic effect 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aJuniperus chinensis 3aalloxan 3ablood glucose 3acholesterol 3atriacylglycerols 3arats 3alipemic effect 3aoral administration 3aethanol 3aanimal disease models 0atransaminases 0aaqueous extracts 0aChinese juniper berries 0aglutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase 0afruits (plant anatomy) 0aethanolic extracts1 aKim, J.S.1 aChoi, C.W.1 aLee, H.K.1 aOh, T.K.1 aKim, S.C.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2008 Jan. 4, v. 115, no. 1 p.110-115dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2007.09.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20110609b20110701c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/04/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02904naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001600119245007200135300001600207500002400223500001500247520166800262650002501930650001101955650002001966650002001986650001402006650002302020650001802043650002402061653002202085653001102107700001602118700001702134700001502151700001902166773013102185852000902316856007402325930003302399945002502432946001302457655001202470IND4399569520221118033415.0071231s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439956952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ8001 aDavis, J.N.10aUse of Chemical Soil Additives to Stabilize Off-Road Vehicle Trails  ap. 597-602.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOff-road vehicle (ORV) use is an increasingly popular form of outdoor recreation throughout the United States. This form of motorized recreation, however, can sometimes lead to serious erosion of trail running surfaces, with resulting export of sediment into forested ecosystems causing environmental degradation. This project was conducted to determine the feasibility of using two types of soil amendments, an acrylic copolymer (Envirotac) and a lignin emulsion (Terrabind), as cementing agents to seal and harden ORV trails to reduce erosion and promote durability. The amendments were evaluated in controlled traffic tests on simulated trails in two slope classes -- averaging 2% and 8%, respectively. Simulated rainfall events of 1-h duration and intensity of 75 mm per hour were used to assess erosion potential. Results showed that both amendments increased total runoff from test plots on flatter slopes, but that sediment concentration was reduced. Net export of sediment was lower for treated plots than those not receiving any soil amendment. In further tests after a period of four months and at higher soil moisture content, the Envirotac treatment retained most of its ability to control the sediment concentration of effluent while the effectiveness of the lignin product was reduced. The Envirotac product was selected for limited testing on actual ORV trails. The amendment was applied on curved, outsloped sections of trails and rut formation was compared to untreated curves located nearby. The soil amendment did not improve durability of the treated sections, but this was likely due to high soil moisture content at the time of installation. 3aall-terrain vehicles 3alignin 3asoil amendments 3aerosion control 3aemulsions 3acomposite polymers 3awater erosion 3arainfall simulation 0aacrylic copolymer 0atrails1 aBaier, J.E.1 aFulton, J.P.1 aBrown, DA.1 aMcDonald, T.P.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2007, v. 23, no. 5 p.597-602dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080401b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/04/01  aOther US 7aarticle02086naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100001500186245007400201300001600275500002400291500001500315520066700330650002500997650000901022650002101031650001701052650004301069650001801112650002201130650001001152650002601162650001301188650001801201650001501219653001801234653002401252653002101276700001401297700001401311773008801325852000901413856008901422930003301511945002501544946001101569655001201580IND4399569620221118033040.0071231e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439956962DNAL7 a220619542pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ202 0aQ5021 aKesmen, Z.10aPCR assay for the identification of animal species in cooked sausages  ap. 649-653.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA species-specific PCR assay was developed for the detection of low levels of pork, horse and donkey meat in cooked sausages. Oligonucleotid primers were designed for amplification of species-specific mitochondrial DNA sequences of each species and detected the presence of 0.01 ng of template DNA in water. When applying the assay to DNA extracts from sausages samples that were prepared from binary meat mixtures, it was possible to detect each species when spiked in any other species at the 0.1% level. In conclusion, it can be suggested that this assay can be used to determine mislabelled and/or fraudulent species substitution in comminuted meat products. 3aproduct authenticity 3apork 3ameat composition 3acooked foods 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3afood analysis 3amitochondrial DNA 3aasses 3astandards of identity 3asausages 3ablended foods 3ahorse meat 0ameat products 0aspecie-specific PCR 0afood composition1 aSahin, F.1 aYetim, H.0 tMeat science.g2007 Dec., v. 77, no. 4 p.649-653dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.05.0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/02/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03085naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100001600186245012700202300001600329500002400345500001500369520140000384650001501784650001301799650001201812650002701824650001201851650002001863650002101883650002401904650001601928650001601944650001701960650000801977650002001985650001702005650001502022650001702037650000702054650002202061650001102083650001702094653000902111653002202120653003102142700001402173700001702187700001202204773008802216852000902304856008902313930003302402945002502435946001102460655001202471IND4399570120221118033117.0071231e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439957012DNAL7 a220619562pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ5021 aMorales, R.10aSoftness in dry-cured porcine biceps femoris muscles in relation to meat quality characteristics and processing conditions  ap. 662-669.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the study was to quantify the effect of meat quality characteristics and some processing conditions on the softness of dry-cured biceps femoris (BF) muscles. The BF muscles were dissected from forty hams and classified according to their pHBF into three groups: LpH (pH < 5.66), MpH (5.66 <or= pH <or= 6.00) and HpH (pH > 6.00). BF muscles within each pHBF group were distributed into three different Salting levels (1%, 2% or 4% of added NaCl). Muscles were salted, vacuum-packed and stored at 3 °C for 30 days. The post-salting BF muscles were classified into two intramuscular fat (IMF) levels: Low (IMF < 4%) and High (IMF <or= 4%). Thereafter, the muscles were divided into two pieces and dried at two of the three different Drying levels (1.5, 2 and 2.5 g H2O/g desalted dry matter). Then, each piece was divided into two samples that were packed in N2 and stored at 5 °C or 30 °C for 1 month. Stress Relaxation was used to evaluate texture. Dry-cured BF muscles with initial pH > 6.0, with IMF > 4% or with added NaCl levels less than 2% were more prone to show soft texture. Softness in dry-cured muscles can be reduced by applying an ageing temperature of 30 °C for 30 days, despite increasing proteolysis. The softness reduction by ageing at 30 °C compared with 5 °C is expected to be higher when applied to drier samples, which show a smaller increase in proteolysis. 3adried meat 3ahardness 3asalting 3acuring (food products) 3atexture 3askeletal muscle 3avacuum packaging 3astorage temperature 3acured meats 3aproteolysis 3astorage time 3aham 3asodium chloride 3ashear stress 3ameat aging 3ameat quality 3apH 3astress relaxation 3adrying 3acold storage 0apork 0aaging temperature 0aphysicochemical properties1 aSerra, X.1 aGuerrero, L.1 aGou, P.0 tMeat science.g2007 Dec., v. 77, no. 4 p.662-669dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.05.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/02/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03025naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001900195245010600214300001600320500002400336520127600360650001401636650002101650650002001671650001801691650002701709650002901736650001601765650001901781650002301800650002401823650003201847650002601879650002401905650002401929650002201953650002001975650001701995653002002012700002202032700001802054700001902072700001902091700002102110700001802131700001902149773008802168852000902256856008902265930003302354945002502387946001102412655001202423IND4399570820221118033037.0071231e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439957082DNAL7 a220619592pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.05.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ112 0aQ502 0aQ1021 aAlfaia, C.M.M.10aIrradiation effect on fatty acid composition and conjugated linoleic acid isomers in frozen lamb meat  ap. 689-695.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of gamma radiation processing on the lipid content, fatty acid composition and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) profile in frozen lamb meat was investigated. Samples of longissimus thoracis muscle from lambs fed lucerne basal diets either unsupplemented or supplemented with polyunsaturated vegetable oils were irradiated (7 kGy) and analysed. CLA contents in lamb meat did not affect (P > 0.05) the levels of lipid oxidation induced by the irradiation. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed for fatty acid composition, related nutritional indexes (n - 6/n - 3 and PUFA/SFA), as well as for total lipid and CLA contents, between non-irradiated (control) and irradiated meat samples. In contrast, meat irradiation affected the relative proportions of total trans, trans and cis/trans CLA isomers (P < 0.001), in addition to the percentage of some minor individual CLA isomers (t11, t13 and t9, t11, with P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). The percentage of total cis/trans CLA isomers slightly decreased in irradiated samples, while the relative proportion of total trans, trans isomers slightly increased. This observation may be explained by the higher susceptibility to autoxidation of the cis double bond relative to the trans configuration. 3alamb meat 3afood irradiation 3agamma radiation 3alipid content 3afatty acid composition 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3afrozen meat 3afrozen storage 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stability 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3atrans fatty acids 3anutritive value 3aautoxidation 0alipid oxidation1 aRibeiro, P.J.L.C.1 aTrigo, M.J.P.1 aAlfaia, A.J.I.1 aCastro, M.L.F.1 aFontes, C.M.G.A.1 aBessa, R.J.B.1 aPrates, J.A.M.0 tMeat science.g2007 Dec., v. 77, no. 4 p.689-695dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.05.0253Available from publisher's Web site  a20080227b20080301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/02/22  aNon-US 7aarticle01751naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001600119245008800135300001600223500002400239520056500263650001700828650001400845650001500859650002500874650001500899650002200914650001000936650001600946650002100962653002800983653001201011700001801023700001501041773013101056852000901187856007401196930003301270945002501303946001301328655001201341IND4399571720221118033122.0071231s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439957172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aMukhtar, S.10aEvaluation of a Synthetic Tube Dewatering System for Animal Waste Pollution Control  ap. 669-675.  aIncludes references  aEutrophication of surface waters due to the addition of excess nutrients via runoff is one of the most widespread water quality problems in the United States.

Two different configurations of aerator modules were studied using water test. The aerator modules consisted of a number of venturi air injectors connected either in series or in parallel aimed at achieving better aeration efficiencies. The results obtained indicated that the parallel design generally performed better than the series design in terms of transferring oxygen into water, with the oxygen transfer coefficients found to be 9.67 and 5.93 h-1 for two- and three-aerator parallel modules, as opposed to 4.54, 3.79, and 3.63 h-1 for one-, two-, and three-aerator series modules. Similarly, higher aeration efficiencies were also observed for the parallel design of the two modules (0.14 and 0.10 kgO2/kWh) as compared to those in the series design (0.07, 0.06, and 0.06 kgO2/kWh). The parallel module with two air injectors achieved the highest aeration efficiency (0.14 kgO2/kWh), which was two times the highest efficiency reached by the series modules (0.07 kgO2/kWh). In the same way, the oxygenation capacities were also significantly higher for parallel modules (0.22 and 0.15 kgO2/h) than for series modules (0.10, 0.09, and 0.09 kgO2/h). The data suggest that more research effort should be invested in exploring the possibility of using inexpensive aerators through better designs of the air injector complex in order to develop inexpensive aeration systems. 3awastewater treatment 3awaste lagoons 3aanimal manures 3aaeration 3aaerators 3aequipment performance 3ainjectors 3aoxygen 0aventuri air injectors 0agas transfer1 aMiller, C.F.1 aDong, C.1 aWu, X.1 aWang, L.1 aMukhtar, S.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2007, v. 23, no. 5 p.661-667dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/04/01  aOther US 7aarticle02694naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146100002200155245022300177300001400400500002400414520121800438650002301656650002401679650002001703650003001723650003101753650002401784650002101808650001401829650001401843650002301857650001901880650001001899650003001909700001801939700002301957773010401980852000902084856008602093930003302179945002502212946001102237655001202248IND4399573920221118033144.0071231s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439957392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2007.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8511 aAthanassiou, C.G.10aInsecticidal effect of Steinernema feltiae (Filipjev) (Nematoda: Steinernematidae) against Tribolium confusum du Val (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) and Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) in stored wheat  ap. 52-57.  aIncludes references  aThe confused flour beetle, Tribolium confusum, and the Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella, are important pests of stored grain products. The insecticidal effect of three strains (UK 76 [=Nemasys], USA/SC, and Hawaii) of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema feltiae was determined in the laboratory, in wheat, against these pests. The nematodes were applied at three dose rates: 100, 300 and 900 nematodes/insect individual. The Hawaii strain was most virulent against T. confusum adults and larvae, with a significant dose effect in the case of the larvae. Larval mortality of this species reached 79% and 100% after 7 and 14 d of exposure to the nematodes, respectively, at the highest dose applied. On the other hand, adult mortality of T. confusum did not exceed 66%. In the case of E. kuehniella larvae, USA/SC performed best causing 52% and 69% mortality after 7 and 14 d exposure, respectively, at the highest dose tested. Since very few data are available on the effect of entomopathogenic nematodes against these pests, it is concluded that the Hawaii and USA/SC strains of S. feltiae should be further investigated as promising biological control agents for T. confusum and E. kuehniella. 3aTribolium confusum 3aEphestia kuehniella 3astorage insects 3abiological control agents 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3aSteinernema feltiae 3aapplication rate 3avirulence 3amortality 3astrain differences 3ainsect control 3awheat 3astored product protection1 aPalyvos, N.E.1 aKakouli-Duarte, T.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2008, v. 44, no. 1 p.52-57dElsevier Sciencex0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2007.04.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/04/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02080naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164100001800173245006500191300001400256500002400270520068200294650001200976650001800988650002201006650000801028650001901036650002401055650002501079650001201104650002101116650000901137650002901146651001301175653002201188653003001210653001701240700001601257700001501273700001801288773010401306852000901410856008601419930003301505945002501538946001101563655001201574IND4399573720221118033219.0071231s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439957372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2007.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF850 0aL300 0aL0011 aLathiya, S.B.10aFood habits of rodents in grain godowns of Karachi, Pakistan  ap. 41-46.  aIncludes references  aThe present study is based on identification of stomach contents of three commensal rodents (Rattus rattus, Rattus norvegicus, Mus sp.) and the common house shrew (Suncus murinus), which were collected from the Thole Produce Yard rice godowns, Karachi.

It is concluded that insects can be a significant component of the diet of these commensal rodents. 3arodents 3aRattus rattus 3aRattus norvegicus 3aMus 3aSuncus murinus 3afeeding preferences 3awildlife food habits 3ainsects 3avertebrate pests 3arice 3agrain storage facilities 3aPakistan 0acommensal rodents 0astomach contents analysis 0arice godowns1 aAhmed, S.M.1 aPervez, A.1 aRizvi, S.W.A.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2008, v. 44, no. 1 p.41-46dElsevier Sciencex0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2007.06.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/04/25  aNon-US 7aarticle04549naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194100001800203245010600221300001600327500002400343520284500367650001303212650002603225650001003251650001503261650001403276650001803290650001703308650002003325650003503345650002003380650001303400650001703413650001803430650001503448650002103463650001603484650001303500650002603513650002103539653002303560700001703583700001803600700001603618700001403634773012003648852000903768856008903777930003303866945002503899946001103924655001203935IND4399575320221118033154.0071231e20070720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439957532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2007.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aM120 0aL600 0aL200 0aM001 0aL8101 aRaisuddin, S.14aThe copepod Tigriopus: A promising marine model organism for ecotoxicology and environmental genomics  ap. 161-173.  aIncludes references  aThere is an increasing body of evidence to support the significant role of invertebrates in assessing impacts of environmental contaminants on marine ecosystems. Therefore, in recent years massive efforts have been directed to identify viable and ecologically relevant invertebrate toxicity testing models. Tigriopus, a harpacticoid copepod has a number of promising characteristics which make it a candidate worth consideration in such efforts. Tigriopus and other copepods are widely distributed and ecologically important organisms. Their position in marine food chains is very prominent, especially with regard to the transfer of energy. Copepods also play an important role in the transportation of aquatic pollutants across the food chains. In recent years there has been a phenomenal increase in the knowledge base of Tigriopus spp., particularly in the areas of their ecology, geophylogeny, genomics and their behavioural, biochemical and molecular responses following exposure to environmental stressors and chemicals. Sequences of a number of important marker genes have been studied in various Tigriopus spp., notably T. californicus and T. japonicus. These genes belong to normal biophysiological functions (e.g. electron transport system enzymes) as well as stress and toxic chemical exposure responses (heat shock protein 20, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase). Recently, 40,740 expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) from T. japonicus, have been sequenced and of them, 5673 ESTs showed significant hits (E-value, >1.0E-05) to the red flour beetle Tribolium genome database. Metals and organic pollutants such as antifouling agents, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and polychrlorinated biphenyls (PCB) have shown reproducible biological responses when tested in Tigriopus spp. Promising results have been obtained when Tigriopus was used for assessment of risk associated with exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Application of environmental gene expression techniques has allowed evaluation of transcriptional changes in T. japonicus with the ultimate aim of understanding the mechanisms of action of environmental stressors. Through a better understanding of toxicological mechanisms, ecotoxicologists may use this ecologically relevant species in risk assessment studies in marine systems. The combination of uses as a whole-animal bioassay and gene expression studies indicate that Tigriopus may serve as an excellent tool to evaluate the impacts of marine pollution throughout the coastal region. The purpose of this review is to illustrate the potential of using Tigriopus to fulfill the niche as an important invertebrate marine model organism for ecotoxicology and environmental genomics. In addition, the knowledge gaps and areas for further studies have also been discussed. 3aCopepoda 3aaquatic invertebrates 3agenes 3abiomarkers 3abioassays 3aecotoxicology 3alife history 3awater pollution 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3agene expression 3agenomics 3agenotoxicity 3aanimal models 3apollutants 3atoxicity testing 3atemperature 3asalinity 3aultraviolet radiation 3astress tolerance 0aliterature reviews1 aKwok, K.W.H.1 aLeung, K.M.Y.1 aSchlenk, D.1 aLee, J.S.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2007 July 20, v. 83, no. 3 p.161-173dElsevier/North Holland Biomedical Pressx0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2007.04.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080220b20080301c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/02/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03325naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147100001500156245015000171300001600321500010900337500002400446500001500470520153900485650001302024650002802037650001602065650002002081650002202101650002302123650001702146650002002163650002202183650001102205650002202216650002102238650001702259650001202276651001102288653002402299653001802323653002202341653001902363700001702382700001802399700002002417700001802437700001702455700002002472773007802492852000902570856008702579930003302666945002502699946001102724655001202735IND4399578020221118033221.0071231s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439957802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2006.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aLuttge, U.10aPhysiological ecology of photosynthesis of five sympatric species of Velloziaceae in the rupestrian fields of Serra do Cipo, Minas Gerais, Brazil  ap. 637-646.  aIn a special issue in honor of the 80th birthday of Otto Ludwig Lange / edited by B.

The species investigated co-occurred in a plot of 50mx50m. The chosen species were distinguished by different architectures, mainly tallness of the plants. They were Vellozia variabilis Mart. ex Shult. f.>Vellozia glabra J.C. Mikan>Vellozia nivea L.B.Sm. et Ayensu=Vellozia alata L.B.Sm.>Barbacenia involucrata L.B.Sm. In the open highly sun exposed habitat there was no photoinhibition in any of the five species being not reversible within 30min at any time during the day including the afternoon. There was a slightly but not statistically significant better instantaneous performance of the taller species. Significant differences showing a higher intrinsic photosynthetic capacity of the taller as compared to the smaller species were revealed by photosynthetic parameters extracted from light dependence curves obtained in the morning and at midday. Light dependence curves of all five species showed a significant and substantial drop of intrinsic photosynthetic capacity when measured in the afternoon as compared to the morning and midday. As this cannot be explained by a build up of photoinhibition during the day this is a novel observation made here with the Velloziaceae. 3asympatry 3ainterspecific variation 3achlorophyll 3asolar radiation 3aplant communities 3aplant architecture 3afluorescence 3aphotoinhibition 3aelectron transfer 3aheight 3adiurnal variation 3aplant physiology 3aVelloziaceae 3acerrado 3aBrazil 0aspecies differences 0aplant ecology 0asympatric species 0aphotosynthesis1 aDuarte, H.M.1 aScarano, F.R.1 aMattos, E.A. de1 aCavalin, P.O.1 aFranco, A.C.1 aFernandes, G.W.0 tFlora.g2007, v. 202, no. 8 p.637-646dG.

Presently, the old-growth Larix forests show no regeneration, while Picea abies, Norway spruce, invades at lower elevation, and Pinus cembra, Stone pine, at higher elevation. In this study, we investigate the conditions that lead to pure stands of L. decidua in the past. It is shown that intensive land-use of grazing was essential for Larix regeneration, and that the pure stands of Larix will disappear in the future with the change of land-use, unless management will be intensified again to produce mineral soil for Larix to regenerate. 3aland use change 3aforest trees 3aLarix decidua 3amontane forests 3aplant communities 3amineral soils 3abotanical composition 3amountains 3agrazing 3aintensive livestock farming 3anatural regeneration 3aaltitude 3aItaly 0aspecies diversity 0aAlps 0aland use1 aMischi, G.1 aAsche, G.1 aBorner, A.0 tFlora.g2007, v. 202, no. 8 p.705-713dG.

The herbicidal and in vitro activities have been measured and correlated with their (Log)octanol/water partition coefficients (Log K(o/w)). The length of the 3-n-alkyl substituent for optimal activity differed between herbicidal and in vitro activity. The maximum in vitro activity was given by the nonyl to dodecyl homologues (Log K(o/w) between 6.54 and 8.12), whereas herbicidal activity peaked with the n-hexyl compound (Log K(o/w) = 4.95). The effect of chain branching was also investigated using isomeric pentyl analogues substituted at position 3. All exhibited similar levels of in vitro activities but herbicidal activities differed, albeit moderately, with the exception of one analogue that was much less phytotoxic. Other modes of action were also investigated using two representative compounds. They did not show any activity on photosystem I or mitochondrial complex I, or generate toxic oxygen radicals by redox cycling reactions. Only moderate activity was found against mitochondrial complex III from plants, in contrast to much higher corresponding activity using an insect enzyme. 3achemical structure 3aherbicidal properties 3ainsects 3amechanism of action 3anaphthoquinones 3aoctanol 3apartition coefficients 3apest management 3aphotosystem I 3aphotosystem II 3aphytotoxicity 3areactive oxygen species 3aubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase1 aHiggins, James1 aBerry, Kate J.1 aMoss, Stephan R.1 aBoogaard, Adrian B.1 aKhambay, Bhupinder P.S.0 tPest management science.g2002 Mar., v. 58, no. 3 p.234-242x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.4283Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140318  aNon-US 7aarticle03017naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002400092040001800116100002100134245011200155300001600267520162300283650002201906650002501928650001301953650001301966650001901979650002701998650001102025650001102036650001102047650001302058650002102071650001502092650001502107650001502122650001602137650002602153650002002179650001602199650001502215650001302230650001002243651001202253700002002265773009902285852000902384856007402393939003302467946001102500655001202511IND4478507120221118033333.0140318e200304  xx |||||o|||||||||||rus||7 aIND447850712DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.6472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzigeti, Zoltán12aA review of physiological and biochemical aspects of resistance to atrazine and paraquat in Hungarian weeds  ap. 451-458.  aThe most important results in the field of atrazine and paraquat resistance research by Hungarian researchers are reviewed. Pleiotropic effects accompanying atrazine resistance were investigated in atrazine-resistant (AR) and susceptible (S) biotypes of horseweed (Conyza canadensis (L) Cronq). No significant difference in carbon dioxide assimilation rate was found between the AR and S plants. The rates of the Hill reaction of the AR and S chloroplasts exhibited different temperature dependence. The thylakoid membrane lipids contained a lower amount of polar lipid and the fatty acid content exhibited a higher degree of unsaturation in the AR biotype. Photosynthetic apparatus of the AR biotype had better adaptive ability at low temperature and showed enhanced susceptibility to high-temperature stress. AR horseweed plants had reduced activity of xanthophyll cycle, limited capacity of light-induced non-photochemical and photochemical quenching, higher photosensitivity and susceptibility to photo-inhibition. In the case of paraquat resistance, horseweed found in Hungary exhibited a resistance factor of 450; the resistance is not based on an elevated level and activity of the antioxidant enzyme system. The suggested role of polyamines in the resistance mechanisms can be excluded. The higher putrescine and total polyamine content of paraquat-treated R leaves can be regarded as a general stress response rather than as a symptom of paraquat resistance. A paraquat-inducible, nuclear-coded protein, which presumably functions by carrying paraquat to the vacuole, is supposed to play a role in resistance. 3aConyza canadensis 3aantioxidant activity 3aatrazine 3abiotypes 3acarbon dioxide 3afatty acid composition 3aleaves 3alipids 3alutein 3aparaquat 3aphotosensitivity 3apleiotropy 3apolyamines 3aputrescine 3aresearchers 3aresistance mechanisms 3astress response 3atemperature 3athylakoids 3avacuoles 3aweeds 3aHungary1 aLehoczki, Endre0 tPest management science.g2003 Apr., v. 59, no. 4 p.451-458wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.6473Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140318  aNon-US 7aarticle03163naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002400092040001800116100001900134245008100153300001600234500001500250520164700265650001301912650001801925650001901943650002201962650003301984650001702017650001402034650003302048650002102081650002202102650002502124650002302149650001102172650001202183650002502195650001202220650002202232650001902254650001202273650001002285651001202295653001502307653001702322700001802339700002202357700002202379773008102401852000902482856007402491939003302565946001102598655001202609IND4478507220221118033224.0140318e200304  xx |||||o|||||||||||rus||7 aIND447850722DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.7062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarna, Balázs10aRole of reactive oxygen species and antioxidants in plant disease resistance  ap. 459-464.  a2019-12-05  aMembrane damage caused by the non-specific fungal toxin fusaric acid was less on pre-treated than on control leaves when tobacco leaves were pretreated with anti-senescence plant hormones, such as kinetin, benzyladenine or the anti-ozonant N-[2-(2-oxo-1-imidazolidinyl)]ethyl-N′-phenylurea. Similarly, the necrosis caused by mercuric chloride was reduced by the above anti-senescence agents. In addition, in in vitro tests, leaves from selected paraquat-tolerant tobacco plants were less sensitive to Alternaria alternata (Fr) Keissler infection than those of the control paraquat-sensitive tobacco leaves. Paraquat-tolerant Conyza canadensis (L) Cronq weeds naturally selected in vineyards in Hungary showed similar inhibition of senescence to paraquat-tolerant tobacco, expressed as more green leaves and slower development. In accordance with this, the paraquat-tolerant Conyza leaves remained almost symptomless, while paraquat-sensitive plants showed severe symptoms after infection with Botrytis cinerea Pers. Oxidative burst (accumulation of hydrogen peroxide) was attenuated in TMV-infected leaves of Xanthi-nc tobacco as a result of treatment with salicylic acid or in leaves where systemic acquired resistance (SAR) had been induced by a previous TMV infection. Accordingly, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was higher in Xanthi tobacco leaves with SAR than without SAR. However, in NahG tobacco, in which SAR cannot develop, there was no augmentation of SOD activity. All the above data support the significance of delayed senescence and antioxidants in the resistance of plants to biotic and abiotic necrosis-inducing agents. 3anecrosis 3abenzyladenine 3asalicylic acid 3aConyza canadensis 3aplant diseases and disorders 3afusaric acid 3avineyards 3asystemic acquired resistance 3aBotrytis cinerea 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aAlternaria alternata 3adisease resistance 3aleaves 3akinetin 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atobacco 3amercuric chloride 3aplant hormones 3atesting 3afungi 3aHungary 0asenescence 0aantioxidants1 aFodor, Jozsef1 aPogány, Miklós.1 aKirály, Zoltán.0 tPest management science.g2003 Apr., v. 59, no. 4 p.459-464x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.7063Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140318  aNon-US 7aarticle02963naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162100001700171245009400188300001400282500002400296500001500320520150100335650001001836650002801846650001501874650001801889650001801907650002201925650002301947650001901970650002601989650002102015650001802036650001902054650002102073650002102094653002202115700001902137700002002156773012202176852000902298856009302307930003302400945002502433946001102458655001202469IND4399740220221118033336.0080107e20071130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439974022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ100 0aQ2001 aDodd, C.E.R.10aSuicide through stress: A bacterial response to sub-lethal injury in the food environment  ap. 46-50.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe response of bacteria to sub-lethal injury is an important aspect of food microbiology as many inimical processes to which bacteria are subjected during processing are non-lethal. For pathogens like Salmonella and Escherichia coli, the difference in injury levels of exponential phase cells compared to their stationary phase counterparts in this regard is well recognised and evident for a variety of inimical processes. The expression of a range of stress resistance genes under the control of the sigma factor RpoS provides some explanation for the greater resistance of stationary phase cells. However in 1997 the suicide response hypothesis was put forward as an explanation for the observed response of Salmonella and E. coli to sub-lethal stresses. This hypothesis arose as an explanation for the observed protection of Salmonella and E. coli strains to heat and freeze-thaw injury by the presence of a high level of competitor organisms, a protection that had been shown to be RpoS independent. The central tenet of this theory was that under sub-lethal stress bacteria produce a burst of intracellular free radicals and it is these that lead to sub-lethal injury and/or death. Exponential phase cells because of their more active metabolism are more susceptible to this effect and suffer greater damage. This paper reviews the origins of this theory, the evidence for a free radical response and explores the potential mechanisms by which competitor cells produce a protective effect. 3afoods 3abacterial contamination 3aSalmonella 3afree radicals 3afood industry 3afood preservation 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afood pathogens 3aresistance mechanisms 3astress tolerance 3asigma factors 3aheat treatment 3aoxidative stress 3aEscherichia coli 0afood microbiology1 aRichards, P.J.1 aAldsworth, T.G.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2007 Nov. 30, v. 120, no. 1-2 p.46-50dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.06.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20080206b20080301c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/02/05  aNon-US 7aarticle01953naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002400092040001800116100002200134245010600156300001600262520088800278650002301166650001901189650002401208650001401232650001301246650002301259650001301282650001401295650001501309650001301324700001501337700001901352773008101371852000901452856007401461939003301535946001101568655001201579IND4478508120221118033243.0140318e200203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447850812DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.4442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdelson, Jonathan10aToxicity of biorational insecticides: activity against the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer)  ap. 255-260.  aThe relationship between dose for each of four biorational insecticides (pyrethrins, neem extract, capsiacin extract, insecticidal soap) and mortality of the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) was determined using a laboratory bioassay. These insecticides were toxic to aphids and paired mixtures of the insecticides provided synergistic activity as measured by aphid mortality under the laboratory bioassay conditions. Capsiacin extracts were found to provide low levels of mortality alone but acted synergistically in mixtures with the other insecticides and provided higher than expected levels of mortality. Activity as determined in the laboratory for each insecticide was not evident under field-use conditions in five separate experiments.

In this publication, we reveal the identity of a gene and encoded protein essential for GA synthesis. Although it has long been recognized that plants, bacteria, and fungi synthesize and accumulate GA, the pathway leading to its synthesis was largely unknown. Here we provide evidence that shikimate dehydrogenase (SDH), a shikimate pathway enzyme essential for aromatic amino acid synthesis, is also required for GA production. Escherichia coli (E. coli) aroE mutants lacking a functional SDH can be complemented with the plant enzyme such that they grew on media lacking aromatic amino acids and produced GA in vitro. Transgenic Nicotiana tabacum lines expressing a Juglans regia SDH exhibited a 500% increase in GA accumulation. The J. regia and E. coli SDH was purified via overexpression in E. coli and used to measure substrate and cofactor kinetics, following reduction of NADP⁺ to NADPH. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry (RP-LC/ESI-MS) was used to quantify and validate GA production through dehydrogenation of 3-dehydroshikimate (3-DHS) by purified E. coli and J. regia SDH when shikimic acid (SA) or 3-DHS were used as substrates and NADP⁺ as cofactor. Finally, we show that purified E. coli and J. regia SDH produced GA in vitro.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aJuglans regia 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3adehydrogenation 3afungi 3agallic acid 3agenes 3amass spectrometry 3amutants 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3ashikimate pathway 3ashikimic acid 3atannins 3atea 3atransgenic plants 3awalnuts 3awines 0aAroE 0aShikimate dehydrogenase 0aWalnut1 aIbáñez, Ana M. 1 aUratsu, Sandra L. 1 aIngham, Elizabeth S. 1 aLeslie, Charles A. 1 aMcGranahan, Gale H. 1 aBatra, Neelu 1 aGoyal, Sham 1 aJoseph, Jorly 1 aJemmis, Eluvathingal D. 1 aDandekar, Abhaya M. 0 tPlant molecular biology.g2011 Apr., v. 75, no. 6 p.555-565dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-011-9739-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20110316b20110402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02535naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011700163300001600280520103500296650001801331650001801349650001801367650002101385650000701406650003101413650002501444650002401469650001501493650001301508650001701521650001601538650001401554653000801568653001701576653002301593700001601616700001901632700001701651700001401668700001901682700001701701700001601718700001401734773013101748852000901879856008501888930003301973946001102006655001202017IND4451507120221118033249.0110326e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445150712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-011-1429-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Liping.10aPEG-coated lyophilized proliposomes: preparation, characterizations and in vitro release evaluation of vitamin E  ap. 647-654.  aPolyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated vitamin E (VE) lyophilized proliposomes was produced by thin-film ultrasonic dispersion and lyophilization and then evaluated by encapsulation efficiency (EE), distribution of particle size, storage stability, and release behavior in the simulated physiological media. The results showed that the conventional liposomes (CL) were successfully coated by PEG layer, and the hydrogen bond interaction between PEG and the Soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC) headgroups in the bilayers is regarded as the coated mechanism. The mean diameter and EE were 164.2 nm and 83.87% for PEG-coated lyophilized proliposomes (PLP), respectively. VE contained within PLP exhibited a better stability comparing to the CL, and the retention percentage of PLP was 89.81% at 4 °C after 15 days storage. In addition, VE within the PLP could be controlled release in different pH of simulated media. It is proven that PLP could employ to protect VE for extending shelf life and to provide convenience for commercial usage. 3aencapsulation 3afood research 3afreeze drying 3ahydrogen bonding 3apH 3aparticle size distribution 3aphosphatidylcholines 3apolyethylene glycol 3ashelf life 3asoybeans 3astorage time 3aultrasonics 3avitamin E 0aPEG 0aProliposomes 0aControlled release1 aXiong, Hua 1 aPeng, Hailong 1 aWang, Qiang 1 aHan, Dan 1 aBai, ChunQing 1 aLiu, Yuzhen.1 aShi, SuHua 1 aDeng, Bo 0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2011 Apr., v. 232, no. 4 p.647-654dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-011-1429-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20110327b20110402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02996naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003000145245010900175300001600284520163700300650001401937650002001951650001401971650001801985650001202003650002402015650001502039650001402054650001902068650001802087651001802105653002902123653002202152653001902174653002302193700002202216700002202238700001802260773013402278852000902412856008502421930003302506946001102539655001202550IND4451441620221118033209.0110326e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445144162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-010-1536-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Mohammad Shahidul 12aA mobile monitoring system to understand the processes controlling episodic events in Corpus Christi Bay  ap. 349-366.  aCorpus Christi Bay (TX, USA) is a shallow wind-driven bay and thereby, can be characterized as a highly pulsed system. It cycles through various episodic events such as hypoxia, water column stratification, sediment resuspension, flooding, etc. Understanding of the processes that control these events requires an efficient observation system that can measure various hydrodynamic and water quality parameters at the multitude of spatial and temporal scales of interest. As part of our effort to implement an efficient observation system for Corpus Christi Bay, a mobile monitoring system was developed that can acquire and visualize data measured by various submersible sensors on an undulating tow-body deployed behind a research vessel. Along with this system, we have installed a downward-looking Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler to measure the vertical profile of water currents. Real-time display of each measured parameter intensity (measured value relative to a pre-set peak value) guides in selecting the transect route to capture the event of interest. In addition, large synchronized datasets measured by this system provide an opportunity to understand the processes that control various episodic events in the bay. To illustrate the capability of this system, datasets from two research cruises are presented in this paper that help to clarify processes inducing an inverse estuary condition at the mouth of the ship channel and hypoxia at the bottom of the bay. These measured datasets can also be used to drive numerical models to understand various environmental phenomena that control the water quality of the bay. 3aacoustics 3adata collection 3aestuaries 3ahydrodynamics 3ahypoxia 3amathematical models 3amonitoring 3asediments 3awater currents 3awater quality 3aUnited States 0aMobile monitoring system 0aAdaptive sampling 0aStratification 0aCorpus Christi Bay1 aBonner, James S. 1 aOjo, Temitope O. 1 aPage, Cheryl 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2011 Apr., v. 175, no. 1-4 p.349-366dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-010-1536-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110327b20110402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01726naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245008200172300001600254500001500270520072600285650001701011653001701028653003401045653003801079700002201117700002101139773011401160852000901274856008501283930003301368946001101401655001201412IND4451519920221118033109.0110326e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445151992DNAL7 a10.1007/s00580-010-0975-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhabaz, Mohamad Nidal 10aReactivation of latent Toxoplasma gondii in immunocompromised cancer patients  ap. 183-186.  a2019-12-04  aActive Toxoplasma gondii infection in cancer patients undergoing anticancer chemotherapy was evaluated using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. Ninety-nine cancer patients were studied. Sixty seven of those patients were under cancer chemotherapy treatment, 41 (61.2%) of which were found to be ELISA immunoglobulin g (IgG) positive and five (7.5%) were PCR positive. On the other hand, none of the 32 untreated cancer patients was found to be PCR positive although 22 (68.7%) of them were ELISA IgG positive.

The reaction mechanism involves the use of Knoevenagel condensation, Michael addition, and ring-opening of 1,3-thiazolidinedione, followed by intramolecular ring closure process. The reaction is diastereoselective and only trans-2,3-dihydrothiophenes were produced in moderate yields. The functionalized dihydrothiophenes can be converted efficiently to the corresponding thiophenes by DCC dehydrogenation reaction.

Special consideration is given to the species of Echinodera from the Canary Islands. Between islands, these are represented by multiple vicariant species that have undergone parallel speciation along replicate environmental gradients on the respective islands. Based on the phylogenetic tree and further data, a number of taxonomic changes is presented: two new species are described, Echinodera montana, sp. nov. from the Canaries (Fuerteventura) and Echinodera bargouensis, sp. nov. from Tunisia. Five species are declared to be synonyms: Echinodera gomerensis Stüben, 2000, syn. nov.=Echinodera praedicta Germann & Stüben, 2006, syn. nov.=Echinodera pseudohystrix Stüben, 2000; Ruteria bellieri epirica Wolf, 2001, syn. nov.=Echinodera tyrrhenica Caldara, 1978, syn. nov.=Acalles bellieri Reiche, 1860; Echindera troodosi Wolf, 2010, syn. nov.=Echinodera cyprica Stüben, 2010. The subgenus Echinodera (Dieckmannia) Stüben, 1998 is a synonym of Echinodera s. str. The genus Ruteria is again declared a subgenus of Echinodera: Echinodera (Ruteria) Roudier, 1954 stat. rev. Two species are transferred to a different subgenus: Echinodera (Ruteria) incognita (Hoffmann, 1956) and Echinodera (Ruteria) cognita Stüben, 2006 (both formerly Echinodera s. str.). 3aBayesian theory 3aCurculionidae 3agenes 3ainvertebrates 3aislands 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aCanary Islands 3aTunisia 0aCOI 0alineage age estimates 0aMediterranean 0awestern Palaearctic 0a16S1 aStüben, Peter E.0 tInvertebrate systematics.g2010, v. 24, no. 5 p.434-455dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1445-52267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/IS100213Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03062naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013700166300001400303520187100317650001802188650001902206653001702225653002102242653002202263653002102285653002402306653001402330653001402344653001602358700001902374700001702393700002502410773010302435852000902538856008502547930003302632946001102665655001202676IND4451479520221118033242.0110326e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445147952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10872-011-0001-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuda, Shin-ya 10aCompensatory response of the unicellular-calcifying alga Emiliania huxleyi (Coccolithophoridales, Haptophyta) to ocean acidification  ap. 17-25.  aOcean acidification damages calcareous organisms, such as calcifying algae, foraminifera, corals, and shells. In this study, we made a device equipped with a Clark-type oxygen electrode and a pH-stat to examine how the most abundant calcifying phytoplankton, the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi, responded to acidification and alkalization of the seawater medium. When E. huxleyi was incubated at pH 8.2, close to oceanic pH, the medium was alkalized during photosynthesis, and the alkalization rate [determined as μmol HCl added (mg Chl)⁻¹ h⁻¹] was identical to the activity of photosynthesis [determined as μmol O₂ evolved (mg Chl)⁻¹ h⁻¹]. When pH was maintained at 7.2 by the pH-stat, alkalization activity was stimulated and exceeded photosynthetic activity, resulting in an increase in the ratio of alkalization to photosynthesis (Alk/PS). On the other hand, no alkalization and photosynthesis were observed at pH 9.2. In contrast, acidification of seawater was observed in the dark because of the release of respiratory CO₂ from cells at pH 8.2-9.2, but not at pH 7.2. When orthophosphate was rapidly depleted within a day in the batch culture, intracellular calcification gradually increased, and both photosynthesis and alkalization decreased gradually. During the period the Alk/PS ratio also decreased gradually. These results indicate that E. huxleyi possesses an ability to compensate for the acidification of seawater when photosynthesis is more actively driven than respiration. These results suggest that the E. huxleyi cells may not be severely damaged by oceanic acidification during photosynthesis because of their homeostatic function to avoid negative effects on cellular activity. Finally, we concluded that E. huxleyi cells possess a buffering ability to reduce acidification effects when photosynthesis is actively driven. 3acalcification 3aphotosynthesis 0aAlkalization 0aCoccolithophorid 0aEmiliania huxleyi 0aInorganic carbon 0aOcean acidification 0apH change 0apH effect 0aRespiration1 aSuzuki, Iwane 1 aHama, Takeo 1 aShiraiwa, Yoshihiro 0 tJournal of oceanography.g2011 Feb., v. 67, no. 1 p.17-25dJapan : Springer Japanx0916-83707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10872-011-0001-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110327b20110402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02412naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245009900162300001600261520135500277653002201632653002201654653003601676653002601712653003001738700002801768700002301796700002401819773010301843852000901946856008501955939003302040946001302073655001202086IND4451468220221118033134.0110326e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445146822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11095-010-0353-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Guoqin 10aIn Vivo Anti-Tumor Effect of Expressing p14ARF-TAT Using a FGF2-Targeted Cationic Lipid Vector  ap. 720-730.  aPurpose To develop an efficient and safe strategy to introduce a therapeutic gene into target cells in vivo for cancer therapy. The overall efficiency is based on proper selection of the delivery vector and expressed protein. Methods A plasmid coding for a specific cytotoxic fusion peptide, p14ARF-TAT, was evaluated in a xenograft mouse tumor model. The expressed peptide consisted of three domains, a secretory signal, a membrane permeability segment and a cytotoxic fragment. Gene expression was verified in U87-MG cells by Western blot and cytotoxicity confirmed with CyQuant assay. To improve the delivery, a FGF2 targeting peptide, MQLPLATC, was incorporated into the vector, which was evaluated using a luciferase-expressing plasmid. Results The luciferase activity in vitro was two-fold higher with the targeted formulations, and cytotoxicity was three-fold higher with expression of the p14ARF-TAT protein. A murine xenograph model of human glioma (U87-MG cells) tumors was used to address in vivo activity. FGF2-targeted lipoplexes demonstrated increased tumor volume reduction as compared to non-targeted formulations. RT-PCR and Western blot of tumor homogenizes indicated p14ARF-TAT expression in tumors along with other tissues. Conclusion p14ARF-TAT was cytotoxic and is a promising approach when combined with an efficient targeting. 0aanti-tumor effect 0acationic liposome 0afibroblast growth factor (FGF2) 0afusion cytotoxic gene 0alipid-based gene delivery1 aDriessen, Wouter H.

Between January 2006 and June 2009, 30 patients (20 males and 10 females; mean age 45 years, range 18-65; mean serum creatinine 6.3 ± 1.57 mg%) with calculus nephropathy were treated in our department. In 25 patients with obstructed and infected systems preliminary percutaneous nephrostomy or double J stenting was done. After stabilization and treatment of sepsis, percutaneous nephrolithotomy was done. Eight patients underwent bilateral procedure and 22 underwent unilateral procedure. Twenty-two patients needed a single sitting while eight patients needed two sittings for stone clearance. The renal function was monitored by serial creatinine estimations. Of the 30 patients, 27 patients achieved complete clearance. Renal function was improved in 27 patients. Six patients developed postoperative sepsis.

The fundamental theories involved in CE-ECL, e.g., the mechanism involving both coreactant-based and inhibitor-based ECL, as well as the possible analytes to be detected by CE-ECL are summarized. Different schemes for the construction of CE-ECL apparatus, including methods for preparing the working electrode, approaches for addition of ECL reagents, ways to fabricate electrical decouplers, and factors affecting ECL efficiency are reviewed. Discussion of the literature related to the application of CE-ECL from January 2005 to September 2010 is sorted by the corresponding analyte matrixes, namely, the standard solution, urine, serum and plasma, and other matrixes. Finally, possible trends for CE-ECL in the near future are discussed.

Real-time PCR analyses showed the abundance of Microcystis 16S rDNA gene copies in the Ulungur Lake is low, at 7.2 × 10⁴ copies L ⁻ ¹ averagely and 4.5 × 10⁵ copies L ⁻ ¹ at maximum. Two Microcystis species, M. aeruginosa (Kützing) Lemmermann and Microcystis wesenbergii (Komárek) Komárek were, for the first time, reported in this lake. The mcyA gene-specific PCR determination on the isolates of Microcystis showed that the M. aeruginosa strains are all mcyA-containing genotypes, while M. wesenbergii are non-mcyA-containing ones. The microcystin contents of the toxic M. aeruginosa strains were shown to be lower than those of the Microcystis strains isolated from other eutrophic lakes in China. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA and rpoC1 genes showed that the Microcystis strains isolated from the Ulungur Lake were not genetically divergent from those isolated in the other freshwaters. Such an investigation would contribute to the knowledge on the bloom-forming cyanobacteria of the increasingly eutrophic and saline lakes in the desert area. 3aMicrocystis wesenbergii 3aeutrophication 3agenes 3agenotype 3alakes 3amicrocystins 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3atoxicity 3aChina 0aLake Ulungur 0aReal-time PCR 0aHPLC 0aMicrocystin 0aMcy gene 0aBrackish lake1 aShen, Jianzhong 1 aLiu, Yang 1 aWu, Xingqiang 1 aLiu, Qigen 1 aLi, Renhui 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2011 Apr., v. 175, no. 1-4 p.139-150dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-010-1500-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110327b20110402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02048naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245009800169300001400267520112800281650001801409653002401427653001901451653002401470773013801494852000901632856008501641930003301726946001101759655001201770IND4451510020221118033333.0110326e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445151002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10901-010-9204-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Connie P.

The paper charts the marked change of direction seen since the 1980s, with a switch from a deregulated approach giving housing associations freedom from central control within a clear accounting framework to set rents at least to cover costs, to a more regulated rent-setting system based on individual property values and local earnings levels. Using rental data from housing associations' Regulatory and Statistical Returns, the study shows that social rents are now set on quasi-market principles that simulate some aspects of a real market reflecting the characteristics of the property, but continuing to be sub-market reflecting the lower household income of social tenants. However, the constraints of the rent-setting formula reduce the capacity of housing associations to undertake proper maintenance and improvement of existing stock. This will become a particular issue for those in London and the North of England where rents now only just cover operational costs. 3aaffordability 0aFinancial viability 0aSocial housing 0aRental differential0 tJournal of housing and the built environment HBE.g2011 Apr., v. 26, no. 1 p.85-97dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1566-49107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10901-010-9204-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20110327b20110402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02373naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245012600165300001400291520111000305650002101415650001301436650002001449650002201469650002301491650001401514650002101528650001701549650001901566650001601585650001301601650002201614653002501636653002701661700003001688773010701718852000901825856008501834930003301919946001101952655001201963IND4450685420221118033310.0110316e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445068542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-010-0469-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarceló, Juan.10aHyperaccumulation of trace elements: from uptake and tolerance mechanisms to litter decomposition; selenium as an example  ap. 31-35.  aHyperaccumulation of trace elements by plants is an attractive field of research with potential applications in phytoremediation of contaminated soils, biofortification of food with essential nutrients, and biofuel production. For these purposes, selenium is of special interest because areas with Se-deficient soils frequently are close to seleniferous soils. The use of Se-hyperaccumulating species for phytoremediation of soils with high Se burdens requires basic knowledge on the mechanisms of uptake, transport and tolerance of Se in plants. However, also a better understanding of the rhizosphere processes governing Se cycling is essential. Quinn et al. in this issue of Plant and Soil address, for the first time, the question of specialist decomposers presence and role in leaf litter from selenium hyperaccumulating plants in a seleniferous habitat. Their experimental results strongly support the involvement of selenium tolerant decomposers. This knowledge is of crucial importance for putting into practice integrated management systems for biofortification and phytoremediation technologies. 3abiofortification 3abiofuels 3afuel production 3ahyperaccumulators 3amanagement systems 3anutrients 3aphytoremediation 3aplant litter 3apolluted soils 3arhizosphere 3aselenium 3auptake mechanisms 0aLitter decomposition 0aSoil microbe diversity1 aPoschenrieder, Charlotte 0 tPlant and soil.g2011 Apr., v. 341, no. 1-2 p.31-35dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-010-0469-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20110316b20110402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02215naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245018700167300001600354520108600370650001701456653001001473653000901483653004501492700002301537700002001560700002301580700002101603773012701624852000901751856008501760930003301845946001101878655001201889IND4451458520221118033242.0110326e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445145852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00262-010-0953-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacini, Stefania 10aGc protein-derived macrophage-activating factor (GcMAF) stimulates cAMP formation in human mononuclear cells and inhibits angiogenesis in chick embryo chorionallantoic membrane assay  ap. 479-485.  aThe effects of Gc protein-derived macrophage-activating factor (GcMAF) have been studied in cancer and other conditions where angiogenesis is deregulated. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the mitogenic response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to GcMAF was associated with 3′-5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation. The effect was dose dependent, and maximal stimulation was achieved using 0.1 ng/ml. Heparin inhibited the stimulatory effect of GcMAF on PBMCs. In addition, we demonstrate that GcMAF (1 ng/ml) inhibited prostaglandin E₁- and human breast cancer cell-stimulated angiogenesis in chick embryo chorionallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Finally, we tested different GcMAF preparations on CAM, and the assay proved to be a reliable, reproducible and inexpensive method to determine the relative potencies of different preparations and their stability; we observed that storage at room temperature for 15 days decreased GcMAF potency by about 50%. These data could prove useful for upcoming clinical trials on GcMAF. 3aangiogenesis 0aGcMAF 0acAMP 0aPeripheral blood human mononuclear cells1 aMorucci, Gabriele 1 aPunzi, Tiziana 1 aGulisano, Massimo 1 aRuggiero, Marco 0 tCancer immunology, immunotherapy.g2011 Apr., v. 60, no. 4 p.479-485dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-70047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00262-010-0953-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20110327b20110402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02573naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245010400160300001600264520118400280650000801464650001201472650003001484650001901514650001001533650001401543650001001557650001301567650002101580650000701601650002101608650002401629650002601653650000901679653003801688653003601726653002001762700001701782700001401799700001901813700001901832773010201851852000901953856008501962939003302047946001102080655001202091IND4450666420221118033427.0110316e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445066642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-010-1907-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wujie 10aQualitative and Quantitative Determination of Oligonucleotides by Non-Gel Capillary Electrophoresis  ap. 579-582.  aA novel simple non-gel capillary electrophoresis (NGCE) method was developed for the qualitative and quantitative determination of oligonucleotides (ODNs). ODNs were synthesized in a DNA synthesizer and separated by NGCE under optimized conditions as follows: 25 mmol L⁻¹ Tris-boric-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) with 7 mmol L⁻¹ urea in the presence of 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 35000 at 30 °C and −20 kV. Single-base differences, in which there are differences in the base quantity and the single-base structure with the same base quantity, can be identified by the proposed method, and the quantitative determination was carried out. The obtained regression equation revealed a good linear relationship between the peak area ratio and the ODNs concentration. The correlation coefficient was 0.9986 and the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the precision was <3.6% (intro-day) and <6.2% (inter-day), respectively. The recoveries of three concentrations (high, middle, and low) were between 99.6% and 107.6%. The established method is sensitive, simple, economical, and can be used in gene mutation detection, pharmacokinetics study of nucleic acid drugs, and so on. 3aDNA 3abuffers 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achromatography 3adrugs 3aequations 3agenes 3amutation 3aoligonucleotides 3apH 3apharmacokinetics 3apolyethylene glycol 3aquantitative analysis 3aurea 0aNon-gel capillary electrophoresis 0aPolyethylene glycol (PEG) 35000 0aOligonucleotide1 aMa, Yinling 1 aGan, Zhu 1 aLing, Xiaomei 1 aYang, Zhenjun 0 tChromatographia.g2011 Mar., v. 73, no. 5-6 p.579-582dWiesbaden : Vieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-010-1907-03Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110327  aNon-US 7aarticle02788naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001700180245010000197300001600297500001500313520091800328650001801246650002201264650001101286650000901297650002501306650001401331650001701345650002501362650002501387650002101412650001501433650002201448650002401470650001201494650001801506650001801524650001601542650003601558650003501594650002001629650002801649650004201677650001401719650002301733650002701756650004801783653001201831653002401843653002801867653003901895700001701934700001501951773008201966852000902048930003302057945002502090946001102115655001202126IND4367130520221118032026.0050215e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436713052DNAL7 a156068072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In mammals and Caenorhabditis elegans, there is at least one gene each of the cytoplasmic, mitochondrial and extracellular lineages of SOD genes. The cytoplasmic SOD was one of the first enzymes to be implicated in ageing due to its protection against damaging oxygen free radicals. In contrast to other metazoans, insects were thought to lack a gene for the extracellular SOD. We have cloned and sequenced an SOD mRNA in the ant Laslus niger that appears to belong to this extracellular family. Subsequent searches and analyses of SOD gene sequences in insect databases revealed that insects do indeed express all three SOD genes including the extracellular form. We conclude that insects as well as other metazoans appear to have the full repertoire of the three families of SOD. 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3acopper 3azinc 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aphylogeny 3aLasius niger 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3amultigene family 3ametal ions 3asequence homology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBayes Theorem 2aDNA Primers 2aExtracellular Spacexmetabolism 2aInsectaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Amplification Techniques 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aInsecta 0amolecular phylogeny 0amolecular sequence data 0aextracellular superoxide dismutase1 aParker, K.M.1 aKeller, L.0 tInsect molecular biology.g2004 Dec., v. 13, no. 6 p.587-594x0962-10757nnas  aDNAL  a20050810b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/03/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02754naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001700180245012400197300001600321500001500337520076200352650001401114650001401128650000901142650001801151650001801169650001901187650002501206650002001231650002501251650002201276650002701298650001401325650002401339650001201363650004801375650002901423650001801452650005101470650002401521650001601545650002801561650001401589650004901603650002301652650002701675650002401702650002401726650003501750653001401785653002401799653002801823653001501851653002501866700001701891773008201908852000901990930003301999945002502032946001102057655001202068IND4364062320221118032111.0040824e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436406232DNAL7 a152712082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The species complex is composed of forms that differ in their ecology, behaviour, physiology and vector competence. Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) caused by endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria is thought to play an important role in restricting gene flow and the evolution of the Culex complex. Here we describe the first molecular marker useful for discriminating between Wolbachia infections in Culex. A putative bacteriophage locus (orf7) varies between Culex forms in copy number and sequence. We provide evidence that the orf7 loci are strictly associated with Wolbachia and are maternally inherited. 3acytotypes 3aWolbachia 3aloci 3aCulex pipiens 3aendosymbionts 3abacteriophages 3aamino acid sequences 3agenetic markers 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 3ainheritance (genetics) 3ainfection 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacteriophagesxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCulexxclassificationxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aCytoplasmxgenetics 2aDNA Primers 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSymbiosisxgenetics 2aWolbachiaxgeneticsxvirology. 0aCulicidae 0abacteriophage locus 0amolecular sequence data 0aorf7 locus 0amaternal inheritance1 aDobson, S.L.0 tInsect molecular biology.g2004 Aug., v. 13, no. 4 p.365-369x0962-10757nnas  aDNAL  a20050121b20050130c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/01/13  aNon-US 7aarticle00990naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001500117245004500132300001000177500001500187520031900202650001700521651001100538653002200549653001100571653001400582773006600596852000900662939003300671945000800704655001200712991627660970742620221118032108.0780701e19780223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7899122972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, B.10a50th year and all is well? not quite all  ap. 8.  a2019-12-06  aExtract: An interview with the President of Federated Co operatives Ltd. pinpoints the organization's weaknesses. members and staff will engage in special programs during 1978, the cooperative's fiftieth anniversary, to deal with problems of member complacency, competition, labor management tension and inflation. 3acooperatives 3aCanada 0aWestern provinces 0aRetail 0aconsumers0 pThe Western Producerg1978 Feb. 23, v. 55, no. 29 p.8-87nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19780701c00000000  aAGC 7aarticle01349naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245002400130300001600154500001500170520056000185650002300745650001300768650001200781653002300793653001000816653002500826653001800851700002300869773006800892852000900960939003300969945000801002946001301010655001201023991627655680742620221118031945.0860505e19850202xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860104302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies, I.10aAgeing and research  ap. 286-287.  a2019-12-04  aA commentary on and critique of a previously published report urges that the need and allocation of resources for aging research should not be restricted to studies of the molecular and cellular causes of aging.

Immunoreactive ecdysteroid levels were low on days 0-2, increased to higher values on days 3-6, and peaked on day 7 (about 5 ng of 20-hydroxyecdysone equivalents per pair of ovaries). The predominant non-conjugated ovarian ecdysteroid detected by HPLC analysis was 20-hydroxyecdysone. During oocyte maturation, the dynamics of patency, vitellogenin uptake, increase in follicle cells diameter (suggested to be due to polyploidy), and choriogenesis was studied. A comparison of the ovarian ecdysteroid profile with the succession of physiological processes occurring within the oocyte maturation cycle suggests that these hormones could be directly or indirectly involved in the control of patency, polyploidy and choriogenesis in the follicle cells. 3aBlattella germanica 3achorion 3aovarian development 3aecdysterone 3ajuvenile hormones 3aoocytes 3avitellogenesis 0aecdysteroids 0afollicles 0areproductive physiology1 aCerda, X.1 aBenito, B.1 aTomas, J.1 aPiulachs, M.D.1 aBellés, X.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1992 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.339-348x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01760naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245007000130300001600200300002100216520096700237650002301204650001301227650001501240650001901255653001801274653001401292700001701306773008201323852000901405939003301414946001101447655001201458IND9203283420221118031934.0920521s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920328342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDon-Wheeler, G.14aThe female- and male-produced vitellogenins of Leucophaea maderae  ap. 869-882.  ap. 869-882. ill.  aVitellogenin synthesis was induced in adult females and males as well as in last-instar nymphs of both sexes of Leucophaea maderae by the juvenile hormone analogue methoprene. Vitellogenic competency in females and males is developed during the last nymphal instar, but maximal vitellogenic competency in females is attained only after emergence. No increase in competency is observed for adult males. Once vitellogenic competency is established, last-instar female nymphs synthesize vitellogenin at a higher rate than either adult or last-instar males. Female- and male-produced vitellogenins are different in their polypeptide compositions. The difference in composition may reflect differences in vitellogenin processing in the female and male fat body. Female- and male-produced vitellogenins are taken up into competent oocytes at different rates in vitro and in vitro, i.e. the female-produced vitellogenin is preferred over the male-produced vitellogenin. 3aLeucophaea maderae 3afat body 3amethoprene 3avitellogenesis 0avitellogenins 0avitellins1 aEngelman, F.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1991, v. 37, no. 12 p.869-882x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02749naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011100127300001600238300002100254500001500275520190000290650002302190650001802213650001402231650001402245650002802259653002502287773008202312852000902394939003302403946001102436655001202447IND9203284120221118032047.0920521s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920328412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBohrmann, J.10aPotassium uptake into Drosophila ovarian follicles: relevance to physiological and developmental processes  ap. 937-946.  ap. 937-946. ill.  a2019-12-05  aThe origin of bioelectric phenomena in insect ovarian follicles is scarcely known and the presumption that these phenomena play an important role during development is still controversial. In the present study the K+ uptake mechanisms of vitellogenic Drosophila follicles were investigated in vitro using rubidium-86 as a probe. Follicles were exposed to the inhibitors 2,4-dinitrophenol, sodium azide, ouabain, 4-aminopyridine, tetraethylammonium chloride and barium chloride. The total K+ uptake changed stage-specifically and was different in anterior and posterior follicle halves. Maximal values were reached during mid-vitellogenesis (stage 10B), and at this stage K+ uptake into the posterior half (occupied by the oocyte with its columnar follicle cell epithelium) exceeded that into the anterior half (nurse cell with flat follicle cells) by 20%. This difference was probably due to ouabain-insensitive K+-pump(s) whereas the (Na+, K+)-pump was equally active in anterior and posterior halves and did not show stage-specific variations. The active K+ uptake into the anterior half increased during nurse-cell regression (stages 11 and 12). Active as well as passive K+ uptake increased with increasing extracellular pH. The used K+-channel blockers blocked K+ efflux but affected the passive K+ uptake only slightly. A juvenile hormone analogue and 20-hydroxyecdysone diminished the active K+ uptake, affecting the (Na+, K+-pump and the other K+-pump(s) differently. In the presence of ouabain or at alkaline pH, mid-vitellogenic follicles developed in vitro rather normally up to the end of oogenesis whereas the other inhibitors as well as acidic pH blocked the course of development. The relevance of these findings for intracellular pH-regulation, osmoregulation, growth, membrane potentials, ionic currents, intrafollicular transport and other developmental processes is discussed. 3anutrient transport 3aion transport 3aoogenesis 3apotassium 3aDrosophila melanogaster 0anutrition physiology0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1991, v. 37, no. 12 p.937-946x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02580naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011600126300001600242300002100258520145100279650002401730650001401754650002001768650001701788650001401805650001601819650001601835650002301851650001601874653002401890653003301914653002101947700001501968700001801983700001602001700001802017773008202035852000902117939003302126946001102159655001202170IND9203348620221118032001.0920522s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920334862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirch, H.J.10aMechanism of haemolysis of erythrocytes by haemolytic factors from Stomoxys calcitrans (L.) (Diptera: Muscidae)  ap. 851-861.  ap. 851-861. ill.  aHaemolysis in vitro of bovine erythrocytes by posterior midgut homogenate from stable flies displayed a sigmoidal pattern. The addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor to mixtures of midgut homogenate and erythrocytes reduced haemolytic and proteolytic activity equally. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that erythrocytes exposed to homogenate immediately transformed into echinocytes which released microvesicles from their membrane spicules. Subsequently, membrane spicules became blunt and cells developed membrane invaginations. Finally, at the onset and during the phase of rapid cell lysis, smooth spherocytes were formed. Some of these spherocytes had a single hole of about 1 micrometer in their plasma membrane which allowed intracellular material to escape. The morphological changes during the process of haemolysis were influenced by soybean trypsin inhibitor. However, the inhibitor did not impair the initial formation of echinocytes, but membrane invaginations and membrane holes were not noticed. Furthermore, cell ghosts remained in the presence of the soybean trypsin inhibitor even after haemolysis was completed. Haemolytic activity of homogenates was markedly reduced when bovine serum albumin was added to the assay medium. Albumin noticeably suppressed the formation of echinocytes. A mechanism for the haemolysis of bovine erythrocytes by midgut homogenate including detergent-like and enzymatic activities is presented. 3aStomoxys calcitrans 3adigestion 3aenzyme activity 3aerythrocytes 3ahemolysis 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3atrypsin inhibitors 3ahematophagy 0acell ultrastructure 0abovin erythrocyte morphology 0asphingomyelinase1 aSpates, G.1 aDroleskey, R.1 aKloft, W.J.1 aDeLoach, J.R.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1991, v. 37, no. 11 p.851-861x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02177naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009200124300001400216300001900230500001500249520125900264650001301523650001901536650002101555650001101576653002301587653001201610653001601622653002301638700001401661700001501675773008401690852000901774939003301783946001101816655001201827IND9302369320221118032029.0930421e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930236932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZupko, K.10aProteins of the honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) body surface and exocrine gland secretions  ap. 41-46.  ap. 41-46. ill.  a2019-12-05  aIn this paper, soluble proteins are demonstrated on the surface of the honeybee cuticle. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed an 80 kDa doublet on workers, queens, and drones showed a single band at a slightly higher molecular weight. Several additional queen- or drone-specific proteins were observed. The presence of soluble cuticular surface proteins may be a general phenomenon because they were also present on insects of two other orders, Orthoptera and Hemiptera. Exocrine gland secretions from the Nasanov glands of workers and the tarsal glands of both female castes and drones also contained soluble proteins. Proteins of tarsal gland secretions may contribute to the milieu of surface proteins because the electrophoretic profiles of cuticular proteins and tarsal secretions were similar. In contrast, the electrophoretic profile of proteins from Nasanov gland secretions was distinct from the profile of the tarsal gland secretion. Proteins on the cuticular surface or in exocrine gland secretions could also affect social interactions. Surface cuticular proteins and those associated with exocrine glands may function in pheromone degradation, as slow release substances, or as caste- or sex-specific modulators of pheromone activity. 3aproteins 3aApis mellifera 3asebaceous glands 3achitin 0aglandular proteins 0acuticle 0askin glands 0acuticular proteins1 aSklan, D.1 aLensky, Y.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1993 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.41-46x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02378naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245017700131300001600308300002100324520139000345650003001735650002501765650001501790650001801805650001701823650001601840650002201856650002001878700001501898773008601913852000901999939003302008946001102041655001202052IND9206110720221118031934.0921005e199206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920611072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDübendorfer, A.10aCell differentiation in vitro and establishment of permanent, ecdysone-responsive cell lines from embryonic tissues of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata  ap. 397-405.  ap. 397-405. ill.  aWhen embryos of the shortened germ-band stage of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, were mechanically broken up into small fragments and placed in Drosophila tissue culture medium, cells migrated out from the fragments and populated the culture chamber. Many cells differentiated into larval neurones, myocytes, haemocytes and epidermal cells. Subsequently, tissues such as ganglia, muscles, tracheae and larval epidermis with fully differentiated larval bristles developed without exogenous ecdysteroid hormones being applied. Perfect patterning of a cuticular structure (labium) resulted once in a culture that was treated with ecdysone. In the second week after setting up, many cultures produced masses of cellular vesicles which were maintained in vitro for several months. When the vesicles collapsed, undifferentiated, polygonal and spindle-shaped cells grew out and multiplied to confluency. From this material, we have established a permanent line (ZIZ-LD-1) with three sublines (1-3, 14 and 1-15) of L. decemlineata cells with a doubling time of 5 days. Upon treatment with ecdysone, the cells of the permanent line ZIZ-LD-1-4 aggregated, whilst control cultures remained disperse. This reaction must have been elicited by ecdysone itself since the cells did not hydroxylate ecdysone into 20-hydroxyecdysone, even after incubation periods of up to 5 days. 3aLeptinotarsa decemlineata 3acell differentiation 3acell lines 3aculture media 3aecdysteroids 3aplant pests 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aembryo (animal)1 aLiebig, B.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1992 June, v. 38, no. 6 p.397-405x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02105naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245015300130300001600283300002100299500001500320520108500335650001301420650002201433650001701455650001801472650001001490650001301500650002501513650001101538653002201549700001801571700001501589773008601604852000901690939003301699946001101732655001201743IND9206111720221118032049.0921005e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920611172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoribayashi, A.10aPhysiological differentiation of the ring glands in mature larvae of the flesh fly, Boettcherisca peregrina, programmed for diapause or non-diapause  ap. 177-183.  ap. 177-183. ill.  a2019-12-05  aPupariation time, pupariation of parts anterior to ligatures and the activities of ring glands to secrete ecdysteroid were compared between diapause- and non-diapause-destined larvae of Boettcherisca peregrina. Diapause-destined larvae pupariated 1 day later than non-diapause-destined larvae. When a ligature was tied at the 11th segment of the larval body, the anterior parts of both diapause and non-diapause larvae were able to pupariate. The anterior parts of diapause-destined larvae ligated at the 10th segment pupariated at a higher rate (40%) than those of non-diapause-destined larvae ligated at the same segment (5%). The isolated ring glands of diapause-destined larvae secreted 6.0 ng of ecdysteroid per gland into the medium for 4 h culture even without the addition of brain extract and those of non-diapause-destained larvae secreted only 0.4 ng per gland. From these findings, it is suggested that there is a difference between diapause- and non-diapause-destined larvae in the role and function of the brain and the ability of the ring gland to secrete ecdysone. 3aextracts 3ahormone secretion 3aecdysteroids 3aanimal glands 3abrain 3adiapause 3aSarcophaga peregrina 3alarvae 0aanimal physiology1 aKurahashi, H.1 aOhtaki, T.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1992 Mar., v. 38, no. 3 p.177-183x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01592naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245015900126300001600285300002100301520074600322650002801068650002401096650001901120650001601139700002001155773008601175852000901261939003301270946001101303655001201314IND9206223220221118032110.0921008e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920622322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYocum, G.D.10aProlonged thermotolerance in the flesh fly, Sarcophaga crassipalpis, does not require continous expression or persistence of the 72 kDa heat-shock protein  ap. 603-609.  ap. 603-609. ill.  aA brief exposure to a supraoptimal temperature (35-45 degrees C) induced thermotolerance in pharate adults of the flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis. While a 90 min exposure to 45 degrees C was normally lethal to flies reared at 25 degrees C, a brief pretreatment at high temperature generated protection from heat-shock injury. The induction of thermotolerance was dependent upon both the temperature and duration of the pretreatment, and in this study maximal thermotolerance was induced by a 2 h exposure to 40 degrees C. Thermotolerance induced by a 2 h exposure to 40 degrees C decayed slowly over a 72 h period.

In order to improve the growth of P. thunbergii seedling in the Tottori sand dune, we tried to find a mycorrhiza helper bacteria (MHB) from P. thunbergii mycorrhizosphere in a Tottori sand dune. Two MHB, Ralstonia sp. and Bacillus subtilis, were selected from the nine bacterial species isolated from the mycorrhizosphere of P. thunbergii. The bacterial effect on the ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus granulatus was investigated by confrontation assay and a microcosm experiment. The confrontation assay showed that Ralstonia sp. promoted the hyphal growth of S. granulatus. Moreover, the S. granulatus-P. thunbergii symbiosis was significantly stimulated by Ralstonia sp. and B. subtilis. Ralstonia sp. and B. subtilis were regarded as MHB associated with P. thunbergii.

Compost pile temperature reflected the initiation and stabilization of the composting process. The pH, electrical conductivity, NO₃ ⁻-N content, and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio were measured as chemical properties of the compost. The color (CIELAB variables), humification index (the absorption ratio Q ₄/₆ = A ₄₇₂ / A ₆₆₄ of 0.5 M NaOH extracts), absorption at 665 nm of acetone extracts, and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured to evaluate the organic matter transformation; germination of komatsuna or tomato seeds was measured to assess the potential phytotoxicity of composting materials during composting. No single parameter was capable of giving substantial information on the composting process, the nutrient balance, phytotoxicity, and organic matter decomposition. The FT-IR spectra at 3,300, 2,930, 2,852, and 1,065 cm⁻¹ provided information on the molecular transformation of GRC during composting and they decreased over the composting. Most of the assayed parameters showed no further change after about 90 days of composting suggesting that GRC can be used for agricultural purposes after this period. 3aBrassica rapa subsp. nipposinica var. perviridis 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aacetone 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acolor 3acomposting 3acomposts 3aelectrical conductivity 3agermination 3agreen tea 3ahumification 3anitrate nitrogen 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphytotoxicity 3arice bran 3aseeds 3asodium hydroxide 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3awastes 0aGreen tea waste 0aStability indices1 aUeno, Kihachi 1 aHorimoto, Sakae 1 aKomai, Fuminori 1 aTanaka, Kinji 1 aOno, Yoshitaka 0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2009 Feb., v. 45, no. 3 p.305-313dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-008-0335-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090130b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02951naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245017200125300001800297300002300315520191300338650002202251650002302273650002702296650001202323650001302335650001102348650001302359650001902372650002802391700001802419700001902437773009002456852000902546939003302555946001302588655001202601IND9000842320221118032021.0900226e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900084232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoar, W.J.10aComparative toxicity of spores and crystals from the NRD-1 and HD-1 strains of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki to neonate beet armyworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 1593-1603.  ap. 1593-1603. ill.  aThe toxicities of different components of the spore-parasporal body complex of the NRD-12 and HD-1 strains of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Berliner) to neonate Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) were determined using diet incorporation bioassays. The LC50's of NRD-12 and HD-1 from lyophilized powders obtained from sporulated liquid cultures were 20.8 micrograms per milliliter diet and 49.3 micrograms per milliliter diet, respectively. Both strains produced a bipyramidal crystal containing a 135-kDa (kilodalton) protein (P1) and a cuboidal crystal containing a 65-kDa protein (P2). Preparations of the NRD-12 P1 crystal (LC50 = 63.0 micrograms per milliliter diet) were more toxic than similar preparations of HD-1 (LC50 = 153 micrograms per milliliter diet). Alternatively, the P2 crystal from HD-1 (LC50 = 34.2 micrograms per milliliter diet) was more toxic than preparations of the NRD-12 P2 crystal (LC50 = 72.4 micrograms per milliliter diet). Combinations of the P1 and P2 crystals of NRD-12 were more toxic (LC50 = 82.0 micrograms per milliliter diet) than HD-1 P1/P2 preparations (LC50 = 157 micrograms per milliliter diet). Spore preparations from HD-1 (LC50 = 117 micrograms per milliliter diet) were slightly more toxic than those from NRD-12 (LC50 = 166 micrograms per milliliter diet). Significant (P less than or equal to 0.0005) potentiation resulted when the LC25 of spores was added (1:1 wt/wt) to the LC25 of the 65-kDa/135-kDa protein combination from the same isolate. Significant (P less than or equal to 0.005) potentiation also was observed when NRD-12 spores were added to HD-1 crystal protein and when HD-1 spores were added to the NRD-12 crystal protein. However, there was no difference in toxicity between these two combinations. These data suggest that the comparatively high toxicity of NRD-12 to S. exigua is due at least in part to the 135-kDa proteins of this strain. 3aSpodoptera exigua 3abiological control 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3astrains 3acrystals 3aspores 3atoxicity 3ainsect control 3ainsecticidal properties1 aTrumble, J.T.1 aFederici, B.A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1989 Dec., v. 82, no. 6 p.1593-1603x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01929naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245007300160300001600233520100200249653003401251653002201285653002101307653002701328700002201355773012401377852000901501856008501510930003301595946001101628655001201639IND4415663520221118032016.0090130e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441566352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10874-008-9116-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoupa, G. 10aAir pollutant emission rates and concentrations in medieval churches  ap. 169-187.  aA series of indoor air quality parameters were determined in two medieval churches, in Cyprus (temperature, relative humidity, total and UV solar radiation, CO₂ indoors and O₃, NO, NO₂ *, HNO₃ *, HCl, HCOOH, CH₃COOH indoors and outdoors). These data were used as input in a validated indoor air quality model to predict indoor air pollutant source strengths and species concentrations that resulted from dark or photochemical reactions. The NO and NO₂ emission rates due to the burning of incense or candles were estimated. Model results revealed that heterogeneous NO formation takes place simultaneously with the heterogeneous HONO formation. Also, model application has shown that indoor NOx emissions resulted in decreased free radical concentrations, in contrast to the organic compound emissions, which increased free radical concentrations.

Using segment-level panel data on land values and irrigation status, we measure the extent to which irrigation restrictions are capitalized into irrigated and nonirrigated cropland values in Nebraska. On average, irrigation restrictions did not have a measurable impact on farmland values across 1999–2012. However, our results show that the effects of the restrictions vary considerably over time and that basins that were more dependent on irrigation were disproportionately impacted by the restrictions. 3aagricultural industry 3abasins 3acropland 3afarmland values 3airrigation 3awater shortages 3aNebraska 3aWestern United States1 aBigelow, Daniel P.1 aSavage, Jeffrey0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g2018 May, v. 43, no. 2 p.195-214dWestern Agricultural Economics AssociationwJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas40uhttp://www.waeaonline.org/UserFiles/file/JARE431_v2.pdf  aDNAL 7aarticle01611naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245003600133300001600169520081900185650002601004650001801030650002801048650002501076700002501101773016501126856005701291852000901348655001201357IND60604463120221118031804.0180717e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060446312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, Gareth P.10aDiscounting Environmental Goods  ap. 215-232.  aUnderstanding  individual  discounting  behavior  of  future  costs  and  benefits  is  critical  for designing  environmental  policy.

Sound is produced in the syrinx and then modified by the upper vocal tract. Movements of the hyoid skeleton have been shown in the northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) to be extensively involved in forming an oropharyngeal-esophageal cavity (OEC), which contributes a major resonance to the vocal tract transfer function. Here we report that a similar relationship exists between the volume of the OEC and the fundamental frequency in the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis) whose song, unlike that of the cardinal, consists of a series of almost constant frequency notes. Cineradiography of singing sparrows shows that the oropharyngeal cavity and cranial end of the esophagus expand abruptly at the start of each note and maintain a relatively constant volume until the end of the note. Computation of the vocal tract transfer function suggests a major resonance of the OEC follows the fundamental frequency, making sound transmission more efficient. The presence of similar prominent song-related vocal tract motor patterns in two Oscine families suggests that the active control of the vocal tract resonance by varying the volume of the OEC may be widespread in songbirds.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPasseriformes 3aanimal communication 3aesophagus 3aphysiology 3aradiography 3askeleton 3asongbirds1 aSuthers, Roderick A. 0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2009 Feb., v. 195, no. 2 p.183-192dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-008-0397-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20090130b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02670naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010300164300001600267520144400283650002501727650001601752650002601768650001601794650001001810650001201820650001901832650002401851650001501875650001901890650001401909650001301923650001301936650002101949700002301970773012901993852000902122856008502131930003302216946001102249655001202260IND4415685120221118031803.0090130e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441568512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-008-0399-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chunbo 10aLake char (Salvelinus namaycush) olfactory neurons are highly sensitive and specific to bile acids  ap. 203-215.  aBile acids have been implicated as chemical signals in spawning behaviour of lake char (Salvelinus namaycush). In this study, we investigated olfactory responses of lake char to bile acids by using the electro-olfactogram recording. Lake char detected 9 out of 38 bile acids tested at thresholds 0.02-0.5 nM. The most stimulatory included chenodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, and taurolithocholic acid 3α-sulphate. Structure-activity analysis indicated that substituents in the side chain or hydroxyl sulphation were determinant elements for the recognition of individual bile acid receptors, while the position and orientation of hydroxyls or the type of amidation were important for effective stimulation. Three distinct types of concentration-response relationships were found, representing free, taurine- or glycine-amidated, and 3α-sulphated bile acids. Cross-adaptation and binary mixture experiments revealed the presence of multiple olfactory receptors for bile acids. Lake char were also capable of detecting petromyzonol sulphate at 1 nM, possibly via its own receptors. Our study further showed that the olfactory responses to bile acids were independent of those of known odorants including amino acids, prostaglandins and gonadal steroids. We conclude that lake char possess multiple olfactory receptors capable of discriminating bile acids produced and released by conspecifics. 3aSalvelinus namaycush 3aamino acids 3achenodeoxycholic acid 3acholic acid 3alakes 3aneurons 3aodor compounds 3aolfactory receptors 3aphysiology 3aprostaglandins 3areceptors 3aspawning 3asteroids 3ataurocholic acid1 aHara, Toshiaki J. 0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2009 Feb., v. 195, no. 2 p.203-215dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-008-0399-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090130b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03930naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245004400186300001600230520210900246650002802355650001102383650001702394650001402411650002102425650001602446650001202462650001002474650003502484650001202519650001102531650001102542650001202553650001702565650001202582650001202594650004402606650003602650650004002686650004302726650001102769650003202780650002402812650003002836650002502866650002802891653000802919653001502927653001902942653003802961700002802999700001903027773012003046852000903166856008503175930003303260946001103293655001203304IND4415679220221118032101.0090130e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441567922DNAL7 a189721342pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-008-0708-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeenstra, Jan A. 10aRegulatory peptides in fruit fly midgut  ap. 499-516.  aRegulatory peptides were immunolocalized in the midgut of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Endocrine cells were found to produce six different peptides: allatostatins A, B and C, neuropeptide F, diuretic hormone 31, and the tachykinins. Small neuropeptide-F (sNPF) was found in neurons in the hypocerebral ganglion innervating the anterior midgut, whereas pigment-dispersing factor was found in nerves on the most posterior part of the posterior midgut. Neuropeptide-F (NPF)-producing endocrine cells were located in the anterior and middle midgut and in the very first part of the posterior midgut. All NPF endocrine cells also produced tachykinins. Endocrine cells containing diuretic hormone 31 were found in the caudal half of the posterior midgut; these cells also produced tachykinins. Other endocrine cells produced exclusively tachykinins in the anterior and posterior extemities of the midgut. Allatostatin-immunoreactive endocrine cells were present throughout the midgut. Those in the caudal half of the posterior midgut produced allatostatins A, whereas those in the anterior, middle, and first half of the posterior midgut produced allatostatin C. In the middle of the posterior midgut, some endocrine cells produced both allatostatins A and C. Allatostatin-C-immunoreactive endocrine cells were particularly prominent in the first half of the posterior midgut. Allatostatin B/MIP-immunoreactive cells were not consistently found and, when present, were only weakly immunoreactive, forming a subgroup of the allatostatin-C-immunoreactive cells in the posterior midgut. Previous work on Drosophila and other insect species suggested that (FM)RFamide-immunoreactive endocrine cells in the insect midgut could produce NPF, sNPF, myosuppressin, and/or sulfakinins. Using a combination of specific antisera to these peptides and transgenic fly models, we showed that the endocrine cells in the adult Drosophila midgut produced exclusively NPF. Although the Drosophila insulin gene Ilp3 was abundantly expressed in the midgut, Ilp3 was not expressed in endocrine cells, but in midgut muscle. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aadults 3aallatostatin 3aantiserum 3adiuretic hormone 3afruit flies 3aganglia 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ainsulin 3amidgut 3amodels 3amuscles 3anerve tissue 3aneurons 2aAnimals 2aDigestive Systemxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aDrosophila Proteinsxmetabolism 2aDrosophila melanogasterxmetabolism 2aEndocrine Cellsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aInsect Hormonesxmetabolism 2aInsulinxmetabolism 2aNeuropeptidesxmetabolism 2aPeptidesxmetabolism 2aTachykininsxmetabolism 0aNPF 0aTachykinin 0aEndocrine cell 0aDrosophila melanogaster (Insecta)1 aAgricola, Hans-Jürgen 1 aSellami, Azza 0 tCell and tissue research.g2008 Dec., v. 334, no. 3 p.499-516dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-008-0708-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20090130b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03975naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245012900184300001600313520188000329650001802209650001102227650001002238650001802248650002702266650001702293650001102310650001802321650001102339650001002350650002102360650001402381650001002395650001202405650002302417650001202440650005002452650006202502650002602564650003502590650004602625650002902671650003302700650004702733650004102780650003602821650003302857650002202890650003202912653000902944653001602953653001502969653001302984653003902997700001903036773012003055852000903175856008503184930003303269946001103302655001203313IND4415679120221118032107.0090130e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441567912DNAL7 a189535692pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-008-0703-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuehn, Claudia 10aExpression of two different isoforms of fasciclin II during postembryonic central nervous system remodeling in Manduca sexta  ap. 477-498.  aInsect metamorphosis serves as a useful model to investigate postembryonic development in the central nervous system, because the transformation between larval and adult life is accompanied by a remodeling of neural circuitry. Most changes are controlled by ecdysteroids, but activity-dependent mechanisms and cell surface signals also play a role. This immunocytochemical study investigates the expression patterns of two isoforms of the neural cell adhesion molecule, fasciclin II (FasII), during postembryonic ventral nerve cord remodeling in the moth, Manduca sexta. Both the expression of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked isoform and the transmembrane isoform of Manduca FasII (TM-MFasII) are regulated in a stereotyped spatio-temporal pattern. TM-MFasII is expressed in a stage-specific manner in a subset of neurons. Subsets of central axons express high levels during outgrowth supporting a functional role for TM-FasII during pathfinding. Dendritic localization is not found at any stage of metamorphosis, suggesting no homophilic interactions of TM-MFasII during central synapse development. GPI-MFasII is expressed in a stage-specific manner, most likely only in glial cells. The larval and adult stages show almost no GPI-MFasII expression, whereas during pupal life, positive GPI-MFasII labeling is present around synaptotagmin-negative tracts or commissures, so that either homophilic stabilization of glial boundaries or heterophilic neuron-glial interactions possibly stabilize the axons within their tracts. GPI-MFasII expression is not co-localized with synaptotagmin-positive central terminals, rendering a role for synapse development unlikely. Neither isoform is expressed in all neurons of a specific class at any developmental stage, indicating that MFasII functions are restricted to specific subsets of neurons or to individual neurons. 3aManduca sexta 3aadults 3aaxons 3acell adhesion 3acentral nervous system 3aecdysteroids 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3amodels 3amoths 3aneurodevelopment 3aneuroglia 3apupae 3asynapse 3aventral nerve cord 2aAnimals 2aCell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronalxmetabolism 2aCentral Nervous Systemxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDendritesxmetabolism 2aGangliaxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aGlycosylphosphatidylinositolsxmetabolism 2aGrowth Conesxmetabolism 2aLarvaxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aManducaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMotor Neuronsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aNeuropilxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aProtein Isoformsxmetabolism 2aProtein Transport 2aPupaxcytologyxmetabolism. 0aNCAM 0aDevelopment 0aMotoneuron 0aDendrite 0aSilk moth, Manduca sexta (Insecta)1 aDuch, Carsten 0 tCell and tissue research.g2008 Dec., v. 334, no. 3 p.477-498dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-008-0703-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20090130b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02354naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008200127300001800209300002300227520147400250650001201724650001401736650002001750650002801770650002101798650001601819650001601835650001601851651001601867773009001883852000901973939003301982946001302015655001202028IND9002118620221118031944.0900314e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900211862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarker, G.M.10aGrass host preferences of Listronotus bonariensis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)  ap. 1807-1816.  ap. 1807-1816. ill.  aHost plant preferences for feeding and oviposition by adult Listronotus bonariensis (Kuschel) were determined in multiple-choice experiments in the field and laboratory using 19 grasses. Feeding intensity was negatively correlated with fiber (cellulose + hemicellulose + lignin) content of foliage, possibly indicating an effect of leaf toughness on feeding. Oviposition preferences were correlated with feeding intensity; 29-86% of the variation in egg numbers per plant was accounted for in numbers of feeding scars on these plants. Numbers of eggs deposited in the plants were negatively correlated with the density of intercoastal silica deposits (inclusive of trichomes) in the abaxial surface of the grass sheaths. A causal relationship between silicification and oviposition preference was confirmed in a pot experiment where increased silica uptake and deposition reduced egg-laying on two ryegrass cultivars. The dispersion of eggs in the various grasses also was apparently related to the density and distribution of intercostal silica deposits and trichomes on the sheath. Feeding and oviposition on 'Grasslands Nui' ryegrass, Lolium perenne L., were reduced by plant infection by the endophytic fungus Acremonium lolii Latch, Christensen & Samuels. In the absence of A. lolii infection, ryegrass cultivars of L. multiflorum L. parentage were preferred over L. perenne cultivars. These results are briefly discussed in relation to breeding of forage grasses. 3agrasses 3acultivars 3apest resistance 3aListronotus bonariensis 3afeeding behavior 3aoviposition 3ahost plants 3aplant pests 3aNew Zealand0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1989 Dec., v. 82, no. 6 p.1807-1816x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02086naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011200126300001400238300002000252500001500272520090500287650003001192650002301222650002101245650002301266650001901289650002701308651001301335653001901348653002801367700001701395700001801412700001601430700002001446700001901466700001801485700002001503773008601523852000901609939003301618946001301651655001201664IND9001155020221118031929.0900320e199002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900115502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorse, R.A.14aThe population density of feral colonies of honey bees (Hymenoptera: Aphidae) in a city in upstate New York  ap. 81-83.  ap. 81-83. maps.  a2019-12-05  aIn Oswego, a city in upstate New York, a search for all honey bee, Apis mellifera L., colonies in an area of 4.2 km2 (1.6 square miles) revealed 12 colonies. All but one of the colonies were feral, living in tree cavities and the walls of buildings. The observed density was 2.7 colonies per km2 (7.0 feral colonies per square mile). Oswego may be considered typical of the smaller cities in the northeastern United States, with many older wooden houses and streets lined with large trees. The high frequency of feral honey bee colonies in cities, many in inaccessible areas, adds considerably to the difficulty of controlling nuisance bees, as well as noxious bee mites and other honey bee disease agents for which feral colonies constitute reservoirs of infection. Our data make clear that ordinances against beekeeping would not significantly reduce the number of colonies living in an urban area. 3aApis mellifera scutellata 3aintroduced species 3aVarroa jacobsoni 3apopulation density 3ainsect control 3aAfricanized honey bees 3aNew York 0aApis mellifera 0awild honey bee colonies1 aCamazine, S.1 aFerracane, M.1 aMinacci, P.1 aNowogrodzki, R.1 aRatnieks, L.W.1 aSpielholz, J.1 aUnderwood, B.A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1990 Feb., v. 83, no. 1 p.81-83x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01901naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014100127300001600268300002100284520093400305650001101239650002001250650001901270650003301289651001301322653001401335700001801349700001601367700001801383700001901401773008801420852000901508939003301517946001301550655001201563IND9204441620221118032128.0920715e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920444162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBryant, V.M.10aTechniques for studying pollen adhering to nectar-feeding corn earworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) moths using scanning electron microscopy  ap. 237-240.  ap. 237-240. ill.  aCorn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), male moths (399) were collected from sex pheromone traps during spring and late summer for determination and identification of attached pollen. Comparisons made between dissecting light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) show that direct mounting and viewing by SEM is a much more reliable technique for locating and separating pollen from other debris and for identifying pollen types. Red fingernail polish provides good conductive surfaces and better bonding for mounting specimens to SEM stubs than does silver paint and several other mounting media. Viewing all moth specimens by SEM is more costly, but added cost is partially offset by time saved in eliminating the preliminary examination by dissecting microscopes (approximately 15 min per specimen). About 3.5 h are required for preparation, analysis, and reporting results from individual moth specimens when using only SEM. 3apollen 3aHelicoverpa zea 3anectar feeding 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aOklahoma 0amigration1 aPendleton, M.1 aMurry, R.E.1 aLingren, P.D.1 aRaulston, J.R.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1991 Feb., v. 84, no. 1 p.237-240x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02111naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010700129300001600236300002800252520109700280650001101377650001401388650002301402650002301425650001701448650001101465650001601476650001601492651001001508651001501518700002301533700002101556700001701577773008801594852000901682939003301691946001301724655001201737IND9204407420221118032254.0920714e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920440742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenedict, J.H.10aPollens ingested by boll weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico  ap. 126-131.  ap. 126-131. ill., maps.  aBoll weevils, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman, were collected in 1978-1980 from grandlure-baited traps in the Lower Gulf Coast (LGC) and the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of southern Texas, and in northeastern Mexico (NEM). The weevils were dissected, and the midgut was removed and examined for the presence of pollen grains. Pollen grains representing 12 families of plants were found in boll weevils from the LRGV, 9 families of plants from the LGC, and 6 families of plants from NEM. The most frequently encountered pollen grains were from plants in the families Poaceae (grasses), Brassicaceae (mustards), and Asteraceae (sunflowers and daisies). Some ingested pollen grains could not be identified. In a separate no-choice study, boll weevils were caged on 22 species of plants during blooming to document pollen feeding. Twenty to 100% of the boll weevils caged on a plant species consumed pollen from that species. These data suggest that adult boll weevils in the field may consume pollen from a wide range of plant species; however, further studies are required to confirm this. 3apollen 3aingestion 3aAnthonomus grandis 3ainsect attractants 3ainsect traps 3amidgut 3ahost plants 3aplant pests 3aTexas 3aNew Mexico1 aWolfenbarger, D.A.1 aBryant, V.M.

Hypothesis: an increase in the productivity of direct solar energy will be achieved if, by redistribution, it is intercepted at a more uniform and lower intensity by a greater proportion of the leaf area of a crop. A model is developed which uses estimates of the proportions of clear and overcast conditions from site records of solar radiation to calculate the resultant photosynthetic productivity. The amounts of diffuse light and direct light are estimated for clear conditions. The model predicts that redistributing direct solar radiation over twice the leaf area at half the intensity would give an increase of 22% in annual productivity. The model gives reasonable values for the productivity reductions reported for two shading regimes. Tomato plants were grown for 21 d in three cabinets under regimes that differed from each other only in the distribution of PAR energy over the daily photoperiod: (a) 103 W m-2 for half the photoperiod followed by 13 W m-2, (b) 13 W m-2 followed by 103 W m-2 and (c) 58 W m-2 for the whole photoperiod. The dry matter increase of plants under the uniform regime was 33% greater than the average of those in the two asymmetric regimes. It is suggested that, in protected cultivation, screens of partially reflective material could be used to redistribute solar radiation from leaves exposed to high intensities on to shaded leaves and so raise the photosynthetic efficiency. Assuming an absorption of direct light by the screens of 0.10, the increase in productivity is estimated to be 17%. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aphotosynthesis 3asolar radiation 3alight intensity 3aleaf area 3aphotoperiod 3adry matter accumulation 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 0aconversion efficiency 0alight interception0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1989 Aug., v. 40, no. 217 p.855-864x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03307naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245013200130300001600262300002100278500001500299520221000314650002102524650002202545650002202567650001402589650002102603650002002624650001202644650001802656650001002674653001802684653001602702700001702718700001602735700001502751773009002766852000902856939003302865946001102898655001202909IND9002612220221118031521.0900604e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900261222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobertson, J.M.10aDevelopmental responses to drought and abscisic acid in sunflower roots. I. Root growth, apical anatomy, and osmotic adjustment  ap. 325-337.  ap. 325-337. ill.  a2019-12-05  aAeroponically grown sunflower seedlings (Helianthus annuus L. cv. Russian Giant) were droughted or treated with abscisic acid (ABA) for 7 d. Drought stress prompted a three-phase growth response in sunflower roots: an initial phase of increased root elongation was followed by a period of almost complete inhibition between about 6 h and 72 h; this was followed, in turn, by a phase of partial recovery in the rate of root elongation. Drought decreased the size of the apical meristem as cells in the proximal region of the meristem vacuolated and elongated. Root-to-shoot biomass ratios (R:S) increased initially but declined after 72 h. Drought stress decreased water potential and osmotic potential and increased turgor pressure in the apical 3.0 mm of the roots. These initial changes were transitory, lasting about 3 h. Thereafter, water potential and osmotic potential began to rise; turgor pressure fell back to control levels. In the later stages of treatment, water potential fell as the stress grew more severe, but turgor pressure was maintained by osmotic adjustment. Desiccation for 1 h increased turgor pressures in excised 3.0 mm apical segments. The transitory increase in root elongation was contemporary with the initial rise in turgor pressure in the root apices, while the periods of greatest inhibition and partial recovery in root elongation were contemporary with the periods of decline and partial recovery in the length of the apical meristem respectively. The inhibition of root elongation and the anatomical changes in the root apices were not determined by loss of turgor or lack of photosynthate, but rather appeared to be an active response by the meristem to a drop in external water potential. Treatment with ABA triggered many of the same changes as drought stress: ABA promoted a three-phase growth response, increased R:S, triggered the same initial changes in water potential, osmotic potential, and turgor pressure increased turgor pressure in excised 3.0 mm apical segments, and induced the same pattern of anatomical changes in the root apices as drought stress. It is proposed that ABA mediates drought-induced changes in the primary development of sunflower roots. 3aapical meristems 3aplant development 3aHelianthus annuus 3aseedlings 3aosmotic pressure 3astress response 3adrought 3aabscisic acid 3aroots 0aplant anatomy 0agrowth rate1 aHubick, K.T.1 aYeung, E.C.1 aReid, D.M.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1990 Mar., v. 41, no. 224 p.325-337x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01981naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007600127300001600203300002100219500001500240520098500255650001901240650001301259650002201272650001801294650001401312650001701326650001701343650002301360650001101383653001501394653001401409653001501423700001401438773009001452852000901542939003301551946001101584655001201595IND9003841220221118031616.0900810e199004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900384122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalone, R.P.10aMutagenesis and triazine herbicide effects in strawberry shoot cultures  ap. 463-469.  ap. 463-469. ill.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of simazine on shoot culture of two varieties of strawberry were investigated with a view to establishing a system for in vitro selection of resistant mutants. In single shoots some chlorophyll loss occurred at herbicide levels producing little growth inhibition, but efficient bleaching was associated with severe suppression of growth. Varying simazine and sucrose levels, in both single and multiple shoot cultures did not reveal any conditions where chlorophyll destruction and growth inhibition could be separated. A protective effect, against bleaching, of high sucrose levels was not linked to suppression of photosynthesis, as assessed by CO2-fixation measurements. Mutagenesis with nitrosomethyl urea resulted in chlorophyll deficiencies in about 10% of shoots arising from axillary buds, but no resistant sectors emerged from 8000 and 400 mutagenized explants placed on medium containing inhibitory levels of simazine and streptomycin sulphate, respectively. 3atissue culture 3asimazine 3aFragaria ananassa 3aphytotoxicity 3avarieties 3amutagenicity 3astreptomycin 3agrowth retardation 3ashoots 0aresistance 0atriazines 0ainhibitors1 aDix, P.J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1990 Apr., v. 41, no. 225 p.463-469x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01787naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245007300124300001600197300002100213500001500234520085600249650001401105650002201119650001301141650002201154650001501176650001001191650001101201651001101212653002201223653002301245700001401268773009001282852000901372939003301381946001101414655001201425IND9002611520221118031639.0900604e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900261152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Y.L.10aInvolvement of tRNA bound cytokinin on the gall formation in Zizania  ap. 277-281.  ap. 277-281. ill.  a2019-12-05  aTo understand the role of the conjugated forms of cytokinin in gall formation, tRNA was extracted and purified from vegetative and flowering shoots of Zizania, then hydrolysed by RNase T1 or acid to release the conjugated forms of cytokinin. The results indicated that the level of cis-zeatin riboside from Zizania gall tissue was 3 to 5 times higher than that of flowering Zizania, and the cytokinin activity in terms of kinetin equivalence was 1.6 times higher in Zizania gall tissue than that of flowering Zizania. It was found that higher amounts of cytokinin also promote protein synthesis. Due to the difference in levels of the conjugated forms of cytokinin between vegetative and flowering Zizania shoots, it is implied that the conjugated form of cytokinin may play an important role during the process of gall formation in Zizania latifolia. 3aflowering 3aprotein synthesis 3aUstilago 3aZizania latifolia 3acytokinins 3agalls 3ashoots 3aTaiwan 0aplant development 0austilago esculenta1 aLin, C.H.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1990 Mar., v. 41, no. 224 p.277-281x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01627naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009000124300001600214300002100230500001500251520053000266650001500796650000800811650001500819650001900834650001400853650001500867651002800882651003000910653002000940653001500960653002400975653001500999653002301014653002001037700001701057773009001074852000901164939003301173946001101206655001201217IND9004809720221118031624.0900928e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900480972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaier, I.10aChemotaxis in Laminaria digitata (Phaeophyceae).

Cell separation is preceded by an increase in the activity of the hydrolytic enzyme cellulase (beta 1,4-glucanase, E.C. 3.1.2.4), and this rise in enzyme activity is restricted to the dehiscence zone cells. In contrast, the activity of the cell wall degrading enzyme polygalacturonase (E.C. 3.2.1.15) exhibits no correlation either temporally or spatially with pod dehiscence. An analysis of the ethylene production profile by intact pods during maturation has revealed the existence of an ethylene climacteric and this is temporally correlated with the tissue-specific increase in cellulase activity. The major site of ethylene production by the fruit has been identified to be the developing seed. Since maintenance of intact pods in ethylene accelerates both the senescence and dehiscence of the tissue, it is possible that this gaseous regulator plays an important role in the process of pod shatter in vivo. 3aseeds 3acell walls 3apolygalacturonase 3acellulases 3aethylene production 3adehiscence 3aBrassica napus 3aultrastructure 3aenzyme activity 3apods 0aplant anatomy 0adehiscence zone1 aRoberts, J.A.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1990 Aug., v. 41, no. 229 p.1003-1011x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02556naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245015800170300001800328500002400346500001500370520130900385650001801694650001701712650000901729650001401738650002001752650002401772650002001796650000901816650002101825650001201846650002101858650001701879650001301896653001101909700001901920700001501939773011601954852000902070856005502079655001202134IND4460335320221118031614.0110722e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446033532DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01763.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadifar, E.10aEffects of dietary thymol-carvacrol on growth performance, hematological parameters and tissue composition of juvenile rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss  ap. 1057-1060.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGrowth performance, carcass quality, survival and hematological responses of Oncorhynchus mykiss juveniles (initial weight 8.4 ± 0.1 g) fed diets containing thymol-carvacrol powder at the levels of 0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 g kg⁻¹ were tested. Thymol-carvacrol powder originated from Origanum vulgare, a Mediterranean plant, added to diets. Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of fish for 45 days. Fish fed diets containing thymol-carvacrol had significantly higher final weight and growth than the control group. Food conversion ratio in fish fed diets containing 2.0 and 3.0 g kg⁻¹ thymol-carvacrol was statistically better than in other treatments. Survival was not different among all treatments. The number of lymphocytes increased when thymol-carvacrol was used at higher levels. Furthermore, whole body lipid content was higher in fish fed 1.0 and 2.0 g kg⁻¹ thymol-carvacrol than the other groups, but body protein in the group fed 3.0 g kg⁻¹ was higher than in other groups. Also, body ash in control and 1.0 g kg⁻¹ was higher than in other groups. Whole body dry matter was not affected by dietary treatments. These results indicated that dietary administration of thymol-carvacrol can influence some growth, hematological parameters and tissue composition in rainbow trout juveniles. 3alipid content 3abody protein 3adiet 3ajuveniles 3afood conversion 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3acarcass quality 3afish 3alymphocyte count 3apowders 3aOriganum vulgare 3afish feeding 3abody fat 0aplants1 aFalahatkar, B.1 aAkrami, R.0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2011 Aug., v. 27, no. 4 p.1057-1060dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0175-86597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01763.x 7aarticle02693naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245011100191300001600302500002400318520129700342650002701639650001301666650001301679650001101692650001801703650001401721650001401735650001401749650001401763650002901777650004401806650006901850650001401919650002701933650001401960651001701974700002401991700002102015700001802036700002002054773009202074852000902166856004802175655001202223IND4449105720221118031748.0110211e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444910572DNAL7 a211100162pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-010-9772-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchrallhammer, Martina10aDetection of a Novel Subspecies of Francisella noatunensis as Endosymbiont of the Ciliate Euplotes raikovi  ap. 455-464.  aIncludes references  aFrancisella are facultative intracellular bacteria causing severe disease in a broad range of animals. Two species are notable: Francisella tularensis, the causative organism of tularemia and a putative warfare agent, and Francisella noatunensis, an emerging fish pathogen causing significant losses in wild and farmed fish. Although various aspects of Francisella biology have been intensively studied, their natural reservoir in periods between massive outbreaks remains mysterious. Protists have been suspected to serve as a disguised vector of Francisella and co-culturing attempts demonstrate that some species are able to survive and multiply within protozoan cells. Here, we report the first finding of a natural occurrence of Francisella sp. as a protist endosymbiont. By molecular and morphological approaches, we identified intracellular bacteria localized in a strain of the marine ciliate Euplotes raikovi, isolated from the coast of Adriatic Sea. Phylogenetic analysis placed these endosymbionts within the genus Francisella, in close but distinct association with F. noatunensis. We suggest the establishment of a novel subspecies within F. noatunensis and propose the cytoplasmatic endosymbiont of E. raikovi as “Candidatus F. noatunensis subsp. endociliophora” subsp. nov. 3aFrancisella tularensis 3aProtozoa 3abacteria 3acoasts 3aendosymbionts 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3atularemia 3awild fish 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEuplotesxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aFrancisellaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSymbiosis 3aAdriatic Sea1 aSchweikert, Michael1 aVallesi, Adriana1 aVerni, Franco1 aPetroni, Giulio0 tMicrobial ecology.g2011 Feb., v. 61, no. 2 p.455-464dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-010-9772-9 7aarticle02535naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245008600175300001600261520117600277592002801453650002601481650002101507650002301528650001601551650001801567650002401585650001701609650001301626653002101639653002001660653002101680653001801701653004501719700002501764700002201789700002401811700001701835700002001852700002401872773009301896856009101989852000902080655001202089IND60610095020221120050215.0200128e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061009502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArno, Maria C.10aExploiting topology-directed nanoparticle disassembly for triggered drug delivery  ap. 184-192.  aThe physical properties of cyclic and linear polymers are markedly different; however, there are few examples which exploit these differences in clinical applications. In this study, we demonstrate that self-assemblies comprised of cyclic-linear graft copolymers are significantly more stable than the equivalent linear-linear graft copolymer assemblies. This difference in stability can be exploited to allow for triggered disassembly by cleavage of just a single bond within the cyclic polymer backbone, via disulfide reduction, in the presence of intracellular levels of l-glutathione. This topological effect was exploited to demonstrate the first example of topology-controlled particle disassembly for the controlled release of an anti-cancer drug in vitro. This approach represents a markedly different strategy for controlled release from polymer nanoparticles and highlights for the first time that a change in polymer topology can be used as a trigger in the design of delivery vehicles. We propose such constructs, which demonstrate disassembly behavior upon a change in polymer topology, could find application in the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3achemical bonding 3acomposite polymers 3aglutathione 3ananoparticles 3aphysical properties 3atherapeutics 3atopology 0aGraft copolymers 0aCyclic polymers 0aDisulfide linker 0aAcetal linker 0aTopology-controlled particle disassembly1 aWilliams, Rebecca J.1 aBexis, Panagiotis1 aPitto-Barry, Anaïs1 aKirby, Nigel1 aDove, Andrew P.1 aO'Reilly, Rachel K.0 tBiomaterials.g2018 Oct., v. 180 p.184-192dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245011200178300001600290520110700306592002801413650002801441650003801469650002001507650001401527650001101541650001401552650001401566650001701580653002401597653001901621653001901640653002001659653001701679653001901696700001801715773009301733856009101826852000901917655001201926IND60610095120221120055041.0200128e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061009512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWieduwild, Robert10aAssembling and decorating hyaluronan hydrogels with twin protein superglues to mimic cell-cell interactions  ap. 253-264.  aSimple polymeric scaffolds have yielded dramatic effects on cell behavior. For more sophisticated phenotypes, precise and efficient chemistries are desired to incorporate proteins into these scaffolds. Here we derivatize hyaluronan with an elastin-like polypeptide containing telechelic SpyTags (HA-SpyTag). Our second network component, the TriCatcher protein, had two SpyCatchers and a terminal SnoopCatcher. Mixing HA-SpyTag with TriCatcher led to rapid hydrogel formation, via spontaneous amidation. SnoopCatcher allowed modular network decoration with SnoopTagJr-linked adhesion molecules, through orthogonal transamidation. This programmed scaffold enables the testing of how individual matrix-anchored protein interactions affect cell behavior. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) regulates cell behavior and migration, with important effects in cancer.

However, existing reinforcement learning methods face challenges when it comes to continuous state and action spaces problems or problems with operation constraints. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an optimal voltage control scheme based on the safe deep reinforcement learning. In this scheme, the optimal voltage control problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process, in which both state and action spaces are continuous. To solve this problem efficiently, the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is utilized to learn the reactive power control policies, which determine the optimal control actions from the states. In contrast to existing reinforcement learning methods, deep deterministic policy gradient is naturally capable of addressing control problems with continuous state and action spaces. This is due to the utilization of deep neural networks to approximate both value function and policy. In addition, in order to handle the operation constraints in active distribution networks, a safe exploration approach is proposed to form a safety layer, which is composed directly on top the deep deterministic policy gradient actor network. This safety layer predicts the change in the constrained states and prevents the violation of active distribution networks operation constraints. Numerical simulations on modified IEEE test systems demonstrate that the proposed scheme successfully maintains all bus voltage within the allowed range, and reduces the system loss by 15% compared to the no control case.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3aissues and policy 3aneural networks 0aActive distribution network 0aConstraint satisfaction 0aDeep deterministic policy gradient 0aOptimal voltage control 0aSmart transformer1 aLiang, Deliang1 aWang, Chen1 aWu, Zihao1 aGao, Lin0 tApplied energy.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 264 p.114772-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1147723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008300172300001600255500001400271520123600285592002801521650002301549650001201572650001701584650001301601650001301614650002001627650001601647650001501663650002001678650001301698650001501711650001101726650002501737650001601762650001301778653001901791653002901810653002001839653001701859653000801876700002001884700001801904773011101922856008502033852000902118655001202127IND60693109520221120093820.0200505e20030101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069310952DNAL7 a10.1080/09524622.2003.97535002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWAHLBERG, MAGNUS10aLocalising bitterns botaurus stellaris with an array of non-linked microphones  ap. 233-245.  aNAL-light  aSome animals emit sounds usable for acoustic monitoring of their population size. Such signals should be loud, omni-directional and easy to recognise and localise. Eurasian Bittern Botaurus stellaris mating calls (booms) are known to be loud and probably omni-directional but there is no data on acoustic localisation of this species. We made recordings of bittern booms with a 4-element GPS-linked microphone array, calibrated for absolute sound pressure level measurements. Receiver spacing was 65 to 294 m. The source level was 101 ± 3 dB re 20 μPa @ 1 m. The source level did not vary more than 7 dB for the same boom recorded at two different locations, with angular separations of 3°-27° as seen from the source. The geometric transmission loss was close to spherical, and the excess attenuation was much smaller than what was expected from the prevailing temperature and humidity conditions. The prevailing wind conditions caused sound velocity variations of up to 3%. The source location error was 104 ± 113 m (mean ± 1 s.d.). The prevalence of large location errors was probably caused by problems of discerning the direct path from multipath arrivals of the signal at the receivers and by sound velocity variations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotaurus stellaris 3aanimals 3abioacoustics 3ageometry 3ahumidity 3amating behavior 3amicrophones 3amonitoring 3apopulation size 3apressure 3aprevalence 3asounds 3aspatial distribution 3atemperature 3avelocity 0aacoustic array 0aacoustic source location 0aacoustic census 0abittern boom 0aGPS1 aTOUGAARD, JAKOB1 aMØHL, BERTEL0 tBioacoustics.g2003 Jan. 1, v. 13, no. 3 p.233-245dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:21583x2165-05867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09524622.2003.97535003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245011000211300001600321506007600337520091700413592002801330506003701358650002201395650002801417650002301445650001501468650002101483650001101504650001801515651001101533700002101544700001901565700002301584700002201607773009101629856008101720852000901801655001201810IND60121251020221207100417.0150219e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012125102DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-015-0627-y2doi7 aPMC43291562pmcid7 a256819872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollentine, Dennis10aDesigning cost efficient buffer zone programs: An application of the FyrisSKZ tool in a Swedish catchment  ap. 311-318.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRiparian buffer zones are the only measure which has been used extensively in Sweden to reduce phosphorus losses from agricultural land. This paper describes how the FyrisSKZ web tool can be used to evaluate allocation scenarios using data from the Svärta River, an agricultural catchment located in central Sweden. Three scenarios are evaluated: a baseline, a uniform 6-m-wide buffer zone in each sub-catchment, and an allocation of areas of buffer zones to sub-catchments based on the average cost of reduction. The total P reduction increases by 30 % in the second scenario compared to the baseline scenario, and the average reduction per hectare increases by 90 % while total costs of the program fall by 32 %. In the third scenario, the average cost per unit of reduction (<euro>163 kg P⁻¹) is the lowest of the three scenarios (58 % lower than the baseline) and has the lowest total program costs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural watersheds 3acost effectiveness 3aphosphorus 3ariparian buffers 3arivers 3asubwatersheds 3aSweden1 aJohnsson, Holger1 aLarsson, Peter1 aMarkensten, Hampus1 aPersson, Kristian0 tAmbio.g2015 Mar., v. 44, no.

Here, we describe class II major histocompatibility complex (MHCII) as an important component of high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Microarray analysis of primary adipocytes revealed that multiple genes involved in MHCII antigen processing and presentation increased in obese women. In mice, adipocyte MHCII increased within 2 weeks on HFD, paralleling increases in proinflammatory ART markers and decreases in anti-inflammatory ART markers, and preceding adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) accumulation and proinflammatory M1 polarization. Mouse 3T3-L1 and primary adipocytes activated T cells in an antigen-specific, contact-dependent manner, indicating that adipocyte MHCII is functional. HFD-fed MHCII⁻/⁻ mice developed less adipose inflammation and insulin resistance than did wild-type mice, despite developing similar adiposity. These investigations uncover a mechanism whereby a HFD-induced adipocyte/ART dialog involving MHCII instigates adipose inflammation and, together with ATM MHCII, escalates its progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadipocytes 3aadipose tissue 3aadiposity 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantigens 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3amacrophages 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3aobesity 3awomen1 aLyon, Christopher J.,1 aMinze, Laurie J.1 aLin, Jianxin1 aZou, Jia1 aLiu, Joey Z.1 aRen, Yuelan1 aYin, Zheng1 aHamilton, Dale J.1 aReardon, Patrick R.1 aSherman, Vadim1 aWang, Helen Y.1 aPhillips, Kevin J.,1 aWebb, Paul1 aWong, Stephen T.C.1 aWang, Rong-fu1 aHsueh, Willa A.,0 tCell metabolism.g2013 Mar. 5, v. 17, no. 3 p.411-422dElsevier Inc.x1550-41317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2013.02.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03845naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024004100132040001800173100002100191245023000212300001600442506007600458506003100534520165400565592002802219596007902247596008302326506003702409650002402446650002502470650005602495650002002551650002102571650001002592650002402602650001502626650002002641650001402661650001402675650000902689650001002698650002202708650001202730650001602742653001502758653001002773653005602783653003002839653001602869653002402885700002202909700002202931700002302953700002602976700002703002773010803029856008503137852000903222655001203231IND60582869720221207115639.0190403e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058286972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.06.0232doi7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.06.0232chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOber, Rebecca A.10aIncreased microbiome diversity at the time of infection is associated with improved growth rates of pigs after co-infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2)  ap. 203-211.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) are two of the most important pathogens affecting the swine industry worldwide. Co-infections are common on a global scale, resulting in pork production losses through reducing weight gain and causing respiratory disease in growing pigs. Our initial work demonstrated that the fecal microbiome was associated with clinical outcome of pigs 70days post-infection (dpi) with PRRSV and PCV2. However, it remained uncertain if microbiome characteristics could predispose response to viral infection. The purpose of this study was to determine if microbiome characteristics present at the time of virus exposure were associated with outcome after co-infection. Using the Lawrence Livermore Microbial Detection Array, we profiled the microbiome in feces prior to infection from pigs identified retrospectively as having high or low growth rates after co-infection. High growth rate pigs had less severe interstitial pneumonia, reduced virus replication, and a significant increase in average daily weight gain throughout the study. At the level of the fecal microbiome, high growth rate pigs had increased microbial diversity on both a family and species level. Shifts in the microbiome composition of high growth rate pigs included reduced Methanobacteriaceae species, increased Ruminococcaceae species, and increased Streptococcaceae species when compared to low growth rate pigs. The results indicate that both microbiome diversity and composition at the time of virus exposure may play a role in the subsequent response of pigs to PRRSV/PCV2 co-infection.  aPublisher supplied data  cLawrence Livermore National Laboratorydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006227  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMethanobacteriaceae 3aPorcine circovirus-2 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aRuminococcaceae 3aStreptococcaceae 3afeces 3amicrobial detection 3amicrobiome 3amixed infection 3apathogens 3apneumonia 3apork 3aswine 3avirus replication 3aviruses 3aweight gain 0aMicrobiome 0aSwine 0aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 0aPorcine circovirus type 2 0aWeight gain 0aMicrobial diversity1 aThissen, James B.1 aJaing, Crystal J.1 aCino-Ozuna, Ada G.1 aRowland, Raymond R.R.1 aNiederwerder, Megan C.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2017 Sept., v. 208 p.203-211dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013100165300001600296520125300312592002801565650002201593650001501615650001501630650002701645650001301672650002701685650001801712650002201730650001601752650002701768650002101795700001401816700001601830700001501846700001901861773010401880856008101984852000902065655001202074IND60112409620221117225256.0141111e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011240962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2012.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yingyao10aLipase-catalyzed acidolysis of canola oil with caprylic acid to produce medium-, long- and medium-chain-type structured lipids  ap. 707-712.  aLipase-catalyzed acidolysis of canola oil with caprylic acid was performed to produce structured lipids (SLs) containing medium-chain fatty acid (M) at position sn-1,3 and long-chain fatty acid (L) at the sn-2 position in a solvent-free system. Six commercial lipases from different sources were screened for their ability to incorporate caprylic acid into the canola oil. The sn-1,3 regiospecificity toward the glycerol backbone of canola oil of the lipases with relatively higher acidolysis activity was compared by investigating the fatty acid profiles of the products. The results showed that Lipozyme RM IM from Rhizomucor miehei resulted in the highest caprylic acid incorporation ability and the lowest acyl migration. The reaction parameters including substrate mole ratio, enzyme load, reaction time and temperature of Lipozyme RM IM were investigated. Incorporation of caprylic acid was higher when reactions were carried with 10% lipase of the total weight of substrates with a 1:4 mole ratio of oil and caprylic acid. The optimal time course and temperature for synthesis SLs were 15h and 50–60°C.

We conducted a cross-sectional study of pig exposed participants and controls in Guangdong, China, using a multi-stage sampling design. Participants provided a nasal swab for MRCoNS analysis and resulting isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility. The dose-response relation was examined using log binomial regression or Poisson regression models. The adjusted prevalence of MRCoNS carriage in pig exposed participants was 1.67 times (95% CI: 1.32–2.11) higher than in controls. The adjusted average number of resistance to different antibiotic classes of MRCoNS isolates from pig exposed participants was 1.67 times (95% CI: 1.46–1.91) higher than those from controls. Notably, we found the frequency and duration of occupational pig contact was associated with increased prevalence and increased number of resistance to different antibiotic classes of MRCoNS in a dose-response manner. When examining these relations by MRCoNS species, there was still evidence of similar exposure-response relations. Additionally, the proportion of tetracycline-resistant and tet(M)-containing MRCoNS isolates was significantly higher in pig exposed participants than in controls. These findings suggested a potential transmission of MRCoNS from livestock to humans by occupational livestock contact, and the presence of phenotypic and genotypic tetracycline resistance may aid in the differentiation of animal origins of MRCoNS isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3across-sectional studies 3adose response 3ahumans 3amethicillin 3anose 3aphenotype 3aregression analysis 3aswine 3azoonoses 3aChina 0aMethicillin-resistant 0aCoagulase-negative staphylococci 0aHuman 0aLivestock-associated1 aChen, Zhiyao1 aGuo, Dan1 aLi, Shunming1 aHuang, Jingya1 aWang, Xiaolin1 aYao, Zhenjiang1 aChen, Sidong1 aYe, Xiaohua0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2017 Sept., v. 208 p.231-238dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245013200170300001600302520148700318592002801805650001901833650001501852650001101867650002201878650001101900650002601911650001701937651001201954651001201966651001101978651001201989651001602001651001902017653001802036653003202054653003002086653003402116653002202150653001402172700002502186700002202211773009402233856008402327852000902411655001202420IND60635872220221119232703.0190523e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063587222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2019.03.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikova, Nadezhda10aLow-carbon energy scenarios 2050 in north-west European countries: Towards a more harmonised approach to achieve the EU targets  ap. 448-460.  aThis paper proposes an approach to comparing and assessing the policy settings in the European low-carbon energy scenarios. First, it presents the methodology including ten characteristics for scenario assessment: modelling framework (diversity), ambitiousness of the targets 2050, relations with other (European) countries, stakeholder involvement, technology options, non-technological aspects, economic component, usage of scenarios in policy design, intermediate indicators of targets' achievement and revision of scenarios. Further, it uses qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate energy scenarios developed in six north-west European countries (the Netherlands, Germany, France, Denmark, the UK, Belgium). Finally, conclusions are made concerning the possible ways of scenario design improvement. The analysis has shown that all selected countries have potential for modifying their energy scenarios, which being implemented may help to achieve the joint European targets 2050. Since these countries are socially and economically interrelated, a more harmonised approach to scenario development is needed to be designed and introduced on the EU level. Ten characteristics proposed in this study may serve as an initial input for such harmonisation. The results can be of interest to economists, business and academic representatives, and especially policy makers involved in the long-term energy scenario development on the international, regional and national level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aeconomists 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aquantitative analysis 3astakeholders 3aBelgium 3aDenmark 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aNetherlands 3aUnited Kingdom 0aEnergy policy 0aLow-carbon energy scenarios 0aThe European targets 2050 0aNorth-west European countries 0aTechnology trends 0aForesight1 aEichhammer, Wolfgang1 aPfluger, Benjamin0 tEnergy policy.g2019 July, v. 130 p.448-460dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.03.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006900148245013900217300001800356520158300374592002801957596011201985596010502097650002402202650002102226650002202247650003402269650003402303650002002337650001602357650001702373650000902390650001402399650002202413650001802435650002002453650001502473700006802488700006402556700006902620700006302689700006102752773013402813856008302947852000903030655001203039IND60745723120221118054339.0210820e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074572312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10695-021-00971-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndreyeva, Aleksandra Yu.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7845-016510aProtein kinase A activity and NO are involved in the regulation of crucian carp (Carassius carassius) red blood cell osmotic fragility  ap. 1105-1117.  aActivation of the cAMP pathway by β-adrenergic stimulation and cGMP pathway by activation of guanylate cyclase substantially affects red blood cell (RBC) membrane properties in mammals. However, whether similar mechanisms are involved in RBC regulation of lower vertebrates, especially teleosts, is not elucidated yet. In this study, we evaluated the effects of adenylate cyclase activation by epinephrine and forskolin, guanylate cyclase activation by sodium nitroprusside, and the role of Na⁺/H⁺-exchanger in the changes of osmotic fragility and regulatory volume decrease (RVD) response in crucian carp RBCs. Western blot analysis of protein kinase A and protein kinase G substrate phosphorylation revealed that changes in osmotic fragility were regulated via the protein kinase A, but not protein kinase G signaling pathway. At the same time, the RVD response in crucian carp RBCs was not affected either by activation of adenylate or guanylate cyclase. Adenylate cyclase/protein kinase A activation significantly decreased RBC osmotic fragility, i.e., increased cell rigidity. Inhibition of Na⁺/H⁺-exchanger by amiloride had no effect on the epinephrine-mediated decrease of RBC osmotic fragility. NO donor SNP did not activate guanylate cyclase, however affected RBCs osmotic fragility by protein kinase G-independent mechanisms. Taken together, our data demonstrated that the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway and NO are involved in the regulation of crucian carp RBC osmotic fragility, but not in RVD response. The authors confirm that the study has no clinical trial.  aPublisher supplied data  aAAAA-A18-118012290371-3cState Assignment of Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russian Federation  aN 121041400077-1cState Assignment of Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russian Federation 3aCarassius carassius 3aWestern blotting 3aadenylate cyclase 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3acGMP-dependent protein kinase 3aclinical trials 3aepinephrine 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3aforskolin 3aguanylate cyclase 3anitroprusside 3aphosphorylation 3aphysiology1 aKladchenko, Ekaterina S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9476-65731 aSudnitsyna, Julia S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5322-70441 aKrivchenko, Aleksander I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5807-20211 aMindukshev, Igor V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5978-21051 aGambaryan, Stepan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1470-07910 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2021 Aug., v. 47, no. 4 p.1105-1117dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870056x0920-17427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-021-00971-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245005800173300001600231500001400247520084000261592002801101650001501129650002401144650001701168650001601185650001401201650001301215650001101228650001701239650001101256650001201267651001401279653002201293653002301315653002701338653002701365653001301392653002501405653001301430700001901443773011101462856008501573852000901658655001201667IND60693109820221120093842.0200505e20030101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069310982DNAL7 a10.1080/09524622.2003.97535032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aELLINGER, NORBERT10aHabitat acoustics of a neotropical lowland rainforest  ap. 297-321.  aNAL-light  aThe acoustic characteristics of an Amazonian lowland rain forest study site in southern Venezuela was analysed to determine environmental constraints upon acoustic communication.

Measurements of ambient noise served to determine possible communication distances for various times of day, heights above ground level and frequencies. “Sound windows” for acoustic long-range communication were found for low frequencies, calling heights in the midstorey and calling in the morning or during the night. Sound attenuation was affected by height and frequency but not by time of day. Background noise varied remarkably with time of day and frequency and had a greater impact on communication distance than signal attenuation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3aacoustic properties 3abioacoustics 3adegradation 3afrequency 3ahabitats 3aheight 3arain forests 3asounds 3awindows 3aVenezuela 0ahabitat acoustics 0asound transmission 0aacoustic communication 0acommunication distance 0aSurumoni 0atropical rain forest 0aAmazonia1 aHödl, Walter,0 tBioacoustics.g2003 Jan. 1, v. 13, no. 3 p.297-321dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:21583x2165-05867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09524622.2003.97535033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012600169300001800295520118500313592002801498650001101526650002101537650001501558650001801573650001501591650003401606650003301640650001901673650001901692700001901711700002101730773011101751856008601862852000901948655001201957IND60570090220221119093719.0170708e20170705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057009022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b015962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsieh, Yi-Ting10aSEM as a Facile Tool for Real-Time Monitoring of Microcrystal Growth during Electrodeposition: The Merit of Ionic Liquids  ap. 7249-7254.  aDue to the extremely low vapor pressure of ionic liquids (ILs), electrochemical deposition/dissolution of hexagonal hollow CuSn alloy tubes in IL can be real-time observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Two specially made electrochemical cells are used for the top-view and side-view observations. A series of clear SEM images reveals the hexagonal cones are formed prior to further developing hexagonal tubes. At the beginning, many small nuclei are formed on the electrode surface. Due to the electrodeposition rate being slow enough for the nuclei to crystallize into hexagonal structures, the electrodeposition rate is faster on the periphery than the inside of the structures. As the electrodeposition progresses, the tube wall will grow thicker, and a secondary tube emerges inside the primary tube. Finally, shell-by-shell hexagonal tubes are formed. Furthermore, the in situ SEM observation also reveals that the dissolution of tube starts from its inner wall followed by a sudden collapse of its wall. In this paper, we establish a simple and convenient method, which can be broadly applied to the study of metal, alloy, and semiconductor growth in real time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aionic liquids 3amonitoring 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asemiconductors 3avapor pressure1 aTsuda, Tetsuya1 aKuwabata, Susumu0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2017 July 05, v. 89, no. 13 p.7249-7254dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.7b015963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245007200213300001600285500001500301520101200316592002801328650002201356650002401378650001301402650001801415650001101433650001701444650001301461650004001474650001201514650001701526650001201543650001001555650001501565650001901580650001901599653001001618700003101628700002301659700002001682700002001702700002701722700002101749700002401770700002201794700002301816700002201839700001901861700002301880700002001903700001601923700002101939700001901960700002501979700001902004700002102023700002402044700001602068700002402084700002202108700002202130700001902152700002602171700002802197700002002225700002202245700002202267700002602289700002102315700002602336700002102362700002402383700002102407773009002428856008202518990002302600852000902623655001202632IND60092831520221123003354.0141103e20130305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009283152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cmet.2013.02.0012doi7 aPMC37461722pmcid7 a234730372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiason-Lauber, Anna10aIdentification of a SIRT1 Mutation in a Family with Type 1 Diabetes  ap. 448-455.  a2019-12-06  aType 1 diabetes is caused by autoimmune-mediated β cell destruction leading to insulin deficiency. The histone deacetylase SIRT1 plays an essential role in modulating several age-related diseases. Here we describe a family carrying a mutation in the SIRT1 gene, in which all five affected members developed an autoimmune disorder: four developed type 1 diabetes, and one developed ulcerative colitis. Initially, a 26-year-old man was diagnosed with the typical features of type 1 diabetes, including lean body mass, autoantibodies, T cell reactivity to β cell antigens, and a rapid dependence on insulin. Direct and exome sequencing identified the presence of a T-to-C exchange in exon 1 of SIRT1, corresponding to a leucine-to-proline mutation at residue 107. Expression of SIRT1-L107P in insulin-producing cells resulted in overproduction of nitric oxide, cytokines, and chemokines. These observations identify a role for SIRT1 in human autoimmunity and unveil a monogenic form of type 1 diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3asequence analysis 3ahistone deacetylase 3aantigens 3aT-lymphocytes 3ahumans 3anitric oxide 3amutation 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ainsulin 3aautoimmunity 3acolitis 3aexons 3achemokines 3aautoantibodies 3alean body mass 0agenes1 aBöni-Schnetzler, Marianne1 aHubbard, Basil P.1 aBouzakri, Karim1 aBrunner, Andrea1 aCavelti-Weder, Claudia1 aKeller, Cornelia1 aMeyer-Böni, Monika1 aMeier, Daniel T.1 aBrorsson, Caroline1 aTimper, Katharina1 aLeibowitz, Gil1 aPatrignani, Andrea1 aBruggmann, Remy1 aBoily, Gino1 aZulewski, Henryk1 aGeier, Andreas1 aCermak, Jennifer M.1 aElliott, Peter1 aEllis, James L.1 aWestphal, Christoph1 aKnobel, Urs1 aEloranta, Jyrki J.1 aKerr-Conte, Julie1 aPattou, François1 aKonrad, Daniel1 aMatter, Christian M.1 aFontana, A.q(Adriano),1 aRogler, Gerhard1 aSchlapbach, Ralph1 aRegairaz, Camille1 aCarballido, José M.1 aGlaser, Benjamin1 aMcBurney, Michael W.1 aPociot, Flemming1 aSinclair, David A.1 aDonath, Marc Y.0 tCell metabolism.g2013 Mar. 5, v. 17, no. 3 p.448-455dElsevier Inc.x1550-41317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2013.02.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002000197245011600217300001800333506007600351520193500427592002802362506003702390650001302427650002302440650001802463650002102481650001102502650002502513650001602538650001502554650001402569650001502583700002102598700001702619700002802636700001602664773008602680856009002766852000902856655001202865IND60090400120221207095851.0141102e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009040012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.11.0662doi7 aPMC32792982pmcid7 a221776222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKishore, Vipuil10aTenogenic differentiation of human MSCs induced by the topography of electrochemically aligned collagen threads  ap. 2137-2144.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTopographical cues from the extracellular microenvironment can influence cellular activity including proliferation and differentiation. Information on the effects of material topography on tenogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (human MSCs) is limited. A methodology using the principles of isoelectric focusing has previously been developed in our laboratory to synthesize electrochemically aligned collagen (ELAC) threads that mimics the packing density, alignment and strength of collagen dense connective tissues. In the current study, human MSCs were cultured on ELAC and randomly oriented collagen threads and the effect of collagen orientation on cell morphology, proliferation and tenogenic differentiation was investigated. The results indicate that higher rates of proliferation were observed on randomly oriented collagen threads compared to ELAC threads. On the other hand, tendon specific markers such as scleraxis and tenomodulin, were significantly increased on ELAC threads compared to randomly oriented collagen threads. Additionally, osteocalcin, a specific marker of bone differentiation was suppressed on ELAC threads. Previous studies have reported that BMP-12 is a key growth factor to induce tenogenic differentiation of MSCs. To evaluate the synergistic effect of BMP-12 and collagen orientation, human MSCs were cultured on ELAC threads in culture medium supplemented with and without BMP-12. The results revealed that BMP-12 did not have an additional effect on the tenogenic differentiation of human MSCs on ELAC threads. Together, these results suggest that ELAC induces tenogenic differentiation of human MSCs by presenting an aligned and dense collagen substrate, akin to the tendon itself. In conclusion, ELAC has a significant potential to be used as a tendon replacement and in the development of an osteotendinous construct towards the regeneration of bone–tendon interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acollagen 3aconnective tissues 3aculture media 3aelectrochemistry 3ahumans 3aisoelectric focusing 3aosteocalcin 3astem cells 3asynergism 3atopography1 aBullock, Whitney1 aSun, Xuanhao1 aVan Dyke, William Scott1 aAkkus, Ozan0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Mar., v. 33, no. 7 p.2137-2144dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.11.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04080naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002200111024001900133024002100152024003300173024001100206040001800217100002100235245015600256300001200412506007600424506017300500520167200673592002802345506003702373650001902410650004802429650002402477650001502501650002302516650001602539650002402555650001902579650002702598650002702625650002602652650002202678650003802700650001202738650001402750650001402764650002102778650001702799650001302816700002402829700003502853700002302888700002002911700002302931700002002954773011602974856011203090856008003202956012603282961001303408852000903421655001203430IND50071538420221214231428.0210217e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007153842DNAL7 a2810032aris7 aPMC38784912pmcid7 a243414852pmid7 a10113/582862hdl7 a10.1186/1746-6148-9-2562doi8 ans3924  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWadhwa, Ashutosh10aUse of ethanol extract of Mycobacterium bovis for detection of specific antibodies in sera of farmed red deer (Cervus elaphus) with bovine tuberculosis  ap. 256.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aBACKGROUND: Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in wildlife species poses a threat to domestic livestock in many situations. Control programs for bTB in livestock depend on testing and slaughtering the positive animals; however, the currently available diagnostic tests often have poor specificity. In our previous study, we developed a specific and sensitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for another mycobacterial disease – Johne’s disease, using surface antigens of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) extracted by briefly agitating the bacilli in 80% ethanol solution. The ELISA test was named ethanol vortex ELISA (EVELISA). The objective of this study is to examine whether EVELISA technique could be used to specifically detect anti-Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) antibodies in the serum of M. bovis-infected farmed red deer (Cervus elaphus). We tested a total of 45 red deer serum samples, divided in 3 groups – uninfected animals (n = 15), experimentally infected with M. bovis (n = 15) and experimentally infected with MAP (n = 15). RESULTS: The presence of anti-M. bovis antibodies was tested using an ethanol extract of M. bovis. Without absorption of anti-MAP cross reactive antibodies, it was found that 13 out of the 15 MAP-infected animals showed high antibody binding. Using heat killed MAP as an absorbent of cross reactive antibodies, anti-M. bovis antibodies were detected in 86.7% of M. bovis-infected animals with minor false positive results caused by MAP infection. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggest that EVELISA may form a basis for a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of bTB in farmed red deer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCervus elaphus 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aMycobacterium bovis 3aantibodies 3aantibody detection 3ablood serum 3abovine tuberculosis 3across reaction 3adiagnostic sensitivity 3adiagnostic specificity 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease detection 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aethanol 3alivestock 3aslaughter 3asurface antigens 3awild animals 3awildlife1 aJohnson, Rachel E.,1 aMackintosh, C.

The aim of this study was to design a MIP-based sensor recognition material and enhance its sensitivity by blending it with GO for sensing a harmful dengue hemorrhagic fever pathogen, namely the dengue type 1 virus (DENV-1). Polymer composites comprising GO incorporated to an acrylamide (AAM)/methacrylic acid (MAA)/methyl methacrylate (MMA)/N-vinylpyrrolidone (VP) copolymer were synthesized and compared to the “pure” MIP, i.e., the copolymer without GO. The pure polymer revealed a zeta potential of + 9.9 ± 0.5 mV, whereas GO sheets prepared have a zeta potential of − 60.3 ± 2.7 mV. This results in an overall zeta potential of − 11.2 ± 0.2 mV of the composite. Such polymer composites seem appropriate to bind the positively charged DENV-1 particle (+ 42.2 ± 2.8 mV). GO-MIP coated onto 10-MHz quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors indeed revealed two times sensitivity compared to sensors based on the pure MIP. Furthermore, GO-polymer composites revealed imprinting factors of up to 21, compared to 3 of the pure MIP. When plotting the sensor characteristic in a semilogarithmic way, the composite sensor shows the linear response to DENV-1 in the concentration range from 10⁰ to 10³ pfu mL⁻¹. The corresponding limits of detection (S/N = 3) and quantification (S/N = 10) are 0.58 and 1.94 pfu mL⁻¹, respectively. Furthermore, imprinted polymer composites selectively bind DENV-1 without significant interference: DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, respectively, yield 13–16% of DENV-1 signal. The sensor requires only about 15–20 min to obtain a result.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aanalytical chemistry 3acomposite polymers 3adengue hemorrhagic fever 3agraphene 3apathogens 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3athermal conductivity 3aviruses 3azeta potential1 aSangma, Chak1 aYenchitsomanus, Pa-thai1 aChunta, Suticha1 aLieberzeit, Peter A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1596-05840 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2021 Oct., v. 413, no. 24 p.6191-6198dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-021-03410-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245017300166520124400339592002801583650001201611650001501623650002801638650001101666650002101677650001201698650002301710650001501733650002201748650001101770650001101781650002301792650002001815650001101835651001001846653003301856653003301889653002101922653002701943653001201970700001801982700001602000700001802016700001402034700001702048773011602065856008402181852000902265655001202274IND60680735920221121164323.0200210e20200331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068073592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2019.1059582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Ziyang10aChanges in reference evapotranspiration over Northwest China from 1957 to 2018: Variation characteristics, cause analysis and relationships with atmospheric circulation  aThe Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NX) in Northwest China has been challenged by water scarcity and drought for decades. In this study, to understand the spatio-temporal variation, cause analysis and relationship with atmospheric circulation of ET₀ in Ningxia, ET₀ and other climate factors at 20 national climate stations from 1957 to 2018 were analyzed. Results showed that ET₀ in NX (Ningxia), NYR (Northern Yellow River Irrigation Area) and SMA (Southern Mountain Area) had increased significantly at annual scale, whilst the CAZ (Central Arid Zone) was the opposite trend, and ET₀ had a trend of first rise and then decline from north to south in spatial distribution. ET₀ was most sensitive to RH and Tₘₐₓ at annual scale in Ningxia, while the greatest contribution rates were Tₘₐₓ and SD. Ningxia was becoming drier in the past decades. The abrupt change in ET₀ at approximately 1990, and it’s long and short period were 25a(15a) and 10a(5a) at annual scale, respectively. The four teleconnection indices could be used to predict changes in ET₀ at annual and autumn scale, while the ENSO and PDO could predict changes in ET₀ of summer and IOD and AO could predict changes in ET₀ of spring and winter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aarid zones 3aatmospheric circulation 3aautumn 3aclimatic factors 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation 3aspatial variation 3aspring 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3awater shortages 3awinter 3aChina 0aReference evapotranspiration 0aSpatio-temporal distribution 0aDominant factors 0aTeleconnection indices 0aNingxia1 aWang, Hongrui1 aWang, Cheng1 aLi, Wangcheng1 aChen, Hao1 aDeng, Caiyun0 tAgricultural water management.g2020 Mar. 31, v. 231 p.105958-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.1059583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01273naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245005800172300001600230520033900246592002800585650002800613650001500641650001700656650001300673650001200686650001400698650004300712773009000755856008200845990002300927852000900950655001200959IND60092831720221123003337.0141103e20130305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009283172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cmet.2013.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHardie, D. Grahame10aMetformin—Acting through Cyclic AMP as well as AMP?  ap. 313-314.  aMetformin, developed from an ancient herbal remedy, remains the front-line drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Comparison of fossil HDPE and biobased HDPE produced from sugar beet and wheat  ap. 159-167.  aPolymers are one of the most used materials and the majority of their production is based on fossil fuels. Due to the decrease of oil resources and concerns about climate change, alternatives are needed, the transformation of biobased ethanol into biobased polymer being one of them. This paper undertakes an environmental evaluation of the production of biobased polymer produced from two different feedstock cultivated in Belgium: sugar beet and wheat. Both crops cultivation are studied as well as their transformation into biobased ethanol, first, and then to biobased ethylene, focusing on high-density polyethylene (HDPE) as final product. These scenarios are analyzed and compared with the production of conventional polymer using the life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodology with reference to relevant environmental impact categories. This study shows a reduction of impact of around 60% for both climate change and fossil fuel depletion categories when using biobased HDPE instead of its fossil counterpart. For all other impact categories, fossil HDPE achieves better results than the biobased product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acrops 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aethanol 3aethylene 3afeedstocks 3afossil fuels 3afossils 3alife cycle assessment 3aoils 3apolyethylene 3asugar beet 3awheat 3aBelgium 0aHigh-density polyethylene (HDPE) 0aLife-cycle assessment (LCA) 0aBiobased polymer1 aLéonard, Angélique0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 Feb., v. 85 p.159-167dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01488naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245011100163300001800274520046900292592002800761650001900789650001400808650002000822650001700842650001500859650002700874650001200901650001300913700002100926773013200947856007401079852000901153655001201162IND60660197020221118045545.0190823e20140508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066019702DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc02073a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrayton, Daniel F.10aSolvent free selective dehydrogenation of indolic and carbazolic molecules with an iridium pincer catalyst  ap. 5987-5989.  aA previously known iridium POCOP pincer catalyst was found to selectively dehydrogenate the heterocyclic portion of several indolic and carbazolic molecules.

In addition to partly allowing a further utilization of the existing gas infrastructure for energy transport and storage, hydrogen or synthetic natural gas (SNG) from electric power represents a high-density energy carrier and important feedstock material for further processing. This premise leads to a significant demand for large-scale PtG plants, which was evaluated with an amount of up to 4530 GWₑₗ for electrolysis and up to 1360 GWSNG for methanation capacities at a global scale. Together with the upscaling of single-MW plants available today, this will enable to achieve appropriate cost reduction effects through technological learning. Under given scenarios, reduction potentials for CAPEX of >75% are expected for multi-MW PtG plants in the long-term, with significant advantages of PEM and solid oxide electrolysis over alkaline systems in the short- and mid-term. The resulting effects on PtG product costs were evaluated via a holistic techno-economic assessment, resulting in SNG production costs of 15 €-cent/kWh and below for large-scale appliances in 2050, depending on the renewable electricity supply.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3aelectric power 3aelectrolysis 3afeedstocks 3ahydrogen 3alearning 3amethane production 3anatural gas 3aproduction costs 3arenewable electricity 3arenewable energy sources 0aPower-to-gas 0aMethanation 0aScaling effects 0aTechnological learning1 aZauner, Andreas1 aRosenfeld, Daniel C.1 aTichler, Robert0 tApplied energy.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 264 p.114780-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1147803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009600165300001800261500001100279520157200290592002801862596005601890596004901946650002501995650001502020650002102035650001902056650001702075650001502092650002602107650001602133650001402149650002902163773014802192856008302340852000902423655001202432IND60750527220221123011146.0210917e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075052722DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-021-03425-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeiles, Sven10aAdvanced tandem mass spectrometry in metabolomics and lipidomics—methods and applications  ap. 5927-5948.  aReview  aMetabolomics and lipidomics are new drivers of the omics era as molecular signatures and selected analytes allow phenotypic characterization and serve as biomarkers, respectively. The growing capabilities of untargeted and targeted workflows, which primarily rely on mass spectrometric platforms, enable extensive charting or identification of bioactive metabolites and lipids. Structural annotation of these compounds is key in order to link specific molecular entities to defined biochemical functions or phenotypes. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS), first and foremost collision-induced dissociation (CID), is the method of choice to unveil structural details of metabolites and lipids. But CID fragment ions are often not sufficient to fully characterize analytes. Therefore, recent years have seen a surge in alternative tandem MS methodologies that aim to offer full structural characterization of metabolites and lipids. In this article, principles, capabilities, drawbacks, and first applications of these “advanced tandem mass spectrometry” strategies will be critically reviewed. This includes tandem MS methods that are based on electrons, photons, and ion/molecule, as well as ion/ion reactions, combining tandem MS with concepts from optical spectroscopy and making use of derivatization strategies. In the final sections of this review, the first applications of these methodologies in combination with liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry imaging are highlighted and future perspectives for research in metabolomics and lipidomics are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  aLiebig fellowshipcVerband der Chemischen Industrie  aHE 8521/1-1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiomarkers 3achemical species 3aderivatization 3adissociation 3alipidomics 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3aphenotype 3atandem mass spectrometry0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2021 Oct., v. 413, no. 24 p.5927-5948dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-021-03425-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245008200176300001400258520129500272592002801567650005801595650001201653650000901665650001001674650001601684650002201700650001801722650002001740651001001760653002601770653001801796653001801814653002201832653001901854653002001873773009201893856008401985852000902069655001202078IND60635872620221119232734.0190523e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063587262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2019.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSokołowski, Maciej M.10aWhen black meets green: A review of the four pillars of India's energy policy  ap. 60-68.  aIndia is one of the most important global players in the energy sector in terms of production and consumption. The way in which the country shapes its energy policy not only affects India itself, but also the global climate action. On the one hand, India led by PM Narendra Modi declares the commitment to pro-climate actions, including the enhancement of the energy efficiency and renewable capacity. On the other hand, the development of India's conventional energy sector (coal) was indicated as one of the reasons for the US′ exit from the Paris Agreement. This dilemma lead to a discussion on the shape of India's energy policy, seen from the climate's standpoint. In this context, the article discusses the pillars of India's energy policy presented by Modi in 2016. The main energy pillars (access, efficiency, sustainability and security) are juxtaposed with the previous Indian strategic documents concerning the energy sector, including electricity (National Electricity Policy of 2005, Draft National Energy Policy of 2017). A climate-energy policy analysis is extended by legal comments on Indian energy law. As a result, the article draws a picture of India's energy policy and climate agenda in ‘black’ (conventional energy) and ‘green’ (renewable capacity) colours.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aclimate 3acoal 3acolor 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy policy 3apolicy analysis 3aIndia 0aIndia's energy policy 0aNarendra Modi 0aEnergy access 0aEnergy efficiency 0aSustainability 0aEnergy security0 tEnergy policy.g2019 July, v. 130 p.60-68dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.03.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01837naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245011100131300001800242500002900260520069400289592002800983650002301011650002401034650001501058650002101073650001201094650001601106651001001122653001201132653001901144653003701163700001701200700002101217700001701238700001701255700001701272773015301289852000901442655001201451IND60723782320221118211224.0210117e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072378232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirpara, B.

To improve the lack of insufficient sensitivity for quantification of low abundance protein, we propose a new two dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC-SRM) method for the quantitation of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in human plasma. The method centers on anion exchange cartridge between reversed-phase chromatography and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) in an on-line arrangement. The use of the anionic cartridge allows an easier online transfer of the analytes between both dimensions. Moreover, it provides an additional selectivity since the more basic peptides are not retained on this support. This setup has been applied to the quantification of prostate specific antigen (PSA) protein in plasma on a previous generation of mass spectrometer, which enabled a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1ng/mL without any upfront immuno-depletion or intense off-line fractionation before the SRM analysis. The obtained LOQ is compatible with the required sensitivity for the clinically relevant plasma-based PSA tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion exchange 3abiomarkers 3afractionation 3ahumans 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3aimmunoassays 3amonitoring 3apeptides 3aprostate-specific antigen 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 0a2D-LC 0aProtein 0aHILIC 0aQuantification 0aMass spectrometry 0aProstate specific antigen1 aPasseron, Sébastien1 aLemoine, Jérôme1 aSalvador, Arnaud0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 Aug. 08, v. 1354 p.75-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.05.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011400158300001600272500002000288520160600308592002801914650002401942650001401966650001101980650001701991650002102008650001402029650001702043650002002060650002302080650001602103650001702119650002102136650003202157650001002189650002102199650000902220651000902229651001502238700001402253700003002267700002402297700002502321700002402346700002902370700001502399700001902414773013002433856007302563852000902636655001202645IND60587608920221118100949.0180102e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058760892DNAL7 a10.1890/11-0039.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVieilledent, G12aA universal approach to estimate biomass and carbon stock in tropical forests using generic allometric models  ap. 572-583.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAllometric equations allow aboveground tree biomass and carbon stock to be estimated from tree size. The allometric scaling theory suggests the existence of a universal power‐law relationship between tree biomass and tree diameter with a fixed scaling exponent close to 8/3. In addition, generic empirical models, like Chave's or Brown's models, have been proposed for tropical forests in America and Asia. These generic models have been used to estimate forest biomass and carbon worldwide. However, tree allometry depends on environmental and genetic factors that vary from region to region. Consequently, theoretical models that include too few ecological explicative variables or empirical generic models that have been calibrated at particular sites are unlikely to yield accurate tree biomass estimates at other sites. In this study, we based our analysis on a destructive sample of 481 trees in Madagascar spiny dry and moist forests characterized by a high rate of endemism (>95%). We show that, among the available generic allometric models, Chave's model including diameter, height, and wood specific gravity as explicative variables for a particular forest type (dry, moist, or wet tropical forest) was the only one that gave accurate tree biomass estimates for Madagascar (R² > 83%, bias < 6%), with estimates comparable to those obtained with regional allometric models.

Owing to the high spatial variability of P losses, cost-effective countermeasures need to target parts of the catchment that are most susceptible to P losses. Field surveys identified critical source areas for overland flow and erosion amounting to only 0.4–2.6 % of total arable land in four different catchments in southern Sweden. Distributed modelling using high-resolution digital elevation data identified 72–96 % of these observed erosion and overland flow features. The modelling results were also successfully used to predict occurrence of overland flow and rill and gully erosion in a catchment in central Sweden. Such exact high-resolution modelling allows for accurate placement of planned countermeasures. However, current legislative and environmental subsidy programmes need to change their approach from income-loss compensation to rewarding high cost effectiveness of implemented countermeasures.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarable soils 3acost effectiveness 3aeutrophication 3agully erosion 3amodels 3aoverland flow 3aphosphorus 3asurveys 3awatersheds 3aSweden1 aVilla, Ana0 tAmbio.g2015 Mar., v. 44, no.

N.10aAutonomy, Interdependence, and Moral GovernancebPluralism in a Rocking Boat  ap. 153-171.  aDrawing on key themes in the work of Sir Geoffrey Vickers, this article outlines the need for a moral perspective that can address the pluralistic social realities of the dawning 21st century. The trends of globalism and localism are traced out against the material advances that our technologies make possible and the often conflicting moral claims to a share of that wealth that our distinct but increasingly interdependent cultures make inevitable. We have come to see these moral claims as entitlements of membership in society and have designed an array of institutions that we hold responsible for their fulfilment. This status quo, however, is systemically unstable, unsustainable, and, therefore, morally unjustifiable. To achieve an acceptable form of stability (in terms of human systems, the virtuous mean between chaos and stagnation), we must, at the very least, learn to manage both conflicting moral claims and conflicting standards of morality—we must develop a system of moral governance that can enable us to act responsibly within our increasingly pluralistic moral world. Some requirements of such a system are outlined.  aPublisher supplied data 3agovernance 3ahumans 3asociety0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g1994 Sept., v. 38, no. 1 p.153-171dSage PublicationswJournal:2328x0002-76427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642940380010123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012900165300001600294520125400310592002801564596007601592596009101668596006601759650002801825650001201853650001601865650001601881650000901897650001101906650001601917650001301933650001501946650001501961650001501976650001401991650001002005650002102015650001602036700002102052700002102073700002502094700002102119773013202140856008302272852000902355655001202364IND60745723820221118054400.0210820e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074572382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10695-021-00944-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAle, Analía10aLow temperature stress in a cultured fish (Piaractus mesopotamicus) fed with Pyropia columbina red seaweed-supplemented diet  ap. 829-839.  aThis study aimed to analyze the cold stress effects (in terms of hematology, energy reserves, and oxidative stress) in Piaractus mesopotamicus (pacú) and their mitigation by a Pyropia columbina red seaweed-supplemented diet. For this purpose, juvenile fish were fed with a control (CD) or a red seaweed-supplemented diet (RD) for 60 days, and then, the animals were exposed to a low temperature (14 °C) and a control temperature (24 °C) for 24 h. The cold shock generated an increase of hemoglobin levels in fish fed with both diets. In CD-fed fish, plasmatic triglycerides, cholesterol, and hepatic glycogen decreased after the thermal shock; meanwhile, the animals fed with RD showed decreased hepatic proteins, but increased cholesterol and hepatic glycogen. Regarding oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes augmented their activity in the liver, intestine, and gills; meanwhile, lipid oxidative damage was observed in the liver and intestine of fish exposed to 14 °C and fed with both diets. Pacú was sensitive to cold shock, but no mitigation effects were observed in fish fed with the supplemented diet. Further research should target higher concentrations of P. columbina in supplemented diets to take advantage of this valuable resource.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT-2016 1911cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica  aPIP- 112 201501 00942 COcConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas  aCAI+D 2016-50420150100016LIcUniversidad Nacional del Litoral 3aPiaractus mesopotamicus 3aPyropia 3acholesterol 3acold stress 3adiet 3aenergy 3afarmed fish 3aglycogen 3ahematology 3ahemoglobin 3aintestines 3ajuveniles 3aliver 3aoxidative stress 3atemperature1 aBacchetta, Carla1 aRossi, Andrea S.1 aScarabotti, Pablo A.1 aCazenave, Jimena0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2021 Aug., v. 47, no. 4 p.829-839dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870056x0920-17427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-021-00944-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245016100169300001300330520108400343592002801427650001501455650001901470650001701489650002501506650001701531650002001548650002901568650002701597650002201624650002001646650002501666651001101691651001001702651001201712651001801724653001801742653003401760653001901794653001601813653002401829700001201853700001701865700002401882773009101906856008401997852000902081655001202090IND60635873020221119232941.0190523e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063587302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2019.03.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmeyaw, Bismark10aInvestigating, forecasting and proposing emission mitigation pathways for CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion only: A case study of selected countries  ap. 7-21.  aIn this study, we investigate the direction of causal relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion only (CO2EFFCO) and economic growth for the USA, China, Canada, and Nigeria by using annual time series data for the period 1990–2016. The results depict a unidirectional causality running from gross domestic product per capita to CO2EFFCO for the USA, China, and Canada. However, no causality direction was found for Nigeria. Furthermore, with the quest to achieve cleaner energy targets, we formulate long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm devoid of exogenous variables and assumptions required to forecast CO2EFFCO for the USA, China, Canada, and Nigeria. Based on the performance of our algorithm, we propose emission-mitigation pathways for the countries herein to follow to achieve zero CO2EFFCO by the year 2030. The emission-mitigation pathways demonstrate that intensifying and promoting current and future policies that mitigate CO2EFFCO based on our projections are enough to reduce energy-related CO2EFFCO to a considerable level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aeconomic development 3afossil fuels 3afuel combustion 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agross domestic product 3aissues and policy 3aneural networks 3atime series analysis 3aCanada 3aChina 3aNigeria 3aUnited States 0aCO2 emissions 0aLong short-term memory (LSTM) 0aClimate change 0aForecasting 0aForecast evaluation1 aYao, Li1 aOppong, Amos1 aAgyeman, Joy Korang0 tEnergy policy.g2019 July, v. 130 p.7-21dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.03.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245011800164300001600282500002000298520128900318592002801607650002401635650001501659650002601674650001501700650001101715650001201726700002101738700002501759700002201784700002201806773013001828856007301958852000902031655001202040IND60587609320221118102147.0180102e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058760932DNAL7 a10.1890/11-1059.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCauley, Douglas J.10aEvaluating the performance of methods for estimating the abundance of rapidly declining coastal shark populations  ap. 385-392.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAccurately surveying shark populations is critical to monitoring precipitous ongoing declines in shark abundance and interpreting the effects that these reductions are having on ecosystems. To evaluate the effectiveness of existing survey tools, we used field trials and computer simulations to critically examine the operation of four common methods for counting coastal sharks: stationary point counts, belt transects, video surveys, and mark and recapture abundance estimators. Empirical and theoretical results suggest that (1) survey method selection has a strong impact on the estimates of shark density that are produced, (2) standardizations by survey duration are needed to properly interpret and compare survey outputs, (3) increasing survey size does not necessarily increase survey precision, and (4) methods that yield the highest density estimates are not always the most accurate. These findings challenge some of the assumptions traditionally associated with surveying mobile marine animals. Of the methods we trialed, 8 × 50 m belt transects and a 20 m radius point count produced the most accurate estimates of shark density. These findings can help to improve the ways we monitor, manage, and understand the ecology of globally imperiled coastal shark populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer simulation 3aecosystems 3afield experimentation 3amonitoring 3asharks 3asurveys1 aMcLean, Kevin A.1 aBauer, John,d-1978,1 aYoung, Hillary S.1 aMicheli, Fiorenza0 tEcological applications.g2012 Mar., v. 22, no. 2 p.385-392dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-1059.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245013000176300001600306500001400322520119000336592002801526650002701554650001101581650001701592650002201609650001201631650001101643650001001654650001201664650001501676653001901691653002301710653002201733773011101755856008501866852000901951655001201960IND60693110720221118052343.0200505e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069311072DNAL7 a10.1080/09524622.2004.97535242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGORETSKAIA, MARIA I.10aSong structure and singing behaviour of willow warbler phylloscopus trochilus acredula in populations of low and high density  ap. 183-195.  aNAL-light  aSong structure and singing behaviour in two nesting populations of Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus acredula of different density were studied in Moscow and Kostroma Regions, Russia, from 1994–1997. In total 520 songs of 9 males from the low-density population and 566 songs of 12 males from the high density population were analysed. Singing periods in the high density Willow Warbler population (11 males, 758 min.) were longer (58% of the time) than in the low density population (13 males, 866 min.) (58%). In the high density population, 51% of singing time consisted of “singing duels” (singing in gaps between the songs of a neighbouring male, and singing during the singing of a neighbouring male), while in the low density population only 7% did. The initial phrases of Willow Warbler songs were significantly longer in the high density population, with up to 9–13 elements, while there were no occurrences of this length in the low density population. Songs as a whole were longer and more variable in the high density population. Thus changes in structure, singing activity and behaviour are linked to male-male interaction and density of the nesting community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhylloscopus trochilus 3aRussia 3abioacoustics 3achemical elements 3adensity 3alength 3amales 3anesting 3apopulation 0asong structure 0apopulation density 0asinging behaviour0 tBioacoustics.g2004 Jan. 1, v. 14, no. 3 p.183-195dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:21583x2165-05867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09524622.2004.97535243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245007200206300001600278520166100294592002801955650001701983650002302000650002602023650001602049650001602065650001902081653002702100653002102127653002902148653002502177653002102202773011802223856008602341852000902427655001202436IND60635873320221119232746.0190425e20190615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063587332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Ajay1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6700-030X10aManaging the uncertainty problems of municipal solid waste disposal  ap. 259-265.  aIn waste management systems, several parameters such as the rate of waste production, disposal facility, treatment cost, and their relations may be uncertain and can influence the associated optimization processes. These uncertainty problems in waste management were addressed by using various inexact programming methods. For example, fuzzy, stochastic programming, and interval programming techniques were generally used for solving the uncertainty-related waste management problems. The analysis revealed that the efficiency of waste management system can be maximized by the proper use of these optimization techniques. In this approach, an uncertainty problem is reduced into several subproblems with sureness by using the minimax regret optimization technique. And these subproblems are focused on a calculation where the lament of not getting the goal is minimized. The analysis also revealed that the fuzzy-stochastic method was increasingly used for dealing with the waste management system uncertainty in recent times. This paper gives an overview of dealing with the uncertainty problems of waste disposal in urban areas. An indication of the solid waste disposal problems and its management in conjunction with the repercussion of the investigation is described. The rationale and setting of the uncertainty issues in proper waste management are detailed.

We observed two colonies in an area of secondary Atlantic Forest, FLONA-ICMBio, in Northeastern Brazil. The workers were individually marked. We recorded the displacement of workers, their returns to the nest with and without food, the time spent searching for food, maximum and total distance, inter-trip latency and direction of trips. The time spent searching for food, maximum distance and transport velocity did not vary with food size. The previous trip success reduced the latency between foraging trips and increased the percentage of success on the next trip. However, this previous success did not demonstrate a significant variation relative to the time spent searching on the next trip or direction of search. The workers maintained an individual directional fidelity during foraging. The adjustments of these foraging variables under individual control contributed to the efficiency at the colony level. D. quadriceps is compatible with the central place theory and risk sensitivity model of behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDinoponera 3afoods 3aforaging 3aforests 3amodels 3anests 3arisk 3aBrazil1 aMedeiros, Jeniffer C.1 aAraújo, Arrilton0 tJournal of insect behavior.g2014 Mar., v. 27, no. 2 p.177-191dSpringer-Verlagx0892-75537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10905-013-9412-6  aDNAL 7aarticle01641naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245014300164300001800307520041900325592002800744650002300772650002300795650002200818650002200840650002000862650003000882700001700912700001600929700001600945700001800961700002200979700005701001773013301058856007901191852000901270655001201279IND60734218320221118004156.0210417e20210329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073421832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c030042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Xiangshuo10aOrganocatalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Biologically Relevant 3,3- Dihydroxyphenyloxindoles via para-Quinone Methides Derived from Isatins  ap. 5489-5498.  aThe first asymmetric synthetic approach to biologically relevant 3,3-diphenyloloxindoles was developed using para-quinone methides derived from isatins and phenols.

The results of the reclassification accuracy were higher than random assignment, indicating the existence of individual differences. Individual pup vocalisations did not differ from one another by any single acoustic parameter, but by a set of parameters.

In this study, the effect of 22-year fertilization and cropping on accumulation, availability, and uptake of heavy metals in red soil was investigated. The results showed that pig manure promoted significantly cadmium (Cd) accumulation (average 1.1 mg kg⁻¹), nearly three times higher than national soil standards and, thus, increased metal availability. But the enrichment of heavy metals decreased remarkably by 50.5 % under manure fertilization, compared with CK (control without fertilization). On the contrary, chemical fertilizers increased greatly lead (Pb) availability and Cd activity; in particular, exceeding 85 % of soil Cd became available to plant under N (nitrogen) treatment during 9–16 years of fertilization, which correspondingly increased their enrichment by 29.5 %. Long-term application of chemical fertilizers caused soil acidification and manure fertilization led to the increase in soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM), and available phosphorus (Olsen P), which influenced strongly metal behavior in red soil, and their effect had extended to deeper soil layer (20∼40 cm). It is advisable to increase application of manure alone with low content of heavy metals or in combination with chemical fertilizers to acidic soils in order to reduce toxic metal risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3acadmium 3acrop yield 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amanure spreading 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apig manure 3arisk 3asoil acidification 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3atoxicity1 aLiu, Jing1 aXu, Minggang1 aLv, Jialong1 aSun, Nan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Oct., v. 22, no. 19 p.15154-15163dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4745-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245009800209520167800307592002801985650001502013650001902028650001502047650001302062650002402075650001102099650002302110650001502133650001602148653003902164653001602203653002602219653001602245653002402261653002302285700001802308700002602326700001302352773009702365856008702462852000902549655001202558IND60686572720221120022621.0200419e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068657272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1147912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHua, Zhiguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4195-275610aRemaining useful life prediction of PEMFC systems based on the multi-input echo state network  aThe limited durability is one of the key barriers of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) to large-scale commercial applications. The data-driven prognostic method aims to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) without the need for complete knowledge about the system’s physical phenomena. As an improved structure of the recurrent neural network, the Echo State Network (ESN) has demonstrated better performances, especially in reducing the computational complexity and accelerating the convergence rate. The traditional prognostic methods utilize only the previous state, e.g. stack voltage, for prediction. Nevertheless, the current operating conditions, such as stack current, stack temperature and the pressures of the reactants (i.e. oxygen and hydrogen) can also contain important degradation information in practice. Especially, the stack current is a crucial operating parameter, since it is normally taken as the scheduling variable and it could reflect the operating conditions. Compared with the single-input and single-output (SISO-ESN) structure, the ESN with multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO-ESN) is proposed in this paper to improve the RUL prediction accuracy. Stack voltage, stack current, stack temperature and the pressures of the reactants are combinedly used to predict the RUL. After the mathematical modeling and the parameter designing, the prediction performance of SISO-ESN and MIMO-ESN are verified and compared on a 1 kW electrical power test bench developed in the laboratory. Results show that the MIMO-ESN method has a better performance than the SISO-ESN method under both static and quasi-dynamic operating conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3adurability 3aelectric power 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen 3amathematical models 3aoxygen 3aphysical phenomena 3aprediction 3atemperature 0aProton exchange membrane fuel cell 0aPrognostics 0aRemaining useful life 0aData-driven 0aReservoir computing 0aEcho state network1 aZheng, Zhixue1 aPéra, Marie-Cécile,1 aGao, Fei0 tApplied energy.g2020 May 01, v. 265 p.114791-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1147913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04044naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245021600165300001600381520196100397592002802358650002002386650002202406650001902428650002102447650001202468650001902480650002502499650001802524650002402542650002902566650001602595650002902611650002102640650002302661650001202684650001802696650001602714650001102730650001502741650001902756650002402775650001902799650001002818650001702828650001402845651001002859653002302869653001502892653001502907653002902922653003302951653003602984700001603020700001303036700001703049700005203066700002003118700001803138773011903156856008603275852000903361655001203370IND60635873520221118050938.0210312e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063587352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Yucui10aAssessing the viability of soil successive straw biochar amendment based on a five-year column trial with six different soils: Views from crop production, carbon sequestration and net ecosystem economic benefits  ap. 173-186.  aConverting straw to biochar (BC) followed by successive application to soil has been increasingly suggested as a multi-win approach for soil fertility improvement, carbon (C) sequestration and efficient disposal of straw residues in intensive cropping agroecosystems. However, different soil types response differently in terms of crop growth and non-CO₂ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions after BC application. Furthermore, few studies have comprehensively evaluated the net global warming potential (GWP) and net ecosystem economic benefits (NEEB) after long-term BC incorporation across representative soil types in China. A five-year outdoor column experiment was conducted using three rice-wheat rotated paddy soils and three millet-wheat rotated upland soils developed from different parent materials. Rice straw BC application rates of 0, 2.25 and 11.3 Mg ha⁻¹ were used in each crop season with identical doses of NPK fertilizers. Compared with the no BC controls, BC significantly boosted crop growth, enhanced C sequestration, and decreased cumulative N₂O and CH₄ emissions in all six soils over five rotation cycles. The response of the upland soils to BC was better in terms of crop growth and N₂O mitigation, whereas the soil organic carbon (SOC) increment and CH₄ mitigation were less effective compared with the paddy soils. Net GWP decreased 0.6–19 fold after BC application; however, given the low trade price of CO₂ (0.21 × 10³ CNY Mg⁻¹), only a small contribution was made in terms of C costs to the NEEB. The BC-induced NEEB was mainly dependent on grain yield gains and BC costs. These findings highlight that widespread adoption of successive straw BC application to farmland requires an increase in crop yield and substantial lowering of the BC cost regardless of the soil type.

However, the co-combustion of sludge and pulverized coal will generate a lot of particulate matter (PM). In this paper, the formation characteristics of particulate matter (PM₁₀) produced by the co-combustion of sludge and pulverized coal were studied. The effect of the furnace temperature and the sludge mixing ratio on the mass-based particle size distribution and elemental composition of PM₁₀ in sludge, coal combustion and co-combustion was discussed. The experiment results show that the mass-based particle size distribution of PM₁₀ produced by pulverized coal and sludge combustion are both bimodal, while the elemental composition and particle size distribution of PM₁₀ are different. Whether burning alone or co-firing, increasing the furnace temperature will increase the mass yield of PM₁₀. Increasing the temperature promotes particle fragmentation more than the melting aggregation of particulate minerals, increasing PM₀.₄–₁₀ yield. The mass yield of PM₁₀ produced by coal combustion is higher than that of sludge. In the sludge addition ratio range ≤ 30%, increasing the sludge addition ratio will reduce the mass yield of PM₁₀. The synergistic effect exists between sludge and pulverized coal co-combustion. Compared to the weighted calculation results, the content of main elements Si, Ca, Fe and S in PM₀.₄ decreases, while in PM₀.₄–₁₀ the content of Si decreases and the content of Ca, Fe, Al, and P increases. At a low sludge addition ratio of 10%, the elemental composition of PM₁₀ with the particle size distribution trend is consistent with that of pulverized coal, and sludge co-firing takes negligible effect on PM₁₀ formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3aelemental composition 3afurnaces 3aparticle size distribution 3aparticulates 3apower generation 3apulverized coal 3asludge 3asynergism 3atemperature 3aChina 0aMunicipal sludge 0aPower plant 0aCoal combustion 0aCo-firing 0aPM101 aMa, Wenjing1 aRuan, Renhui1 aLi, Yuan1 aZhang, Qingfu1 aMao, Rui1 aYu, Shilin1 aDeng, Shuanghui1 aTan, Houzhang1 aWang, Xuebin0 tFuel processing technology.g2022 Nov., v. 236 p.107438-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2022.1074383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010700158300002000265520097400285592002801259650001701287650001401304650002301318650002301341650002101364650001301385650002201398650001801420650001501438650001101453650001301464650001701477650002401494650001101518700001301529773012401542856007401666852000901740655001201749IND60667300020221119001037.0190919e20150203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066730002DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra00280j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shengwei10aPreparation of a Ag–MnO₂/graphene composite for the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline solution  ap. 15627-15633.  aAg–MnO₂/graphene composite with mesoporous structure is prepared by an immersion-calcination method. The composite composed of Ag (∼6 nm) and MnO₂ (∼4 nm) nanoparticles is distributed evenly on the graphene sheets. The oxygen reduction peak of the Ag–MnO₂/graphene catalyst in a 0.1 M KOH solution is tested at −0.15 V, which is more positive than that of 20% Pt/C (−0.19 V). The onset potential of Ag–MnO₂/graphene (0.068 V) is close to Pt/C (0.079 V). The oxygen reduction reaction limiting current density for the Ag–MnO₂/graphene catalyst is approximately 5.62 mA cm⁻², which is similar to that for Pt/C (5.83 mA cm⁻²). The onset potential of the Ag–MnO₂/graphene is close to that of Pt/C. The introduction of Ag nanoparticles between the MnO₂ nanoparticles on graphene sheets can significantly improve the catalytic activation, because of the increase in conductivity and abundant active sites provided during the ORR process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reduction 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3amanganese dioxide 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aoxygen 3aplatinum 3aporous media 3apotassium hydroxide 3asilver1 aQin, Xue0 tRSC advances.g2015 Feb. 03, v. 5, no. 20 p.15627-15633dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra00280j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03779naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245023400156300001600390520211100406592002802517650001502545650002002560650002002580650001002600650002302610650002002633650001402653650001102667650002602678650002002704650002602724650002202750650001602772650002402788650001302812650002702825650002102852650002002873650001002893650002502903650002302928700001502951700002002966700001802986700002003004700002003024773012303044856007303167852000903240655001203249IND60082171220221119062113.0141016e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008217122DNAL7 a10.1111/evj.122062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, J.

There is limited information regarding their effects in horses. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of quinapril and its effects on ACE and renin in horses. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study using healthy mature horses. METHODS: Six healthy horses were administered quinapril at 120 mg i.v., 120 mg per os and 240 mg per os in a 3‐way crossover design. Blood was collected for measurement of quinapril and quinaprilat concentrations using ultra‐high pressure liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity and renin activity were measured using a radioenzymatic assay. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic modelling and statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: No adverse effects were observed during the study period. Intravenous and oral administration significantly inhibited ACE activity. Renin concentrations increased in all groups, but this increase was not statistically significant. Following i.v. administration of quinapril, mean terminal half‐life was 0.694 h and 1.734 h for quinapril and quinaprilat, respectively. The mean volume of distribution and clearance for quinapril were 0.242 l/kg bwt and 11.93 ml/kg bwt/min, respectively. Maximum concentration for quinaprilat was 145 ng/ml at 0.167 h. Bioavailability of quinapril following oral administration was <5%. Quinaprilat was detected in all horses following oral administration of quinapril; however, it was below the limit of quantification of the assay (2.5 ng/ml) for most horses in the 120 mg dosing group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, despite low plasma concentrations, quinapril has sufficient oral absorption to produce inhibition of ACE in healthy horses. Controlled studies in clinically affected horses are indicated. Quinapril provides a potential treatment alternative for horses with cardiovascular and renal disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadverse effects 3abioavailability 3ablood 3across-over studies 3aenzyme activity 3ahalf life 3ahorses 3aintravenous injection 3akidney diseases 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3aoral administration 3apatients 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3apharmacokinetics 3aquality of life 3arenin 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models1 aKruger, K.1 aLaFevers, D.

We analysed 303 red deer individuals from the middle of the region, in seven Hungarian game reserves, at ten microsatellite loci (C01, C229, T26, T108, T123, T156, T172, T193, T501, T507), to investigate the genetic diversity of these subpopulations. We discovered high levels of genetic diversity of red deer subpopulations; allelic richness values ranging 4.99–7.01, observed heterozygosity 0.729–0.800, polymorphic information content 0.722–0.806, and Shannon’s information index 1.668–2.064. Multi-locus analyses indicated population admixtures of various degrees that corresponded to geographical location, and complex genetic structures were shown by clustering. Populations in the south-western and the north-eastern parts of the region formed two highly separated groups, and the red deer from populations in between them were highly admixed (in western Pannonia/Transdanubia, where the Danube flows into the Carpathian Basin). This pattern corresponds to the distribution of mitochondrial as well as Y-chromosome lineages. Assignment tests showed that a large fraction of individuals (29.4%) are found outside of their population of origin, indicating that the dispersal of red deer is rather common, which could be expected considering the life course of the species.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAIK-MBK/MS71411cministry of agriculture (hu): agrárminisztérium  aÚNKP-17-3-I-KE-2cemberi eroforrások minisztériuma 3aCervus elaphus 3aY chromosome 3abasins 3afauna 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondria 3aresearch 3awildlife1 aSzepesi, Kinga1 aBleier, Norbert1 aSugar, László,1 aKusza, Szilvia1 aBarta, Endre1 aHorn, Peter,1 aOrosz, László,1 aStéger, Viktor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8765-17350 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2022 Oct., v. 68, no. 5 p.55-55dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4237928x1612-46427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-022-01602-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014500171300001600316520140200332592002801734650001901762650001401781650001401795650002401809650003401833650001301867650000901880650001901889650001501908650001701923650001301940651001001953653004001963653003002003653002802033653001002061653001002071700002302081700003002104700002302134700002102157700002202178700001902200700002302219773009702242856008502339852000902424655001202433IND60086935420221119221414.0190318e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008693542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2013.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaillard, J. C.,10aParticipatory 3-dimension mapping: A tool for encouraging multi-caste collaboration to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction  ap. 158-166.  aThis article reflects upon the use of participatory 3-dimensional mapping (P3DM) for facilitating the collaboration of different castes in disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA). Unequal power relationships amongst upper and lower castes has indeed been identified has a major driver of people's vulnerability to natural hazards, including the negative effects of climate change, in Nepal and elsewhere in South Asia. However, this does not prevent the members of all these castes, including the lowest untouchables, to display significant capacities in facing these natural hazards and changes in climate patterns. It is therefore similarly important to harness those capacities and address the unequal power relationships underpinning vulnerability. Achieving these goals requires fostering dialogue amongst upper and lower castes as well as with other stakeholders of DRR and CCA, e.g. scientists, NGOs, government agencies, which often tend to work with a single caste because it is easier. P3DM provides a platform for such a dialogue as it makes the knowledge of every caste tangible and credible to others. This proves essential in both assessing and planning for reducing the risk of disasters and adapting to climate change.

The vinylcyclopropane thus prepared was separated into two epimers, namely, RSS-1 and SSS-1. Both the epimers and an epimeric mixture underwent radical ring-opening polymerization (RROP), where the number-average molecular weights (Mₙs) of the polymers depended on the configuration of 1; i.e., the RROP of SSS-1 gave the corresponding polymer, of which Mₙ was higher than the polymer obtained by the RROP of RSS-1. This difference in polymerization behaviors was correlated successfully with the difference in manners of intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the two epimers, which were clarified by the polymerization of SSS-1 was assisted by intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Besides the RROP in solution, the RROP of SSS-1 in its solid state was investigated to find that it afforded the corresponding polymer highly efficiently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3ahydrogen bonding 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aSudo, Atsushi1 aEndo, Takeshi0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Aug. 08, v. 50, no. 15 p.5679-5686dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b027783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002300156245010900179300001600288520144900304592002801753650002101781650002701802650002601829650003701855650002901892650001201921650001401933650001001947650001401957650001701971650003901988650001302027650001302040650001302053650001802066650001502084650003402099650001902133650001102152653001302163653001802176653003302194653002002227653002102247653003002268700001602298700001702314700002202331700002002353700002102373700002302394700002202417700002102439700002302460773009402483856009102577852000902668655001202677IND60610092620221121060836.0190613e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061009262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZander, Zachary K.10aPost-fabrication QAC-functionalized thermoplastic polyurethane for contact-killing catheter applications  ap. 339-350.  aThe use of catheters is ubiquitous in medicine and the incidence of infection remains unacceptably high despite numerous advances in functional surfaces and drug elution. Herein we report the use of a thermoplastic polyurethane containing an allyl ether side-chain functionality (allyl-TPU) that allows for rapid and convenient surface modification with antimicrobial reagents, post-processing. This post-processing functionalization affords the ability to target appropriate TPU properties and maintain the functional groups on the surface of the device where they do not affect bulk properties. A series of quaternary ammonium thiol compounds (Qx-SH) possessing various hydrocarbon tail lengths (8–14 carbons) were synthesized and attached to the surface using thiol-ene “click” chemistry. A quantitative assessment of the amount of Qx-SH available on the surface was determined using fluorescence spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Contact-killing assays note the Q8-SH composition has the highest antimicrobial activity, and a live/dead fluorescence assay reveals rapid contact-killing of Staphylococcus aureus (>75% in 5 min) and Escherichia coli (90% in 10 min) inocula. Scale-up and extrusion of allyl-TPU provides catheter prototypes for biofilm formation testing with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and surface-functionalized catheters modified with Q8-SH demonstrate their ability to reduce biofilm formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiofilm 3acatheters 3adrugs 3aextrusion 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ainoculum 3amedicine 3amoieties 3apolyurethanes 3aprototypes 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3athermoplastics 3athiols 0aCatheter 0aAntimicrobial 0aQuaternary ammonium compound 0aContact-killing 0aPost-fabrication 0aSurface functionalization1 aChen, Peiru1 aHsu, Yen-Hao1 aDreger, Nathan Z.1 aSavariau, Laura1 aMcRoy, Willie C.1 aCerchiari, Alec E.1 aChambers, Sean D.1 aBarton, Hazel A.1 aBecker, Matthew L.0 tBiomaterials.g2018 Sept., v. 178 p.339-350dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014100157300001800298500001900316520148600335592002801821650002301849650001701872650002001889650001201909650001501921650001601936650001101952650002001963650001201983650001101995650001302006650001402019700001202033700001602045700001502061700001902076700001802095700001802113773012502131856007402256852000902330655001202339IND60731004620221116192605.0210315e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073100462DNAL7 a10.1039/d0gc04084c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Lanfang10aEfficient extracellular laccase secretion via bio-designed secretory apparatuses to enhance bacterial utilization of recalcitrant lignin  ap. 2079-2094.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicrobial-driven lignin conversion has a significant impact on the biogeochemistry of global ecosystems and biomass utilization. During this process, secretion of extracellular ligninolytic enzymes is the first, essential step, yet there is a significant challenge to the secretion of these high-redox potential enzymes in bacteria, especially in Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, genome and proteome analyses enabled us to bio-design two types of extracellular secretory apparatus, both of which effectively secreted a heterologous laccase in Pseudomonas putida, up to ∼300 U mL⁻¹. Importantly, a strong cooperation between P. putida A514 cells and the extracellular laccase, which was either released to the medium or displayed on the cell surface, was observed to significantly promote cell growth (9 × 10¹⁰ CFUs mL⁻¹) and lignin consumption (12.5%). Chemical analyses of lignin further confirmed the effect on lignin utilization. Moreover, we demonstrated that a free laccase-A514 cell system exhibited greater effect on lignin utilization than that of a cell-immobilized laccase complex, which challenges the current view of bacterial polymer catabolism, and suggests the importance of secretory pathways and sufficient reaction surface for lignin biocatalysis. Our study advances the knowledge of secretion mechanisms in Gram-negative bacteria and provides novel insights into the lignin utilization by extracellular lignolytic enzyme-bacterial cell systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas putida 3abiocatalysis 3abiogeochemistry 3abiomass 3acatabolism 3acell growth 3agenome 3agreen chemistry 3alaccase 3alignin 3aproteome 3asecretion1 aLin, Lu1 aSui, Haiyan1 aWang, Heng1 aZhang, Zhichao1 aJiao, Nianzhi1 aZhou, Jizhong0 tGreen chemistry.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 23, no. 5 p.2079-2094dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0gc04084c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010500169300001600274520085600290592002801146596005101174596005201225650002601277650001701303650001801320650001801338650002201356650001701378650001301395650001201408700002201420700001901442700006101461773011901522856008301641852000901724655001201733IND60786937520221121125745.0220807e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078693752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-022-03271-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSöderlund, Isac10aFacile synthesis of 2-hydroxyacetophenone from racemic styrene oxide catalyzed by engineered enzymes  ap. 985-990.  aWe describe a system that allows for biocatalyzed in vivo synthesis of α-hydroxy ketones from racemic epoxide starting material by in vivo co-expression of native and engineered epoxide hydrolase and alcohol dehydrogenases. The constructed expression system exploits the host cell metabolism for supply and regeneration of precious nicotinamide dinucleotide coenzyme. Racemic styrene oxide added to growth medium passively enters the cells and is hydrolyzed into (1R)-phenylethane-1,2-diol, which is subsequently oxidized to the acyloin 2-hydroxyacetophenone. Produced 2-hydroxyacetophenone escapes the cells via passive diffusion into the growth medium. Thus, co-expression of potato epoxide hydrolase and engineered alcohol dehydrogenase variants can be employed for robust and facile production of 2-hydroxyacetophenone from racemic styrene oxide.  aPublisher supplied data  a183-358cStiftelsen Olle Engkvist Byggmästare  a194-0638cStiftelsen Olle Engkvist Byggmästare 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3abiocatalysis 3abiotechnology 3aculture media 3aepoxide hydrolase 3anicotinamide 3apotatoes 3astyrene1 aTjärnhage, Elias1 aHamnevik, Emil1 aWidersten, Mikael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3203-37930 tBiotechnology letters.g2022 Aug., v. 44, no. 8 p.985-990dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-022-03271-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011400158300001500272500002000287520136800307592002801675596007701703596005901780596002801839650001101867650000801878650001301886650001601899650001801915650001601933650001101949650001001960650001601970650001501986650002902001650002602030650003102056700002202087700001902109700002102128700005802149700006002207773012602267856007402393852000902467655001202476IND60761376920221122052251.0211228e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076137692DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.142072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shao‐jia10aCitrus heat shock transcription factor CitHsfA7‐mediated citric acid degradation in response to heat stress  ap. 95-104.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHeat stress is a major abiotic stress for plants, which can generate a range of biochemical and genetic responses. In ‘Ponkan’ mandarin fruit, hot air treatment (HAT) accelerates the degradation of citric acid. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of citrate degradation in response to HAT remain to be elucidated. Here, 17 heat shock transcription factor sequences were isolated, and dual‐luciferase assays were employed to investigate whether the encoded proteins that could trans‐activate the promoters of key genes in the GABA shunt, involved in citrate metabolism. We identified four heat shock transcription factors (CitHsfA7, CitHsfA3, CitHsfA4b and CitHsfA8) that showed trans‐activation effects on CitAco3, CitIDH3 and CitGAD4, respectively. Transient expression of the CitHsfs in citrus fruits indicated that CitHsfA7 was the only factor that resulted in a significant lowering of the citric acid content, and these results were confirmed by a virus‐induced gene silencing system (VIGS). Sub‐cellar localization showed that CitHsfA7 is located in the nucleus and is capable of binding directly to a putative HSE in the CitAco3 promoter and enhance its expression. We proposed that the induction of CitHsfA7 transcript level contributes to citric acid degradation in citrus fruit, via modulation of CitAco3 in response to HAT.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018FZA6010cThe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a31801591cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aB17039cthe 111 Project 3aCitrus 3aair 3acitrates 3acitric acid 3acitrus fruits 3aenvironment 3afruits 3agenes 3aheat stress 3ametabolism 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation1 aLiu, Sheng‐chao1 aLin, Xia‐hui1 aGrierson, Donald1 aYin, Xue‐ren1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1282-44321 aChen, Kun‐song1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2874-23830 tPlant, cell and environment.g2022 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.95-104dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl11406x0140-77917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.142073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04138naa a2200997 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011100163300001800274520126300292592002801555650001701583650001301600650002001613650001001633650001001643650001401653650001401667700001601681700001601697700002301713700002301736700001801759700001801777700002001795700002101815700002201836700001801858700002201876700001701898700002901915700002201944700002401966700002301990700002702013700002602040700002102066700002202087700001702109700002702126700003102153700002002184700001702204700002102221700001602242700002002258700001802278700002602296700002302322700002602345700002802371700001802399700001902417700002002436700001902456700001802475700002602493700002102519700003102540700002002571700002002591700002502611700002602636700002602662700002002688700001902708700002802727700001702755700002502772700002202797700001602819700001802835700002002853700001802873700001902891700001802910700002502928773009302953856007303046852000903119655001203128IND60465831520221120133321.0151123e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046583152DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.135532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDivakar, Pradeep K.10aEvolution of complex symbiotic relationships in a morphologically derived family of lichen‐forming fungi  ap. 1217-1226.  aWe studied the evolutionary history of the Parmeliaceae (Lecanoromycetes, Ascomycota), one of the largest families of lichen‐forming fungi with complex and variable morphologies, also including several lichenicolous fungi. We assembled a six‐locus data set including nuclear, mitochondrial and low‐copy protein‐coding genes from 293 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The lichenicolous lifestyle originated independently three times in lichenized ancestors within Parmeliaceae, and a new generic name is introduced for one of these fungi. In all cases, the independent origins occurred c. 24 million yr ago. Further, we show that the Paleocene, Eocene and Oligocene were key periods when diversification of major lineages within Parmeliaceae occurred, with subsequent radiations occurring primarily during the Oligocene and Miocene. Our phylogenetic hypothesis supports the independent origin of lichenicolous fungi associated with climatic shifts at the Oligocene–Miocene boundary. Moreover, diversification bursts at different times may be crucial factors driving the diversification of Parmeliaceae. Additionally, our study provides novel insight into evolutionary relationships in this large and diverse family of lichen‐forming ascomycetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParmeliaceae 3aancestry 3adata collection 3afungi 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3asymbiosis1 aCrespo, Ana1 aWedin, Mats1 aLeavitt, Steven D.1 aHawksworth, D.

Herein, three widely used OPV building blocks DT-BT, DT-FBT, and DT-OBT were prepared and comparatively researched for their intra-molecule charge transport (ICT) based on single molecular conductance measurements and theoretical calculation. The measured conductance (G) of the three molecules displays an order of GDT₋BT < GDT₋FBT < GDT₋OBT, contradicting the conductivity order predicted by tunnelling theory. Further research demonstrated that this change was mainly caused by NCLs embedded in DT-FBT and DT-OBT, resulting in more efficient charge transporting pathways, evidenced by their HOMOs showing hyper-conjugation characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHomo 3achemical communication 3ameasurement 3aprediction 3aresearch1 aShi, Yangyang1 aWang, Zhiye1 aWang, Xu1 aLi, Yunchuan1 aSun, Mingjun1 aGuo, Jing1 aQian, Gongming1 aChang, Shuai0 tChemical communications.g2022 Mar. 8, v. 58, no. 20 p.3298-3301dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1cc06406a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100006100187245013000248300001800378506007600396520204300472592002802515506003702543650001302580650001402593650002102607650001902628650002202647650001102669650004402680650001302724650002302737650002002760650001502780700005502795700006502850700006002915773013702975856008003112852000903192655001203201IND60671579020221207071855.0191003e20190904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067157902DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b060342doi7 aPMC67653652pmcid7 a314836532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKay, Matthew J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3079-918910aBreaking the Backbone: Central Arginine Residues Induce Membrane Exit and Helix Distortions within a Dynamic Membrane Peptide  ap. 8034-8047.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTransmembrane domains of membrane proteins sometimes contain conserved charged or ionizable residues which may be essential for protein function and regulation. This work examines the molecular interactions of single Arg residues within a highly dynamic transmembrane peptide helix. To this end, we have modified the GW⁴,²⁰ALP23 (acetyl-GGAW⁴(AL)₇AW²⁰AGA-amide) model peptide framework to incorporate Arg residues near the center of the peptide. Peptide helix formation, orientation and dynamics were analyzed by means of solid-state NMR spectroscopy to monitor specific ²H- or ¹⁵N-labeled residues. GW⁴,²⁰ALP23 itself adopts a tilted orientation within lipid bilayer membranes. Nevertheless, the GW⁴,²⁰ALP23 helix exhibits moderate to high dynamic averaging of NMR observables, such as ²H quadrupolar splittings or ¹⁵N–¹H dipolar couplings, due to competition between the interfacial Trp residues on opposing helix faces. Here we examine how the helix dynamics are impacted by the introduction of a single Arg residue at position 12 or 14. Residue R14 restricts the helix to low dynamic averaging and a well-defined tilt that varies inversely with the lipid bilayer thickness. To compensate for the dominance of R14, the competing Trp residues cause partial unwinding of the helix at the C-terminal. By contrast, R¹²GW⁴,²⁰ALP23 exits the DOPC bilayer to an interfacial surface-bound location. Interestingly, multiple orientations are exhibited by a single residue, Ala-9. Quadrupolar splittings generated by ²H-labeled residues A3, A5, A7, and A9 do not fit to the α-helical quadrupolar wave plot defined by residues A11, A13, A15, A17, A19, and A21. The discontinuity at residue A9 implicates a helical swivel distortion and an apparent 3₁₀-helix involving the N-terminal residues preceding A11. These molecular features suggest that, while arginine residues are prominent factors controlling transmembrane helix dynamics, the influence of interfacial tryptophan residues cannot be ignored.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarginine 3adeuterium 3aisotope labeling 3alipid bilayers 3amembrane proteins 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apeptides 3aphysical chemistry 3astable isotopes 3atryptophan1 aFu, Riqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0075-04101 aGreathouse, Denise V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7104-84991 aKoeppe, Roger E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0676-64130 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Sept. 04, v. 123, no. 38 p.8034-8047dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b060343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245008100198300001400279500002000293520141900313592002801732596004701760596003801807596009701845596009701942596002902039596002902068596002802097650002102125650001702146650001202163650001502175650002602190650001202216650001602228650001202244650001502256650001302271650001902284650001102303650001602314650001002330650003102340700005502371700005902426700006002485700006002545700005802605700005602663773012502719856007402844852000902918655001202927IND60761377020221122052356.0211228e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076137702DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.142192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRissanen, Kaisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8615-419510aDrought effects on volatile organic compound emissions from Scots pine stems  ap. 23-40.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTree stems have been identified as sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that play important roles in tree defence and atmospheric chemistry. Yet, we lack understanding on the magnitude and environmental drivers of stem VOC emissions in various forest ecosystems. Due to the increasing importance of extreme drought, we studied drought effects on the VOC emissions from mature Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stems. We measured monoterpenes, acetone, acetaldehyde and methanol emissions with custom‐made stem chambers, online PTR‐MS and adsorbent sampling in a drought‐prone forest over the hot‐dry summer of 2018 and compared the emission rates and dynamics between trees in naturally dry conditions and under long‐term irrigation (drought release). The pine stems were significant monoterpene sources. The stem monoterpene emissions potentially originated from resin, based on their similar monoterpene spectra. The emission dynamics of all VOCs followed temperature at a daily scale, but monoterpene and acetaldehyde emission rates decreased nonlinearly with drought over the summer. Despite the dry conditions, large peaks of monoterpene, acetaldehyde and acetone emissions occurred in late summer potentially due to abiotic or biotic stressors. Our results highlight the potential importance of stem emissions in the ecosystem VOC budget, encouraging further studies in diverse environments.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Helsinki Research Foundation  cFinnish Society of Forest Science  a310030_189109cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung  a31003A_159866cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung  a1266388cSuomen Akatemia  a1303676cSuomen Akatemia  a307331cSuomen Akatemia 3aPinus sylvestris 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetone 3aadsorbents 3aatmospheric chemistry 3adrought 3aenvironment 3aforests 3airrigation 3amethanol 3amonoterpenoids 3asummer 3atemperature 3atrees 3avolatile organic compounds1 aAalto, Juho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5686-13661 aGessler, Arthur1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1910-95891 aHölttä, Teemu,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7677-71561 aRigling, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1944-40421 aSchaub, Marcus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0158-88921 aBäck, Jaana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6107-667X0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2022 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.23-40dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl11406x0140-77917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.142193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01708naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008600160300001800246520050600264592002800770650001100798650002500809650002200834650001300856700001900869700002000888700001700908700002400925700001800949700001400967700002700981700002301008700001701031700001801048700002701066773013301093856007501226852000901301655001201310IND60769677220221122125154.0220309e20220308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076967722DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc06456h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Prashant10aBismuth-based mixed-anion compounds for anode materials in rechargeable batteries  ap. 3354-3357.  aA facile solvothermal synthesis approach for chemical composition control in ternary Bi–S–I systems is reported by simply controlling the sulfide concentration.

The monolignol ratio has been proposed to affect biomass recalcitrance and the resistance to plant disease. Stem rot caused by the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in Brassica napus causes severe losses in its production. To date, there is no information about the effect of the lignin monomer ratio on the resistance to S. sclerotiorum in B. napus. Four dominantly expressed ferulate‐5‐hydroxylase genes were concertedly knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9 in B. napus, and three mutant lines were generated. The S/G lignin compositional ratio was decreased compared to that of the wild type based on the results of Mӓule staining and 2D‐NMR profiling in KO‐7. The resistance to S. sclerotiorum in stems and leaves increased for the three f5h mutant lines compared with WT. Furthermore, we found that the stem strength of f5h mutant lines was significantly increased. Overall, we demonstrate for the first time that decreasing the S/G ratio by knocking out of the F5H gene improves S. sclerotiorum resistance in B. napus and increases stem strength.  aPublisher supplied data  a31771830cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31971902cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31371655cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aB12006cHigher Education Discipline Innovation Project  aDE‐SC0018409cDOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center 3aBrassica napus 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3abiomass 3aenvironment 3aenzymes 3afungi 3agenes 3alignin 3amutants 3astem rot1 aYan, Xingying1 aRan, Shuyao1 aRalph, John1 aSmith, Rebecca A.1 aChen, Xueping1 aQu, Cunmin1 aLi, Jiana1 aLiu, Liezhao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5781-61210 tPlant, cell and environment.g2022 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.248-261dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl11406x0140-77917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.142083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04299naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245015400160520243300314592002802747650003402775650001702809650002802826650001102854650002002865650001002885650001002895650001402905650001802919650002102937650001902958650001002977650000902987650001102996650001503007650002003022650002503042650001603067650000903083650001703092650003303109650001503142650002003157651001003177653002503187653002003212653002303232653001603255653001303271700001403284700001503298700001503313700001603328700001603344700001903360700001803379700001703397700001603414773011603430856008203546852000903628655001203637IND60786182520221119031940.0220914e20221115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078618252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2022.1155732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Fan10aIntegrating network pharmacology and transcriptomic validation to investigate the efficacy and mechanism of Mufangji decoction preventing lung cancer  aMufangji decoction (MFJD), a famous traditional Chinese medicine formula in Synopsis of Golden Chamber (Jingui yaolue), has been utilized to treat cough and asthma and release chest pain over 2000 years in China. Chinese old herbalist doctor use MFJD to treat lung cancer and cancerous pleural fluid, but the preventive effect of MFJD on lung cancer and the underlying mechanism are indefinite. The goal of this study is to explore the efficacy and mechanism of Mufangji decoction preventing lung cancer referring to the traditional use. Tumor allograft experiment and host versus tumor experiment were used to observe the direct anti-tumor effect and indirect anti-tumor immune effect, the mouse lung carcinogenic model was used to evaluate the dose-response and the preventive effect of MFJD on lung cancer. The active ingredients of MFJD were obtained by UPLC-MS/MS. The potential targets of MFJD were screened by network pharmacology and transcriptomics. The therapeutic targets and pathways of MFJD on lung cancer were obtained by protein-protein interaction, molecular docking and David database. The predicted results were verified in vitro and in vivo. MFJD could significantly prevent tumor growth in host versus tumor experiment but could not in tumor allograft experiment, indicating an anti-tumor immune effect against lung cancer. MFJD could reduce lung nodules with a dose-response in mouse lung carcinogenic model. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) was selected as the core target due to the highest degree value in Protein-Protein interaction network and had potently binding activity to sinomenine and dehydrocostus lactone in molecular docking. In vivo, MPO-expressed neutrophils are negatively correlated with lung cancer progression and MFJD could promote the neutrophil-related immune surveillance. In vitro, sinomenine and dehydrocostus lactone could promote neutrophil phagocytosis, MPO and ROS production in a dose dependent manner. The major compounds from MFJD were identified to regulate 36 targets for lung cancer prevention by UPLC-MS/MS, network pharmacology and transcriptomics. David database exhibited that MFJD plays an important role in immunoregulation by modulating 4 immune-related biological processes and 3 immune-related pathways. MFJD prevents lung cancer by mainly promoting MPO expression to maintain neutrophil immune surveillance, its key compounds are sinomenine and dehydrocostus lactone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aallografting 3aantineoplastic activity 3aasthma 3acarcinogenicity 3achest 3acough 3adatabases 3adose response 3aimmunomodulation 3alung neoplasms 3alungs 3amice 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amyeloperoxidase 3aneoplasm progression 3aneutrophils 3apain 3aphagocytosis 3aprotein-protein interactions 3asinomenine 3atranscriptomics 3aChina 0aNetwork pharmacology 0aTranscriptomics 0aMufangji decoction 0aLung cancer 0aImmunity1 aNiu, Yuju1 aSun, Luyao1 aLi, Wenwen1 aXia, Haojie1 aZhang, Yaru1 aGeng, Shengnan1 aGuo, Zhenzhen1 aLin, Haihong1 aDu, Gangjun0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2022 Nov. 15, v. 298 p.115573-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2022.1155733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01588naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245015100161300001800312520048600330592002800816650000800844650001100852650001500863650001500878650002800893650002000921650001300941650001400954700001500968700002000983700001801003773013301021856007501154852000901229655001201238IND60769677320221122093355.0220309e20220308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076967732DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc06477k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Liangfeng10aCopper-catalyzed multiple oxidation and cycloaddition of aryl–alkyl ketones (alcohols) for the synthesis of 4-acyl- and 4-diketo-1,2,3-triazoles  ap. 3342-3345.  aA Cu/TEMPO-catalyzed tandem multiple oxidative dehydrogenation and cycloaddition has been developed, which affords 4-acyl-1,2,3-triazoles and 4-diketo-1,2,3-triazoles from readily-available aryl–alkyl ketones (or alcohols) and different organic azides.

For this reason, in this study, a new conceptual design process for a small UAV with a PEMFC system was investigated with respect to energy. The mission profile and requirements for the small UAV were first determined. Five reference aircrafts were selected based on mission requirements, and some input parameters were assumed for conducting analyses based on these reference aircrafts. A constraint analysis was conducted to determine wing loading and power-to-weight ratios. The wing loading and power-to-weight ratios were used for mission analysis to determine the design specifications of the small UAV. The effect of gravimetric power and energy densities of the PEMFC system on the designed UAV endurance was also investigated. Finally, performance targets of the PEMFC system were suggested for a long endurance mission of the small UAV. This study investigated a conceptual design process that can be widely used for the conceptual design of small UAVs with PEMFC systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 0aProton exchange membrane fuel cell 0aFuel cell system 0aUnmanned aerial vehicle 0aDesign specification 0aConceptual design0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 176 p.349-356dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.09.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04112naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002200175245009200197300001400289520266000303592002802963650001102991650001803002650001203020650001703032650001803049650001703067650002503084650001903109650001703128650000903145650002303154650001503177650001303192650002203205650001903227650002303246700002303269773015003292856006803442856010003510990002303610852000903633655001203642IND60643371320221119085337.0190510e20120912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064337132DNAL7 a10.3791/40612doi7 aPMC34902462pmcid7 a230076082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhlghatyan, Jivan10aTime-lapse imaging of neuroblast migration in acute slices of the adult mouse forebrain  ap. e4061.  aThere is a substantial body of evidence indicating that new functional neurons are constitutively generated from an endogenous pool of neural stem cells in restricted areas of the adult mammalian brain. Newborn neuroblasts from the subventricular zone (SVZ) migrate along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to their final destination in the olfactory bulb (OB)1. In the RMS, neuroblasts migrate tangentially in chains ensheathed by astrocytic processes2,3 using blood vessels as a structural support and a source of molecular factors required for migration4,5. In the OB, neuroblasts detach from the chains and migrate radially into the different bulbar layers where they differentiate into interneurons and integrate into the existing network1, 6. In this manuscript we describe the procedure for monitoring cell migration in acute slices of the rodent brain. The use of acute slices allows the assessment of cell migration in the microenvironment that closely resembling to in vivo conditions and in brain regions that are difficult to access for in vivo imaging. In addition, it avoids long culturing condition as in the case of organotypic and cell cultures that may eventually alter the migration properties of the cells. Neuronal precursors in acute slices can be visualized using DIC optics or fluorescent proteins. Viral labeling of neuronal precursors in the SVZ, grafting neuroblasts from reporter mice into the SVZ of wild-type mice, and using transgenic mice that express fluorescent protein in neuroblasts are all suitable methods for visualizing neuroblasts and following their migration. The later method, however, does not allow individual cells to be tracked for long periods of time because of the high density of labeled cells. We used a wide-field fluorescent upright microscope equipped with a CCD camera to achieve a relatively rapid acquisition interval (one image every 15 or 30 sec) to reliably identify the stationary and migratory phases. A precise identification of the duration of the stationary and migratory phases is crucial for the unambiguous interpretation of results. We also performed multiple z-step acquisitions to monitor neuroblasts migration in 3D. Wide-field fluorescent imaging has been used extensively to visualize neuronal migration7-10. Here, we describe detailed protocol for labeling neuroblasts, performing real-time video-imaging of neuroblast migration in acute slices of the adult mouse forebrain, and analyzing cell migration. While the described protocol exemplified the migration of neuroblasts in the adult RMS, it can also be used to follow cell migration in embryonic and early postnatal brains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood vessels 3acameras 3acell culture 3acell movement 3afluorescence 3afluorescent proteins 3aimage analysis 3ainterneurons 3amice 3amigratory behavior 3amonitoring 3aneonates 3aneural stem cells 3aolfactory bulb 3atransgenic animals1 aSaghatelyan, Armen0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 Sept. 12, , no. 67 p.e4061-e4061dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/40613Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/4061/time-lapse-imaging-neuroblast-migration-acute-slices-adult-mouse  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007900158300002000237520127200257592002801529650003701557650002401594650003701618650002101655650001001676650002501686650001101711650001301722700001601735700001701751700001901768700001801787700001401805700001701819700001501836773012401851856007401975852000902049655001202058IND60667301120221119000824.0190919e20150424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066730112DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra00304k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuliyalil, H.10aPlasma as a tool for enhancing insulation properties of polymer composites  ap. 37853-37858.  aThe performance of electrical insulating polymers measured by comparative tracking index can be improved by flame retardant fillers in the polymer–matrix, but is not necessary effective due to persisting surface layers. We demonstrated a method for selective etching of polyphenol–matrix composites which leads to improvement of the tracking properties. Selective etching was performed by low pressure inductively coupled oxygen plasma generated at 35 Pa. Species created in discharge were monitored in situ during the treatment by optical emission spectroscopy (OES). Their surface reactions were established indirectly from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) after plasma treatment. The effective etching was done by oxygen species which removed off surface polymer layer within 10 to 15 s during plasma pulse operation to prevent surface overheating. The selective polymer removal improved tracking properties of the 70% glass filler reinforced composites up to 56%, whereas the performance level decreased with the decrease in filler content. This technology provides an important enhancement of polymer–matrix composites' tracking properties and resistance of composites to electrical short-circuit fire.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acomposite materials 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aflame retardants 3aglass 3ainsulating materials 3aoxygen 3apolymers1 aCvelbar, U.1 aFilipič, G.1 aPetrič, A.

The developed methodology comprises an in-capillary reaction step carried out by electrophoretically mediated microanalysis and a separation step in which highly sulfated β-cyclodextrin with partial filling technique has been employed as chiral selector for verapamil and norverapamil enantiomers resolution, joining the advantages of both methodologies in a unique assay. Kinetic parameters of the enzymatic reaction (Kₘ and Vₘₐₓ) have been evaluated for both verapamil enantiomers by non-linear fitting of experimental data obtained under intermediate precision conditions to Michaelis–Menten equation. Kₘ and Vₘₐₓ estimated values were 51±9μM and 22±2pmolmin⁻¹(pmolCYP)⁻¹ for S-VER and 47±9μM and 21±2pmolmin⁻¹(pmolCYP)⁻¹ for R-VER. Consequently, slight enantioselectivity was found for the CYP3A4 metabolism of verapamil. However, since confidence intervals of estimates overlap, we cannot assure a significant enantioselectivity. Intrinsic clearance values were also estimated from Kₘ and Vₘₐₓ for both enantiomers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achromatography 3aconfidence interval 3aenantiomers 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzyme kinetics 3ametabolism 3averapamil1 aMartín-Biosca, Y.1 aEscuder-Gilabert, L.1 aSagrado, S.1 aMedina-Hernández, M.J.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 July 12, v. 1298 p.139-145dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011200164300002000276500001900296520137800315592002801693650001701721650001801738650002201756650001901778650001701797700001301814700005801827700005401885773014201939856007902081852000902160655001202169IND60719266020221120073527.0201201e20201109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071926602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.0c057792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Chuning10aMacropatterning of Microcrumpled Nanofiltration Membranes by Spacer Imprinting for Low-Scaling Desalination  ap. 15527-15533.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSurface patterns provide a chemical-free approach to reduce fouling by mimicking nature and are yet limited by their complicated fabrication procedures. Here, we report readily scalable methods to create sub-micrometer- and millimeter-scale patterns on membrane surfaces for low-scaling desalination, with a focus on the antiscaling mechanism. Specifically, a robust polyethylene (PE) lithium battery separator prepared from melt casting and stretching has been used as the support for nanofiltration (NF), giving micrometer-scale crumples on the surface. Then, the PENF membrane is imprinted by a permeate spacer during tests, leading to millimeter-scale patterns. Two types of experiments are designed to give insights into the impact of surface structure on scaling in NF processes, including (1) comparisons of smooth surfaces and surfaces with nanometer-, micrometer-, and millimeter-scale features and (2) no-stirring dead-end tests and crossflow tests. It has been found that micrometer-scale patterns are resistant to scaling through both spatial and hydrodynamic effects, and millimeter-scale patterns are also effective in reducing scaling solely due to hydrodynamic effects. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation gives further explanations. In addition, organic and microbial fouling has been studied to give implications for future membrane engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesalination 3ahydrodynamics 3alithium batteries 3ananofiltration 3apolyethylene1 aWang, Li1 aXia, Jianzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1563-95631 aZhang, Sui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2767-86340 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Nov. 09, v. 54, no. 23 p.15527-15533dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c057793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03789naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015500168300001800323520239300341592002802734650001102762650002002773650002102793650001402814650001102828650001402839650000802853650001102861650001902872650001702891650001602908650001302924650001002937651001402947653002202961653001402983700002402997700002003021700002303041700001703064700001703081700001503098773009903113856008603212852000903298655001203307IND60535079020221120161141.0190319e20150626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053507902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.05.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyda, Amalie10aFactors associated with influenza vaccination in middle and older aged Australian adults according to eligibility for the national vaccination program  ap. 3299-3305.  aIn Australia, influenza vaccination is recommended and provided free of charge for all adults aged ≥65 years and those aged <65 years with specific risk factors. Other than age, there is limited information on characteristics associated with vaccine uptake.We used the 45 and Up Study, a large cohort of adults aged ≥45 years, who completed a questionnaire in 2012 asking about influenza vaccination. We compared characteristics of those reporting influenza vaccination in those aged <65 and ≥65 years using a log binomial model to estimate relative rates (RRs), adjusted for age and other factors.Among 27,036 participants, the proportion reporting influenza vaccination in the last year increased steadily with age from 24.6% in those <54 years to 67.2% in those 75–79 years; of those eligible for universal free vaccine, (≥65 years) 57.3% had an influenza vaccination in the previous year. Many characteristics associated with higher vaccination rates in adults aged <65 years (mean 60.7) and those ≥65 years (mean 73.7) were similar. These included sex (women versus men: <65 years, aRR=1.14[95% CI 1.08–1.20]; ≥65 years, aRR=1.04[1.02–1.07]), higher BMI (≥30kg/m2 versus >18.5 to <25kg/m2: <65 years, aRR=1.16[1.09–1.24]; ≥65 years, aRR=1.06[1.03–1.09]), requiring assistance with daily tasks versus not (<65 years, aRR=1.27[1.15–1.40]; ≥65 years, aRR=1.05[1.02–1.09]) and reporting versus not reporting specific chronic illnesses (<65 years, aRR=1.55 [1.48–1.63]; ≥65 years, aRR=1.08[1.06–1.10]). Current smokers had lower vaccination rates (<65 years, aRR=0.78[0.69–0.90]; ≥65 years, aRR=0.91[0.84–0.99]). Among those aged <65 years only, being a carer, higher income, and education were associated with influenza vaccination (aRR=1.32[1.19–1.47], 1.17[1.10–1.24] and 1.12[1.10–1.22] respectively). Non-English speaking country of birth was associated with lower vaccination rates in ≥65 years (aRR 0.86[0.81–0.92]).Factors most strongly associated with vaccination were age and among those aged <65 years, having a medical indication recommended for influenza vaccination, suggesting higher uptake among those who can access free vaccine. Among those eligible for free vaccination, interventions could be targeted towards men, smokers, those from non-English speaking backgrounds and those <65 years with a medical indication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody mass index 3achronic diseases 3aeducation 3aincome 3ainfluenza 3amen 3amodels 3aquestionnaires 3arisk factors 3avaccination 3avaccines 3awomen 3aAustralia 0aAdult vaccination 0aInfluenza1 aMacIntyre, C.

Thirty-six women (M=29years −8months of age) receiving clinical treatment for eating disorders completed: the Attribution Style Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Stirling Eating Disorder Scales. An HRA yielded a three-way interaction among the attributional dimensions on depressive symptoms. Plotting of the slopes showed that the attribution of negative life events to the combination of internal locus of control, high stability, and a high globality, was associated with the optimal level of depressive symptoms. The findings supported the Reformulated Helplessness as a model of depression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeating disorders 3alife events 3amental depression 3amodels 3aquestionnaires 3awomen 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aDepressionxcomplicationsxpsychology. 2aDepressive Disorderxcomplicationsxpsychology. 2aEatingxpsychology 2aFeeding and Eating Disordersxcomplicationsxpsychologyxtherapy. 2aFemale 2aHelplessness, Learned 2aHumans 2aInternal-External Control 2aLife Change Events 2aMiddle Aged 2aPsychiatric Status Rating Scales 2aPsychological Theory1 aCosta, Paula1 aTrueman, Mark1 aLattimore, Paul0 tEating behaviors.g2012 Aug., v. 13, no. 3 p.264-266dElsevier Ltdx1471-01537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2012.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007900157300001600236520165600252592002801908650001201936650001201948650001001960650002301970650001001993650001602003650000702019650000902026650001602035650000902051650001702060700002302077700002202100700001702122700003002139700001802169700002602187700002602213773012202239856007402361852000902435655001202444IND60662143820221122142032.0190904e20140326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066214382DNAL7 a10.1039/c3fo60525f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNebot, Elena10aEffects of the amount and source of dietary protein on bone status in rats  ap. 716-723.  aThis study examined the effects of the dietary amount and source of protein on bone status in rats. 140 male Wistar rats aged 8 weeks were randomly allocated to 4 groups (n = 35) fed normal-protein (NP, 10% richness) or high-protein (HP, 45% richness) diets based on whey protein (WP) or soy protein (SP) sources for 12 weeks. Plasma urea was 46% higher for the HP compared to the NP diet (p < 0.001). Urinary calcium was 65% higher for the HP compared to the NP and 60% higher for the WP compared to the SP diets (all, p < 0.001). Urinary pH was 8% more acidic in the HP compared to the NP diet (p < 0.001) and 4% in the WP compared to the SP diet (p < 0.01). The plasma osteocalcin concentration was 19% higher for the NP compared to the HP (p < 0.05) and 25% for the SP compared to the WP diets (p < 0.01). Femur ash, metaphyseal and diaphyseal cross-sectional, trabecular and cortical areas were 3% higher in the HP compared to the NP diet (all, p < 0.05). Femur diaphyseal periosteal and endocortical perimeters were also 3% higher in the HP compared to the NP diet (both, p < 0.01). Groups fed the SP diet showed 2% higher femur ash percentage, 7% higher calcium content (both, p < 0.001), and 3% higher diaphyseal cortical area and thickness (both, p < 0.05) than those fed the WP diet. Some interactions were found, such as the greater effects of the SP diet on decreasing the higher plasma urea concentration promoted by the intake of the HP diet (p < 0.001). Under adequate Ca intake, HP diets could better maintain bone properties than NP diets, even with increasing some acidity markers, which could be reduced by the intake of SP sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acalcium 3afemur 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3aosteocalcin 3apH 3arats 3asoy protein 3aurea 3awhey protein1 aErben, Reinhold G.1 aPorres, Jesús M.1 aFemia, Pedro1 aCamiletti-Moirón, Daniel1 aAranda, Pilar1 aLópez-Jurado, María1 aAparicio, Virginia A.0 tFood & function.g2014 Mar. 26, v. 5, no. 4 p.716-723dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3fo60525f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010900167300001600276520102900292592002801321650001201349650001101361650002501372650002301397650001501420650001301435650000801448650001801456650002601474650001201500650001001512651001301522651001101535700002101546700002201567700002601589773008401615856008101699852000901780655001201789IND60579359920221117233619.0170816e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057935992DNAL7 a10.1007/s10745-017-9919-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAthayde, Simone14aThe Same, but Different: Indigenous Knowledge Retention, Erosion, and Innovation in the Brazilian Amazon  ap. 533-544.  aThis study explores how indigenous knowledge (IK) might be retained and/or changed among contemporary indigenous peoples. Through semi-structured interviews and quantitative analyses of long-term changes in artistic knowledge among three geographically displaced Kaiabi (Kawaiwete) we found an association between language proficiency and gender with greater IK retention, and formal schooling with IK erosion. Six mechanisms of innovation in knowledge of basketry and textiles among men and women were documented. A mixed mode of collaborative learning and knowledge transmission involving diverse actors emerged from community workshops and group forums. Innovative mechanisms for cultural transmission have taken advantage of media, technology, and non-indigenous support organizations to expand weaving knowledge of basketry designs. Our results illustrate how indigenous peoples actively shape cultural transmission and change, as well as the role that public policies and academic research may play in these processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3agender 3aindigenous knowledge 3aindigenous peoples 3ainterviews 3alearning 3amen 3apublic policy 3aquantitative analysis 3aweaving 3awomen 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil1 aSilva-Lugo, Jose1 aSchmink, Marianne1 aHeckenberger, Michael0 tHuman ecology.g2017 Aug., v. 45, no. 4 p.533-544dSpringer USx0300-78397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-017-9919-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03435naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245012900179506011700308506007600425520187500501592002802376506003702404650001502441650001002456650002202466650001702488650001602505650001302521650001602534650001602550653001102566653002202577653001402599653002702613653001302640700002202653700002902675700002102704700002202725700002202747773011102769856008802880852000902968655001202977IND60786183020221207130044.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078618302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2022.1114102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScafide, Katherine N.10aPredicting alternate light absorption in areas of trauma based on degree of skin pigmentation: Not all wavelengths are equal  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDetection and documentation of bruises on survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) can provide valuable evidence to support investigation and subsequent prosecution of these crimes. Detection of bruises in persons with darker skin tones is often difficult, contributing to disparities in health and criminal justice responses to IPV. The purpose of this secondary data analysis was to determine whether use of an alternate light source (ALS) increased the predictive probability of successfully detecting bruises on diverse skin tones following a history of physical trauma. In this study, data were analyzed from a convenience sample of 157 subjects inclusive of six skin tones (very light, light, intermediate, tan, brown, dark) with induced bruises. Bruises were assessed under white light and an ALS 21 times over four weeks using 10 different ALS wavelength and goggle color combinations. Data analyzed included 31,841 skin observations obtained over 2897 participant assessments. Multilevel modeling was used to account for the correlation among the repeated measurements for each bruise. Across all categories of skin pigmentation, ALS wavelengths 415 nm and 450 nm viewed through a yellow filter had the most frequent detections of bruises (415 nm: n = 2777, 11.2%; 450 nm: n = 2747, 11.1%) and greater predictive probability of a positive finding (415 nm: 0.90–0.99; 450 nm: 0.85–0.99) than white light (n = 2487; 10%; 0.81–0.90). These two ALS wavelengths were the only combinations that provided greater probability of detection than white light on groups with darker skin (brown or dark), whereas additional ALS wavelengths/filters worked equally well on groups with lighter skin. Findings suggest use of an ALS in clinical assessments of patients of color who report IPV may help reduce health and criminal justice-related disparities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3acolor 3aforensic sciences 3apigmentation 3aprobability 3aviolence 3awavelengths 3awhite light 0aBruise 0aSkin pigmentation 0aDetection 0aAlternate light source 0aForensic1 aDowning, Nancy R.1 aKutahyalioglu, Nesibe S.1 aSheridan, Danny,1 aLanglois, Neil E.1 aHayat, Matthew J.0 tForensic science international.g2022 Oct., v. 339 p.111410-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2022.1114103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245010500189300001600294500001500310520135600325592002801681650001901709650001701728650001701745650002201762650001501784650001001799650002001809650002401829650001801853650003301871650001101904650003301915650001001948650001101958650001301969653001801982700001602000700001802016773008802034856008402122852000902206655001202215IND60086936520221119221729.0141102e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008693652DNAL7 a226644112pmid7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2012.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHouben, Katrijn10aGuilty pleasures II: Restrained eaters' implicit preferences for high, moderate and low-caloric food  ap. 275-277.  a2019-12-06  aIn a previous study, restrained eaters showed stronger implicit preferences for high-caloric food compared to unrestrained eaters. Caloric density and palatability are however almost always intertwined, and it was never tested whether this high-calorie food preference of restrained eaters follows from the energy density or the palatability of high-calorie foods. Here, it was examined whether restrained eaters may hold stronger implicit preferences than unrestrained eaters for palatable food in general, irrespective of caloric density. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Using two unipolar SCIATs positive and negative implicit associations were measured with palatable food of either high, moderate, or low caloric density. Results showed a strong effect of dietary restraint on implicit food preferences independently of caloric density, indicating stronger implicit preferences for all types of palatable food with increased dietary restraint. With respect to negative implicit associations, participants showed stronger negative implicit associations with high-calorie food than with moderate-calorie or low-calorie food, regardless of dietary restraint. Thus, restrained eaters show enhanced implicit preferences, not only for high caloric food, but for palatable food in general compared to unrestrained eaters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy density 3apalatability 3afood choices 3alow calorie foods 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBody Mass Index 2aCaloric Restriction 2aEnergy Intake 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology 2aFemale 2aFood Preferencesxpsychology 2aGuilt 2aHumans 2aPleasure 0aeating habits1 aRoefs, Anne1 aJansen, Anita0 tEating behaviors.g2012 Aug., v. 13, no. 3 p.275-277dElsevier Ltdx1471-01537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2012.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012800159300001600287520139600303592002801699650002301727650002301750650002601773650001801799650001201817650002001829650001101849650001701860650002501877650002301902650002301925650001201948650000901960650001701969650001001986650002801996700001902024700002702043700002602070700001902096700001702115700002002132700001802152773012202170856007402292852000902366655001202375IND60662144020221122142026.0190904e20140326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066214402DNAL7 a10.1039/c3fo60539f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontó, Fermí10aAction of an extract from the seeds of Fraxinus excelsior L. on metabolic disorders in hypertensive and obese animal models  ap. 786-796.  aNuzhenide and GI3, the principal secoiridoids of an extract obtained from the seeds of Fraxinus excelsior L. (FXE), are believed to be the active compounds responsible for the previously reported hypoglycemic effects of this extract. In this study, the effects of FXE were studied in two animal models which are representative of metabolic disorders: spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and obese Zucker rats. SHR were acutely treated (oral gavage) with different doses of FXE. In addition, SHR and Zucker rats were chronically fed (20 or 5 weeks, respectively) with standard chow supplemented with FXE. Acute treatment with FXE (200 mg per kg body weight) decreased systolic blood pressure as in the case with captopril (50 mg per kg body weight). Chronic treatment with FXE at 100 mg per kg body weight per day, a dose equivalent to that showing hypoglycemic activity in humans, resulted in a significant decrease in glycemia (−16.3%), triglyceridemia (−33.4%) and body weight (−8.1%) in Zucker rats as well as a significant decrease in SBP in SHR (−6.7%), with a concomitant improvement in endothelial function in both strains. The broad-ranging effects of FXE may be due to a unique compositional profile that could be useful to prevent the metabolic syndrome, characterized by obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia and elevated blood pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFraxinus excelsior 3aactive ingredients 3aanimal disease models 3ablood glucose 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3ahumans 3ahypertension 3ahypertriglyceridemia 3ainsulin resistance 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3arats 3asecoiridoids 3aseeds 3asystolic blood pressure1 aArce, Cristina1 aNoguera, Maria Antonia1 aIvorra, Maria Dolores1 aFlanagan, John1 aRoller, Marc1 aIssaly, Nicolas1 aD'Ocon, Pilar0 tFood & function.g2014 Mar. 26, v. 5, no. 4 p.786-796dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3fo60539f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009100172300001400263520166000277592002801937650001501965650002501980650001602005650003202021650001102053650002602064650000702090650001502097650001902112650001402131650001402145700002202159700001802181700002402199773009402223856008402317852000902401655001202410IND60113090820221122033410.0141111e20130712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011309082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.04.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuélat, Bertrand10aModel-based prediction of monoclonal antibody retention in ion-exchange chromatography  ap. 17-25.  aIn order to support a model-based process design in ion-exchange chromatography, an adsorption equilibrium model was adapted to predict the protein retention behavior from the amino acid sequence and from structural information on the resin. It is based on the computation of protein–resin interactions with a colloidal model and accounts for the contribution of each ionizable amino acid to the protein charge. As a verification of the protein charge model, the experimental titration curve of a monoclonal antibody was compared to its predicted net charge. Using this protein charge model in the computation of the protein–resin interactions, it is possible to predict the adsorption equilibrium constant (i.e. retention factor or Henry constant) with an explicit pH and salt dependence. The application of the model-based predictions for an in silico screening of the protein retention on various stationary phases or, alternatively, for the comparison of various monoclonal antibodies on a given cation-exchanger was demonstrated. Furthermore, considering the structural differences between charge variants of a monoclonal antibody, it was possible to predict their individual retention times. The selectivity between the side variants and the main isoform of the monoclonal antibody were computed. The comparison with the experimental data showed that the model was reliable with respect to the identification of the operating conditions maximizing the selectivity, i.e. the most promising conditions for a monoclonal antibody variant separation. Such predictions can be useful in reducing the experimental effort to identify the parameter space.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3aion exchange chromatography 3amodels 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apH 3aprediction 3aprocess design 3ascreening 3atitration1 aDelegrange, Lydia1 aValax, Pascal1 aMorbidelli, Massimo0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 July 12, v. 1298 p.17-25dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.04.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008600156300001800242500001900260520166500279592002801944650001201972650001201984650002601996650001302022650001902035650002102054650001702075650001702092650002202109650002002131650001302151650001802164650001602182650001602198700001402214700001502228773012502243856007402368852000902442655001202451IND60731005620221116192615.0210315e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073100562DNAL7 a10.1039/d0gc04362a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Xiao10aFlexible on-site halogenation paired with hydrogenation using halide electrolysis  ap. 2037-2043.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDirect electrochemical halogenation has appeared as an appealing approach in synthesizing organic halides in which inexpensive inorganic halide sources are employed and electrical power is the sole driving force. However, the intrinsic characteristics of direct electrochemical halogenation limit its reaction scope. Herein, we report an on-site halogenation strategy utilizing halogen gas produced from halide electrolysis while the halogenation reaction takes place in a reactor spatially isolated from the electrochemical cell. Such a flexible approach is able to successfully halogenate substrates bearing oxidatively labile functionalities, which are challenging for direct electrochemical halogenation. In addition, low-polar organic solvents, redox-active metal catalysts, and variable temperature conditions, inconvenient for direct electrochemical reactions, could be readily employed for our on-site halogenation. Hence, a wide range of substrates including arenes, heteroarenes, alkenes, alkynes, and ketones all exhibit excellent halogenation yields. Moreover, the simultaneously generated H₂ at the cathode during halide electrolysis can also be utilized for on-site hydrogenation. Such a strategy of paired halogenation/hydrogenation maximizes the atom economy and energy efficiency of halide electrolysis. Taking advantage of the on-site production of halogen and H₂ gases using portable halide electrolysis but not being suffered from electrolyte separation and restricted reaction conditions, our approach of flexible halogenation coupled with hydrogenation enables green and scalable synthesis of organic halides and value-added products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3aalkynes 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acathodes 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolysis 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy efficiency 3agreen chemistry 3ahalogens 3ahydrogenation 3atemperature 3avalue added1 aLiu, Xuan1 aSun, Yujie0 tGreen chemistry.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 23, no. 5 p.2037-2043dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0gc04362a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011300174520137500287592002801662650001801690650001201708650002201720650002101742650002701763650000901790650001301799651001101812653003301823653003001856653002801886653004901914653004501963653002702008653002102035700001902056773011102075856008802186852000902274655001202283IND60786183320221121164616.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078618332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2022.1114132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Hsiao-Wen10aMethanol concentration as a preceding eliminative marker for the authentication of Scotch Whiskies in Taiwan  aModern rectified spirit is distilled ethanol (EtOH) containing only a tiny amount of methanol (MeOH), as opposed to former industrial alcohol, and is frequently used by perpetrators to adulterate or counterfeit Scotch whiskies in Taiwan. As a result, MeOH level presents an obvious discrepancy between adulterated whiskies and authentic Scotch whiskies. In this study, 54 authentic single malt Scotch whisky samples and 30 authentic blended Scotch whisky samples were comparatively analyzed. Instead of various analog internal standards often spiked for GC/MS quantitative analyses, the isotope-labeled internal standard ²H₃-MeOH was employed for optimizing the Scotch whisky analysis to achieve a limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 5 ppm for MeOH. The resulting data were further analyzed by a distribution fitting method and showed that the distribution of MeOH levels corresponded to a lognormal distribution for both authentic single malt Scotch whiskies and authentic blended Scotch whiskies. Based on the statistical characteristics of the lognormal distribution, 99.7% of the MeOH concentrations would lie between 13.4 and 44.2 ppm for authentic single malt Scotch whiskies and between 7.87 and 74.9 ppm for authentic blended Scotch whiskies, suggesting that the MeOH level might serve as a marker for the authentication of the seized Scotch whiskies in Taiwan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScotch whisky 3aethanol 3aforensic sciences 3aisotope labeling 3alognormal distribution 3amalt 3amethanol 3aTaiwan 0aScotch whisky authentication 0aAdulterated Scotch whisky 0aMethanol quantification 0aGas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) 0aIsotope labeled internal standard method 0aLognormal distribution 0aRectified spirit1 aChang, Wei-Tun0 tForensic science international.g2022 Oct., v. 339 p.111413-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2022.1114133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03712naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006800145245013500213300002000348500001900368520183800387592002802225650001502253650002502268650001402293650001602307650001602323650002502339650001902364650002002383650002602403650001102429650001202440650002202452650003102474650001102505650001502516650001302531650001502544650002102559650002202580651001902602700006402621700006402685700005702749700001602806700002102822700002002843700006502863773014202928856007903070852000903149655001203158IND60719266520221120073438.0201201e20201113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071926652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.0c059722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKassotis, Christopher D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0990-242810aThyroid Receptor Antagonism of Chemicals Extracted from Personal Silicone Wristbands within a Papillary Thyroid Cancer Pilot Study  ap. 15296-15312.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResearch suggests that thyroid cancer incidence rates are increasing, and environmental exposures have been postulated to be playing a role. To explore this possibility, we conducted a pilot study to investigate the thyroid disrupting bioactivity of chemical mixtures isolated from personal silicone wristband samplers within a thyroid cancer cohort. Specifically, we evaluated TRβ antagonism of chemical mixtures extracted from wristbands (n = 72) worn by adults in central North Carolina participating in a case–control study on papillary thyroid cancer. Sections of wristbands were solvent-extracted and analyzed via mass spectrometry to quantify a suite of semivolatile chemicals. A second extract from each wristband was used in a bioassay to quantify TRβ antagonism in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293/17) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10% of the original extract (by volume). Approximately 70% of the sample extracts tested at a 1% extract concentration exhibited significant TRβ antagonism, with a mean of 30% and a range of 0–100%. Inhibited cell viability was noted in >20% of samples that were tested at 5 and 10% concentrations. Antagonism was positively associated with wristband concentrations of several phthalates, organophosphate esters, and brominated flame retardants. These results suggest that personal passive samplers may be useful in evaluating the bioactivities of mixtures that people contact on a daily basis. We also report tentative associations between thyroid receptor antagonism, chemical concentrations, and papillary thyroid cancer case status. Future research utilizing larger sample sizes, prospective data collection, and measurement of serum thyroid hormone levels (which were not possible in this study) should be utilized to more comprehensively evaluate these associations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonism 3abioactive properties 3abioassays 3ablood serum 3abromination 3acase-control studies 3acell viability 3adata collection 3aenvironmental science 3ahumans 3akidneys 3amass spectrometry 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3apeople 3aphthalates 3asilicone 3atechnology 3athyroid hormones 3athyroid neoplasms 3aNorth Carolina1 aHerkert, Nicholas J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3286-89341 aHammel, Stephanie C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5334-20451 aHoffman, Kate1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8029-77101 aXia, Qianyi1 aKullman, Seth W.1 aSosa, Julie Ann1 aStapleton, Heather M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9995-65170 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Nov. 13, v. 54, no. 23 p.15296-15312dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c059723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100001400157245007500171300001800246520187000264592002802134650002402162650001202186650001302198650001102211650001002222650001102232650001402243650000902257650001102266650001202277650001302289650001102302650001802313650000902331650001202340650002802352650002902380650001402409650001402423650001302437650004102450650005402491700002202545773010902567856007202676852000902748655001202757IND60082174620221118051404.0141017e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008217462DNAL7 a250535762pmid7 a10.1002/etc.26952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei10aDepuration of metals by the green‐colored oyster Crassostrea sikamea  ap. 2379-2385.  aThe accumulation of metals (especially copper) in oysters has led to green‐color now being found in Chinese estuaries. In the present study, the authors quantified the depuration of 8 metals (Ag, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in green‐colored oysters (Crassostrea sikamea) collected from an estuary that is heavily contaminated by metals as a result of industrial effluent releases. The oysters were depurated under laboratory conditions for 4 mo; the accumulated concentrations and the subcellular distribution of metals were measured at different time intervals. Results showed that the green color of oysters faded to light yellow (nearly normal) after 4 mo of depuration. Depuration of metals could be described by a first‐order kinetic process. The calculated overall depuration rate constants of metals were in the range of 0.008 d⁻¹ to 0.024 d⁻¹, with a biological retention half‐life of 30 d to 70 d. The depuration rates of green‐colored contaminated oysters were significantly higher for Cd, Cu, Cr, and Ni than the rates of oysters from a less contaminated site, whereas the depuration rates of Ag, Co, Pb, and Zn were comparable between the 2 populations. When corrected for the change of oyster tissue weight, the actual efflux rate constants of the metals (0.0708–0.1014 d⁻¹) were much higher than the overall depuration rate constants. Cellular debris and metallothionein‐like proteins were the important fractions binding with the metals in the oysters. Significant changes in metal subcellular distribution were observed during the 4‐mo depuration for Ag, Cd, Cu, and Zn. Metallothionein‐like protein became more important in sequestering the metals during the depuration period, with a concomitant decrease in metals associated with the cellular debris fraction.

Crude tire pyrolysis oil (CTPO) was produced in a 10 ton rotating autoclave reactor by thermal depolymerization of the tire polymers. In this work, the prior-reported straightforward and inexpensive strategy of upgrading CTPO using a combination of silica gel (as adsorbent) and petroleum ether (as the solvent) has been scaled up with minimal loss in mass of oil and improved physicochemical characteristics (e.g., lowered acid value, low sulfur content). The upgraded TPO (StTPO) was characterized extensively to better understand their chemical compositions, physicochemical properties, and combustion characteristics. StTPO was mixed with diesel in different volumetric proportions and the blends were studied for performance and emission characteristics in a single-cylinder engine. The use of biomass-derived ethyl levulinate (EL) as a fuel oxygenate improved the cold-flow properties of StTPO–diesel blends as well as lowered the exhaust emissions (e.g., lower NOₓ). A fuel blend consisting of 50% diesel, 40% StTPO, and 10% EL demonstrated the best fuel properties in the single-cylinder diesel engine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid value 3aadsorbents 3acombustion 3adepolymerization 3adiesel engines 3aliquids 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apyrolysis 3apyrolysis oils 3asilica gel 3asolvents 3asulfur1 aDutta, Saikat1 aBalusamy, Saravanan1 aMadav, Vasudeva0 tRSC advances.g2021 Mar. 08, v. 11, no. 17 p.9807-9826dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra08803j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03419naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245016600158300002000324520192200344592002802266650001702294650001302311650001402324650002902338650001402367650001602381650002302397650000902420650001902429650001602448650002002464650002202484650000902506650000902515650002402524650001202548700001202560700001602572700001702588700001302605700001102618700001702629700001102646700002002657700001702677773012402694856007402818852000902892655001202901IND60667301820221119000838.0190919e20150402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066730182DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra00315f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Meng-Meng10aRole of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the protective effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate on lead-induced impairments of spine formation in the hippocampus of rats  ap. 31622-31628.  aThe Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been implicated in the development of dendritic spines, which are the structural basis for the induction of long-term potentiation. We have previously shown that exposure to Pb during development causes damage to the spines on hippocampal pyramidal neurons by decreasing the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin in green tea, has been shown to recover impaired hippocampal-dependent long-term potentiation in rats exposed to Pb. We report here an investigation of whether this protective function of EGCG works by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to refine the formation of spines in rats exposed to Pb during development. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were exposed to Pb from parturition to weaning and EGCG (10, 25 and 50 mg kg⁻¹) was given intraperitoneally from postnatal day 14 to postnatal day 21. We found that exposure to Pb significantly decreased the density of dendritic spines and spine head size of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 areas; EGCG (10 and 25 mg kg⁻¹) reversed this Pb-induced spine damage. EGCG (10 and 25 mg kg⁻¹) also recovered the expression of Wnt7a and β-catenin phosphorylation after exposure to Pb. However, 50 mg kg⁻¹ of EGCG did not restore the spine morphology and the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway on rats exposed to Pb. EGCG did not exert any protective effect on Pb²⁺-induced damage in cultured hippocampal neurons when Wnt7a shRNA applied. Our results show that EGCG (within a certain dose range) has a significant protective effect on spine formation and maturation through Wnt/β-catenin signaling in young rats exposed to Pb. This effect involves the up-regulation of Wnt7a expression and the attenuation of phospho-β-catenin expression. EGCG may be a potential complementary agent in the treatment of Pb poisoning.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta catenin 3acatechin 3adendrites 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3agreen tea 3ahippocampus 3alaboratory animals 3alead 3alead poisoning 3aparturition 3aphosphorylation 3aprotective effect 3apups 3arats 3asignal transduction 3aweaning1 aHu, Fan1 aLou, Zhi-Yi1 aXue, Weizhen1 aYu, Hang1 aXu, Li1 aLiu, Zhi-Hua1 aXu, Yi1 aChen, Xiang-Tao1 aWang, Hui-Li0 tRSC advances.g2015 Apr. 02, v. 5, no. 40 p.31622-31628dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra00315f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245007900170520132800249592002801577650002001605650001301625650002101638650002201659650004101681650001801722650001501740650001401755650002401769653002201793653001401815653001301829653001501842653002201857653001201879653001901891700002501910700002001935700002001955700002001975700001901995773011102014856008802125852000902213655001202222IND60786183420221121164548.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078618342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2022.1114142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Lucy10aGenuine and counterfeit prescription pill surveillance in Washington, D.C.  aFor the first time in Washington, D.C., an in-depth analysis of counterfeit pills has been performed as part of a larger initiative to understand the city’s illicit drug supply. Over a 56-month period, 567 pills that were physically identified as a pharmaceutical were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Out of the 567 pills submitted to our laboratory, 119 were confirmed to be counterfeit. Beginning in 2018, an increase in counterfeit pills was observed in suspected pharmaceutical submissions. By 2021, 62.5% of all pill exhibits were determined to be counterfeit. Most of the counterfeit pills submitted during this time frame had a ’30M′ imprint with blue coloring, consistent with the physical identification of a 30 mg Oxycodone tablet. Fentanyl was the number one identified psychoactive substance detected in counterfeit pills (75.4%), however, other opioids, precursors, and a novel benzodiazepine were also identified. This preliminary research hopes to illustrate counterfeit pill trends in Washington, D.C. and highlight the importance of analyzing pharmaceuticals in addition to suspected illicit substances. This surveillance is ongoing and collaboration with neighboring jurisdictions is anticipated in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzodiazepines 3afentanyl 3aflame ionization 3aforensic sciences 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aillicit drugs 3amonitoring 3anarcotics 3apsychotropic agents 0aCounterfeit Pills 0aOxycodone 0aFentanyl 0aAlprazolam 0aSynthetic opioids 0aopioids 0adesigner drugs1 aEvans, Alexandra T.,1 aFrank, Gabriela1 aLevitas, Morgan1 aMennella, Allie1 aShort, Luke C.0 tForensic science international.g2022 Oct., v. 339 p.111414-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2022.1114143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245009700150300001400247500002000261520118500281592002801466596006001494650002201554650001001576650001901586650001701605650001901622650001201641650001701653650001101670650002701681650001501708650001601723700001301739700005101752773012901803856007401932852000902006655001202015IND60761378020221122031933.0211228e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076137802DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.135842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, J.10aImproving riboflavin production by modifying related metabolic pathways in Bacillus subtilis  ap. 78-83.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRiboflavin is a feed additive, food additive and clinical drug, with a significant annual demand of nearly 8000 t. Fermentation using recombinant Bacillus subtilis is currently one of the most important industrial production method for riboflavin. First, a suitable medium was selected and the expression of the ureABC operon was modified. The ykgB gene was overexpressed in B. subtilis RX10, the production of the derivative strain RX20 was increased to 4·61 g l⁻¹ riboflavin, and the yield was increased to 52 mg riboflavin g‐¹ glucose. The relative transcription level of pyr operon in RX20 was reduced to 71%, the production of the derivative strain RX21 was increased to 5·82 g l⁻¹ riboflavin, and the yield was 76 mg riboflavin g⁻¹ glucose. The start codon of the pyrE gene in RX21 was modified to ‘TTG’, the production of the derivative strain RX22 was increased to 7·01 g l⁻¹ riboflavin, and the yield was 89 mg riboflavin g⁻¹ glucose. These results indicated that overexpression of the ykgB gene and reduction of the metabolic flux of de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides were beneficial to the synthesis of riboflavin.  aPublisher supplied data  a2012AA02A701cNational High‐tech R&D Program of China 3aBacillus subtilis 3adrugs 3afeed additives 3afermentation 3afood additives 3aglucose 3amicrobiology 3aoperon 3apyrimidine nucleotides 3ariboflavin 3astart codon1 aWang, C.1 aBan, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9765-16210 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2022 Jan., v. 74, no. 1 p.78-83dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.135843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002000175245009500195300001400290520169800304592002802002650002602030650001502056650001302071650001802084650001702102650000902119650001702128650003902145650001002184650001302194650001202207650001802219650001402237650001402251650002902265700002802294700002302322700002302345700002002368773014902388856006802537856009602605990002302701852000902724655001202733IND60643371820221119085151.0190510e20121007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064337182DNAL7 a10.3791/40732doi7 aPMC39125912pmcid7 a230700762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRonander, Elena10aAnalysis of single-cell gene transcription by rna fluorescent In Situ hybridization (fish)  ap. e4073.  aAdhesion of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes (IE) to human endothelial receptors during malaria infections is mediated by expression of PfEMP1 protein variants encoded by the var genes. The haploid P. falciparum genome harbors approximately 60 different var genes of which only one has been believed to be transcribed per cell at a time during the blood stage of the infection. How such mutually exclusive regulation of var gene transcription is achieved is unclear, as is the identification of individual var genes or sub-groups of var genes associated with different receptors and the consequence of differential binding on the clinical outcome of P. falciparum infections. Recently, the mutually exclusive transcription paradigm has been called into doubt by transcription assays based on individual P. falciparum transcript identification in single infected erythrocytic cells using RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of var gene transcription by the parasite in individual nuclei of P. falciparum IE1. Here, we present a detailed protocol for carrying out the RNA-FISH methodology for analysis of var gene transcription in single-nuclei of P. falciparum infected human erythrocytes. The method is based on the use of digoxigenin- and biotin- labeled antisense RNA probes using the TSA Plus Fluorescence Palette System2 (Perkin Elmer), microscopic analyses and freshly selected P. falciparum IE. The in situ hybridization method can be used to monitor transcription and regulation of a variety of genes expressed during the different stages of the P. falciparum life cycle and is adaptable to other malaria parasite species and other organisms and cell types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aRNA probes 3aadhesion 3aantisense RNA 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3afluorescence 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3ahaploidy 3amalaria 3amessenger RNA 3aparasites 3areceptors 3atranscription (genetics)1 aBengtsson, Dominique C.1 aJoergensen, Louise1 aJensen, Anja T.

The grain thickness trait was considered highly heritable, with a credibility interval ranging from: [Formula: see text]: 0.9480; 0.9440; 0.8610, in environments 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The grain yields showed a weak correlation estimate between grain thickness and 100-grain weight, in all environments, with a credibility interval ranging from ([Formula: see text]= 0.5477; 0.5762; 0.5618 and 0.5973; 0.5247; 0.5632, grain thickness and 100-grain weight, in environments 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The Bayesian multi-trait model proved to be an adequate strategy for the genetic improvement of flood-irrigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3aOryza sativa 3aalgorithms 3aexperimental design 3agenetic improvement 3amodels 3arice1 ade Castro Sant’Anna, Isabela1 aPeixoto, Marco Antônio1 aTorres, Lívia Gomes1 aSilva Siqueira , Michele Jorge1 ada Costa, Weverton Gomes1 aAzevedo, Camila Ferreira1 aSoares, Plínio César1 aCruz, Cosme Damião0 tEuphytica.g2022 Sept., v. 218, no. 9 p.124-124dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-022-03077-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245011300210300001600323520106500339592002801404650002601432650001601458650002001474650003401494650001301528650001101541650003001552650000901582650000901591650001201600650001401612700001901626700001401645700001801659700001901677700001901696700001601715700001801731700002301749700002301772700002501795700002101820700001501841700002901856700002001885700001601905700002201921700003501943700001601978700002201994700002302016700001902039700002202058773009002080856008202170990002302252852000902275655001202284IND60092829020221122043513.0141103e20130108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009282902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cmet.2012.12.0072doi7 aPMC35452832pmcid7 a233122892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParks, Brian W.10aGenetic Control of Obesity and Gut Microbiota Composition in Response to High-Fat, High-Sucrose Diet in Mice  ap. 141-152.  aObesity is a highly heritable disease driven by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a number of loci contributing to obesity; however, a major limitation of these studies is the inability to assess environmental interactions common to obesity. Using a systems genetics approach, we measured obesity traits, global gene expression, and gut microbiota composition in response to a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet of more than 100 inbred strains of mice. Here we show that HF/HS feeding promotes robust, strain-specific changes in obesity that are not accounted for by food intake and provide evidence for a genetically determined set point for obesity. GWAS analysis identified 11 genome-wide significant loci associated with obesity traits, several of which overlap with loci identified in human studies. We also show strong relationships between genotype and gut microbiota plasticity during HF/HS feeding and identify gut microbial phylotypes associated with obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental factors 3afood intake 3agene expression 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotype 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aloci 3amice 3aobesity 3aphylotype1 aNam, Elizabeth1 aOrg, Elin1 aKostem, Emrah1 aNorheim, Frode1 aHui, Simon T.1 aPan, Calvin1 aCivelek, Mete1 aRau, Christoph D.1 aBennett, Brian J.,1 aMehrabian, Margarete1 aUrsell, Luke K.1 aHe, Aiqing1 aCastellani, Lawrence W.1 aZinker, Bradley1 aKirby, Mark1 aDrake, Thomas A.1 aDrevon, C.

We consider two implications of individually distinct echolocation calls: 1) whether bats may be able to use such variation to recognise familiar conspecifics, and 2) whether investigators could use such variation to identify known individuals or to census populations. We compared the discriminability of the echolocation calls of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) recorded in three situations: (a) while held in the hand, (b) while perched on a platform, and (c) while flying in an anechoic chamber. Using variables describing each sonar call, we employed discriminant function analysis (DFA) to assign calls to recording situation or to bat. Discrimination of calls by recording situation was largely unsuccessful, although flying calls could be distinguished from platform calls. Assignment of calls to individual bat across recording situations yielded 72% success, and, within a given recording situation, yielded 87% success. Stepwise DFA reduced the number of variables needed to discriminate between individuals with only a slight decrease in correct classification. These results suggest that bats (or researchers) may be able to use the information contained in the echolocation calls for individual recognition. Individual distinctiveness raises the possibility of censusing bats by sound. We used cluster analysis in an attempt to determine whether, given a sample of calls from an unknown number of bats, a reasonable estimate of the number of bats could be obtained. Results were unsatisfactory, suggesting that cluster analysis probably will not permit acoustic censusing of bats in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEptesicus fuscus 3abioacoustics 3aclassification 3acluster analysis 3adiscriminant analysis 3aecholocation 3aflight 3ainformation 3apopulation 3aresearchers 3asonar 3avariability 0abig brown bat 0aindividual discrimination1 aKAZIAL, KARRY A.1 aMASTERS, W.

Recordings were made during the 1992 and 1997 breeding seasons at Davis and during the 1997 season at Casey. Two observers independently analysed four attributes (start and end frequency, duration and number of elements) of narrow bandwidth calls from each location and time. There were few observer differences when the calls were grouped into four broad types (Trills, Descending Whistles, Ascending Whistles and Mews). Ascending Whistles and Mews were rare at Casey but common at Davis. Descending Whistles occurred significantly more often at Davis. Except for Trills, discriminant function analyses indicated less variation between the call attributes at Davis in 1992 and 1997 than between either of the Davis data sets and that from Casey. Vocalisation differences between Weddell seals from different areas can be detected by measuring common attributes of narrow bandwidth calls.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioacoustics 3abreeding season 3achemical elements 3adata collection 3adiscriminant analysis 3aduration 3afrequency 3aseals 3avocalization 3aAntarctica 0aLeptonychotes weddellii 0avocalisations 0ageographic variation1 aHEALEY, S.

(Asteraceae) are used in Cameroonian folk medicine as a general stimulant and to treat various illnesses and conditions including malaria, bacterial infections and helminthic infestations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten gram samples of the leaf and tuber powders of Vernonia guineensis were extracted separately using dichloromethane, methanol and distilled water. The extracts were dried in vacuo and used in bioassays. These extracts and three compounds previously isolated from Vernonia guineensis [vernopicrin (1), vernomelitensin (2) and pentaisovalerylsucrose (3)] were screened for antiplasmodial activity against chloroquine (CQ)-sensitive (Hb3) and CQ-resistant (Dd2) Plasmodium falciparum lines. RESULTS: Crude extracts and pure compounds from Vernonia guineensis showed antiplasmodial activity against both Hb3 and Dd2. The IC₅₀ values of extracts ranged from 1.64 to 27.2µg/ml for Hb3 and 1.82–30.0µg/ml for Dd2; those for compounds 1, 2 and 3 ranged from 0.47 to 1.62µg/ml (1364–1774nM) for Hb3 and 0.57–1.50µg/ml (1644–2332nM) for Dd2. None of the crude extracts or pure compounds was observed to exert toxic effects on the erythrocytes used to cultivate the Plasmodium falciparum lines. CONCLUSION: In Cameroonian folk medicine, Vernonia guineensis may be used to treat malaria in part due to the antiplasmodial activity of sesquiterpene lactones (1, 2), a sucrose ester (3) and perhaps other compounds present in crude plant extracts. Exploring the safety and antiplasmodial efficacy of these compounds in vivo requires further study.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aVernonia 3abacterial infections 3abioassays 3aerythrocytes 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleaves 3amalaria 3amethanol 3aplant extracts 3apowders 3asesquiterpenoid lactones 3asucrose 3atoxicity 3atraditional medicine 2aAntimalarialsxpharmacology 2aErythrocytesxdrug effects 2aLactonesxpharmacology 2aMedicine, African Traditional 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPlant Leaves 2aPlant Tubers 2aPlasmodium falciparumxdrug effects 2aSesquiterpenesxpharmacology 2aSucrosexpharmacology 2aVernonia 0aCameroon1 aKrause, Michael A.1 aFairhurst, Rick M.1 aTane, Pierre1 aBryant, Joseph1 aVerpoorte, R.,0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2013 June 3, v. 147, no. 3 p.618-621dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.03.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245023500171300001800406520128300424592002801707650003501735650003001770650001501800650001801815650002201833650001501855700001801870700002301888773011101911856008602022852000902108655001202117IND60570088620221118165504.0170708e20170705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057008862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b011852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMozhayeva, Darya10aImplementation of Online Preconcentration and Microsecond Time Resolution to Capillary Electrophoresis Single Particle Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (CE-SP-ICP-MS) and Its Application in Silver Nanoparticle Analysis  ap. 7152-7159.  aCapillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to single particle inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry (SP-ICP-MS) was used for the first time with a prototype data acquisition (μsDAQ) system that features 5 μs time resolution (100% duty cycle) to separate and quantify mixtures of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). Additionally, an online preconcentration technique, reversed electrode polarity stacking mode (REPSM), was applied for Ag NPs analysis with CE-SP-ICP-MS for the first time. After optimization, best results were achieved using a injection time of 110 s and a constant pressure of 50 mbar in hydrodynamic injection mode. It was possible to detect 14.3 ± 1.5× more 20 nm sized, 21.0 ± 4.2× more 40 nm sized, and 27.7 ± 4.9× more 60 nm sized Ag NPs compared to the standard injection time of only 3 s. The effect of applied voltage on the NPs separation was studied, and a CE separation at 20 kV was found to be optimal for the present setup. The capability of CE-SP-ICP-MS for quantification of particle number concentration was investigated, and detection limits in the submicrogram-per-liter range were achieved. The possibility to separate 20, 40, and 60 nm sized Ag NPs simultaneously present in a mixture was demonstrated over a broad concentration range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acapillary electrophoresis 3aelectrodes 3ahydrodynamics 3amass spectrometry 3ananosilver1 aStrenge, Ingo1 aEngelhard, Carsten0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2017 July 05, v. 89, no. 13 p.7152-7159dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.7b011853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008900165300001600254520168400270592002801954650000801982650002501990650001102015650001202026650001902038650001902057650001302076650001402089650001902103650001102122650003302133650001402166650001902180650001602199653003102215653002102246653001402267653001302281700001702294700001702311700002102328700001802349700001802367700002102385773011202406856008502518852000902603655001202612IND60582868020221118002916.0180830e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058286802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.07.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalehi, M.10aOxygen permeation and stability study of (La0.6Ca0.4)0.98(Co0.8Fe0.2)O3-δ membranes  ap. 245-253.  aThe perovskite-type oxide (La0.6Ca0.4)0.98(Co0.8Fe0.2)O3-δ (LCCF) was investigated for use as oxygen separation membrane. A 25µm thick dense membrane on a porous LCCF support with a thickness of around 175µm was prepared by a tape casting and lamination process. The optimum sintering temperature of the component was established to be 1050°C by analysis of microstructures of membranes sintered at different temperatures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination of cross-sections of the sintered membrane showed that it consisted of two phases, the main phase being enriched in calcium (Ca) and depleted in lanthanum (La), relative to the nominal composition. A surface activation layer of LCCF was deposited onto the dense layer to increase the exchange rate of oxygen at the surface. For the coated membrane, the oxygen permeation flux increased with temperature and reached a maximum value of 3.32Nmlcm⁻²min⁻¹ at 900°C when, for characterization purpose pure oxygen was used as feed and a maximum value of 2.06Nmlcm⁻²min⁻¹ at 900°C was obtained when air was used at the feed side, both with N2 sweep on the permeate side. The stability of the membrane against sulfur dioxide (SO2) and pure carbon dioxide (CO2) was tested. A small decrease in the flux was observed over 48h in CO2 at 850°C. SEM examinations of the cross-section of the tested membrane showed that the Ca rich phase in the membrane showed a tendency to migrate to the feed side. Whereas the material shows a CO2 stability superior to that of Sr or Ba containing analogues, the material stability is not sufficient for applications requiring direct exposure to sulfur-rich flue gases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aartificial membranes 3abarium 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3adirect contact 3aflue gas 3alanthanum 3amicrostructure 3aoxygen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astrontium 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 0aOxygen permeation membrane 0aKinetic demixing 0aStability 0aOxy-fuel1 aSøgaard, M.1 aEsposito, V.1 aFoghmoes, S.P.V.1 aPersoon, E.S.1 aSchroeder, M.1 aHendriksen, P.V.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 542 p.245-253dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.07.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04369naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245007600206300001100282506007600293520228900369592002802658506003702686650002702723650002402750650001802774650001402792650000902806650001402815650002002829650003002849650001002879650001102889650002002900650002502920650001702945650001802962650001202980650002402992650001003016650001803026650000903044650001303053650001703066650000903083650004303092650001903135650001403154650001003168650002403178650002603202650001103228650001703239650001503256650002303271650003203294650001103326700001803337700001703355700001503372700001503387700002003402700001603422773009503438856008103533852000903614655001203623IND60121249420221207090954.0160905e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012124942DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-015-0353-52doi7 aPMC43327302pmcid7 a258896602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiangping10aEstablishment of a mouse model to express bovine CD14 short hairpin RNA  ap. 36.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) functions as a co-receptor for Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 and myeloid differentiation factor (MD)-2 in detecting bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Together, these complexes promote the phagocytosis and digestion of Gram-negative bacteria, and initiate immune responses. To date, much of our understanding of CD14 function during Gram-negative bacterial inflammation comes from studies on mouse knockout models and cell transfection. To identify the effect of CD14 knockdown in this process in large livestock animals, we established a mouse model expressing bovine CD14 short hairpin (sh) RNA. shRNA fragments targeting bovine CD14 were screened by co-transfection in HEK 293 cells, and the most effective CD14 shRNA fragment was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pSilencer4.1-CD14 shRNA-IRES (internal ribosome entry site) and transferred into mouse zygotes by pronuclear microinjection to obtain transgenic mice. Expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter and genes related to the TLR4 signaling pathway was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. RESULTS: One effective shRNA fragment (shRNA-674) targeting bovine CD14 was obtained, the sequence of which was shown to be conserved between cows, buffalos, sheep, and humans. Thirty-seven founder pups were obtained by pronuclear microinjection, of which three were positive for the transgene. In the F₁ generation, 11 of 33 mice (33%) were positive for the transgene as detected by PCR. IHC analysis detected exogenous EGFP expression in the liver, kidney, and spleen of transgenic F₁ mice, indicating that they were chimeric. The expression of endogenous CD14 mRNA in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney of transgenic F₁ mice was decreased 8-, 3-, 19.5-, 6-, and 11-fold, respectively. The expression patterns of endogenous MD-2, TLR4, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α genes in transgenic mice also varied. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that transgenic mice expressing bovine CD14 shRNA can be generated by pronuclear microinjection, and demonstrates inhibited endogenous mouse CD14 expression that alters gene expression related to the TLR4 signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aToll-like receptors 3aanimal models 3achimerism 3acows 3adigestion 3agene expression 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aheart 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3akidneys 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3anecrosis 3aphagocytosis 3apups 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areporter genes 3aribosomes 3asheep 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 3aspleen 3atransfection 3atransgenes 3atransgenic animals 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3azygote1 aHuang, Shihai1 aRen, Yanping1 aWang, Meng1 aKang, Chao1 aXie, Liangliang1 aShi, Deshun0 tBMC veterinary research.g2015 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.36-36dBioMed Centralx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0353-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01535naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013100160300001800291520040200309592002800711650002300739650001300762650000900775650001100784650001300795650003400808650001100842700002200853700001900875700001800894700002200912700002300934773013300957856007401090852000901164655001201173IND60660194920221118045529.0190823e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066019492DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc02022g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuoka, Ryota10aOrdered alignment of a one-dimensional π-conjugated nickel bis(dithiolene) complex polymer produced via interfacial reactions  ap. 8137-8139.  aA liquid–liquid interfacial synthesis using 1,2,4,5-benzenetetrathiol and nickel(ii) ions produced a thin black film of a π-conjugated polymer featuring the nickel bis(dithiolene) motif.

Often, these agencies view nonnative plants as a threat to wildlife habitat, and they seek to control or eradicate nonnative plant populations. However, little is known about how nonnative plant invasions impact native fauna, and it is unclear whether managing these plants actually improves habitat quality for resident animals. Here, we compared the impacts of native and nonnative wetland plants on three species of native larval amphibians; we also examined whether plant traits explain the observed impacts. Specifically, we measured plant litter quality (carbon : nitrogen : phosphorus ratios, and percentages of lignin and soluble phenolics) and biomass, along with a suite of environmental conditions known to affect larval amphibians (hydroperiod, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH). Hydroperiod and plant traits, notably soluble phenolics, litter C:N ratio, and litter N:P ratio, impacted the likelihood that animals metamorphosed, the number of animals that metamorphosed, and the length of larval period. As hydroperiod decreased, the likelihood that amphibians achieved metamorphosis and the percentage of tadpoles that successfully metamorphosed also decreased. Increases in soluble phenolics, litter N:P ratio, and litter C:N ratio decreased the likelihood that tadpoles achieved metamorphosis, decreased the percentage of tadpoles metamorphosing, decreased metamorph production (total metamorph biomass), and increased the length of larval period. Interestingly, we found no difference in metamorphosis rates and length of larval period between habitats dominated by native and nonnative plants. Our findings have important implications for habitat management. We suggest that to improve habitats for native fauna, managers should focus on assembling a plant community with desirable traits rather than focusing only on plant origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphibians 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aecological invasion 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3ahabitat conservation 3aintroduced plants 3alignin 3ametamorphosis 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphenolic compounds 3aphosphorus 3aplant communities 3aplant litter 3atadpoles 3atemperature 3awetland plants 3awildlife habitats1 aMaerz, John C.1 aBlossey, Bernd0 tEcological applications.g2012 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.218-228dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-0078.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245018400170300001300354520134700367592002801714650001701742650002201759650001501781650002801796650002001824650003101844650001701875650001101892650001801903650001401921650001301935650001001948650002101958650002201979650001502001650001002016650000902026650001302035653003102048653002702079653002402106653004402130653001802174700002302192700005802215700002402273700001702297700001802314700002802332700005802360773009102418856008202509852000902591655001202600IND60635870420221119232601.0190509e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063587042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2019.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVervliet, Philippe10aInvestigating the in vitro metabolism of the dental resin monomers BisGMA, BisPMA, TCD-DI-HEA and UDMA using human liver microsomes and quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry  ap. 1-10.  aDental resin systems have been in use for several decades. (Meth)acrylic monomers are an important part of the matrix system and are either based on BPA while others lack the BPA core. The degree of conversion during restoration is in general between 50–70 % allowing leaching from unreacted monomers to the oral cavity where they can be taken up through the pulp or gastrointestinal tract after ingestion with subsequent hepatic metabolism. This study identified the in vitro Phase I and Phase II metabolism of the dental resin monomers BisGMA, UDMA, BisPMA and TCD-DI-HEA, using human liver microsomes (HLM) and human liver cytosols. During Phase I incubation with HLM, the (meth)acrylic acid in the monomers was rapidly removed followed by oxidative and hydroxylation pathways. For BisPMA an O-dealkylation pathway occurred resulting in the formation of BPA. The carbamates present in TCD-DI-HEA and UDMA were resistant to biotransformation reactions. Phase II biotransformation products were only observed for BisPMA and included conjugation reactions with sulphate and glucuronic acid. In total 4, 3, 12 and 3 biotransformation products were identified in this study for BisGMA, UDMA, BisPMA and TCD-DI-HEA respectively. Possible human health effects of these biotransformation products remain unclear due to limited data availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3abiotransformation 3acarbamates 3agastrointestinal system 3aglucuronic acid 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ahydroxylation 3aingestion 3aleaching 3aliver 3aliver microsomes 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3amouth 3apulp 3asulfates 0aIn vitro biotransformation 0aHuman liver microsomes 0aCytosolic fractions 0aLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 0aDental resins1 aDen Plas, Jens Van1 aDe Nys, Siemon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1201-13671 aDuca, Radu Corneliu1 aBoonen, Imke1 aElskens, Marc1 aVan Landuyt, Kirsten L.1 aCovaci, Adrian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0527-11360 tToxicology.g2019 May 15, v. 420 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2019.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03670naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009300157300001600250500002000266520242600286592002802712650002602740650002302766650001302789650001502802650001402817650002102831650001102852650002502863650001002888650001402898650001102912651001502923700001902938700001902957700001702976700001902993773013003012856007303142961001203215852000903227655001203236IND60587606820221118100818.0180102e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058760682DNAL7 a10.1890/10-2108.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, J. D.10aTrends and causes of severity, size, and number of fires in northwestern California, USA  ap. 184-203.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResearch in the last several years has indicated that fire size and frequency are on the rise in western U.S. forests. Although fire size and frequency are important, they do not necessarily scale with ecosystem effects of fire, as different ecosystems have different ecological and evolutionary relationships with fire. Our study assessed trends and patterns in fire size and frequency from 1910 to 2008 (all fires > 40 ha), and the percentage of high‐severity in fires from 1987 to 2008 (all fires > 400 ha) on the four national forests of northwestern California. During 1910–2008, mean and maximum fire size and total annual area burned increased, but we found no temporal trend in the percentage of high‐severity fire during 1987–2008. The time series of severity data was strongly influenced by four years with region‐wide lightning events that burned huge areas at primarily low–moderate severity. Regional fire rotation reached a high of 974 years in 1984 and fell to 95 years by 2008. The percentage of high‐severity fire in conifer‐dominated forests was generally higher in areas dominated by smaller‐diameter trees than in areas with larger‐diameter trees. For Douglas‐fir forests, the percentage of high‐severity fire did not differ significantly between areas that re‐burned and areas that only burned once (10% vs. 9%) when re‐burned within 30 years. Percentage of high‐severity fire decreased to 5% when intervals between first and second fires were >30 years. In contrast, in both mixed‐conifer and fir/high‐elevation conifer forests, the percentage of high‐severity fire was less when re‐burned within 30 years compared to first‐time burned (12% vs. 16% for mixed conifer; 11% vs. 19% for fir/high‐elevation conifer). Additionally, the percentage of high‐severity fire did not differ whether the re‐burn interval was less than or greater than 30 years. Years with larger fires and greatest area burned were produced by region‐wide lightning events, and characterized by less winter and spring precipitation than years dominated by smaller human‐ignited fires. Overall percentage of high‐severity fire was generally less in years characterized by these region‐wide lightning events. Our results suggest that, under certain conditions, wildfires could be more extensively used to achieve ecological and management objectives in northwestern California.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aconiferous forests 3aconifers 3aecosystems 3alightning 3anational forests 3aspring 3atime series analysis 3atrees 3awildfires 3awinter 3aCalifornia1 aSkinner, C.

Faba bean (Vicia faba L., 2n = 12) is an important food legume crop that is widely grown for multiple uses worldwide. However, no reference genome is currently available due to its very large genome size (approximately 13 Gb) and limited single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers as well as highly efficient genotyping tools have been reported for faba bean. In this study, 16.7 billion clean reads were obtained from transcriptome libraries of flowers and leaves of 102 global faba bean accessions. A total of 243,120 unigenes were de novo assembled and functionally annotated. Moreover, a total of 1,579,411 SNPs were identified and further filtered according to a selection pipeline to develop a high-throughput, flexible, low-cost Faba_bean_130K targeted next-generation sequencing (TNGS) genotyping platform. A set of 69 Chinese faba bean accessions were genotyped with the TNGS genotyping platform, and the average mapping rate of captured reads to reference transcripts was 93.14%, of which 53.23% were located in the targeted regions. The TNGS genotyping results were validated by Sanger sequencing and the average consistency rate reached 93.6%. Comprehensive population genetic analysis was performed on the 69 Chinese faba bean accessions and identified four genetic subgroups correlated with the geographic distribution. This study provides valuable genomic resources and a reliable genotyping tool that could be implemented in genetic and molecular breeding studies to accelerate new cultivar development and improvement in faba bean.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS-08cChina Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA-Food Legumes  a2130135cCrop Germplasm Resources Protection  a2019YFD1001300cNational Key R&D Program of China  aCX(18)2019cAgricultural Science and Technology Independent Innovation Fund of Jiangsu Province  aASTIPcAgricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program  aNo.19200030cConstruction of Molecular Database of Faba Bean and Pea and Identification of Maize Germplasm Project 3aVicia faba 3acultivars 3afaba beans 3agenetic analysis 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3ageographical distribution 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscriptome 3aunigenes1 aLiu, Rong1 aLiu, Yujiao1 aHou, Wanwei1 aWang, Xuejun1 aMiao, Yamei1 aHe, Yuhua1 aMa, You,1 aLi, Guangbing,1 aWang, Dong1 aJi, Yishan1 aZhang, Hongyan1 aLi, Mengwei1 aYan, Xin1 aZong, Xuxiao1 aYang, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9755-731X0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2021 Oct., v. 134, no. 10 p.3195-3207dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-021-03885-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03472naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002700188245011900215300001200334506007600346520202400422592002802446506003702474650001302511650001902524650003502543650002602578650002202604650001402626650002002640650001002660650001502670650001302685650001302698650001402711650002002725650001602745651001702761700002002778700002302798773009102821856008102912852000902993655001203002IND60121249620221207090956.0150808e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012124962DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-015-0244-12doi7 aPMC43400982pmcid7 a258891062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMsimanga, Patrick Wela10aHIV-1 diversity in an antiretroviral treatment naïve cohort from Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga Province, South Africa  ap. 244.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: South Africa has a generalized and explosive HIV/AIDS epidemic with the largest number of people infected with HIV-1 in the world. Molecular investigations of HIV-1 diversity can help enhance interventions to contain and combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic. However, many studies of HIV-1 diversity in South Africa tend to be limited to the major metropolitan centers and their surrounding provinces. Hardly any studies of HIV diversity have been undertaken in Mpumalanga Province, and this study sought to investigate the HIV-1 diversity in this province, as well as establish the occurrence and extent of transmitted antiretroviral drug resistance mutations. METHODS: HIV-1 gag p24, pol p10 and p66/p51, pol p31 and env gp41 gene fragments from 43 participants were amplified and sequenced. Quality control on the sequences was carried out using the LANL QC online tool. HIV-1 subtype was preliminary assigned using the REGA 3.0 and jpHMM online tools. Subtype for the pol gene fragment was further designated using the SCUEAL online tool. Phylogenetic analysis was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood methods in MEGA version 6. HIV-1 antiretroviral drug resistance mutations were determined using the Stanford database. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis using Maximum Likelihood methods indicated that all sequences in the study clustered with HIV-1 subtype C. The exception was one putative subtype BC unique recombinant form. Antiretroviral drug resistance mutations K103N and E138A were also detected, indicating possible transmission of anti-retroviral drug resistance mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The phylogenetic analysis of the HIV sequences revealed that, by 2009, patients in the Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga were predominantly infected with HIV-1 subtype C. However, the generalized, explosive nature of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa, in the context of extensive mobility by South Africans who inhabit rural areas, renders the continued molecular monitoring and surveillance of the epidemic imperative.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfricans 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aantiretroviral agents 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3adrug resistance 3agenes 3amonitoring 3amutation 3apatients 3aphylogeny 3aquality control 3arural areas 3aSouth Africa1 aVardas, Efthyia1 aEngelbrecht, Susan0 tVirology journal.g2015 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.244-244dSpringer-Verlagx1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0244-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009600172300001600268520107700284592002801361650002301389650000801412650001101420650003801431650004901469650002001518650001601538650004401554650001101598650001801609650003101627650001801658650001301676650001001689650001701699650002201716650002101738653002201759653002301781653001901804653001501823700005601838700001901894700001601913700002001929700001601949700001801965773010601983856008702089852000902176655001202185IND60526753220221118200945.0190410e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052675322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chunyan,10a60Co-γ radiation-induced changes in the physical and chemical properties of rapeseed straw  ap. 207-214.  aWe investigated changes in the physical and chemical properties of rapeseed straw after treatment with different doses of 60Co γ-irradiation (0 kGy-1200 kGy). Raman spectra, electron spin resonance (ESR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses of the pretreated samples showed that the irradiation partially destroyed the intra- or intermolecular structure of rapeseed straw. Particle size distribution and specific surface area analyses suggested that irradiation decreased the particle size, narrowed the distribution range, and increased the specific surface area. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves showed that increasing the irradiated dose decreased the thermal stability of the treated rapeseed straw and increased the reactivity. Elemental analyses suggested that the oxygen content slightly increased, suggesting that oxygen in the air may be involved in the reaction. These results demonstrate that γ-irradiation can induce a series of changes in the physical and chemical properties of rapeseed straw.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aair 3acobalt 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3agamma radiation 3airradiation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aradionuclides 3arapeseed 3astraw 3asurface area 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 0aBrassica napus L. 0aγ-ray irradiation 0aMicrostructure 0aReactivity1 aSu, Xiaojun,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0470-16001 aXiong, XingYao1 aHu, QiuLong1 aAmartey, Samuel1 aTan, XingHe1 aQin, Wensheng0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 Feb., v. 85 p.207-214dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245009600165300001600261500002000277520149500297592002801792650001901820650001501839650002101854650002501875650002301900650001501923650001601938650002201954650001601976650002201992700002502014700002402039700002702063773013002090856007302220852000902293655001202302IND60587606920221118100840.0180102e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058760692DNAL7 a10.1890/11-0419.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Christopher J.10aHow long can fisheries management delay action in response to ecosystem and climate change?  ap. 298-310.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSustainable management of fisheries is often compromised by management delaying implementation of regulations that reduce harvest, in order to maintain higher catches in the short term. Decreases or increases in fish population growth rate driven by environmental change, including ecosystem and climate change, affect the harvest that can be taken sustainably. If not acted on rapidly, environmental change could result in unsustainable fishing or missed opportunity for higher catches. Using simulation models of harvested fish populations influenced by environmental change, we explore how long fisheries managers can afford to wait before changing harvest regulations in response to changes in population growth. If environmental change causes population declines, delays greater than five years increase the probability of population collapse. Species with fast and highly variable population growth rates are more susceptible to collapse under delays and should be a priority for revised management where delays occur. Generally, the long‐term cost of delay, in terms of lost fishing opportunity, exceeds the short‐term benefits of overfishing. Lowering harvest limits and monitoring for environmental change can alleviate the impact of delays; however, these measures may be more costly than reducing delays. We recommend that management systems that allow rapid responses to population growth changes be enacted for fisheries management to adapt to ecosystem and climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3afish communities 3afisheries management 3amanagement systems 3amonitoring 3aoverfishing 3apopulation growth 3aprobability 3asimulation models1 aFulton, Elizabeth A.1 aPossingham, Hugh P.1 aRichardson, Anthony J.0 tEcological applications.g2012 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.298-310dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-0419.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010900172300001400281500001400295520087600309592002801185650001301213650001701226650001001243650002201253650001601275650001401291650001601305650001601321650003301337650001701370650001301387650002201400650001701422651001501439653002101454653002801475653001301503653001101516653001601527653003401543700002201577773010901599856008501708852000901793655001201802IND60693108320221120083642.0200505e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069310832DNAL7 a10.1080/09524622.2001.97534762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammer, Øyvind,10aTechniques for studying the spatio-temporal distribution of animal vocalizations in tropical wet forests  ap. 21-35.  aNAL-light  aAn array of four microphones was set up in two rain forest locations in Costa Rica, and 12–14 hours of sound were recorded over a 24-hour period at each location.

This study demonstrates the feasibility of localizing some animals acoustically even under difficult field conditions in a highly reverberant and noisy environment. Primates seem to be particularly easy to track using this method, while birds seem more problematical. We also advocate the use of long-term indiscriminate acoustical sampling of all vocalizers, in order to give information about the synecology of animal communication.

(Coleoptera: Curculionidae), on 'Carabao' Mango  ap. 29-35.  a2019-12-06  aThe longevity and reproductive potential of the mango pulp weevil, Sternochetus frigidus (Fabr.), and the levels of feeding and oviposition for weevils at different stages of mango fruit development were determined to identify suitable stages to use in succeeding experiments. Males lived an average of 496.7 + 32.5 d and females 491.5 + 33.0 d. The oviposition period was 165.1 + 22.1 d comprising 33.6% of the adult life span. The female laid 796.3 + 126.8 eggs in its lifetime at a rate of 5.5 + 0.7 eggs per day. Percentage egg hatch was 90.3 + 1.0 %. Female adult survival was 50% at 73 wk after adult emergence. Weekly fecundity rate (mx) was based on the number of female progeny produced by a female parent. It was at its peak 6 wk after adult emergence, with an average of 26.2 eggs. The estimated value of the net reproductive rate (Ro) was 354.0. Female adults lived up to 70.9 + 15.2 d without mango fruit but on wet bark alone. They lived up to 16.4 + 1.4 d without bark or food and water. Female weevils had a higher level of feeding at 11-42 d after flower induction (DAFI) (panicle elongation to mungbean size fruit stage). Female weevils preferred to oviposit on mango fruits at the fruit enlargement stage (61-90 DAFI). The mango fruit part, whether the top (base of fruit), mid-portion or the bottom (fruit apex), were found to have no influence on the number of eggs laid. 3afemales 3ainsect pests 3aMangifera indica 3alongevity 3aova 3aoviposition 3amangoes 3afecundity 3amales 3abark 3aplant pests 3agender differences 3aflowering 3aoviposition sites 3aimagos 3aSternochetus 3afruiting 0aadult insects 0adevelopmental stages 0aSternochetus frigidus 0afruits (plant anatomy)0 tPhilippine agricultural scientist.g2008 Mar., v. 91, no. 1 p.29-35x1655-97117nnas  aDNAL  a20090107b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02654naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100001700204245024200221300001600463500002400479520100800503650000901511650001601520650001501536650001901551650002401570650002001594650002301614650002601637650001601663650001001679650001901689650001401708650001201722650001701734650002501751650002001776700001501796700001801811700001501829700001701844773008801861852000901949856007301958930003302031945002502064946001102089655001202100IND4385037220221118224220.0061107e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438503722DNAL7 a220634232pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aL200 0aQ5021 aTipton, N.C.10aEffects of oral vitamin D3 supplementation and supplement withdrawal on the accumulation of magnesium, calcium, and vitamin D in the serum, liver, and muscle tissue and subsequent carcass and meat quality of Bos indicus influenced cattle  ap. 150-158.  aIncludes references  aBos indicus crossbred cattle (n = 79) were fed vitamin D3 (0 or 3 million IU/hd/d) for 5 d. Afterwards, half of each group was slaughtered immediately, while half was fed, without supplementation, for 7 d before processing. Serum calcium concentration was increased (P < 0.05) in cattle after supplement removal, but not immediately following supplementation. This also was observed in the M. longissimus lumborum and M. triceps brachii, but not in the M. semitendinosus. Liver biopsy vitamin D3 concentrations were higher (P < 0.05) in supplemented cattle immediately following supplementation, but were not different from controls after supplement removal. Vitamin D3 did not affect tenderness at supplement removal day 0, but increased the tenderness of the M. longissimus lumborum and M. semitendinosus at supplement removal day 7. Vitamin D3 supplementation improves muscle tenderness and may be more effective when supplementation is ceased 7 d before slaughter, with minimum food safety concerns. 3azebu 3azebu breeds 3acrossbreds 3acattle feeding 3avitamin supplements 3acholecalciferol 3amineral metabolism 3aintestinal absorption 3ablood serum 3aliver 3amuscle tissues 3amagnesium 3acalcium 3abeef quality 3acarcass condemnation 3ameat tenderness1 aKing, D.A.1 aPaschal, J.C.1 aHale, D.S.1 aSavell, J.W.0 tMeat science.g2007 Jan., v. 75, no. 1 p.150-158dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.06.0243electronic resource  a20070130b20070202c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/01/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02428naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245010300133300001600236520119300252650004301445650003001488650002901518650001301547650001001560650001701570650001701587650001901604650000701623650001601630650001501646650001701661650001401678650001101692700002801703700002301731700002501754773009101779852000901870856008301879939003301962946001101995655001202006IND4482867620221118224110.0140708e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448286762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSohrabvandi, Sarah10aViability of probiotic bacteria in low alcohol- and non-alcoholic beer during refrigerated storage  ap. 104-108.  aThe viability of two probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12) was assessed in low-alcohol beer (2.5% alcohol) and non-alcoholic beer ( < 0.5% alcohol) during 20 d of refrigerated storage (5 °C). The beer was fermented using two brewer's yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae 70424 and Saccharomyces rouxii 2531). At the end of fermentation, yeast cells were inactivated by heat treatment; probiotic microorganisms were inoculated in freshly made beer at 5 °C and stored for 20 d. During the storage period, the pH, alcohol content and viability of the probiotics were assessed in the treatments. Both probiotics, especially L. acidophilus, lost their viability dramatically over the storage time and by the 20th day of storage, the viable counts of the cells decreased by at least three logarithmic cycles. The highest and the lowest decreases in viability were observed in the beer containing L. acidophilus fermented by S. cerevisiae and in the beer containing bifidobacteria fermented by S. rouxii, respectively. Based on the results, beer was not a suitable medium for retaining the viability of probiotic cells during the cold storage period. 3aBifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalcohols 3abeers 3acold storage 3afermentation 3aheat treatment 3apH 3aplate count 3aprobiotics 3astorage time 3aviability 3ayeasts1 aMousavi, Seyed Mohammad1 aRazavi, Seyed Hadi1 aMortazavian, Amir M.0 tPhilippine agricultural scientist.g2010 Mar., v. 93, no. 1 p.104-108x1655-97117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://journals.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/PAS3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140708  aNon-US 7aarticle02034naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100002500166245009100191300001400282500010000296500002400396500001500420520047500435650002300910650002900933650001900962650001900981650004101000650002101041650002001062650001801082650001901100650001101119650004401130653002401174653002301198700001901221700001901240700001901259773011201278852000901390856007201399930003301471945002501504946001101529655001201540IND4385044820221118223907.0061108e20060515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438504482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2006.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8101 aMeulen, K.M. van der10aImmune escape of equine herpesvirus 1 and other herpesviruses of veterinary importance  ap. 31-40.  aIn the special issue: Equine Herpesvirus-1 / edited by D.P.

Twenty-two-week-old male turkeys were exposed to O. rhinotracheale or lung homogenate from O. rhinotracheale-infected turkeys. Within 24 hr after inoculation, turkeys given O. rhinotracheale or lung homogenate intratracheally were depressed and coughing and had decreased feed intake. By 48 hr, several birds were coughing blood and ultimately died. Grossly, the lungs were reddened, wet, and heavy, failed to collapse, and were covered by tenacious tan-to-white exudate. Microscopically, the parabronchi and air capillaries were filled with fibrin, heterophils, macrophages, and small numbers of gram-negative bacteria. The pleura was often covered by a thick layer of fibrin, heterophils, and macrophages. Turkeys that survived to day 7 postinoculation had severe, subacute pneumonia. Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale was recovered from the lungs of most birds with pneumonia and was also cultured from the air sacs, sinuses, tracheas, spleens, and livers. All turkeys inoculated with O. rhinotracheale developed antibodies to O. rhinotracheale detectable by the serum plate agglutination test. 3ahistopathology 3amorbidity 3aturkeys 3aOrnithobacterium rhinotracheale 3aantibodies 3apneumonia 3alungs 3amortality 0aexperimental infection 0aexperimental infections 0asymptoms 0aclinical aspects 0aisolation1 aBack, A.1 aShaw, D.P.1 aNagaraja, K.V.1 aRoepke, D.C.1 aHalvorson, D.A.0 tAvian diseases.g1998 , v. 42, no. 1 p.154-161x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02913naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245010600150300001600256300002400272500001500296520167100311650001501982650002001997650001602017650001202033650003202045650001902077650002802096650001102124650000902135650001502144650001502159650002102174650002402195650001602219653001602235653001202251700001802263700002202281773007702303852000902380939003302389945000802422946001302430655001202443991560822360742620221118223943.0910228e198907  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910003672DNAL7 a27983722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmid, T.L.10aDirect mail recruitment to home-based smoking and weight control programs: a comparison of strategies  ap. 503-517.  ap. 503-517. charts.  a2019-12-05  aObesity and smoking remain major public health problems. Because of their widespread prevalence, large scale community-wide programs are needed to have an impact on public health. The purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude of response to four variations in recruitment and demographic characteristics of people enrolling in self-help programs for weight control and smoking cessation. A total of 76,900 households from three communities were offered correspondence-based programs in weight control and smoking cessation. Rates of enrollment ranged from 0.1 to 5% for smoking and from 0.3 to 12% for weight after adjusting for estimated prevalence of smoking and obesity. Recruitment rates were positively related to amount of money spent on recruitment per household. Sending sign-up packages only to those returning interest cards was less costly than sending sign-up packages to everyone. Those who received announcements of the program prior to receiving sign-up packages enrolled at a higher rate than those not receiving announcements. Mass media campaigns did not clearly increase enrollment. A flat fee/materials only option was about 10 times more popular than an incentive option which required a deposit and was refunded proportional to success. Enrollees were somewhat older, better educated and less overweight than those enrolling in traditional programs. Average recruitment costs per enrollee ranged from $14 to $27 in the three communities. Total enrollment was 1990 for weight and 298 for smoking across the three communities in what may be the largest direct mail recruitment effort and intervention program of its kind yet attempted. 3ahouseholds 3asmoking (habit) 3amethodology 3aobesity 3afood and nutrition programs 3aweight control 2aCosts and Cost Analysis 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMass Media 2aMotivation 2aSelf-Help Groups 2aSmoking Prevention. 2aWeight Loss 0arecruitment 0ahousing1 aJeffery, R.W.1 aHellerstedt, W.L.0 tPreventive medicine.g1989 July, v. 18, no. 4 p.503-517x0091-74357nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02324naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001900136245014800155300001600303500002400319520131700343650000901660650001201669650001101681650000901692650001401701650001501715650001401730651001701744700001901761700002401780700002001804773010201824852000901926856003901935655001201974IND4436425320221118223833.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443642532DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.11022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHardman, Emily10aMovement of sonically tagged bluespine unicornfish, Naso unicornis, in relation to marine reserve boundaries in Rodrigues, western Indian Ocean  ap. 357-361.  aIncludes references  a1.The lagoon fishery of Rodrigues has considerable socio-economic importance; however, catches have declined by 50% in recent years. The bluespine unicornfish, Naso unicornis (Forsskål 1775) is an important component of the fishery.2.To begin to assess whether marine reserves might benefit this species, sonic telemetry was used to track individual fish in one of Rodrigues' four marine reserves. Seven unicornfish were caught in the Grand Bassin reserve and tagged with abdominally implanted acoustic tags.3.Over a period of 57 days their locations were determined up to 21 times using a hand held hydrophone and receiver. Individual minimum convex polygon (MCP) home ranges varied from ~10 000 m² to ~274 000 m² and were not correlated with fish size. Kernel estimates of core areas (50% utilization distribution) varied from ~5000 m² to ~175 000 m². All seven fish stayed within the marine reserve and the largest home range occupied less than ~2% of the area of the marine reserve.4.Fish remained on the outside edge of the lagoon on the shallow reef slope and among coral patches. These findings suggest that bluespined unicornfish biomass and numbers should increase if the Grand Bassin marine reserve is closed to fishing. Long-term monitoring will, however, be required to demonstrate this outcome. 3aNaso 3abiomass 3acorals 3afish 3afisheries 3amonitoring 3atelemetry 3aIndian Ocean1 aGreen, John M.1 aSabrina Desiré, M.1 aPerrine, Sydney0 tAquatic conservation.g2010 May, v. 20, no. 3 p.357-361dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1052-76137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.1102 7aarticle02811naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245016600145300001600311500002400327520098400351650002001335650001301355650001601368650001601384650001901400650001901419650001101438650001801449650002701467650002201494650001301516650001301529650001601542650002201558650001201580650002701592650002001619650001701639650001301656650005501669650004301724650003101767650005501798650004401853650004301897650002501940650003701965653001502002700001402017700001502031700001502046773006802061852000902129930003302138945001302171946001302184655001202197IND2197307220221118223943.0990302e199804  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219730722DNAL7 a96453142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimier, I.H.10aInhibition of Eimeria tenella development in vitro mediated by chicken macrophages and fibroblasts treated with chicken cell supernatants with IFN-gamma activity  ap. 239-247.  aSummary in Spanish.  aPretreatment of chicken macrophages or fibroblasts with supernatants from concanavalin A-stimulated spleen cells or from the virus-transformed cell line reticuloendotheliovirus as source of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) slows down subsequent sporozoite replication in the cells. To identify the presence of IFN-gamma, we combined four typical activities of IFN-gamma: inhibition of cytopathic effect of vesicular stomatitis virus on IFN-gamma-treated fibroblasts, cytostatic activity of IFN-gamma-activated macrophages, induction of major histocompatibility complex II antigen expression on IFN-gamma-activated fibroblasts and macrophages, and induction of nitrite production in macrophages. We have shown that chicken fibroblasts and macrophages possess a microbiostatic capacity once they are able to prevent the otherwise unchecked intracellular replication of Eimeria tenella following activation with culture supernatants identified as containing a strong IFN-gamma activity. 3aEimeria tenella 3achickens 3amacrophages 3afibroblasts 3adisease course 3acultured cells 3aspleen 3acell division 3abiological development 3acytopathogenicity 3anitrites 3aantigens 3ainterferons 3aculture filtrates 2aAnimals 2aCell Line, Transformed 2aCells, Cultured 2aChick Embryo 2aChickens 2aEimeria tenellaxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aFibroblastsximmunologyxparasitology. 2aFlow Cytometryxveterinary 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class IIxbiosynthesis 2aInterferon-gammaxanalysisximmunology. 2aMacrophagesximmunologyxparasitology. 2aNitritesxmetabolism 2aSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms 0ainhibition1 aQuere, P.1 aNaciri, M.1 aBout, D.T.0 tAvian diseases.g1998 , v. 42, no. 2 p.239-247x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle03358naa a2200613 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245010900150300001600259300002400275520165500299650001601954650001201970650001901982650001502001650002302016650001002039650000802049650002502057650003302082650001502115650001002130650004602140650000902186650003802195650006002233650001102293650001902304650001102323650000902334650001602343650001902359650001802378650002402396650001602420650002602436651001402462651001402476653003502490700001802525700001802543700001502561700001602576773007702592852000902669939003302678945000802711946001302719655001202732991560818350742620221118224112.0910411e198911  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910009182DNAL7 a26264132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmid, T.L.10aPublic support for policy initiatives regulating high-fat food use in Minnesota: A multicommunity survey  ap. 791-805.  ap. 791-805. charts.  aPublic support of eight policies to regulate the sale and consumption of high-fat food was evaluated in a survey of 438 women and 383 men in seven Minnesota communities. The survey was part of the ongoing activities of the Minnesota Heart Health Program (MHHP). Respondents, when asked to indicate their level of support or opposition to each of eight policies, expressed general support for all but two. Women were consistently more supportive than men. Other sociodemographic characteristics and reported use of food and other substances were generally not predictive of support. Policies that would control conditions of sale or information about the product were the most strongly supported. Taxation as an incentive to food producers to provide alternatives to high-fat food or as a disincentive to consumers to purchase these foods was moderately supported. A proposal to limit sale of high-fat food to children was the most strongly opposed. The majority of respondents indicated that they felt the individual consumer, as opposed to the producer or retailer, is most responsible for problems associated with high-fat food use. The three communities which had received MHHP health promotion activities were significantly more supportive than the comparison communities on two of the eight proposals. There is a moderate level of support in the general public for additional policies to regulate the sale and consumption of high-fat foods. These policy level interventions, similar to policies common in the regulation of alcohol and tobacco use, may be a feasible strategy to help moderate use of potentially health-compromising food products. 3afood policy 3asurveys 3apublic opinion 3ademography 3agender differences 3awomen 3amen 3alaws and regulations 3aFood and Drug Administration 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAdvertisingxlegislation & jurisprudence. 2aAged 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxetiology 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aFemale 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPublic Opinion 2aPublic Policy 2aRegression Analysis 2aSex Factors 2aSocioeconomic Factors 3aMinnesota 0aMinnesota 0aminnesota heart health program1 aJeffery, R.W.1 aForster, J.L.1 aRooney, B.1 aMcBride, C.0 tPreventive medicine.g1989 Nov., v. 18, no. 6 p.791-805x0091-74357nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03103naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178072001700195100002700212245012900239300001600368500001500384520167400399650003002073650002302103650002902126650001702155650001802172650003502190650001702225650002202242650002702264650002002291650001402311650001902325651001602344653002202360700003402382700002402416773009102440852000902531930003302540945002502573946001102598655001202609IND4434786120221118224418.0100402e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443478612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Makiling Forest Reserve, Philippines  ap. 365-371.  a2019-12-06  aA GIS-based database (or geodatabase) was developed for the Mt. Makiling Forest Reserve, on LuzonIsland, Philippines toward the establishment of a management decision support system. The study presents initial results in the development of a geodatabase, as well as the use of geographic informa-tion system (GIS) in the planning, design and implementation of programs for forest renewal andbiodiversity conservation. GIS use for data encoding is already extensive but its use as a planning and analytical tool is limited, if not altogether lacking. An outline for the establishment of a geodatabase is presented that will allow processing, analysis and modeling and, ultimately, the sustainable development and conservation of the mountain forest reserve, which is a significant watershed area and animportant catchment for Laguna de Bay - the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia. The database design is patterned after the GAME model earlier developed. GAME is an acronym for GIS-based assessment, monitoring and evaluation which uses regular-shaped polygons to provide afull description of the watershed. There are five (5) levels of detail or precision that can be used to characterize and map watershed phenomena: 100-ha grids, 25-ha quadrants, 1-ha cells, 0.04-ha squares and 0.01-ha granules. Depending on the level of detail required for analysis, the appropriate precision level can be used to describe land use/land cover, especially degraded areas, habitats, species distributions and conservation hotspots, among others. The geodatabase for the Mt. Makiling Forest Reserve already contains data and information on soils, slope, elevation and land use. 3ageographical distribution 3aconservation areas 3adecision support systems 3aforest trees 3areforestation 3ageographic information systems 3aspatial data 3aspecies diversity 3aecological restoration 3aforest reserves 3adatabases 3aforest ecology 3aPhilippines 0aforest management1 aAbraham, Emmanuel Rodantes G.1 aFernando, Edwino S.0 tPhilippine agricultural scientist.g2008 Dec., v. 91, no. 4 p.365-371x1655-97117nnas  aDNAL  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/05/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02618naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245013700159300001600296500001500312520110800327650002501435650003601460650001801496650001801514650001501532650001801547650001801565650001301583650001901596650001401615650001001629650002601639650002401665650001701689650002601706650002501732650002101757650002201778650002301800651001001823653002801833653001901861700001101880700001601891773009101907852000901998930003302007945002502040946001102065655001202076IND4434786320221118224221.0100402e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443478632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Based on the results, the content of oil percentage ranged from 9.10-24.87%, of palmitic acid from 4.08-7.58%, of stearic acid from 1.42-2.53%, of oleic acid from 8.04-32.96% and of linoleic acid from 59.90-86.70%. Differences in oil content and fatty acids among genotypes were significant. Oleic acid was significantly correlated with linoleic acid. All correlation coefficients between oil content and fatty acids were nonsignificant. Most of the correlation coefficients between agronomic traits and fatty acids were insignificant. Some photosynthetic parameters, such as photosynthetic and transpiration rate, were significantly correlated with oil content and some fatty acids. This indicated that safflower breeding with high photosynthetic efficiency would be an effective way for improving the yield and quality of safflower seed oil. 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3achemical constituents of plants 3apalmitic acid 3asafflower oil 3aoleic acid 3alinoleic acid 3atranspiration 3agenotype 3aphotosynthesis 3acultivars 3aseeds 3aquantitative analysis 3agenetic improvement 3astearic acid 3anet assimilation rate 3agermplasm evaluation 3aagronomic traits 3agenetic variation 3aselection criteria 3aChina 0asafflower seed products 0aplant breeding1 aWu, W.1 aZheng, Y.L.0 tPhilippine agricultural scientist.g2008 Dec., v. 91, no. 4 p.383-388x1655-97117nnas  aDNAL  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/05/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02226naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245007300177300001600250520109600266650001801362650002301380650001501403650002601418650002001444650004401464650001801508651002101526700001401547700001401561700001801575700001401593700001401607700001401621773009101635852000901726930003301735945002501768946001101793655001201804IND4434786920221118223929.0100402e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443478692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGonulol, E.10aStray Voltage Problems in Dairy Farms and Effects on Animal Behavior  ap. 426-430.  aStray voltage is a small voltage measured between two points that can simultaneously be contacted bya cow. A current will flow between these points. The amount of current depends on the voltage and theresistance of the animal. Reactions of animals to mild electric shocks caused by stray voltage havebeen reported to include behavioral changes, changes in milking characteristics of dairy cows andchanges in production performance. This study evaluated the presence or absence of stray voltage ondairy farms. Questionnaires related to the history of the situation and animal reactions were also used in the study. Experiments were carried out on 51 dairy farms in Turkey. All farms had more than 30 milking cows which are milked by using pipe line milking systems. Stray voltage problems were foundon 12 farms (23%). The relationship between the presence of stray voltage and behavioral change on the dairy farms was statistically significant (P=0,002). Based on the results, stray voltage sources onthe farms were mostly attributed to faulty wiring, faulty equipment and improper grounding. 3adairy farming 3aelectrical charges 3adairy cows 3abehavior modification 3aanimal behavior 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3astray voltage 3aTurkey (country)1 aPolat, R.1 aUlger, P.1 aKayisoglu, B.1 aKuscu, H.1 aToruk, F.1 aPolat, C.0 tPhilippine agricultural scientist.g2008 Dec., v. 91, no. 4 p.426-430x1655-97117nnas  aDNAL  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/05/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03178naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245008200148300001600230520165900246650001401905650001401919650002001933650002401953650001301977650001001990650001502000650001002015650003802025650003002063650001102093650002802104650002002132650001102152650001502163650000902178650002402187650004302211650003202254650002402286650003202310650001702342650002902359650001702388651001602405653001102421700001902432700001602451773007702467852000902544930003302553945001302586946001302599655001202612IND2040477220221118223836.0940623e199403  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204047722DNAL7 a80475232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlorack, E.I.M.10aCigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and caffeine intake and fecundability  ap. 175-180.  aBackground. In a prospective study the effect of the behavioral risk factors of both partners on fecundability was studied. Methods. Information was collected on smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and caffeine intake (e.g. coffee, tea, and cola consumption) by interviewing 259 female nonmedical hospital workers, i.e., clerical staff, cleaners, kitchen and restaurant workers, and their partners, who were planning a pregnancy. The occurrence of pregnancy was tested prospectively during the 12 months after enrollment. Results. Among the participants as well as among their partners, smoking a moderate number of cigarettes (1-10/day) was associated with higher fecundability (i.e., the probability of becoming pregnant each month) than among those not smoking (participant: OR = 1.4 (95% CI, 0.9-2.2); partner: OR = 2.1 (95% CI, 1.2-3.5)). The level of alcohol consumption in the female partner was not related to fecundability. However, in the male partner, there was a positive influence for drinking more than 10 alcoholic drinks per week compared with that observed for those drinking less than 5 (OR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.4). Participants with a moderate caffeine intake (400-700 mg/day) showed a higher fecundability than those with a lower intake level (Or(adjusted) = 2.1 (95% CI, 1.2-3.7)). Heavy caffeine intake (> 700 mg/ day) among partners was negatively related to fecundability when compared with the lowest intake level (Or(adjusted) = 0.6 (95% CI, 0.3-0.97)). Conclusions. This study does not support the hypothesis that moderate cigarette smoking, caffeine intake, and alcohol consumption have an adverse influence on fecundability. 3apregnancy 3afecundity 3asmoking (habit) 3aalcoholic beverages 3acaffeine 3awomen 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAlcohol Drinkingxadverse effects 2aCaffeinexadverse effects 2aFemale 2aFertilityxdrug effects 2aHealth Behavior 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aPersonnel, Hospital 2aPregnancyxstatistics & numerical data 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aProspective Studies 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aSmokingxadverse effects 2aTime Factors 3aNetherlands 0aintake1 aZielhuis, G.A.1 aRolland, R.0 tPreventive medicine.g1994 Mar., v. 23, no. 2 p.175-180x0091-74357nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02795naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002800144245008000172300001600252500001500268520143600283650002501719650001601744650002101760650002401781650000901805650001201814650002901826650002301855650002001878650001901898650002201917650001701939650001301956650003501969650002702004650001802031651001602049653002802065653001402093700002402107773009202131852000902223930003302232945002502265946001102290655001202301IND4420701520221118223844.0090519e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442070152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Germplasm  ap. 329-333.  a2019-12-06  aSixteen accessions of cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) collected and maintained by the National Plant Genetics Resources Laboratory, Institute of Plant Breeding, Crop Science Cluster, College of Agriculture, University of the Philippines Los Banos were subjected to isozyme analysis. Two zones of activity were noted for alkaline phosphatase (ALP-1 and ALP-2), acid phosphatase (ACP-1 and ACP-2), esterase (EST-1 and EST-2), shikimate dehydrogenase (SKDH-1 and SKDH-2), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH-1 and IDH-2), phosphoglucomutase (PGM-1 and PGM-2) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD-1 and PGD-2). Twelve of the loci were monomorphic and homozygous recessive for the S allele. The gene frequency of the twelve recessive alleles was 1.0. Only two presumptive loci, ACP-2 and EST-2, were found to be polymorphic. NTSYSpc-version 2.11s by SAHN was used to construct a dendrogram based on the presence and absence of bands. Using a similarity index coefficient of 0.93, three major clusters were observed. Cluster I was made up of 11 accessions, nine of which came from Zambales and one each from Palawan and Los Banos. Cluster II consisted of only three accessions, two from Palawan and one from Zambales. Cluster III was observed to contain two accessions both from Zambales. The clustering together of accessions from Zambales, Palawan and Los Banos would indicate genotypic similarity among cashew accessions considered. 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acashew nuts 3aacid phosphatase 3agermplasm screening 3aloci 3aalleles 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase 3aphosphoglucomutase 3arecessive genes 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3ahomozygosity 3aisozymes 3aphosphogluconate dehydrogenase 3aAnacardium occidentale 3ashikimic acid 3aPhilippines 0ashikimate dehydrogenase 0aesterases1 aMendioro, Merlyn S.0 tPhilippine agricultural scientist.g2008 Sept., v. 91, no. 3 p.329-333x1655-97117nnas  aDNAL  a20090708b20090801c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/06/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03655naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001100128245008000139300001600219500016800235500001500403520220600418650001902624650000902643650001802652650001802670650001602688650003102704650001402735650001402749650001202763650002602775650003402801650002702835650001802862650001102880650007802891650000902969650001702978653000902995653002303004773007803027852000903105930003303114945001303147946001303160655001203173IND2037371020221118223849.0940217e199309  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203737102DNAL7 a82342132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIp, C.10aControversial issues of dietary fat and experimental mammary carcinogenesis  ap. 728-737.  aPaper presented at the Fourth International Conference on Prevention of Human Cancer: Nutrition and Chemoprevention Controversies, June 3-6, 1992, Tucson, Arizona.  a2019-12-05  aEpidemiological evidence from different countries worldwide has suggested a positive association between the availability of fat in the diet and variations in breast cancer mortality rate. A voluminous amount of information is also available in the literature linking increased fat consumption, particularly polyunsaturated fat, and stimulation of mammary tumorigenesis in animal models. In the past few years, our laboratory has been studying the impact of several confounding factors that could modulate the enhancing effect of fat on neoplastic development of the mammary gland in female rats which are treated with a carcinogen. It is our conclusion that fat promotes mammary carcinogenesis only under a very stringent set of conditions which might not be duplicated in the arena of fat intake and human breast cancer risk. Previous studies on fat and mammary cancer in experimental models have used young virgin rats which are given a dose of carcinogen at a particular age. The question arises as to whether the promoting effect of fat might be a consequence of the characteristics of the model. We have supportive evidence showing that the following criteria must be satisfied in order for fat enhancement of mammary carcinogenesis to be manifested: (a) carcinogen administered at a time when the mammary gland is exquisitely susceptible to tumor induction, (b) animals maintained on a semipurified diet, (c) ad libitum feeding necessary, and (d) unusually high requirement of linoleic acid for tumor development. On the other hand, the stimulatory effect of fat is attenuated or sometimes even negated by (a) feeding of a natural ingredient diet, (b) submaximal calorie intake, and (c) previous history of pregnancy and lactation. Given the spectrum of confounders that are inherent in epidemiological studies linking fat intake and breast cancer, including differences in lifestyle, reproductive history, eating habits, as well as complexity of the total diet, our findings suggest that there may be a need to reevaluate the validity of extrapolating animal data that are obtained under a highly defined set of conditions to the etiological significance of dietary fat in human breast cancer. 3acarcinogenesis 3arisk 3alinoleic acid 3aenergy intake 3adietary fat 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3alactation 3apregnancy 2aAnimals 2aDietxadverse effects 2aDietary Fatsxadverse effects 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aMammary Neoplasms, Experimentalxepidemiologyxetiologyxphysiopathology. 2aRats 2aRisk Factors 0adiet 0aliterature reviews0 tPreventive medicine.g1993 Sept., v. 22, no. 5 p.728-737x0091-74357nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03734naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002100193245013900214300001800353500002400371506007600395520184100471506003702312650002602349650002702375650001002402650001302412650001002425650001302435650001202448650001702460650004502477650001302522650001302535650005902548650004502607650002502652650003002677650002102707650001302728650005502741650001402796650004602810650002702856651001602883651001202899651001202911651001602923651001102939700002602950773010402976852000903080856005503089655001203144IND4384410920221207112906.0061016e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438441092DNAL7 a170322802pmid7 aPMC30448832pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03044.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKURMAYER, RAINER10aDiversity of microcystin genotypes among populations of the filamentous cyanobacteria Planktothrix rubescens and Planktothrix agardhii  ap. 3849-3861.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicrocystins (MCs) are toxic heptapeptides that are produced by filamentous cyanobacteria Planktothrix rubescens and Planktothrix agardhii via nonribosomal peptide synthesis. MCs share a common structure cyclo (-D-Alanine¹-L-X²- D-erythro-ß-iso-aspartic acid³-L-Z⁴-Adda⁵-D-Glutamate⁶- N-methyl-dehydroalanine⁷) where X² and Z² are variable L-amino acids in positions 2, 4 of the molecule. Part of the mcyB gene (1,451 bp) that is involved in the activation of the X² amino acid during MC synthesis was sequenced in 49 strains containing different proportions of arginine, homotyrosine, and leucine in position 2 of the MC molecule. Twenty-five genotypes were found that consisted of eight genotype groups (A-H, comprising 2-11 strains) and 17 unique genotypes. P. rubescens and P. agardhii partly consisted of the same mcyB genotypes. The occurrence of numerous putative recombination events that affected all of the genotypes can explain the conflict between taxonomy and mcyB genotype distribution. Genotypes B (homotyrosine and leucine in X²) and C (arginine in X²) showed higher nonsynonymous/synonymous (dN/dS) substitution ratios implying a relaxation of selective constraints. In contrast, other genotypes (arginine, leucine, homotyrosine) showed lowest dN/dS ratios implying purifying selection. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) revealed the unambiguous identification of mcyB genotypes, which are indicative of variable X² amino acids in eight populations of P. rubescens in the Alps (Austria, Germany, and Switzerland). The populations were found to differ significantly in the proportion of specific genotypes and the number of genotypes that occurred over several years. It is concluded that spatial isolation might favour the genetic divergence of microcystin synthesis in Planktothrix spp.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlanktothrix agardhii 3aPlanktothrix rubescens 3aacids 3aarginine 3agenes 3agenotype 3aleucine 3amicrocystins 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3ataxonomy 3atoxicity 2aBacterial Toxinsxchemistryxclassificationxgenetics. 2aCyanobacteriaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFresh Waterxmicrobiology 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenotype 2aMicrocystinsxchemistryxclassificationxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aAlps region 3aAustria 3aGermany 3aSwitzerland 0aEurope1 aGUMPENBERGER, MARLIES0 tMolecular ecology.g2006 Oct., v. 15, no. 12 p.3849-3861dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03044.x 7aarticle02652naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245010200145300001600247500002400263500001500287520089400302650001301196650001501209650002301224650001801247650001101265650001701276650001101293650002301304650002001327650002401347650001601371650002401387650001401411650001201425650003301437650002301470650001301493650001101506650004601517650001601563650002701579650007401606650007301680650005601753650001601809650002601825653002601851700001801877700001901895773006801914852000901982930003301991945001302024946001302037655001202050IND2199036720221118223955.0990601e199810  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219903672DNAL7 a98768332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrow, C.J.10aProduction of temperature-sensitive clones of Mycoplasma synoviae for evaluation as live vaccines  ap. 667-670.  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aAn Australian field isolate of Mycoplasma synoviae (MS), 89079/7NS, was exposed to the mutagen N-nitro-N'-methyl-N-nitrosoguanidine.

The allergenicity of irradiated shrimp protein extracts and shrimp muscle was analyzed by immunoblotting and Ci-ELISA using pool sera from 15 patients with shrimp specific IgE. Results showed that irradiated shrimp protein extracts exhibited a decrease in allergenicity with the increase of irradiation dose. However irradiated shrimp muscle exhibited an increase of allergenicity before the irradiation dose reached to 5 kGy (10 kGy measured by ELISA), whereas it tended to decrease significantly when the dose exceeded 10 kGy. Therefore, γ-irradiation might have an important effect on the allergenicity of shrimp. 3ashrimp 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3afood irradiation 3agamma radiation 3afood allergies 3aseafoods 3aallergens 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aallergenicity 0ashrimp protein1 aLin, H.1 aCao, L.1 aKhalid, J.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2007 Apr., v. 79, no. 3 p.945-949dElsevier Science Pub.

Plasma samples, without a drying and reconstitution step, were extracted by solid-phase extraction and eluted with acetonitrile. The analyte and zolpidem tartrate (internal standard, IS) were chromatographed on a C₁₈ column; the mobile phase was 85:15 (v/v) acetonitrile-5 mM ammonium formate, pH adjusted to 4.5 with formic acid, at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min⁻¹. The retention times of quetiapine and the IS were 1.25 and 1.05 min, respectively, and the run time was 1.8 min per sample. Selected reaction monitoring of MH⁺ at m/z 384.12 and 308.11 resulted in stable fragment ions with m/z 253.02 and 235.09 for quetiapine and the IS, respectively. Response was a linear function of concentration in the range 1.0-240.0 ng mL⁻¹, with r ≥ 0.9994. Recovery of quetiapine and the IS ranged from 74.82 to 85.57%. The assay has excellent characteristics and has been successfully used for analysis of quetiapine in healthy human subjects in a bioequivalence study. 3aacetonitrile 3adrying 3aformic acid 3ahumans 3aionization 3aions 3aliquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3apH 3apharmacokinetics 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aKambli, Sandeep 1 aShah, Viral 1 aPatel, Yashwant 1 aGupta, Santosh 1 aSharma, Ram 1 aZaware, Bhaskar 1 aKuchekar, Shashikant R. 0 tChromatographia.g2009 Dec., v. 70, no. 11-12 p.1587-1592dWiesbaden : Vieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-009-1353-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02693naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245014100163300001600304500002400320500001500344520156200359650002501921650001001946650002001956650001501976650001301991650002902004650001302033650001202046651001102058653001102069653001502080700002002095700002002115700001802135773008502153852000902238856004802247655001202295IND4405241620221118223947.0080502e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440524162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-008-9127-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJansson, Mats10aLinks between Terrestrial Primary Production and Bacterial Production and Respiration in Lakes in a Climate Gradient in Subarctic Sweden  ap. 367-376.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe compared terrestrial net primary production (NPP) and terrestrial export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with lake water heterotrophic bacterial activity in 12 headwater lake catchments along an altitude gradient in subarctic Sweden. Modelled NPP declined strongly with altitude and annual air temperature decreases along the altitude gradient (6°C between the warmest and the coldest catchment). Estimated terrestrial DOC export to the lakes was closely correlated to NPP. Heterotrophic bacterial production (BP) and respiration (BR) were mainly based on terrestrial organic carbon and strongly correlated with the terrestrial DOC export. Excess respiration over PP of the pelagic system was similar to net emission of CO₂ in the lakes. BR and CO₂ emission made up considerably higher shares of the terrestrial DOC input in warm lakes than in cold lakes, implying that respiration and the degree of net heterotrophy in the lakes were dependant not only on terrestrial export of DOC, but also on characteristics in the lakes which changed along the gradient and affected the bacterial metabolization of allochthonous DOC. The study showed close links between terrestrial primary production, terrestrial DOC export and bacterial activity in lakes and how these relationships were dependant on air temperature. Increases in air temperature in high latitude unproductive systems might have considerable consequences for lake water productivity and release of CO₂ to the atmosphere, which are ultimately determined by terrestrial primary production. 3aprimary productivity 3alakes 3aair temperature 3awatersheds 3alatitude 3adissolved organic carbon 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3aSweden 0acarbon 0aatmosphere1 aHickler, Thomas1 aJonsson, Anders1 aKarlsson, Jan0 tEcosystems.g2008 Apr., v. 11, no. 3 p.367-376dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-008-9127-2 7aarticle03043naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245008700171300001600258500002400274520182300298650001002121650001402131650002102145650002502166650001802191650001302209650001202222650001002234650002402244650001402268650001402282650001002296650001202306700002202318700002102340700002502361700002702386700002202413773011002435852000902545856005502554655001202609IND4426723920221118223951.0091002e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442672392DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-459X.2009.00233.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraghieri, Ada10aSensory properties affecting acceptability of "Bresaola" from Podolian young bulls  ap. 677-697.  aIncludes references  aThree muscles (Semimembranosus, Quadriceps femoris, Adductor) from Podolian young bulls (aged 18 months) were processed into bresaolas, which were compared with commercial products, in terms of sensory profile and preference expressed by consumers. Slope analysis was conducted to study the preference drivers. The preference of homogeneous groups of consumers and the relationships with sensory properties of bresaola were investigated using partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis. The products differed for several sensory properties, such as sweetness, flavor intensity (P < 0.001), saltiness (P < 0.01), peppered, seasoned and tenderness (P < 0.05). The slope analysis showed that taste/flavor (k = 0.86) and appearance (k = 0.76) play an important role in orienting consumer preference, while texture (k = 0.54) is less important. No general trend was found for product liking. Conversely, PLS regression clustered the consumers in homogeneous groups: one preferred the commercial products characterized by sensory properties such as peppered, saltiness, seasoned and marbling, another one was more oriented toward properties such as sweetness, odor and chewiness, which characterized Podolian bresaolas. Partial least squares regression analysis clustered the consumers in homogeneous groups according to their liking: those preferring peppered, salty, seasoned and marbling bresaolas versus those oriented toward sweet and odorous products. In addition, the relationship between overall liking and attribute liking (appearance, taste/flavor and texture) was analyzed by linear regression analysis. This may be helpful in order to establish meaningful criteria for grading bresaolas and identify the particular attributes that move its acceptance (i.e., taste/flavor and appearance rather than texture). 3abulls 3achewiness 3acluster analysis 3aconsumer preferences 3alinear models 3amarbling 3amuscles 3aodors 3aregression analysis 3asaltiness 3asweetness 3ataste 3atexture1 aGirolami, Antonio1 aCarlucci, Angela1 aPiazzolla, Nicoletta1 aRiviezzi, Amelia Maria1 aNapolitano, Fabio0 tJournal of sensory studies.g2009 Oct., v. 24, no. 5 p.677-697dBlackwell Publishing Incx0887-82507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-459X.2009.00233.x 7aarticle02202naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245015500163300001800318520097600336650001101312650001601323650001901339650001601358650002001374650001701394650001801411650002901429650001301458650002101471650001201492700001601504700001901520700002101539773010601560852000901666856008501675930003301760946001101793655001201804IND4429323620221118224117.0091127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442932362DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-009-1368-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Yingnian 10aLC Method for Quantification of ent-11α-Hydroxy-15-oxo-kaur-16-en-19-oic Acid in Rabbit Plasma: Validation and Application to a Pharmacokinetic Study  ap. 1599-1603.  aent-11α-Hydroxy-15-oxo-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid (5F), a diterpenoid isolated from the Chinese herb Pteris semipinnata L, has been suggested to show antitumor properties. A simple and sensitive LC method was developed for the determination of 5F in rabbit plasma. The method involved liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate under acidic conditions using naproxen as an internal standard. Separations were performed on a reversed-phase column with a mixture of 1% (v/v) glacial acetic acid and methanol (45:55, v/v) as mobile phase and UV detection was utilized at 242 nm. The calibration plot was linear in the range 0.20-10.0 μg mL⁻¹ (correlation coefficients r ² > 0.998). The detection limit was 0.20 μg mL⁻¹, mean extraction recovery was above 82%, intra-day precision of the method was less than 6.4%, and inter-day precision was better than 8.7%, respectively. The validated assay was found to be suitable for the pharmacokinetic study of 5F in rabbits. 3aPteris 3aacetic acid 3achromatography 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3aditerpenoids 3aethyl acetate 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amethanol 3apharmacokinetics 3arabbits1 aWu, Kefeng 1 aLiang, Nianci 1 aChen, George G. 0 tChromatographia.g2009 Dec., v. 70, no. 11-12 p.1599-1603dWiesbaden : Vieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-009-1368-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02262naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245010300171300001800274520098300292650002601275650000901301650002101310650004601331650001201377650002501389650002601414650002601440650004401466700002001510700002301530700002701553700002101580700001901601773010601620852000901726856008501735930003301820946001101853655001201864IND4429323920221118224042.0091127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442932392DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-009-1376-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaldini, Mariateresa 10aQuantitative Analysis of Caffeoylquinic Acids and Styrylpyrones in Sweetia panamensis Bark by UPLC  ap. 1621-1626.  aSix secondary metabolites from the methanolic extract of Sweetia panamensis (Fabaceae) bark were isolated and characterised.

Comparisons made were: 1) a line (E) selected long-term for increased egg production and its randombred control (RBC1); 2) a line (F) selected long-term for increased 16-wk BW and its control (RBC2); 3) the F line with a commercial sire line (C); and 4) the RBC1 line and a randombred control (RBC3) that was formed from the F and C lines. Data were analyzed on an absolute basis and after adjustment to a common BW by covariance analysis. The only major change in organ sizes that occurred that could not be accounted for by differences in BW was in the E line. The actual and relative weights of total supply organs decreased and the relative weight of the BWB increased in the E line when compared with its randombred control. Selection for increased BW in the F line did not result in a relative change in BWB. The BWB weight was relatively heavier in the C line than in the F line. The relative amount of BWB was slightly but significantly different in the two randombreds (RBC1 and RBC3) formed 29 yr apart. Weight of the gizzard did not increase at the same rate as BW in two large-bodied lines (F and RBC3). 3aweight 3apancreas 3aline differences 3aliver 3abreast muscle 3abody weight 3aturkeys 3acecum 3agender differences 3aspleen 3adigestive tract 3alength 3aheart 3aselection criteria 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aOrgan Sizexphysiology 2aOvipositionxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSex Factors 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTurkeysxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 0aintestines 0aturkey egg production1 aSaif, Y.M.1 aEmmerson, D.A.1 aAnthony, N.B.0 tPoultry science.g1995 Apr., v. 74, no. 4 p.601-611x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07406013Available from publisher's Web site  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01228naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245005900115300001400174520055100188650002000739650001700759650002300776650001900799653002000818773006100838852000900899939003300908945000800941946001300949655001200962991560812240742620221118224131.0790917e197905  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794556742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aDiet theory: Basic arguments in favor of vegetarianism  ap. 32-35.  aImproved health is the primary reason people adopt a vegetarian diet.

Plants of intermediate morphology indicate that gene flow might take place in both senses. In order to quantify gene flow between cultivated and wild sunflower, an experimental stand of sunflower was sown surrounded by plots of wild plants at increasing distances. Hybridization rate was estimated using a crop specific isozyme marker, and a mean of 7% progenies were crop-wild hybrids. The nearest wild plants (3 m from the cultivar) showed the highest percentage (18%) of gene flow, which was found to decrease with distance, up to 500 m. Pollen flow from wild plants to crop, evaluated through morphological characters in the progenies of cultivated plants from a stand invaded by wild sunflowers, produced 3.75% intermediate plants. 3aHelianthus annuus 3afield crops 3awild relatives 3agene flow 3aintroduced species 3awild plants 3aplant morphology 3aspatial distribution 3ahybridization 3agenetic markers 3aisozymes 3apollen flow 3aArgentina 0anaturalized populations 0avolunteer crops1 aCarrera, A.D.1 aCantamutto, M.A.1 aPoverene, M.M.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2008 Feb., v. 123, no. 4 p.343-349x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2007.07.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02733naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245009900194300001400293520091000307650002201217650002101239650001801260650001601278650003301294650001301327650001301340650005501353650004501408650003501453650006101488650001801549650001801567650003101585650005501616650003301671650002501704650004701729650002901776650004601805653002801851653001501879700002401894700001901918773012101937852000902058856009202067930003302159946001102192655001202203IND4429207820221118224359.0091127e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442920782DNAL7 a199032012pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01832.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlendová, Nad'a10aExpression of Escherichia coli Min system in Bacillus subtilis and its effect on cell division  ap. 58-68.  aIn both rod-shaped Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli cells, Min proteins are involved in the regulation of division septa formation. In E. coli, dynamic oscillation of MinCD inhibitory complex and MinE, a topological specificity protein, prevents improper polar septation. However, in B. subtilis no MinE is present and no oscillation of Min proteins can be observed. The function of MinE is substituted by that of an unrelated DivIVA protein, which targets MinCD to division sites and retains them at the cell poles. We inspected cell division when the E. coli Min system was introduced into B. subtilis cells. Expression of these heterologous Min proteins resulted in cell elongation. We demonstrate here that E. coli MinD can partially substitute for the function of its B. subtilis protein counterpart. Moreover, E. coli MinD was observed to have similar helical localization as B. subtilis MinD. 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3acell division 3acell growth 3aheterologous gene expression 3aproteins 3atopology 2aAdenosine Triphosphatasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aBacillus subtilisxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Division 2aCell Polarity 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aLuminescent Proteins 2aMembrane Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesis 0abacterial cell division 0aMin system1 aMuchová, Katarína1 aBarák, Imrich0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2010 Jan., v. 302, no. 1 p.58-68dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01832.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02510naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245011800155300001600273520127600289650002101565650000901586650001201595650001301607650001501620650001501635650001701650650001901667650001901686650002001705650001801725650002001743650001801763653001501781653002101796700001301817700001501830773007301845852000901918856007801927930003302005945001302038946001302051655001202064IND2052033820221118223955.0960709e199603  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205203382DNAL7 a10.3382/ps.07504322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlandorf, H.10aInhibition of aminoguanidine of glucose-derived collagen cross-linking in skeletal muscle of broiler breeder hens  ap. 432-437.  aAminoguanidine (AG) is a nucleophilic compound that inhibits nonenzymatic, glucose-derived collagen cross-linking in animal tissues. Whether AG can attenuate the accumulation of collagen cross-links in the Biceps femoris muscle of 64-wk-old broiler breeder hens as well as improve meat quality, was investigated. Eighty-four broiler breeder hens (30-wk-old) were divided into four equal groups. Each group was assigned randomly to diets supplemented with 0, 200 400, or 800 ppm AG, respectively. Birds were fed individually, 150 g diet/d. After feeding AG for 34 wk six birds from each group were killed and samples from the leg muscle were analyzed for changes in collagen content. Aminoguanidine decreased (P < 0.05) glucose-derived collagen cross-links in skeletal muscle as measured by fluorescence and collagen solubility. Insoluble collagen fraction decreased with increasing AG dosage, whereas acid-soluble and pepsin-soluble fractions increased with increasing AG dosage. Aminoguanidine did not affect shear force. In agreement with studies on animals with diabetes, AG is a potent inhibitor of glucose-derived cross-linking in chickens, although the results from the measurements of shear force do not support its use for improving carcass quality in spent hens. 3abroiler chickens 3ahens 3amuscles 3acollagen 3asolubility 3aguanidines 3achicken meat 3ahydroxyproline 3ashear strength 3aliveweight gain 3ablood glucose 3askeletal muscle 3adose response 0atenderness 0abiceps femoralis1 aZhou, Q.1 aSams, A.R.0 tPoultry science.g1996 Mar., v. 75, no. 3 p.432-437x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07504323Available from publisher's Web site  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02848naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001700156245009900173300001600272500001500288520139000303650001601693650001901709650003101728650001301759650001801772650001101790650001301801650001501814650003601829650001201865650001701877650002401894650001101918650002001929650001301949650000901962650003101971650004002002653001102042653001202053653001302065700002202078773007202100852000902172856007802181930003302259945001302292946001302305655001202318IND2052633420221118224024.0960815e199605  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205263342DNAL7 a87229052pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07505852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, G.A.12aA method for separating sex-linked imperfect albino (S*ALS) and nonalbino embryos before hatch  ap. 585-588.  a2019-12-04  aThe feasibility of using the sex-linked gene for imperfect albinism (S*ALS) to sex chicks during incubation by candling was studied. With this technique, the dark eye of nonalbino embryos can be positively identified. Two trials were performed. In a first trial, 66.5 and 89.5% of the 254 nonalbino and 210 albino chicks produced in four hatches were correctly identified by candling at 7 d of incubation. Of 191 eggs predicted to be nonalbinos, 22 were albinos, resulting in an overall accuracy of 88.5% for identification of nonalbino embryos. In a second trial, the accuracy of the technique from 7 to 10 d of incubation was evaluated. Increased age resulted in a tendency for lower accuracy, but candling at d, 9, or 10 d of incubation allowed identification of a greater (P < 0.05) proportion of the nonalbino population than at 7 d of incubation. Candling at 8 d of incubation allowed identification of nonalbinos and albinos with an accuracy of 81.3 and 84.9%, respectively, suggesting that the *ALS gene could be used to sex chicks during incubation when used in a sex-linked cross. This technique may prove advantageous to the laying industry because of savings of incubator and hatcher space. The males of commercial layer lines are normally killed at hatch. Reducing the number that hatch by eliminating them before 10 d of incubation could diminish animal welfare concerns. 3asex linkage 3aanimal welfare 3asex determination analysis 3agenotype 3aembryogenesis 3achicks 3aaccuracy 3aprediction 2aAlbinismxgeneticsxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aChick Embryo 2aFeasibility Studies 2aFemale 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenotype 2aMale 2aPoultry Diseasesxgenetics 2aSex Determination Analysisxmethods 0asexing 0aalbinos 0acandling1 aSilversides, F.G.0 tPoultry science.g1996 May, v. 75, no. 5 p.585-588x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07505853Available from publisher's Web site  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02887naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245008900172300001600261520147700277650001201754650001401766650002401780650001101804650001601815650002401831650002501855650001201880650002701892650004101919650003101960650002401991650003502015650006402050650002002114653001602134653002802150700002102178773007202199852000902271856007802280930003302358945001302391946001302404655001202417IND2052633720221118224125.0960815e199605  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205263372DNAL7 a87229082pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07506012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyle, C.R.13aAn application of the augmented randomized complete block design to poultry research  ap. 601-606.  aAvian health researchers are often faced with the need to evaluate large numbers of potential disease agents, but limited facilities and the desire to minimize animal usage and costs prohibit large, all-inclusive experiments. Plant breeders encounter a similar problem with variety screening experiments in which a large number of varieties must be evaluated, but the supply of seed may be limited. In that situation, the use of augmented experimental designs has proven effective for obtaining the replication needed for valid statistical analysis. Those designs rely on the use of multiple trials consisting of different sets of plant varieties; standard varieties are included as controls or checks in every trial to provide an estimate of experimental error. Although the comparisons among varieties are not all equally precise and the estimate of experimental error may be biased, use of augmented designs can reduce the time and number of experimental units needed to isolate the most promising new varieties for further in-depth study. Augmented designs can similarly be applied to screening experiments in poultry research. This paper describes the augmented randomized complete block design and its application in an avian health setting. Data collected in an exploratory study of infectious enteritis in chickens illustrate details of the statistical analysis. Suggestions for implementing this analysis using the SAS statistical analysis package are also given. 3apoultry 3ascreening 3aexperimental design 3achicks 3abody weight 3ainfectious diseases 3astatistical analysis 2aAnimals 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aEnteritisxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aMass Screeningxveterinary 2aModels, Statistical 2aPoultry Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aRandomized Controlled Trials as Topicxmethodsxveterinary. 2aResearch Design 0aexperiments 0acontrols (experimental)1 aMontgomery, R.D.0 tPoultry science.g1996 May, v. 75, no. 5 p.601-606x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07506013Available from publisher's Web site  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle04180naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001300156245015800169300001600327500001500343520209800358650002102456650001902477650002502496650001002521650001402531650002602545650002002571650001902591650002002610650001602630650001602646650001102662650001702673650001902690650003902709650001202748650004402760650004702804650003802851650002002889650002402909650000902933650004002942650006902982650004303051650003103094650001903125653001303144653001503157653001203172653002303184700001503207700001903222700001803241700001703259773007203276852000903348856007803357930003303435945001303468946001303481655001203494IND2052633920221118223913.0960815e199605  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205263392DNAL7 a87229102pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07506182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, H.10aEffects of supplemental phytase and phosphorus on histological and other tibial bone characteristics and performances of broilers fed semi-purified diets  ap. 618-626.  a2019-12-04  aTwo trials with day-old chicks were conducted to investigate the effects of supplemental phytase (Natuphos) on histological, mechanical, and chemical properties of tibia, and performances of broilers fed semi-purified diets containing soybean meal as the only organic P source [0.11% nonphytate P (nP)]. Dietary treatments in Trial 1 were: 1) 0.20% nP, 2) Diet 1 + 800 U of phytase/kg of diet, 3) 0.27% nP, 4) Diet 3 + 600 U of phytase, 5) 0.34% nP, 6) Diet 5 + 400 U of phytase. Supplemental phytase and inorganic P increased tibial length (P < 0.01), shear force (P < 0.001), shear stress (P < 0.05), ash content (P < 0.001), and BW gain and feed intake (P < 0.001) during Trial 1. The hypertrophic zone width at the proximal end of the tibia was decreased (P < 0.05), and the tibial width (P < 0.05) of the long axis of the tibia was increased by the phytase and P supplementation. Supplemental phytase enlarged the cartilaginous and proliferative zones of the tibial proximal end (P < 0.05), and an increase in nP levels produced similar effects. Supplementation of phytase and P also tended to improve the orderliness of development and arrangement of cartilage and bone cells. Dietary treatments in Trial 2 were: 1) 0.27% nP, 2) Diet 1 + 350 U of phytase, 3) Diet 1 + 1,050 U of phytase, 4) 0.45% nP, 5) 0.54% nP, 6) Diet 5 + 1,050 U of phytase. Broilers fed diets containing relatively high levels of nP and phytase supplementation in Trial 2 gave results similar to those observed in Trial 1. Marked improvements (P < 0.05) in the ash content, shear force, shear stress, length of tibia, BW gain, and feed intake, and reduced hypertrophic zone width were achieved for broilers fed the P-deficient diet supplemented with phytase. Also, supplemental phytase tended to increase the width of cartilaginous and proliferative zones, to increase trabecular bone density, and to improve the orderliness of development and mineralization of cartilage and bone cells. In summary, supplementing a low-nP diet with inorganic P or phytase resulted in similar beneficial effects on bone development. 3abroiler chickens 3ashear strength 3ainorganic phosphorus 3atibia 3ahistology 3anutrient deficiencies 3afeed conversion 3afeed additives 3aliveweight gain 3afeed intake 3ameasurement 3achicks 3asoybean meal 3ahistopathology 2a6-Phytasexadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aBone Densityxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aChickensxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aEatingxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFood, Fortified 2aMagnesiumxanalysis 2aMale 2aPhosphorusxadministration & dosage 2aTibiaxanatomy & histologyxchemistryxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aWeight Gainxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aWeight-Bearingxphysiology 2aZincxanalysis 0abone ash 0atrabeculae 0aphytase 0aanimal performance1 aVeit, H.P.1 aKornegay, E.T.1 aRavindran, V.1 aDenbow, D.M.0 tPoultry science.g1996 May, v. 75, no. 5 p.618-626x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07506183Available from publisher's Web site  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02871naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152100001500169245013800184300001600322500002400338520160600362650001801968650002501986650001702011650002302028653001402051653001802065653001002083700001702093700001702110773013102127852000902258856009202267856005502359930003302414945002502447946001302472655001202485IND4424787720221118224230.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442478772DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1740-8261.2009.01573.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Wet gauze bolus has the potential to reduce air gaps between the bolus and surface, which could decrease surface dose if sufficiently large to disrupt electronic equilibrium. Wet gauze bolus is often fabricated and wetness judged qualitatively. We assessed the effect of specific gauze wetness levels, quantified in terms of physical density, at various field sizes with respect to their effectiveness as bolus material compared with Superflab®. For large fields, >7 x 7 cm² in this study, wet gauze sponges with a physical density of 1.02 g/cm³ performed essentially identical to Superflab®; at a smaller field size the wet gauze was slightly less effective, likely due to the heterogeneity of the gauze-water matrix. Gauze that was wetter, with a physical density of 1.2 g/cm³, or less wet, with a physical density of 0.75 g/cm³ was not as effective either due to enhanced photon absorption in the wetter sponges, or less effective establishment of electronic equilibrium in the less wet sponges. The presence of an air gap under Superflab® led to reduced surface dose, especially for small fields and large air gaps. Thus, if Superflab® use leads to poor contact with the skin, wet gauze having a physical density of 1.02 g/cm³ can be used as a substitute. Judging the water content of wet gauze subjectively is not acceptable as over- or under wetness can lead to decreased effectiveness of the bolus material. 3awater content 3aveterinary equipment 3aradiotherapy 3aproduct evaluation 0aSuperflab 0awetness level 0agauze1 aPruitt, A.F.1 aThrall, D.E.0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2009 , v. 50, no. 5 p.555-559dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2009.01573.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2009.01573.x  a20091021b20091106c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/10/04  aOther US 7aarticle03259naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001400156245009500170300001600265500001500281520186700296650001302163650001402176650001802190650002202208650001702230650001702247650002402264650001202288650004402300650003602344650002302380650002002403650002802423650002502451650003302476653001602509653001302525700002002538773007302558852000902631856007802640930003302718945001302751946001302764655001202777IND2052029420221118224145.0960709e199603  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205202942DNAL7 a87787292pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07503512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErf, G.F.10aAlterations in blood leukocyte populations in Smyth line chickens with autoimmune vitiligo  ap. 351-356.  a2019-12-04  aSmyth line (SL) chickens spontaneously develop a posthatch autoimmune loss of pigment cells (vitiligo) in the feather. Concurrent with the development of Smyth line vitiligo (SLV), mononuclear cell infiltration and altered T cell profiles can be observed in the pulp of developing feathers. To determine whether the development of SLV is preceded by or associated with alterations in blood lymphocyte and leukocyte populations, blood leukocyte profiles were established at various times prior to and throughout the spontaneous development of SLV. The proportions among various blood leukocyte populations (percentage of lymphocytes, monocytes, heterophils, eosinophils, and basophils) were determined by differential leukocyte counts. The proportions among blood lymphocyte populations were examined by immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analyses. Lymphocyte markers included fluorescence-conjugated monoclonal antibodies to identify T cells (CD3), T helper cells (CD4), cytotoxic T cells (CD8), and B cells (IgM). The proportions among blood lymphocyte populations examined did not differ between SL and MHC-matched parental Brown line (BL) control chickens prior to and throughout the development of SLV. Compared to BL controls, SL chickens had, however, increased proportions of inflammatory leukocytes in the blood, particularly at the time when most hatchmates developed SLV. Examination of leukocyte alterations with respect to first observation of SLV revealed that inflammatory leukocyte levels were elevated early in SLV. Although altered leukocyte profiles in the blood were observed during the development of SLV, blood from SL chickens did not reflect alterations in lymphocyte populations known to occur at the site of melanocyte destruction. The role of inflammatory blood leukocytes in the development of SLV needs to be further investigated. 3achickens 3amonocytes 3aT-lymphocytes 3ahematologic tests 3ainflammation 3agranulocytes 3aautoimmune diseases 2aAnimals 2aAutoimmune Diseasesxbloodxveterinary. 2aChickensxgeneticsximmunology. 2aImmunity, Cellular 2aLeukocyte Count 2aPoultry Diseasesxblood 2aT-Lymphocyte Subsets 2aVitiligoxbloodxveterinary. 0alymphocytes 0avitiligo1 aSmyth, J.R.

We injected recombinant mouse GM-CSF into the brains of 8-month-old C57BL6 mice via intracerebroventricular injections and studied the activities of microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. We also sought to determine whether an anti-GM-CSF antibody could suppress endogenous microglial activity in the C57BL6 mice and could also suppress microglial activity induced by the recombinant mouse GM-CSF in another group of C57BL6 mice. Using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, we assessed microglial, astrocytic, and neuronal activity by measuring mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, GFAP, and the neuronal marker NeuN in the cerebral cortex tissues from C57BL6 mice. We performed immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry of activated microglia in different regions of the brains from control (phosphate-buffered saline-injected C57BL6 mice) and experimental mice (recombinant GM-CSF-injected C57BL6 mice, GM-CSF antibody-injected C57BL6 mice, and recombinant mouse GM-CSF plus anti-GM-CSF antibody-injected C57BL6 mice). We found increased mRNA expression of CD40 (9.75-fold), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (2.1-fold), CD45 (1.73-fold), and CD11c (1.70-fold) in the cerebral cortex of C57BL6 mice that were induced with recombinant GM-CSF, compared with control mice. Further, the anti-GM-CSF antibody suppressed microglia in mice that were induced with recombinant GM-CSF. Our immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry findings of GM-CSF-associated cytokines in C57BL6 mice induced with recombinant GM-CSF, in C57BL6 mice injected with the anti-GM-CSF antibody, and in C57BL6 mice injected with recombinant mouse GM-CSF plus anti-GM-CSF antibody concurred with our real-time RT-PCR findings. These findings suggest that GM-CSF is critical for microglial activation and that anti-GM-CSF antibody suppresses microglial activity in the CNS. The findings from this study may have implications for anti-inflammatory effects of Alzheimer's disease and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice (a multiple sclerosis mouse model). 3aastrocytes 3aimmunotherapy 3ainflammation 3acytokines 2aAnimals 2aAntibodiesxpharmacology 2aCD11c Antigenxgenetics. 2aCD40 Antigensxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAstrocytesxdrug effects 2aBrainxcytology 2aCytokinesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aGranulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factorximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aInjections, Intraventricularxmethods 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMicrogliaxdrug effects 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNeuronsxdrug effects 2aPhosphopyruvate Hydratasexmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 0aneuroglia 0aneurodegenerative disease1 aManczak, Maria1 aZhao, Wei1 aNakamura, Kazuhiro1 aBebbington, Christopher1 aYarranton, Geoffrey1 aMao, Peizhong0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2009 Dec., v. 111, no. 6 p.1514-1528dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06432.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02381naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245009900170300001600269520112500285650002201410650001501432650001301447650001501460650001201475650001301487650001501500650001301515650001001528650001701538650001601555653001901571653002101590653002101611653001801632700001901650700002101669773011201690852000901802856009201811930003301903946001101936655001201947IND4429205820221118224038.0091127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442920582DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2009.01632.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreplová, M.10aIntra- and inter-specific crosses of Solanum materials after mitotic polyploidization in vitro  ap. 651-657.  aMitotic polyploidization in vitro was used in selected wild Solanum species and Solanum tuberosum dihaploids. The efficiency of polyploidization by colchicine was compared with that of oryzalin. Oryzalin was more effective than colchicine (P = 0.1). The rate of non-affected to mixoploid to tetraploid regenerants was 22 : 2.5 : 1 (colchicine) and 14 : 2 : 1 (oryzalin). Optimal concentrations and durations were 3.5 m m/24 h for colchicine and 25 or 30 μ m for 24 or 48 h for oryzalin (variations in concentration and duration are necessary owing to possible diversity of responses in selected genotypes). Tetraploids were obtained from S. berthaultii, S. bulbocastanum, S. pinnatisectum, S. verrucosum and eleven S. tuberosum dihaploids. The yield of tetraploids derived from tbr dihaploids was lower than that from the wild species (P = 0.01). Tetraploid regenerants were tested in intra- and inter-specific crosses. Three of 43 intra-specific combinations (298 pollinated flowers) were successful and yielded 440 seeds. Inter-specific crosses (138 combinations, 1672 pollinated flowers) yielded 48 seedless berries. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3acolchicine 3acrossing 3adihaploidy 3aflowers 3agenotype 3amixoploidy 3aoryzalin 3aseeds 3asmall fruits 3atetraploidy 0aS. berthaultii 0aS. bulbocastanum 0aS. pinnatisectum 0aS. verrucosum1 aPolzerová, H.1 aDomkářová, J.0 tPlant breeding.g2009 Dec., v. 128, no. 6 p.651-657dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2009.01632.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02556naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001400193245012800207300001400335520125900349653003201608653002001640653001601660653002301676700001601699700001401715700001601729700001501745700001701760700001601777700001601793700001301809700001601822700001901838773013201857852000901989856009201998930003302090946001102123655001202134IND4429193420221118224346.0091127e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442919342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.04045.x2doi7 aPMC28026962pmcid7 a198916592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoppo, R.10aToll-like receptor 4 expression is increased in circulating mononuclear cells of patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy  ap. 73-81.  aWe investigated Toll-like receptors (TLR-3, -4 and -7) expression in circulating mononuclear cells of patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), a disease with debated relationships with mucosal immunity. TLR-4 expression (detected by fluorescence activated cell sorter) and mRNA transcriptional levels (Taqman) were significantly higher in patients with IgAN than in healthy controls (P = 0·00200 and P = 0·0200). TLR-3 and TLR-7 were not modified significantly. In IgAN patients proteinuria was correlated significantly with TLR-4 expression (P = 0·0312). In a group of nephrotic syndromes, TLR-3, -4 and -7 expression was similar to healthy controls. A significant difference in TLR-4 expression and mRNA levels was found between very active IgAN patients (proteinuria > 1 g/1·73 m²/day in association with severe microscopic haematuria) and inactive patients (proteinuria < 0·5 g/1·73 m²/day, with absent or minimal haematuria). No correlation with levels of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1, age, renal biopsy features or therapy was found. This study shows for the first time an up-regulation of TLR-4 in circulating mononuclear cells of patients with IgAN, particularly in association with proteinuria and heavy microscopic haematuria. 0aaberrantly glycosylated IgA 0aIgA nephropathy 0aproteinuria 0aToll-like receptor1 aCamilla, R.1 aAmore, A.1 aPeruzzi, L.1 aDaprà, V.1 aLoiacono, E.1 aVatrano, S.1 aRollino, C.1 aSepe, V.1 aRampino, T.1 aDal Canton, A.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2010 Jan., v. 159, no. 1 p.73-81dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.04045.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01836naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245007200141300001600213500001500229520086400244650001901108650002101127650001801148650001501166650001601181650002101197650001901218650001601237653002001253700001501273700001401288773008201302852000901384930003301393945002501426946001101451655001201462IND4377761020221118223859.0060209e20051110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437776102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The images of gum arabic have revealed predominantly linear structures that are considered to represent the arabinogalactan fraction constituting the major fraction in the gum. In contrast, soybean polysaccharide appears as highly branched structures with linear branches of ca. 20-80 nm in length. This observation is consistent with the previously proposed structural model hypothesizing the presence of long neutral sugar side-chains bound to the backbone of rhamnogalacturonan. AFM has provided the first direct evidence for the difference in branching structures in these hydrocolloids widely utilized in the food industry as effective emulsifiers and stabilizers in oil-in-water emulsions. 3aimage analysis 3asoybean products 3ahydrocolloids 3agum arabic 3aemulsifiers 3aarabinogalactans 3aultrastructure 3astabilizers 0apolysaccharides1 aFunami, T.1 aZhang, G.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2005 Nov. 10, v. 62, no. 2 p.192-196x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20080208b20080301c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/07/14  aNon-US 7aarticle01798naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245009800144300001600242520084600258650001301104650001501117650002301132650001501155650002001170650001801190650002301208650001901231700002001250700001801270773008201288852000901370930003301379945002501412946001101437655001201448IND4377872220221118223809.0060214e20051214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437787222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In spite of their many advantages over ground spices, their sensitivity to light, heat and oxygen is a disadvantage. One approach to overcome this disadvantage is by means of microencapsulation. The present work reports on microencapsulation of cardamom oleoresin by spray drying using gum arabic, maltodextrin, and a commercially available modified starch as wall materials. The microcapsules were evaluated for the content and stability of volatiles, non-volatiles, entrapped 1,8-cineole and entrapped a-terpinyl acetate for 6 weeks. Gum arabic offered greater protection to the oleoresin than maltodextrin and modified starch, as seen from the t1/2, time required for a constituent to reduce to 50% of its initial value. 3acardamom 3aoleoresins 3amicroencapsulation 3agum arabic 3amodified starch 3amaltodextrins 3avolatile compounds 3aultrastructure1 aKshiragar, A.C.1 aSinghal, R.S.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2005 Dec. 14, v. 62, no. 4 p.309-315x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20060715b20060804c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/07/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02350naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245012500141300001600266520143400282650001301716650001601729650002301745650001701768650001801785650002501803650002101828700001501849773008201864852000901946930003301955945002501988946001102013655001202024IND4376606720221118223942.0051209e20050829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437660672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDon, T.M.10aSynthesis and characterization of AB-crosslinked graft copolymers based on maleilated chitosan and N-isopropylacrylamide  ap. 334-337.  aAB-crosslinked graft copolymers based on a maleilated chitosan (MA-CS) and N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) were successfully synthesized through a two-step reaction. Chitosan was first modified with maleic anhydride to produce MA-CS which contained vinyl carboxylic acid groups. In the second step, NIPAAm monomer was graft-copolymerized onto MA-CS via free radical polymerization initiated by UV radiation. The chemical structures of the synthesized copolymers were confirmed by analyses of the Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The grafting efficiency increased with the added amount of NIPAAm monomer and it reached a plateau value of ca. 55%. In the mean time, grafting ratio increased with the added amount of NIPAAm as well, and it had a value of 2.47 when NIPAAm monomer was added five times the amount of MA-CS. A two-stage thermal degradation behavior was observed for the copolymer samples, corresponding to the degradations of chitosan and grafted PNIPAAm chains, respectively. In addition, all copolymer samples exhibited the same glass transition temperature as pure PNIPAAm at 137 degrees C. All of the experimental results confirmed the AB-crosslinked structure in the formed copolymer of PNIPAAm and MA-CS. The influences of grafting ratio on the phase transition as well as swelling behavior of copolymer gels in various pH buffer solutions at different temperatures were studied. 3achitosan 3aacrylamides 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3ahydrocolloids 3aswelling (materials) 3aphase transition1 aChen, H.R.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2005 Aug. 29, v. 61, no. 3 p.334-337x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20060712b20060804c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/07/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02287naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001900127245013600146300001600282520132800298650001701626650002001643650002301663650001401686650001201700650002501712650002201737650001401759700001601773773008201789852000901871930003301880945002501913946001101938655001201949IND4376605520221118223945.0051209e20050829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437660552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

(giant reed) under conditions of ethanol-alkali delignification has been studied. Based on properties of multi-component reaction system, the degradation of arabinan, galactan and mannan (expressed as homopolymers) was accurately described in terms of two simultaneous irreversible first-order reactions, corresponding to two kinetically homogeneous polysaccharide fractions. The first and more reactive fraction accounted for about 30, 73 and 4% of total arabinan, galactan and mannan, respectively, and is rapidly lost during the first pulping period. The respective values of apparent activation energy were estimated as 65, 45 and 82 kJ mol(-1). The second fraction slowly degraded during pulping with two-order lower rate (activation energy of 88-98 kJ mol(-1)). The degradation of uronic acids as well as the formation of hexenuronic acids was accurately described in terms of three simultaneous first-order reactions, corresponding to three kinetically homogeneous fractions. The overall rate of hexenuronic acid formation during ethanol-alkali pulping was found to be one-order lower of the overall rate of uronic acids degradation. 3aArundo donax 3adelignification 3aorganosolv pulping 3agalactans 3amannans 3achemical degradation 3areaction kinetics 3aarabinans1 aPereira, H.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2005 Aug. 29, v. 61, no. 3 p.304-313x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20060712b20060804c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/07/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02052naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245008000143300001600223520095600239650001601195650001201211650001201223650000901235650003201244653001501276653003001291653002901321653003001350700001501380700001801395700001701413700001501430700001801445700001901463773008201482852000901564930003301573945002501606946001101631655001201642IND4376605220221118223913.0051209e20050829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437660522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSomsook, E.10aInteractions between iron(III) and sucrose, dextran, or starch in complexes  ap. 281-287.  aThis paper is aimed to study the nature of iron(III)-saccharide interactions in complexes and to look for new iron-containing drugs for supplementing organisms. Iron(III)-saccharide complexes were synthesized by reacting FeCl3 and saccharides (rice starch, sucrose, and dextran) in basic solutions and their characteristics were compared with synthetic iron-oxide. Both crystalline and amorphous iron(III) complexes were obtained and identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Amorphous samples were chosen to investigate the interactions between iron(III) and saccharides by continuous-flow dissolution experiments. In acidic solution, the rate of iron release from amorphous iron complexes increased with the following order: iron-rice starch approximately equal to iron-oxide<<iron-sucrose approximately equal to iron-dextran. The colloidal structure of iron-rice starch was proposed to describe its similar dissolution profile with that of iron-oxide. 3arice starch 3asucrose 3adextran 3airon 3adietary mineral supplements 0aferric ion 0airon-dextran interactions 0airon-starch interactions 0airon-sucrose interactions1 aHinsin, D.1 aBuakhrong, P.1 aTeanchai, R.1 aMophan, N.1 aPohmakotr, M.1 aShiowatana, J.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2005 Aug. 29, v. 61, no. 3 p.281-287x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20060714b20060804c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/07/11  aNon-US 7aarticle03994naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072000900160072000900169072000900178072000900187100002300196245012500219300001800344500002400362500001500386520177300401650002702174650001202201650001302213650002902226650002002255650002302275650001802298650001402316650001802330650002202348650002402370650002102394650002002415650002002435650000902455650001502464650002302479650002102502650001202523650003302535650002102568650002402589650003502613650001102648650000902659650001102668650002602679650004102705650003202746650003502778653002102813653002302834653002002857700001302877700001302890700001602903700002302919773012102942852000903063856008103072930003303153945002503186946001303211655001203224IND4424827120221118223948.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442482712DNAL7 a197006732pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2008-19092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aL100 0aQ5011 aGómez-Cortés, P.10aEffects of extruded linseed supplementation on n-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid in milk and cheese from ewes  ap. 4122-4134.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to assess the effects of dietary supplementation of extruded linseed on animal performance and fatty acid (FA) profile of ewe milk for the production of n-3 FA- and conjugated linoleic acid-enriched cheeses. A Manchega ewe flock (300 animals) receiving a 60:40 forage:concentrate diet was divided into 3 groups supplemented with 0, 6, and 12 g of extruded linseed/100 g of dry matter for the control, low, and high extruded linseed diets, respectively. Bulk and individual milk samples from 5 dairy ewes per group were monitored at 7, 14, 28, 45, and 60 d following supplementation. Manchego cheeses were made with bulk milk from the 3 treatment groups. Milk yield increased in dairy ewes receiving extruded linseed. Milk protein, fat, and total solids contents were not affected by linseed supplementation. Milk contents of α-linolenic acid increased from 0.36 with the control diet to 1.91% total FA with the high extruded linseed diet. Similarly, cis-9 trans-11 C18:2 rose from 0.73 to 2.33% and its precursor in the mammary gland, trans-11 C18:1, increased from 1.55 to 5.76% of total FA. This pattern occurred with no significant modification of the levels of trans-10 C18:1 and trans-10 cis-12 C18:2 FA. Furthermore, the high extruded linseed diet reduced C12:0 (-30%), C14:0 (-15%) and C16:0 (-28%), thus significantly diminishing the atherogenicity index of milk. The response to linseed supplementation was persistently maintained during the entire study. Acceptability attributes of n-3-enriched versus control cheeses ripened for 3 mo were not affected. Therefore, extruded linseed supplementation seems a plausible strategy to improve animal performance and nutritional quality of dairy lipids in milk and cheese from ewes. 3afatty acid composition 3alinseed 3aewe milk 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3afortified foods 3aruminant nutrition 3adose response 3abulk milk 3asheep feeding 3atrans fatty acids 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3afeed supplements 3acheese ripening 3amanchego cheese 3aewes 3amilk yield 3aexperimental diets 3amilk composition 2aAnimals 2aCheesexanalysisxstandards. 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Supplements 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xanalysis 2aFemale 2aFlax 2aHumans 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretion. 2aSheepxmetabolismxphysiology. 0afood composition 0aanimal performance 0amilk production1 aBach, A.1 aLuna, P.1 aJuárez, M.1 ade la Fuente, M.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2009 Sept., v. 92, no. 9 p.4122-4134dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2008-19093Available from publisher's Web site  a20091114b20091204c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/10/27  aOther US 7aarticle02522naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002200127245008600149300001600235520156300251650001901814650001301833650001301846650001601859650001801875650001201893653003201905653002201937700001301959700001501972700001301987773008202000852000902082930003302091945002502124946001102149655001202160IND4376604920221118224159.0051209e20050829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437660492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHam-Pichavant, F.10aFat resistance properties of chitosan-based paper packaging for food applications  ap. 259-265.  aThe objective of this study was to potentially replace fluorocarbon-treatment of paper-based materials by chitosan coating to produce oil barrier packaging. With this work, the nature of interactions existing between fatty acids, chosen as model lipids (such as oleic acid, largely present in the food field), and chitosan was particularly investigated. The influence of the fatty acid content and the effect of pH were studied. The ability of chitosan to interact with lipid was shown to be pH sensitive. In acidic conditions, the polycationic chitosan exhibited a stabilization of the fatty acid emulsion, which was attributed to its capacity to bind with anionic lipid molecules, as suggested by the sudden change in residual free oleic acid concentration with a slight shift in pH. Since calcium adsorption from foodstuff is known to decrease the nutritional value of the product and since chitosan exhibits chelating properties, interaction between chitosan and calcium was concurrently investigated. Whatever the pH used, adsorption of Ca(2+) ions by chitosan was found to be minor. The fat barrier properties of paper and chitosan-coated paper were also compared in application tests. It was concluded that chitosan coating could be used as fat barrier but treatment cost remained high compared with fluorinated resins. In an attempt to decrease both treatment cost and fat transfer, other natural molecules such as cellulose ethers and alginates were included with chitosan, in the coating formulations. Alginates were found to give the best results. 3afood packaging 3achitosan 3acoatings 3afatty acids 3alipid content 3acalcium 0alipid-chitosan interactions 0afat barrier paper1 aSebe, G.1 aPardon, P.1 aComa, V.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2005 Aug. 29, v. 61, no. 3 p.259-265x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20060707b20060804c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/07/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02366naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001100127245010300138300001600241520147600257650001701733650001701750650002701767650001901794653002101813700001701834700001501851700001501866773008101881852000901962930003301971945002502004946001102029655001202040IND4376604120221118224315.0051209e20050804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437660412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLu, Y.10aInnovative plasticized starch films modified with waterborne polyurethane from renewable resources  ap. 174-182.  aTo develop biodegradable materials with high performance, we prepared a novel waterborne polyurethane (PU) from rapeseed oil based polyol, and then used it to modify the glycerol plasticized starch (PS) to overcome the intrinsic drawbacks of the starch materials, such as poor mechanical properties and water sensitivity. The blend films were successfully prepared by casting the aqueous dispersions of gelatinized starch and PU. The effect of PU content on the morphology, miscibility and physical properties of the resulting materials was detailed investigated by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and measurements of mechanical properties and water sensitivity. The results show that glycerol plasticized starch can mix with rapeseed oil based waterborne polyurethane at molecular level when PU content is lower than 20 wt%, whereas the phase separation occurs when the PU content further increases in the blends. The occurrence of hydrogen bonding interaction between starch and PU plays a key role in improvement of the material performance. Compared with the pure PS films, the PS/PU blends exhibit higher values of the elongation at break (85-480%), the toughness (1.8-7.1 MPa) and the tensile strength (2.8-4.1 MPa). Meanwhile, incorporating PU into the plasticized starch matrix leads to an improvement of surface and bulk-hydrophobation and a better water resistance of the resulting materials. 3awheat starch 3arapeseed oil 3abiodegradable products 3aultrastructure 0aplasticized film1 aTighzert, L.1 aBerzin, F.1 aRondot, S.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2005 Aug. 4, v. 61, no. 2 p.174-182x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20060615b20060702c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/06/12  aNon-US 7aarticle01852naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245007200144300001600216500002300232520099100255650002201246650002201268650002301290650001001313650002301323650001801346650002701364653001601391773006601407852000901473930003301482946001101515655001201526IND9304364220221118224224.0930723e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930436422DNAL7 a184699882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyck, P.L.10aInheritance of leaf rust and stem rust resistance in 'Roblin' wheat  ap. 289-293.  aSummary in French.  aThe Canadian common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar 'Roblin' is resistant to both leaf rust (Puccinia recondita Rob. ex. Desm.) and stem rust (Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici Eriks. and E. Henn.). To study the genetics of this resistance, 'Roblin' was crossed with 'Thatcher', a leaf rust susceptible cultivar, and RL6071, a stem rust susceptible line. A set of F6 random lines was developed from each cross. The random lines and the parents were grown in a field rust nursery artificially inoculated with a mixture of P. recondita and P. graminis isolates and scored for rust reaction. The same material was tested with specific races of leaf rust and stem rust. These data indicated that 'Roblin' has Lr1, Lr10, Lr13, and Lr34 for resistance to P. recondita and Sr5, Sr9b, Sr11, and possibly Sr7a and Sr12 for resistance to P. graminis. In a 'Thatcher' background, the presence of Lr34 contributes to improve stem rust resistance, which appears also to occur in 'Roblin'. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aPuccinia graminis 3aPuccinia recondita 3agenes 3agenetic resistance 3arust diseases 3ainheritance (genetics) 0asegregation0 tGenome =.g1993 Apr., v. 36, no. 2 p.289-293x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02666naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245003800147300001600185500002300201520100500224650001601229650002901245650001701274650001601291650000801307650002101315650001501336650002701351650002701378650002501405650001401430650002001444650002001464650003201484650002601516650001801542650002401560650002501584650004401609650004601653650002301699650002801722650003101750650003001781650003901811650002301850650001301873653003301886653001801919700002001937773006601957852000902023939003302032946001102065655001202076IND9304363520221118224059.0930723e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930436352DNAL7 a85141522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolchinsky, A.10aDirect end labelling of telomeres  ap. 224-229.  aSummary in French.  aA novel approach of direct end labelling of telomeres is presented. Chromosome-sized, agarose-embedded DNA was treated with T4 DNA polymerase to remove protruding 3' end of telomeres and to generate single-stranded 5' ends. The DNA was then labelled by the same enzyme in the presence of [alpha-32P]dGTP and cold dATP and dTTP. Labelled yeast chromosomes separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis maintained their integrity. Digestion of yeast chromosomes separated in pulsed field gels with a restriction nuclease (HinfI), followed by conventional electrophoresis in the second dimension, resulted in a fingerprint-like pattern of labelled telomeres. This was very similar to the hybridization pattern of a similar two-dimensional gel probed with cloned yeast telomeric sequence. The same approach enabled us to label telomeres in soybean, determine their size, and to reveal polymorphisms in the length of telomeres between the closely related subspecies Glycine max (soybean) and Glycine soja. 3aGlycine max 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aGlycine soja 3achromosomes 3aDNA 3aisotope labeling 3aphosphorus 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3anucleotide sequences 3athymidine 3aenzyme activity 3aDNA replication 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosomes, Fungal 2aDNA, Single-Stranded 2aDNA-Directed DNA Polymerasexmetabolism 2aDeoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific 2aGenetic Techniques 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSoybeansxgenetics 2aTelomere 0apulsed field electrophoresis 0atelomeric dna1 aGresshoff, P.M.0 tGenome =.g1993 Apr., v. 36, no. 2 p.224-229x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03446naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072000900160072000900169072000900178072000900187100001700196245007800213300001800291500002400309500001500333520162500348650001501973650002401988650001002012650002702022650001202049650002102061650001602082650002302098650001302121650001802134650001602152650001502168650001502183650001402198650001202212650002102224650002102245650001102266650002402277650000902301650002002310650001402330650001402344650001202358650001702370651001802387651001802405653002302423700001602446700001602462773012102478852000902599856008102608930003302689945002502722946001302747655001202760IND4424833120221118224140.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442483312DNAL7 a197007332pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2008-19852doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL100 0aL841 0aX1001 aPszczola, M.10aShort communication: Trends for monthly changes in days open in Holsteins  ap. 4689-4696.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA reaction norm approach was used to estimate trends for days open (DO) with a model that indirectly accounted for heat stress. Data included 3.4 million first-parity records of DO of US Holsteins. A fixed effect model included herd-year, month of calving within region (MOC), age class, and regression on 305-d milk yield. An index calculated from the standardized solutions to MOC derived from the fixed effect model was treated as a proxy for an index on heat stress (SI). The lowest index for any region was set to zero. The highest index was 1.00 for the Southeast, 0.56 for the Northeast, 0.54 for the Midwest, 0.33 for the Northwest, and 0.42 for the Southwest. In all regions except the Northwest, the highest DO and the corresponding highest indices were in March-April. Compared with the fixed model, the reaction norm model also included the effect of an animal and a random regression on the SI; the 2 animal solutions are subsequently referred to as an intercept and a slope. Genetic trends were calculated for cows and sires separately. For cows, the trend for the intercept was -0.1 d/yr, whereas the trend for the slope was 1 d/yr. For sires, the same trends were -0.3 and 1.5, respectively. Official proofs were used to characterize the 100 top and 100 bottom bulls with at least 50 daughters for the intercept and the slope. Compared with the top bulls, the bottom bulls for the intercept gave 56 kg more milk and their type performance index was higher by 212 points. For the slope, the same numbers were -435 kg and -242 points, respectively.

Milk samples were available from 1,905 cows from 398 commercial herds in the Netherlands, and milk-fat composition was measured by gas chromatography. DNA was available from 7 of the paternal half-sib families: 849 cows and their 7 sires. A genetic map was constructed comprising 1,341 SNP and 2,829 cM, with an average information content of 0.83. Multimarker interval mapping was used in an across-family regression on corrected phenotypes for the 7 half-sib families. Four QTL were found: on Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 6, a QTL was identified for C6:0 and C8:0; on BTA14, a QTL was identified for fat percentage, all odd-chain fatty acids, and C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, and their unsaturation indices; on BTA19, a QTL affected C14:0; and on BTA26, a QTL was identified for the monounsaturated fatty acids and their unsaturation indices. The QTL explained 3 to 19% of phenotypic variance. Furthermore, 49 traits with suggestive evidence for linkage were found on 21 chromosomes. Additional analyses revealed that the QTL on BTA14 was most likely caused by a mutation in DGAT1, whereas the QTL on BTA26 was most likely caused by a mutation in the SCD1 gene. Quantitative trait loci that affect specific fatty acids might increase the understanding of physiological processes regarding fat synthesis and the position of the causal genes. 3aquantitative trait loci 3amedium chain fatty acids 3adairy cows 3asires 3aphenotype 3aDNA 3amutation 3ashort chain fatty acids 3amilk 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3amilk fat percentage 3agenes 3alinkage (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgenetics 2aFatsxchemistry 2aFatty Acidsxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenome-Wide Association Study 2aMale 2aMilkxchemistry 2aPhenotype 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 3aNetherlands 0agenome 0amilk composition 0adairy cattle 0amilk fat1 aSchennink, A.1 aVisker, M.H.P.W.1 aMullaart, E.1 avan Arendonk, J.A.M.1 aBovenhuis, H.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2009 Sept., v. 92, no. 9 p.4664-4675dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2008-19663Available from publisher's Web site  a20091114b20091204c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/10/27  aOther US 7aarticle03608naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180072001700197100002300214245010500237300001800342520181700360650002302177650002502200650001702225650002202242650001102264650002002275650002802295650001602323650001602339650001602355650002002371650001802391650001902409650002502428650005602453650002802509650002902537650003302566650001102599650002402610650003102634650003002665650003402695700002402729700002502753700002302778700002602801773008702827852000902914930003302923945002502956946001302981655001202994IND4429185020221118224009.0091127e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442918502DNAL7 a199033952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aOttesen, Andrea R.10aImpact of Organic and Conventional Management on the Phyllosphere Microbial Ecology of an Apple Crop  ap. 2321-2325.  aBacterial communities associated with the phyllosphere of apple trees (Malus domestica cv. Enterprise) grown under organic and conventional management were assessed to determine if increased biological food safety risks might be linked with the bacterial communities associated with either treatment. Libraries of 16S rRNA genes were generated from phyllosphere DNA extracted from a wash made from the surfaces of leaves and apples from replicated organic and conventional treatments. 16S rRNA gene libraries were analyzed with software designed to identify statistically significant differences between bacterial communities as well as shared and unique phylotypes. The identified diversity spanned eight bacterial phyla and 14 classes in the pooled organic and conventional libraries. Significant differences between organic and conventional communities were observed at four of six time points (P < 0.05). Despite the identification of significantly diverse microfloras associated with organic and conventional treatments, no detectable differences in the presence of potential enteric pathogens could be associated with either organic or conventional management. Neither of the bacterial genera most commonly associated with produce-related illness outbreaks (Salmonella and Escherichia) was observed in any of the libraries. The impressive bacterial diversity that was documented in this study provides a valuable contribution to our developing understanding of the total microbial ecology associated with the preharvest phyllospheres of food crops. The fact that organic and conventional phyllosphere bacterial communities were significantly different at numerous time points suggests that crop management methods may influence the bacterial consortia associated with the surfaces of fruits and vegetables. 3aorganic production 3aconventional tillage 3aphyllosphere 3amicrobial ecology 3aapples 3aMalus domestica 3amicrobial contamination 3afruit trees 3afruit crops 3afood safety 3arisk assessment 3aDNA libraries 3afood pathogens 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aBacteriaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aHumans 2aMalusxmicrobiology 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics1 aWhite, James Robert1 aSkaltsas, Demetra N.1 aNewell, Michael J.1 aWalsh, Christopher S.0 tJournal of food protection.g2009 Nov., v. 72, no. 11 p.2321-2325x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/02/02  aOther US 7aarticle03646naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072000900160072000900169072000900178072000900187100001900196245014000215300001800355500002400373520179100397650001502188650002402203650001302227650001502240650001602255650001602271650002602287650001402313650001302327650002602340650001502366650001202381650002302393650001202416650003402428650001602462650001102478650002402489650002102513650002302534650001402557650003402571650002402605651001102629700001602640700001802656700001802674700002202692773012102714852000902835856008102844930003302925945002502958946001302983655001202996IND4424832420221118224034.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442483242DNAL7 a197007262pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2009-21282doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL600 0aL200 0aX1001 aBignardi, A.B.10aParametric correlation functions to model the structure of permanent environmental (co)variances in milk yield random regression models  ap. 4634-4640.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of the present study was to estimate milk yield genetic parameters applying random regression models and parametric correlation functions combined with a variance function to model animal permanent environmental effects. A total of 152,145 test-day milk yields from 7,317 first lactations of Holstein cows belonging to herds located in the southeastern region of Brazil were analyzed. Test-day milk yields were divided into 44 weekly classes of days in milk. Contemporary groups were defined by herd-test-day comprising a total of 2,539 classes. The model included direct additive genetic, permanent environmental, and residual random effects. The following fixed effects were considered: contemporary group, age of cow at calving (linear and quadratic regressions), and the population average lactation curve modeled by fourth-order orthogonal Legendre polynomial. Additive genetic effects were modeled by random regression on orthogonal Legendre polynomials of days in milk, whereas permanent environmental effects were estimated using a stationary or nonstationary parametric correlation function combined with a variance function of different orders. The structure of residual variances was modeled using a step function containing 6 variance classes. The genetic parameter estimates obtained with the model using a stationary correlation function associated with a variance function to model permanent environmental effects were similar to those obtained with models employing orthogonal Legendre polynomials for the same effect. A model using a sixth-order polynomial for additive effects and a stationary parametric correlation function associated with a seventh-order variance function to model permanent environmental effects would be sufficient for data fitting. 3amilk yield 3amathematical models 3aHolstein 3adairy cows 3acorrelation 3adairy herds 3aadditive gene effects 3aequations 3avariance 3aenvironmental factors 3aanimal age 3acalving 3alactation duration 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEnvironment 2aFemale 2aLactationxgenetics 2aMilkxsecretion. 2aModels, Biological 2aPhenotype 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aRegression Analysis 3aBrazil1 aEl Faro, L.1 aCardoso, V.L.1 aMachado, P.F.1 aAlbuquerque, L.G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2009 Sept., v. 92, no. 9 p.4634-4640dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-21283Available from publisher's Web site  a20091114b20091204c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/10/27  aOther US 7aarticle02840naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245015600146300001600302500002300318520127500341650002201616650002201638650002701660650002001687650002001707650002101727650002301748650001901771650002001790650001201810650001101822650001001833650001201843650002201855650002301877650001501900650001501915650002801930650003001958650006701988650001802055650003402073653001102107700001402118700001602132700001502148773008202163852000902245939003302254946001102287655001202298IND9304363820221118224117.0930723e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930436382DNAL7 a85141542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandle, J.E.10aField performance and heavy metal concentrations of transgenic flue-cured tobacco expressing a mammalian metallothionein-beta-glucuronidase gene fusion  ap. 255-260.  aSummary in French.  aCadmium (Cd) is a nonessential heavy metal that can cause acute and chronic illness in humans. Some plant species such as tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) tend to accumulate high levels of Cd in leaf tissue, the consumed portion of the plant. Tissue-specific expression of mammalian metallothionein has been suggested as a means of partitioning Cd in nonconsumed portions of transgenic plants. The purpose of the experiment reported here was to evaluate Cd concentration and agronomic performance of four field-grown transgenic tobacco lines harbouring a metallothionein-beta-glucuronidase (MG) gene fusion driven by the constitutive 35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus. The trial was grown in a region of Canada known to have high background levels of Cd. The agronomic evaluation showed that some of the transgenic lines were equal to, while others performed more poorly than, the untransformed control for yield, days to flower, and leaf number. Gene expression measured by beta-glucuronidase activity showed that all of the transgenic lines expressed the MG gene in the upper portion of the plant. One line did not express the MG gene in the roots. Cd levels in the leaf tissue of transformed lines were not significantly different from the untransformed control. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3atransgenic plants 3agenetic transformation 3arecombinant DNA 3ametallothionein 3astructural genes 3abeta-glucuronidase 3areporter genes 3agene expression 3acadmium 3aleaves 3aroots 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxanalysis 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCricetinae 2aCricetulus 2aGlucuronidasexgenetics 2aMetallothioneinxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aPlants, Toxic 2aTobaccoxchemistryxgenetics. 0auptake1 aLabbe, H.1 aHattori, J.1 aMiki, B.L.0 tGenome.g1993 Apr., v. 36, no. 2 p.255-260wJournal:jnl41235x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03138naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072000900160072000900169100001600178245007400194300001800268500002400286500001500310520166000325650002401985650003002009650002002039650002302059650001302082650001302095650001902108650001202127650002102139650002302160650001102183650002102194650000902215650002002224650001302244650002402257653001302281700001602294700001602310773012102326852000902447856008102456930003302537945002502570946001302595655001202608IND4424832720221118224201.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442483272DNAL7 a197007292pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2009-20612doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX100 0aL2001 aLegarra, A.12aA relationship matrix including full pedigree and genomic information  ap. 4656-4663.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDense molecular markers are being used in genetic evaluation for parts of the population. This requires a two-step procedure where pseudo-data (for instance, daughter yield deviations) are computed from full records and pedigree data and later used for genomic evaluation. This results in bias and loss of information. One way to incorporate the genomic information into a full genetic evaluation is by modifying the numerator relationship matrix. A naive proposal is to substitute the relationships of genotyped animals with the genomic relationship matrix. However, this results in incoherencies because the genomic relationship matrix includes information on relationships among ancestors and descendants. In other words, using the pedigree-derived covariance between genotyped and ungenotyped individuals, with the pretense that genomic information does not exist, leads to inconsistencies. It is proposed to condition the genetic value of ungenotyped animals on the genetic value of genotyped animals via the selection index (e.g., pedigree information), and then use the genomic relationship matrix for the latter. This results in a joint distribution of genotyped and ungenotyped genetic values, with a pedigree-genomic relationship matrix H. In this matrix, genomic information is transmitted to the covariances among all ungenotyped individuals. The matrix is (semi)positive definite by construction, which is not the case for the naive approach. Numerical examples and alternative expressions are discussed. Matrix H is suitable for iteration on data algorithms that multiply a vector times a matrix, such as preconditioned conjugated gradients. 3amathematical models 3amarker-assisted selection 3aselection index 3agenetic background 3agenomics 3apedigree 3abreeding value 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgenetics 2aDatabases, Genetic 2aFemale 2aGenomexgenetics 2aMale 2aModels, Genetic 2aPedigree 2aRegression Analysis 0agenotype1 aAguilar, I.1 aMisztal, I.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2009 Sept., v. 92, no. 9 p.4656-4663dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-20613Available from publisher's Web site  a20091114b20091204c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/10/27  aOther US 7aarticle02628naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072001700146072001700163100001500180245007900195300001600274520131300290650001401603650001501617650001101632650001001643650002301653650001901676650001201695650000901707650001301716650001501729650002801744650001501772650002201787650001001809650002601819650001701845651001001862653001201872773009801884852000901982856008601991930003302077945002502110946001102135655001202146IND4399089320221118223810.0071217e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439908932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2007.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMoreno, G.10aResponse of understorey forage to multiple tree effects in Iberian dehesas  ap. 239-244.  aThe relative importance of tree effects (shade and changes in soil water and nutrients) on understorey forage production is analysed in three open oak woodlands of Central-Western Spain with different rainfall regimes: 452, 547 and 651 L m-2 of mean annual rainfall. Pasture production was measured in three different zones: under canopy shade, under artificial shade and on the open grassland in six replicate trees per site. In each site, tree and zone, the effect of fertilizer and water application was analysed following a factorial design in four 1-m2 plots (control, watered, fertilised, and watered + fertilised). Results showed a net positive effect of tree canopy on pasture yield of 19% higher beneath the canopy than on open grassland. Neither shade, nor watering, nor fertilisation alone explained this positive effect of trees. It must be explained by a combination of shade with increased soil nutrients and/or water content. The combination of watering and fertilisation produced a significantly higher pasture yield under artificial shade than under the tree canopy, indicating that trees can also have a detrimental effect on pasture yield. This can be better explained in terms of competition for underground resources than by light reduction, especially for soil water in more arid sites. 3awoodlands 3aunderstory 3aforage 3ashade 3asoil water content 3asoil fertility 3aQuercus 3arain 3apastures 3acrop yield 3adry matter accumulation 3agrasslands 3aplant competition 3atrees 3abotanical composition 3aplant growth 3aSpain 0adehesas0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2008 Jan., v. 123, no. 1-3 p.239-244x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2007.04.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20080318b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/02/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03115naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001800156245011200174300001600286500001500302520123500317650001801552650002101570650001101591650001801602650001601620650001601636650001501652650002001667650001601687650002001703650001801723650002001741650001101761650001401772650001801786650004801804650001201852650003001864650001301894650003001907650000901937650005201946650002901998650004302027650002202070650004302092653002002135653001802155700002002173700001702193700001702210700001902227773007302246852000902319856007802328930003302406945001302439946001302452655001202465IND2046611420221118224029.0950628e199504  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204661142DNAL7 a77922332pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07406262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbo-Norag, M.10aInfluence of a hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate and virginiamycin on aflatoxicosis in broiler chicks  ap. 626-632.  a2019-12-04  aMale broiler chicks were fed diets containing 0 or 3.5 mg aflatoxin (AF)/kg from 1 to 28 d of age. The diets were amended with either .5% hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS), 16.5 mg virginiamycin (VM)/kg of diet, or .5% HSCAS + 16.5 mg VM/kg of diet to determine the effects of these compounds during aflatoxicosis. When compared with controls (814 g), BW gains were significantly lower for broilers fed the AF (731 g) or AF + VM (716 g) diets. No differences were found between the BW gains of chicks fed diets without aflatoxin (814 g) and those of chicks fed AF + HSCAS (793 g) or AF + HSCAS + VM (803 g), indicating approximately 75% protection against decreased BW gain by HSCAS and 87% protection by the HSCAS + VM combination. Relative weights of the liver and kidney and creatine kinase activity were significantly increased and albumin, total protein, cholesterol, uric acid, and inorganic phosphorus concentrations were decreased in chicks fed the diet containing AF alone. With the exception of albumin, HSCAS was effective in restoring these values to control values. The findings of this research suggest that HSCAS and HSCAS + VM can counteract some of the toxic effects of AF in growing broiler chicks. 3avirginiamycin 3abroiler chickens 3aweight 3aserum albumin 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3aaflatoxins 3acreatine kinase 3acholesterol 3aliveweight gain 3aanimal organs 3aenzyme activity 3achicks 3asilicates 3aaflatoxicosis 2aAluminum Silicatesxadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aChickens 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aMale 2aMycotoxicosisxbloodxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aPoultry Diseasesxbloodxdrug therapy. 2aTreatment Outcome 2aVirginiamycinxadministration & dosage 0ablood chemistry 0ablood protein1 aEdrington, T.S.1 aKubena, L.F.1 aHarvey, R.B.1 aPhillips, T.D.0 tPoultry science.g1995 Apr., v. 74, no. 4 p.626-632x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07406263Available from publisher's Web site  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01586naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009800126300001600224520081000240650001401050650002201064650001501086650003501101650002401136773010501160852000901265939003301274946001301307655001201320IND9207784820221118220406.0921229e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920778482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolfe, M.L.10aGIS-assisted input data set development for the Finite Element Storm Hydrograph Model (FESHM)  ap. 221-227.  aA study was conducted to develop an automated proceedings to assist in the development of input data sets for the FESHM hydrologic model using the GRASS geographic information system. Shell scripts (executable sequences of commands in the UNIX operating system) were developed to overlay soils and land use maps to generate hydrologic response unit (HRU) maps and to compute the fractional areas of HRUs in overland flow elements. The automated procedures decreased the input data set development time significantly, by approximately 250% (from five to two hours) for a 122 ha (303 ac) watershed. The time savings on larger, more variable watersheds would be even greater.

Zymogram analysis further confirmed the action of pectinase on the latter. Optimum activity occurred at pH 5.0 and 50 °C and the reaction obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km and Vmax values of 3.72 mg mL-1 and 1.852 mmoles min-1 mg-1. Viscometry, GPC and HPLC analyses of the native guar galactomannan showed a molecular weight (Mw) of approximately 240 kDa with a galactose:mannose (G:M) ratio of 1:1.6, as revealed by GLC analysis, whereas, after enzymatic catalysis for 60 min, the major resultant product had a Mw of approximately 70 kDa with a G:M ratio of 1:2.8, respectively. The latter had a solubility of approximately 98% in water at ambient temperature (within 30 min) compared to approximately 60% for native galactomannan. IR spectral analysis revealed differences in the conformation of enzyme catalyzed guar galactomannan. The latter showed better gelling property with xanthan gum compared to native galactomannan. Use of non-specific pectinase for debranching-depolymerization of guar galactomannan is of commercial interest as modified galactomannans find multiple applications as functional food ingredients. 3agel strength 3adepolymerization 3agalactomannans 3apolygalacturonase 3aviscosity 3aguar gum 3aenzyme kinetics 0agelling properties1 aVishu Kumar, A.B.1 aTharanathan, R.N.1 aKoka, R.1 aGaonkar, A.K.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2005 Dec. 1, v. 62, no. 3 p.267-273x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/07/22  aNon-US 7aarticle01713naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245009100133300001600224520092100240650002301161650002101184650002601205653001201231653002001243700001601263773008101279852000901360939003301369945000801402946001301410655001201423991560789090742620221118220338.0850103e198306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE849252072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriffin, R.C.14aThe enhanced role of water conservation in the cost-benefit analysis of water projects  ap. 447-457.  aExtract: The concept of water conservation has increased in importance because of revisions in the rules and procedures for performing cost-benefit analyses of federal water projects. These revisions include a requirement that nonstructural and water conservation measures be incorporated into economic assessments of projects. Project analyses will now proceed as if water supplies were allocated "most effectively," that is, to their highest valued uses. A related requirement provides that the net benefits of any project should now be valued using willingness to pay measures. A specific cost-benefit methodology accommodating the revisions is constructed and discussed. Informational requirements for applying this methodology are identified. In addition to being consistent with federal mandates, this technique offers important advantages over the traditional "requirements" approach to water supply planning. 3awater conservation 3ademand functions 3acost benefit analysis 0apricing 0asupply function1 aStoll, J.R.0 tWater resources bulletin.g1983 June, v.

  1 aRomero-Bastida, C.A.10aPhysicochemical and microstructural characterization of films prepared by thermal and cold gelatinization from non-conventional sources of starches  ap. 235-244.  aEdible films were developed using different starch sources (banana, okenia and mango). Starch suspensions were cold gelatinized with NaOH or gelatinized by heat. Glycerol was used as plasticizer. Films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), water vapor permeability and mechanical analyses. Films prepared with thermal gelatinization showed homogeneous surfaces without pores or cracks compared with starch films made with cold gelatinization, and additionally, thermal gelatinization produced films that during storage, recrystalized as a B-type compared with the A-type X-ray diffraction pattern of the films elaborated with cold gelatinization. These differences had an important role in the thickness, barrier and mechanical properties. In general, films prepared with the thermal gelatinization method, showed better barrier and mechanical properties, important characteristics when choosing the preparation method of the films. In some parameters studied, the starch source had an important role in the properties of the films. Non-conventional sources can be used for film preparation with certain barrier and mechanical characteristics. 3aedible films 3aphysicochemical properties 3amicrostructure 3agelatinization 3aheat treatment 3athermal properties 3athickness 3atensile strength 3adeformation 0amango starch 0abanana starch 0aokenia starch1 aBello-Perez, L.A.1 aGarcia, M.A.1 aMartino, M.N.1 aSolorza-Feria, J.1 aZaritzky, N.E.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2005 May 6, v. 60, no. 2 p.235-244x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20080208b20080301c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/05/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03848naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100002500170245017500195300001600370500002400386520202400410650001102434650001602445650001502461650001702476650001502493650001402508650002002522650001202542650001302554650001302567650001302580650001602593650001902609650001902628650001502647650001302662650003202675653001902707653001602726653002802742653004702770653001502817700002102832700002202853700002202875700002102897700003702918773012102955852000903076856009203085930003303177945002503210946001103235655001203246IND4424793020140725000000.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442479302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-2995.2009.00477.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL8001 aKalchofner, Karin S.12aA study of cardiovascular function under controlled and spontaneous ventilation in isoflurane-medetomidine anaesthetized horses [Erratum: 2010 Jan., v. 37, no. 1, p. 86.]  ap. 426-435.  aIncludes references  aTo determine, in mildly hypercapnic horses under isoflurane-medetomidine balanced anaesthesia, whether there is a difference in cardiovascular function between spontaneous ventilation (SV) and intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). Prospective randomized clinical study. Sixty horses, undergoing elective surgical procedures under general anaesthesia: ASA classification I or II. Horses were sedated with medetomidine and anaesthesia was induced with ketamine and diazepam. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and a constant rate infusion of medetomidine. Horses were assigned to either SV or IPPV for the duration of anaesthesia. Horses in group IPPV were maintained mildly hypercapnic (arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂) 50-60 mmHg, 6.7-8 kPa). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained above 70 mmHg by an infusion of dobutamine administered to effect. Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (fR), arterial blood pressure and inspiratory and expiratory gases were monitored continuously. A bolus of ketamine was administered when horses showed nystagmus. Cardiac output was measured using lithium dilution. Arterial blood-gas analysis was performed regularly. Recovery time was noted and recovery quality scored. There were no differences between groups concerning age, weight, body position during anaesthesia and anaesthetic duration. Respiratory rate was significantly higher in group IPPV. Significantly more horses in group IPPV received supplemental ketamine. There were no other significant differences between groups. All horses recovered from anaesthesia without complications. There was no difference in cardiovascular function in horses undergoing elective surgery during isoflurane-medetomidine anaesthesia with SV in comparison with IPPV, provided the horses are maintained slightly hypercapnic. In horses with health status ASA I and II, cardiovascular function under general anaesthesia is equal with or without IPPV if the PaCO₂ is maintained at 50-60 mmHg. 3ahorses 3ahypercapnia 3aisoflurane 3amedetomidine 3aanesthesia 3abreathing 3aclinical trials 3asurgery 3aketamine 3adiazepam 3asedation 3ablood gases 3acarbon dioxide 3ablood pressure 3aheart rate 3areflexes 3apostoperative complications 0acardiovascular 0aventilation 0aspontaneous ventilation 0aintermittent positive pressure ventilation 0adobutamine1 aPicek, Stephanie1 aRinger, Simone K.1 aJackson, Michelle1 aHässig, Michael1 aBettschart-Wolfensberger, Regula0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2009 Sept., v. 36, no. 5 p.426-435dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2009.00477.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100224b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/10/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03733naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001800189245010400207300001600311500002400327500001500351520195500366650001402321650001502335650002202350650001102372650002402383650001602407650000902423650002602432650001502458650001302473650003702486650003002523650001202553650002302565650004702588650001102635653002702646653002402673653002102697653001002718653003002728653002402758653002502782700001702807700001602824773012102840852000902961856009202970930003303062945002503095946001103120655001203131IND4424793820221118220217.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442479382DNAL7 a197090532pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-2995.2009.00475.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL8001 aIff, Isabelle10aMeasurement of the puncture profile and extradural pressure of cattle during extradural anaesthesia  ap. 495-501.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo measure the pressure profile during caudal extradural puncture and subsequent extradural anaesthesia in cattle and to investigate the presence of extradural pressure waves. Prospective experimental study. Eleven cattle aged 4.1 ± 2.5 years (range 0.8 to 8.8 years), with a body weight of 613 ± 162 kg (range 302-840 kg). Caudal extradural puncture was performed. To measure the extradural pressure profile, the needle was connected to an electronic pressure transducer placed at the height of the base of the tail. The pressure profile was recorded for 3 minutes following extradural puncture. Lack of resistance to injection of saline was assessed. One minute and 10 minutes after extradural anaesthesia with procaine extradural pressure was recorded. Correct extradural needle placement was assessed by clinical response. Three minutes after extradural puncture the median pressure was -16 (range -25 to 25) mmHg. Pressure in the extradural space 1 minute after the lack of resistance, 3 seconds after injection, and 10 minutes after injection was -15 (-24 to 33) mmHg, 8 (-17 to 84) mmHg, and -7 (-25 to 27) mmHg respectively. Pressure waves were visible after puncture, after lack of resistance, 3 seconds and 10 minutes after injection, in 4, 6, 8 and 7 cattle respectively. Pressure after testing lack of resistance, after the injection of local anaesthetic, as well as at the end of the measurement, period was significantly higher than baseline. All cattle showed clinical signs indicative of successful extradural needle placement. Extradural pressure was sub-atmospheric in 82% of the animals. Pressure waves were not consistently present before or after extradural injection, which limits their usefulness to confirm correct extradural needle placement. Extradural pressures increase significantly after injection of local anaesthetic solution. However, the clinical significance of the increase in extradural pressures was not clear. 3aanalgesia 3aanesthesia 3alocal anesthetics 3acattle 3acerebrospinal fluid 3amethodology 3atail 3adrug delivery systems 3aanalgesics 3aprocaine 2aAnesthesia, Epiduralxveterinary 2aAnestheticsxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCerebrospinal Fluid Pressurexdrug effects 2aFemale 0aextradural anaesthesia 0aextradural pressure 0aspinal analgesia 0aspine 0aextradural pressure waves 0aextradural puncture 0aepidural anaesthesia1 aFranz, Sonja1 aMoens, Yves0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2009 Sept., v. 36, no. 5 p.495-501dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2009.00475.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091020b20091106c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/10/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03043naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245013400149300001600283500001500299520131900314650001701633650003201650650002301682650002601705650001001731650001201741650001301753650002301766650001401789650001701803650002101820650000901841650001201850650001101862650001201873650002401885650003301909650006701942650001102009650002802020650001002048650000902058650002102067650003602088650002202124650006802146653001402214653001802228653001402246700001402260773009902274852000902373930003302382945001302415946001302428655001202441IND2205424420221118220805.0000626e199910  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220542442DNAL7 a105843032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenugopal, K.J.10aVitellins and vitellogenins of Dysdercus koenigii (Heteroptera: Pyrrhocoridae)--identification, purification and temporal pattern  ap. 215-223.  a2019-12-05  aTwo vitellins, VtA and VtB, were purified from the eggs of Dysdercus koenigii by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. VtA and VtB have molecular weights of 290 and 260 kDa, respectively. Both Vts are glycolipoproteinaceous in nature. VtA is composed of three polypeptides of M(r) 116, 92 and 62 kDa while VtB contained an additional subunit of M(r) 40 kDa. All subunits except the 116-kDa subunit are glycolipopolypeptides. Polyclonal antibody raised against VtA (anti-VtA antibody) cross-reacted with VtB and also with vitellogenic haemolymph and ovaries and pre-vitellogenic fat bodies, but not with haemolymph from either adult male, fifth instar female, or pre-vitellogenic females demonstrating sex and stage specificity of the Vts. Immunoblots in the presence of anti-VtA revealed two proteins (of 290 and 260 kDa) in both vitellogenic haemolymph and pre-vitellogenic fat bodies that are recognised as D. koenigii Vgs. In newly emerged females, Vgs appeared on day 1 in fat bodies and on day 3 in haemolymph and ovaries. Vg concentration was maximum on day 2 in fat body, day 4 in haemolymph and day 7 in ovary. Although the biochemical and temporal characteristics of these proteins show similarity to some hemipterans, they are strikingly dissimilar with those of a very closely related species. 3apolypeptides 3aion exchange chromatography 3aDysdercus koenigii 3apolyclonal antibodies 3amales 3ainstars 3afat body 3agel chromatography 3ahemolymph 3avitellogenin 3amolecular weight 3aeggs 3afemales 3aadults 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, Gel 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aEgg Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aHeteropteraxphysiology 2aLarva 2aMale 2aMolecular Weight 2aOocytesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aOrgan Specificity 2aVitellogeninsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 0avitellins 0avitellogenins 0aHemiptera1 aKumar, D.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1999 Oct., v. 124B, no. 2 p.215-223x1096-49597nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle03735naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100001700178245010400195300001800299500002400317506007600341520155500417506003701972650001402009650001702023650001502040650002002055650002102075650001602096650002302112650002802135650001202163650002602175650002102201650000902222650002402231650001702255650001502272650001002287650004702297650002302344650002002367650001902387650003502406650004702441650001102488650001102499650003502510650001502545650002902560650002502589650000902614650003302623650002402656650001602680700001702696700001702713700001802730700002802748700002202776700002502798773010402823852000902927856007702936655001203013IND4422758620221207112613.0090703s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442275862DNAL7 a193898212pmid7 aPMC26997362pmcid7 a10.2337/dc09-02592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPak, Kyŏng.10aOxidative Stress and Insulin Resistance: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study  ap. 1302-1307.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: Although cumulative evidence suggests that increased oxidative stress may lead to insulin resistance in vivo or in vitro, community-based studies are scarce. This study examined the longitudinal relationships of oxidative stress biomarkers with the development of insulin resistance and whether these relationships were independent of obesity in nondiabetic young adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Biomarkers of oxidative stress (F₂-isoprostanes [F₂Isop] and oxidized LDL [oxLDL]), insulin resistance (the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]), and various fatness measures (BMI, waist circumference, and estimated percent fat) were obtained in a population-based observational study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) and its ancillary study (Young Adult Longitudinal Trends in Antioxidants) during 2000-2006. RESULTS: There were substantial increases in estimated mean HOMA-IR over time. OxLDL and F₂Isop showed little association with each other. Mean evolving HOMA-IR increased with increasing levels of oxidative stress markers (P < 0.001 for oxLDL and P = 0.06 for F₂Isop), measured in 2000-2001. After additional adjustment for adiposity, a positive association between oxLDL and HOMA-IR was strongly evident, whereas the association between F₂Isop and HOMA-IR was not. CONCLUSIONS: We observed positive associations between each of two oxidative stress markers and insulin resistance.

A typical curved row sideslope averaged about 14% less erosion than a row sideslope of uniform steepness. Different energy levels produced by different rainfall-simulator nozzles affected erosion rates approximately in direct proportion to the rain impact energy. The effect of rain intensity (I) on resulting erosion (E) changed with the applied energy level, as evidenced by a decrease for the coefficient a and an increase for the exponent b in E = aI(b) as energy level decreased. Runoff was affected most by rain intensity, some by rain energy, and little by slope shape. Results from this research also emphasize the importance of applying storms with the characteristics of natural rainfall when conducting erosion experiments. 3ainterrill erosion 3arunoff 3arain 0asimulation1 aHarmon, W.C.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1992 , v. 35, no. 4 p.1199-1203x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01502naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006100127300001800188520077300206650001100979650002000990650001301010650002401023653002601047653001601073773008001089852000901169939003301178946001301211655001201224IND9207792220221118220443.0921229e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920779222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaldas, F.P.10aExperimental high frequency dryer for granular materials  ap. 1275-1282.  aThis article reports on the results obtained with a high frequency (HF) experimental dryer, which included an electrode system, humidity cabinet, air flow supply, ancillary radiofrequency (RF) and electrical equipment, and a water-cooled, 38.5 MHz RF generator, capable of supplying a maximum of 6 kW output on the load.

To provide relevant information for silos containing alfalfa silage, 48 hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted. Both horizontal and vertical conductivities were measured at four values of void ratio and three values of moisture content. Logarithms of the horizontal and vertical conductivities varied nearly linearly with void ratio, and to a lesser extent with moisture content. At a void ratio of five and a moisture content of 68% the horizontal conductivity was about 16 times the vertical.

Two herbicides with contrasted properties: isoproturon, moderately hydrophobic (log Kow= 2.5), diflufenican, strongly hydrophobic (log Kow= 4.9), and isopropylaniline, a metabolite of isoproturon, were used to characterize the sorption and desorption properties of POM originating from soils under three different land uses: a cropped plot under conventional wheat/maize rotation, an adjacent 10-year-old grassed strip and a nearby 80-year-old oak/chestnut forest. Chemical structural composition information obtained from solid-state ¹³C CPMAS NMR and estimation of hydrophobicity from contact angle measurements were used to explain the different sorption capacities of POM according to their size and origins. Sorption of isoproturon and diflufenican increased with hydrophobicity of POM, which was greater in the forest soil. Aromaticity of POM was positively correlated to sorption coefficients (Koc). Desorption of the more hydrophobic compounds, diflufenican and isopropylaniline was weak for all POM fractions, regardless of their origin and size. On the other hand, desorption of isoproturon depended on land use and POM characteristics. The sorption capacities of POM were not only controlled by their chemical composition, but also by their size, due to a greater number of sorptive sites related to a greater surface area with decreasing particle-size. 3aCastanea 3aQuercus 3achemical composition 3acontact angle 3acorn 3acorrelation 3adesorption 3adiflufenican 3afilter strips 3aforest soils 3aforests 3ahydrophobicity 3aisoproturon 3aland use change 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparticulates 3asurface area 3awheat1 aMadrigal, I.1 aPreston, C.M.1 aChenu, C.1 aBarriuso, E.0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2008 Apr., v. 59, no. 2 p.178-189dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1351-07547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.00967.x 7aarticle02526naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245012400153300001600277500002400293520142200317650002601739650001101765650001201776650001501788650001001803650001701813650001701830650001501847650002201862650000901884650001601893650001701909700001401926700001701940700001501957773010901972852000902081856003802090655001202128IND4442509520221118215500.0100917s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444250952DNAL7 a10.1071/WF090662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaura-Mas, S.10aFuel loading and flammability in the Mediterranean Basin woody species with different post-fire regenerative strategies  ap. 783-794.  aIncludes references  aThe flammability and combustibility of plant communities are determined by species features related to growth-form, structure and physiology. In some ecosystems, such as the Mediterranean ones, these characteristics may contribute to the existence of fire-prone species. We measured several parameters associated with the flammability and fuel loading of dominant woody species with different post-fire regenerative strategies (seeders and non-seeders) in shrublands in the western Mediterranean Basin. Overall, seeder species show lower fuel load but are more prone to burning owing to a higher dead-to-live fuel ratio, live fine-fuel proportion and dead fine-fuel proportion. Moreover, they burst into flame at lower temperatures than non-seeders. In the Mediterranean Basin, most seeder species emerged mainly during the Quaternary, under a highly fluctuating Mediterranean climate and during recurrent fires. We propose that properties related to the combustibility and flammability of seeders may be the result of selective pressures associated with both fire and climate. These results suggest that ecosystems dominated by seeder species are more susceptible to fire risk than those dominated by non-seeder species in the Mediterranean Basin. Therefore, the proportion of these types of species resulting from previous fire or management history is likely to determine the characteristics of future fire events. 3aMediterranean climate 3abasins 3aburning 3aecosystems 3afires 3aflammability 3afuel loading 3aphysiology 3aplant communities 3arisk 3atemperature 3awoody plants1 aPaula, S.1 aPausas, J.G.1 aLloret, F.0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2010, v. 19, no. 6 p.783-794dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF09066 7aarticle03286naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245009500147300001600242520159900258650001901857650001601876650001301892650002001905650001601925650003301941650003401974650004802008650001002056650003902066650001702105650001202122650002002134650003002154650003502184650003502219650002602254650007502280650004502355650004602400650002502446650000902471653003102480700002102511700001902532700002602551773009902577852000902676930003302685945001302718946001302731655001202744IND2205749720221118215548.0000714e199912  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220574972DNAL7 a106653692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaperna, T.J.10aInfluence of dietary protein on insulin-like growth factor binding proteins in the chicken  ap. 417-421.  aWe determined the effect of dietary protein on the distribution of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins in chicken plasma. Three groups of male broilers (n = 6 per group) were fed (ad libitum) isocaloric diets containing 12, 21 or 30% dietary protein. Birds were fed respective diets beginning at 7 days of age and killed at 28 days. No differences were observed between adequate (21%) and high (30%) protein intakes for any parameters investigated (growth criteria, plasma levels of IGF-I, growth hormone or IGF-binding proteins). Feeding protein deficient diets (12%) resulted in a 34% decrease in body weight, 17% decrease in feed intake and a 39% increase in feed/gain ratio. IGF-binding proteins in plasma samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. Nitrocellulose blots were probed with [(125)I]chicken IGF-II. Four regions of binding activity corresponding to 70, 43, 30 and 24 kDa were observed in all samples. Birds consuming 12% dietary group protein had less than 50% of the 43-kDa binding activity of birds consuming 21 or 30% dietary protein. The 30-kDa binding activity was 42% lower in the 12% dietary protein group compared to birds consuming protein. In contrast, 70- and 24-kDa binding activities were not influenced by dietary protein. Chickens consuming 12% dietary protein had higher levels of growth hormone and lower levels of IGF-I than those consuming 21 or 30% dietary protein. These data indicate that in chickens, the circulating levels of at least two independent IGF-binding proteins are influenced by dietary protein. 3ablood proteins 3abody weight 3achickens 3adietary protein 3afeed intake 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3ainsulin-like growth factor II 3ainsulin-like growth factor binding proteins 3amales 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asomatotropin 2aAnimals 2aAutoradiography 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aDietary Proteinsxpharmacology 2aGrowth Hormonexblood 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteinsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixmetabolism 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor IIxmetabolism 2aIodine Radioisotopes 2aMale 0ainsulin-like growth factor1 aRosebrough, R.W.1 aMcMurtry, J.P.1 aVasilatos-Younken, R.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1999 Dec., v. 124B, no. 4 p.417-421x1096-49597nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle01341naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005000126300001600176500001500192520053700207650001700744650002400761650001200785650002000797653000900817653002200826700001500848700001700863773009200880852000900972939003300981946001301014655001201027IND9207788620221118215526.0921229e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920778862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeber, A.J.10aFacility for testing exhaust ventilation fans  ap. 599-605.  a2019-12-04  aA laboratory facility to test agricultural exhaust fans with capacities up to 3070 L/s (6500 cfm) was designed, constructed, and tested.

We used Drosophila melanogaster to test the hypothesis that urea loading would promote formation of isoaspartate (beta-carboxyl-linked aspartate), a common form of protein damage that occurs most readily in unstructured polypeptides and flexible regions of folded proteins. Ten populations of flies were tested; five control populations of urea-sensitive flies and five previously selected urea-tolerant populations. We measured the effects of urea consumption on levels of both isoaspartate and protein L-isoaspartate methyltransferase (PIMT), an enzyme believed to function in the repair or removal of isoaspartyl proteins. For both sets of populations, urea feeding for 6 days increased isoaspartyl levels by approximately 60%, supporting the idea that disruption of protein secondary and tertiary structures can accelerate the formation of isoaspartate in vivo. Urea feeding tended to increase PIMT activity in both control and urea-tolerant populations. There were no significant differences in PIMT activities or isoaspartyl levels between the control and urea-tolerant flies raised on normal or urea food. The latter findings indicate that urea tolerance evolved in the selected populations without any significant change in PIMT expression or activity. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aaspartic acid 3amethyltransferases 3apolypeptides 3aprotein content 3aprotein unfolding 3aproteins 3atissues 3aurea 2aAnimals 2aAspartic Acidxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aDrosophila melanogasterxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aInsect Proteinsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aIsomerism 2aLarvaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aProtein D-Aspartate-L-Isoaspartate Methyltransferase 2aProtein Methyltransferasesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSelection, Genetic 2aUreaxpharmacology 0aprotein unfolding1 aPierce, V.A.1 aAswad, D.W.1 aGibbs, A.G.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1999 Dec., v. 124B, no. 4 p.423-427x1096-49597nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02221naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001800163245007100181300001600252500002400268500001500292520091300307650002001220650001901240650002201259650001301281650001501294650001901309650002101328650001401349650002001363650002201383650001301405650002601418650002301444653001901467773011401486852000901600856008501609930003301694945002501727946001101752655001201763IND4424891620221118215918.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442489162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-009-9980-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aX5001 aChen, Chih-Yu10aPhotocatalytic Degradation of Azo Dye Reactive Orange 16 by TiO₂  ap. 335-342.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPhotocatalytic degradation of hydrolyzed reactive orange 16 (RO16) using titanium dioxide (TiO₂) was analyzed in our study. The effects of various parameters, such as photocatalyst amount, RO16 concentration, light intensity, and temperature on photocatalytic degradation were investigated. Decolorization of hydrolyzed RO16 resulted in an decreasing of toxicity (EC₅₀ = 76.54 ± 2.16). It was found that the decolorization efficiency was 87% after 20-min reaction and 100% after 80-min reaction. The total mineralization was 70% after 20 min and nearly 100% after 120 min, respectively. The results indicate that color degradation was faster than the decrease of total organic carbon. The photocatalytic degradation process was well described by first-order reaction. The final mineralization product was acetamide and the intermediate products were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. 3awater pollution 3amineralization 3areaction kinetics 3aazo dyes 3aphotolysis 3adecolorization 3atitanium dioxide 3acatalysts 3alight intensity 3awater temperature 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet radiation 3achemical structure 0aphotochemistry0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2009 Sept., v. 202, no. 1-4 p.335-342dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-009-9980-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01785naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245008700171300001800258500002400276520073300300650001201033650001601045650001701061650001601078650001301094650002601107650002001133650002801153650001601181700001701197700002001214773009801234852000901332856009401341655001201435IND4475051720221118215919.0131220s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447505172DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2003.tb07020.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, D.R.10aBrine Ingredients Alter the Immunoassay of Lactate Dehydrogenase Isozyme 5 in Beef  ap. 2072-2075.  aIncludes references  aGround beef Semimembranosus muscle was prepared in neutral phosphate buffer containing sodium chloride (0% to 3%) with and without 0.5% sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP).

Here, we found that the Drosophila Polycomb group gene super sex combs (sxc) encodes Ogt, the highly conserved glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to proteins in animals and plants. Genome-wide profiling in Drosophila revealed that GlcNAc-modified proteins are highly enriched at Polycomb response elements. Among different Polycomb group proteins, Polyhomeotic is glycosylated by Sxc/Ogt in vivo. sxc/Ogt-null mutants lacked O-linked GlcNAcylation and failed to maintain Polycomb transcriptional repression even though Polycomb group protein complexes were bound at their target sites. Polycomb repression appears to be a critical function of Sxc/Ogt in Drosophila and may be mediated by the glycosylation of Polyhomeotic. 3aDrosophila 3aN-acetylglucosamine 3aanimals 3agenes 3aglycosylation 3amutants 3aplant development 3aplants (botany) 3arepressor proteins 3aresponse elements 3atranscription (genetics)1 aOktaba, Katarzyna1 aMüller, Jürg.0 tScience.g2009 July 3, v. 325, no. 5936 p.93-96dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11697273Available from publisher's Web site  a20090703b20090801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01875naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245014600172300001800318500002400336520075500360650002701115650002901142650001701171650001901188650001301207650001301220650002001233650002001253700001901273700001601292700001601308773009801324852000901422856009401431655001201525IND4475051620221118215927.0131220s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447505162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2003.tb07019.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDel Campo, J.10aDetermination of the Most Bioactive Phenolic Compounds from Rosemary Against Listeria Monocytogenes: Influence of Concentration, pH, and NaCl  ap. 2066-2071.  aIncludes references  aThe anti-Listeria monocytogenes effects of 8 phenolic compounds, carnosol, carnosic acid, 12-methoxy carnosic, ferulic and caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, luteolin and luteolin-7-glucoside were evaluated with a Plackett and Burman design in mixtures mimicking the phenolic composition of rosemary extract without essential oils.

S8-S13.  aIncludes references  aThe SILVER locus has been mapped in the domestic cat, identifying a unique genomic location distinct from that of any known reported gene associated with silver or hypopigmentation in mammals. A demonstrated lack of linkage to SILV, the strong candidate gene for silver, led to the initiation of a genome scan utilizing 2 pedigrees segregating for silver coat color. Linkage mapping defined a genomic region for SILVER as a 3.3-Mb region, (95.87-99.21 Mb) on chromosome D2, (peak logarithm of the odds = 10.5, {theta} = 0), which displays conserved synteny to a genomic interval between 118.58 and 121.85 Mb on chromosome 10 in the human genome. In the domestic cat, mutations at the SILVER locus suppress the development of pigment in the hair, but in contrast to other mammalian silver variants, there is an apparently greater influence on the production of pheomelanin than eumelanin pigment. The mapping of a novel locus for SILVER offers much promise in identifying a gene that may help elucidate aspects of pheomelanogenesis, a pathway that has been very elusive, and illustrates the promise of the cat genome project in increasing our understanding of basic biological processes of general relevance for mammals. 3acats 3achromosome mapping 3acolor 3aeumelanin 3agenes 3aloci 3amutation 3apedigree1 aDavid, Victor A.1 aEizirik, Eduardo1 aRoelke, Melody E.1 aGhaffari, Helya1 aO'Brien, Stephen J.0 tJournal of heredity.g2009 July, v. 100, no. suppl_1 p.S8-S13dThe American Genetic Associationx0022-15037nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01791naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245010800171300001800279500002400297520075700321650002101078650001201099650001601111650001701127650001301144650002601157650001601183700001701199700001601216700002001232773009801252852000901350856009401359655001201453IND4475051820221118215916.0131220s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447505182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2003.tb07021.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, D.R.10aVerification of Cooking Endpoint Temperatures in Beef by Immunoassay of Lactate Dehydrogenase Isozyme 5  ap. 2076-2079.  aIncludes references  aGround beef Semimembranosus muscle was inoculated with Escherichia coli, and aliquots were left raw or cooked to 1 of 24 time/temperature combinations.

Immunologic analysis of LDH5 may be suitable for development into a rapid assay method for the verification in beef of cooking endpoint temperatures from 61 °C to 69 °C. 3aEscherichia coli 3acooking 3aground beef 3aimmunoassays 3aisozymes 3alactate dehydrogenase 3atemperature1 aKeeton, J.T.1 aAcuff, G.R.1 aProchaska, J.F.0 tJournal of food science.g2003 Aug., v. 68, no. 6 p.2076-2079dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2003.tb07021.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02481naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002200172245011100194300001600305500002400321500001500345520107500360650002001435650002401455650001801479650001001497650003101507650002601538650002101564650001901585650001901604650001901623650001501642651001001657653001501667700002001682700002001702773011401722852000901836856008501845930003301930945002501963946001101988655001201999IND4424891420221118215914.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442489142DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-009-9979-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aM300 0aP2001 aSharma, Naveen K.10aPredicting Phytoplankton Growth and Dynamics in Relation to Physico-chemical Characteristics of Water Body  ap. 325-333.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn recent times, frequency and severity of algal blooms has increased significantly. To control their expansion, it is essential to identify the factors responsible for blooming of waters. Nutrient over-enrichment (mainly due to anthropogenic activities) and environmental factors (including the climate change) are considered the major catalyst for onset, proliferation, and development of blooms. A eutrophic subtropical water reservoir (Durgakund Pond, Varanasi) was sampled for 2 years (2000-2002), and data were obtained on various physico-chemical factors such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, phosphorus (PO₄ ⁻ and other P forms), nitrogen (NO₃ ⁻, NO₂ ⁻, and NH⁺ ₄), chloride, iron, and phytoplankton biomass in terms of chlorophyll a, total protein, and carbohydrate content. Linear regression models that developed indicated that phosphorous, nitrogen, and iron had maximal impact on phytoplankton growth. Physical factors, though vital, had an indirect effect in facilitating the interaction among various nutrients and their availability. 3awater pollution 3amathematical models 3aphytoplankton 3aponds 3aphysicochemical properties 3aenvironmental factors 3amicrobial growth 3aeutrophication 3ahydrochemistry 3apollution load 3aprediction 3aIndia 0areservoirs1 aMohan, Devendra1 aRai, Ashwani K.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2009 Sept., v. 202, no. 1-4 p.325-333dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-009-9979-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01924naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001800143245006000161300001400221520091400235650000801149650000801157650002801165650001301193650001301206650001301219700002101232700001901253700002101272700002101293773012201314852000901436856008301445930003301528946001301561655001201574IND4422747320221118215922.0090703e20090703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442274732DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11745772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUra, Yasuyuki10aSelf-Assembling Sequence-Adaptive Peptide Nucleic Acids  ap. 73-77.  aSeveral classes of nucleic acid analogs have been reported, but no synthetic informational polymer has yet proven responsive to selection pressures under enzyme-free conditions. Here, we introduce an oligomer family that efficiently self-assembles by means of reversible covalent anchoring of nucleobase recognition units onto simple oligo-dipeptide backbones [thioester peptide nucleic acids (tPNAs)] and undergoes dynamic sequence modification in response to changing templates in solution. The oligomers specifically self-pair with complementary tPNA strands and cross-pair with RNA and DNA in Watson-Crick fashion. Thus, tPNA combines base-pairing interactions with the side-chain functionalities of typical peptides and proteins. These characteristics might prove advantageous for the design or selection of catalytic constructs or biomaterials that are capable of dynamic sequence repair and adaptation. 3aDNA 3aRNA 3abiocompatible materials 3apeptides 3apolymers 3aproteins1 aBeierle, John M.1 aLeman, Luke J.1 aOrgel, Leslie E.1 aGhadiri, M.

Such errors also arise in daily life, and research traces the tendency to do precisely the worst thing to ironic processes of mental control. These monitoring processes keep us watchful for errors of thought, speech, and action and enable us to avoid the worst thing in most situations, but they also increase the likelihood of such errors when we attempt to exert control under mental load (stress, time pressure, or distraction). Ironic errors in attention and memory occur with identifiable brain activity and prompt recurrent unwanted thoughts; attraction to forbidden desires; expression of objectionable social prejudices; production of movement errors; and rebounds of negative experiences such as anxiety, pain, and depression. Such ironies can be overcome when effective control strategies are deployed and mental load is minimized. 3aanxiety 3abrain 3amemory 3amonitoring 3apain 3aspeech0 tScience.g2009 July 3, v. 325, no. 5936 p.48-50dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11673463Available from publisher's Web site  a20090703b20090801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01780naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245005300172300001800225500002400243520073100267650001800998650001101016650001301027650002301040650001401063650001001077650001001087650001601097650002201113650002201135650001101157700001801168700001901186773009801205852000901303856009401312655001201406IND4475064820221118215500.0131224s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447506482DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2003.tb07033.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShogren, R.L.10aSensory Analysis of Whole Wheat/Soy Flour Breads  ap. 2141-2145.  aIncludes references  aBreads containing 0% to 40% defatted soy flour, 35% to 100% whole wheat flour, and 0% to 35% white bread flour were prepared.

A high-quality yeast was the most important factor in reducing the beany taste of the bread. Addition of ascorbic acid significantly increased yeasty flavor, and there was a strong inverse correlation between beany and sweet flavors.

The F17 fimbriae mediate binding to N-acetylglucosamine-containing receptors present on calf intestinal mucosal cells. These fimbriae consist of F17-A subunit peptides. Analysis of the F17 gene cluster indicated that at least the F17-A, F17-C, F17-D, and F17-G genes are indispensable to obtain adhesive F17 fimbriae (unpublished data). Genetic evidence is presented that the F17-G protein, a minor fimbrial component, is required for the binding of the F17 fimbriae to the intestinal villi. The F17-G gene was cloned and sequenced. An open reading frame of 1,032 bp encoding a polypeptide of 344 amino acids, starting with a signal sequence of 22 residues, was localized. The F17-G mutant strain produced F17 fimbriae which were morphologically identical to the fimbriae purified from strains which contained the intact F17 gene cluster. However, this F17-G mutant could no longer adhere to calf villi. The F17-G locus was shown to act in trans: transformation of the F17-G mutant strain, still expressing the genes F17-A, F17-C, and F17-D, with a vector expressing the F17-G gene restored the binding activity of this mutant strain. 3acalves 3acattle diseases 3aEscherichia coli 3agenes 3afimbriae 3abacterial proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3arestriction mapping 3areceptors 3aadhesion 3avilli 3aintestinal mucosa 3amutants 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3agenetic transformation 3agenetic complementation 2aAdhesins, Escherichia coli 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAntigens, Bacterialxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Adhesionxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aFimbriae Proteins 2aFimbriae, Bacterialxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0abinding 0acloning 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/m625031 aBertels, A.1 aSchlicker, C.1 aDeboeck, F.1 aCharlier, G.1 aPohl, P.1 aNorgren, M.1 aNormark, S.1 aMontagu, M. van.1 aGreve, H. de.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1991 June, v. 173, no. 11 p.3366-3373x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01491naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002000143245005100163300001400214520042400228650001600652650001400668650001700682650001900699700002300718700002200741700001800763700001900781700002000800700002300820700002600843773012200869852000900991856008301000930003301083946001301116655001201129IND4422747220221118215500.0090703e20090703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442274722DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11736842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrunner, Daniel12aA Coherent Single-Hole Spin in a Semiconductor  ap. 70-72.  aSemiconductors have uniquely attractive properties for electronics and photonics.

Because two different samples are hybridized on a single microarray, and several microarrays are usually needed in a given experiment, there are many possible ways to combine samples on different microarrays. The actual combination employed is commonly referred to as the 'hybridization design'. Different types of hybridization designs have been developed, all aimed at optimizing the experimental setup for the detection of differentially expressed genes while coping with technical noise. Here, we first provide an overview of the different classes of hybridization designs, discussing their advantages and limitations, and then we illustrate the current trends in the use of different hybridization design types in contemporary research. 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahybridization 3amicroarray technology1 aVergauwen, Lucia1 aLaukens, Kris1 aBlust, Ronny0 tTrends in biotechnology.g2009 July, v. 27, no. 7 p.406-414dElsevier Sciencex0167-77997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2009.03.0073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01725naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245011300170300001800283500002400301520078300325650001901108650001801127650001201145650001601157650001701173700002101190700001501211773009401226852000901320856009401329655001201423IND4475065720221118220332.0131224s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447506572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb09572.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmbrogi, A.10aFractional Extraction of Paprika using Supercritical Carbon Dioxide and On-line Determination of Carotenoids  ap. 3236-3241.  aIncludes references  aFractionation of pigments occurs over time during supercritical extraction of oil from natural matrices containing carotenoids.

The ratio of ß-carotene + free xanthophylls to total carotenoids in the recovered oleoresin diminished from nearly 50% (w/w) at the beginning down to 10% at the end of the extraction. Increased pressure improved kinetics of carotenoid extraction. 3acarbon dioxide 3afractionation 3apaprika 3atemperature 3axanthophylls1 aCardarelli, D.A.1 aEggers, R.0 tJournal of food science.g2002 , v. 67, no. 9 p.3236-3241dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb09572.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02787naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245013200151300001600283500002400299520141300323650001901736650001601755650000801771650001401779650001001793650001301803650002501816650001401841650001301855650001001868650001001878651001401888651001301902653001901915700002201934700002401956700001901980700002501999700001902024700002602043700002702069700002602096773009902122852000902221856007502230655001202305IND4422683120221118220108.0090703s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442268312DNAL7 a10.1071/AP090082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlen, Morag10aGanoderma and Amauroderma species associated with root-rot disease of Acacia mangium plantation trees in Indonesia and Malaysia  ap. 345-356.  aIncludes references  aFungal sporocarps and cultures associated with signs and symptoms of root-rot disease were collected from Acacia mangium and other tropical hardwood species. The collections were identified by either morphological characters and/or by phylogenetic analysis based on DNA sequences as Ganoderma philippii, G. mastoporum, G. aff. steyaertanum, G. australe and Amauroderma rugosum. Phylogenetic analysis unequivocally placed in the G. philippii clade four sequences amplified from A. mangium root and butt tissue showing clear signs of red root-rot disease (roots are covered by a red rhizomorphic skin). Whereas G. philippii was the most frequently encountered fungal species in A. mangium with red root-rot disease, this study indicates that other fungal species related to G. mastoporum may cause root-rot disease with very similar symptoms. An isolate (FRIM 138) that had caused red root-rot disease in artificial inoculations carried out before this study and was presumed to be G. philippii, is here determined to be closely related to G. mastoporum, G. cupreum and G. sinense. A Ganoderma species associated with a yellow-brown root-rot disease killing trees in an A. mangium plantation in Central Java, previously identified as G. lucidum, is shown by phylogenetic analysis to be closely related to G. steyaertanum, though some morphological characters vary from the original description of that species. 3aAcacia mangium 3aAmauroderma 3aDNA 3aGanoderma 3afungi 3ahardwood 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aroot rot 3aroots 3atrees 3aIndonesia 3aMalaysia 0apolypore fungi1 aBougher, Neale L.1 aFrancis, Anthony A.1 aNigg, Susan Q.1 aLee, S.

GMS and CMS are two types of male sterility system that currently employed in pepper breeding. Conversion from GMS to CMS will increase the male sterility proportion of female parent from 50 to 100%. In this study, segregation analysis of four male sterile mutants consisting of one CMS mutant (CA1) and three GMS mutants (GA1, GA3 and GA4) showed that each had single recessive gene inheritance. A modified complementation test was performed by replacing male sterile mutants with their maintainer line as male parent. The nuclear restorer gene for CMS was independent of all nuclear restorer genes for GMS and all nuclear restorer genes for GMS were independent each other. Further observation on CMS and GMS male sterility loci revealed that GA1 and GA3 had mutated in both nuclear restorer genes for CMS and GMS, while CA1 and GA4 each carried mutation in single male sterility system of nuclear restorer gene for CMS and GMS, respectively. Conversion from GMS to CMS in the case of lines carried mutations in both sterility systems required only S-type cytoplasm donor, while lines carried mutation in single nuclear restorer gene for GMS required not only S-type cytoplasm but also rf allele donors. The important finding is the broader function of maintainer line in certain male sterility system that can be used as a maintainer or restorer line for other male sterility systems. We also confirmed that line CC1 is the general restorer for both CMS and GMS systems. 3aCapsicum annuum 3asweet peppers 3aplant fertility 3aandroecium 3amutants 3agenetic complementation test 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3aselfing 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3arecessive genes 3ainheritance (genetics) 3amaintainer lines 3arestorer lines 3aloci 3acytoplasm 3aalleles 0agenic male sterility1 aChen, Shu-Yun 1 aWahyono, Andi 1 aKu, Hsin-Mei 0 tEuphytica.g2009 Oct., v. 169, no. 3 p.353-361dSpringer Netherlandsx0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-009-9968-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20091010b20091106c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/09/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02124naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245015100149300001800300300002300318520125900341650001601600650001701616650001201633650001801645700001801663773009801681852000901779939003301788946001301821655001201834IND8802828020221118215029.0880726e198806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880282802DNAL7 a163476642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHankinson, T.R.13aAn acidophilic and a neutrophilic Nitrobacter strain isolated from the numerically predominant nitrite-oxidizing population of an acid forest soil  ap. 1536-1540.  ap. 1536-1540. ill.  aTwo physiologically and serologically distinct strains of chemoautotrophic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria were isolated as numerically predominant members of the nitrite-oxidizer population of an undisturbed forest soil with a pH range of 4.3 to 5.2. One isolate responded as a neutrophile, characteristic of the family Nitrobacteraceae, and cross-reacted strongly with fluorescent antibody to Nitrobacter strain Engel. The second isolate responded as an acidophile in pure culture, demonstrated maximal nitrite oxidation activity at pH 5.5, and had a pH tolerance range of pH 4.1 to 7.2. Nitrite oxidase in whole cells of the acidophile sustained activity to at least pH 3.5. Cell morphology of both strains typified the genus Nitrobacter in all respects when cultured at pH 7. However, under more acidic conditions the acidophile tended to elongate and at times appeared to branch. These data provide the first evidence for the existence of an acidophilic chemoautotrophic nitrifying bacterium. Isolation of the neutrophilic Nitrobacter strain reported here complements the earlier isolation of a neutrophilic Nitrosospira strain to provide further evidence of a prominent acid-intolerant population of chemoautotrophic nitrifiers in this acid forest soil. 3aNitrobacter 3aforest soils 3asoil pH 3anitrification1 aSchmidt, E.L.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1988 June, v. 54, no. 6 p.1536-1540x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880726c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03383naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245011100132300001600243500002400259520212100283650003002404650001902434650001102453650002402464650003302488650001402521650001002535650001102545650001202556650001802568650000802586650001402594650002502608650002602633650002202659650002202681650000902703650001802712651001102730651001002741700001902751700001902770700001602789773009902805852000902904655001202913IND4463234320221118215258.0120516e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446323432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDı́az-Solis, H.12aA simple ecological sustainability simulator (SESS) for stocking rate management on semi-arid grazinglands  ap. 655-680.  aIncludes references  aWe constructed a simple simulation model (SESS) of the dynamics of forage growth and standing crop and cattle production to evaluate the ecological sustainability of management alternatives for extensive cow-calf production systems in northeastern México and south Texas. Equations were written to estimate annual net primary production based on range condition, annual precipitation, and soil characteristics typical of the region. Simulations were conducted for annual precipitation levels of 300, 500, and 700 mm to estimate total and green standing crop dynamics, cattle grazing efficiency, and range condition trend for different stocking rates. The model-estimated stocking rates to achieve stable or slight improvement of range condition for the three precipitation levels were close to 58, 15, and 6 ha per animal-unit-year (AUY), respectively. With the model parameterized for precipitation and soil characteristics combined with the stocking rates recommended by COTECOCA (1979. Coahuila. Tipos de vegetación, sitos de productividad forrajera y coeficientes de agostadero. Secretaria de Recursos Hidráulicos. Comisión Técnico Consultiva para la Determinación Regional de los Coeficientes de Agostadero. México), we conducted 20-year simulations for three groups of range sites of Coahuila, México (annual precipitation: 1: 270 mm, 2: 351 mm and 3: 467 mm). The trends of body condition score and range condition for years 5, 10, 15, and 20 were similar within each of the three groups. The stocking rates recommended by COTECOCA were too high for sustainability on range site groups with 270 and 351 mm annual precipitation. The simulated probabilities for pregnancy rates at different stocking rates for the three groups indicated that the stocking rates recommended by COTECOCA were too high to achieve pregnancy rates >80% in 8 out of 10 years with no supplement in the form of hay or concentrated feeds. Model simulations suggested that, in the absence of supplemental feed, ecological sustainability and acceptable livestock production could be achieved simultaneously at light stocking rates. 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abody condition 3acattle 3acow-calf operations 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aequations 3afeeds 3aforage 3agrazing 3agrazing lands 3ahay 3apregnancy 3aprimary productivity 3aproduction technology 3arange improvement 3asimulation models 3asoil 3astocking rate 3aMexico 3aTexas1 aKothmann, M.M.1 aHamilton, W.T.1 aGrant, W.E.0 tAgricultural systems.g2003 May, v. 76, no. 2 p.655-680dElsevier Science Ltdx0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245012500167300001400292500002400306520178100330650002002111650001302131650002102144650000902165650001302174650001302187650000902200650001802209650001202227650002302239650001602262650001202278650001802290650001302308650001502321651001602336651000902352651001302361651001102374651002602385700002302411700002002434773009302454852000902547856008502556655001202641IND4422455820221118213824.0090626s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442245582DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-009-9288-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Mark W.10aStorage and release of solutes from a subalpine seasonal snowpack: soil and stream water response, Niwot Ridge, Colorado  ap. 77-94.  aIncludes references  aMuch of the research on the chemistry of snow and surface waters of the western US, Europe, and Asia has been conducted in high-elevation catchments above treeline. Here we provide information on the solute content of the seasonal snowpack at the Soddie site on Niwot Ridge, Colorado, a subalpine site near treeline. We focus on the storage and release of both inorganic and organic solutes to the soils underneath the snowpack, and subsequent effects on the chemical and nutrient content of the underlying soil solution and the adjacent headwater stream. The concentration of inorganic nitrogen (N) stored in the seasonal snowpack at the Soddie site of about 11 μeq L⁻¹ was on the upper end of values reported for the northern hemisphere when compared to most areas of the Alps, Himalayas, and Tien Shan mountain ranges, but consistent with other reports of snowpacks in the Rocky Mountains. The storage of inorganic N in the snowpack at maximum accumulation averaged about 17 meq m⁻², or 170 eq ha⁻¹ (on the order of 2 kg-N ha⁻¹). Solutes were released from storage in the form of an ionic pulse, with a maximum concentration factor of about four. In contrast to the seasonal snowpack, the dominant form of N in the soil solution was dissolved organic N. Thus, soils underlying the seasonal snowpack appear to assimilate inorganic N released from storage in the snowpack and convert it to organic N. A two component mixing model suggests that the majority of streamflow was this year's snowmelt that had infiltrated the subsurface and undergone subsequent biological and geochemical reactions. The inorganic N in surface waters at the headwaters of Como creek were always near or below detection limits, suggesting that this area at treeline is still N-limited. 3adetection limit 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3asnowpack 3asoil 3asoil solution 3asolutes 3astatistical models 3astream flow 3astreams 3asurface water 3atreeline 3awatersheds 3aAlps region 3aAsia 3aColorado 3aEurope 3aRocky Mountain region1 aSeibold, Christine1 aChowanski, Kurt0 tBiogeochemistry.g2009 Aug., v. 95, no. 1 p.77-94dSpringer Netherlandsx0168-25637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-009-9288-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02632naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016600167300001600333520113900349592002801488650001401516650002601530650001701556650001501573650001401588650001301602650001501615650001201630650001001642650001101652650001001663650002101673650001101694650001201705650002201717650001001739651001101749700002301760700002801783700002301811700001901834700002401853700002801877773014301905856008102048852000902129655001202138IND60624960520221122053735.0181206e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062496052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10493-018-0323-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaia, Maerle O.10aDetection of Rickettsia spp. in ticks associated to wild mammals in Northeastern Brazil, with notes on an undetermined Ornithodoros sp. collected from marsupials  ap. 523-535.  aWe report tick infestations and rickettsial detection in ticks infesting free-living wild mammals (Monodelphis domestica, Tolypeutes tricinctus, Thrichomys inermis and Kerodon rupestris) captured in the Caatinga ecoregion of Bahia state, northeastern Brazil, during September to December 2016.

In some invasive species, rapid thermal acclimation (thermal hardening) may contribute to their success in occupying a wide range of climates. In this study, we investigated whether invasive house geckos from southeastern Australia show differing thermal hardening responses than individuals from the native range in Thailand. In the laboratory, we measured the basal heat tolerance (CTₘₐₓ) of the geckos and their heat hardening response after being subjected to the second thermal stress after 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 h. When geckos had recovered, we measured their basal cold tolerance (CTₘᵢₙ) and cold hardening response over the same time intervals. We then explored whether hardening responses differed between populations or among time intervals. We found that basal heat tolerances did not differ between populations, but geckos from Australia had lower cold tolerance than geckos from Thailand. The magnitude of the heat hardening was similar between populations, but the introduced geckos had a higher magnitude of cold hardening. The native geckos could maximize their cold tolerance capacity for only 0.6 °C, versus 0.9 °C for the introduced geckos. Also, geckos from Australia exhibited faster responses to thermal stress than did geckos from Thailand. Maximum thermal tolerances as a result of hardening responses peaked within three hours after thermal stress in Australian geckos (adjusted means = 44.0 °C for CTₘₐₓ and 9.9 °C for CTₘᵢₙ) and at five hours after thermal stress in Thailand geckos (adjusted means = 44.2 °C and 10.2 °C, respectively). The plasticity in the thermal hardening of the invasive gecko should enable it to survive rapid temperature fluctuations, especially winter cold snaps that occur in temperate regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHemidactylus 3aacclimation 3acold 3acold tolerance 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3ainvasive species 3aplasticity 3atemperature 3athermal stress 3aAustralia 3aThailand1 aDejtaradol, Ariya1 aWebb, Jonathan K.0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2021 Aug., v. 35, no. 4 p.631-641dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870055x0269-76537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-021-10116-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245009200168520142100260592002801681650001501709650002201724650001101746650001601757650000901773650001101782650001801793650001401811650001501825653001701840653002201857653002201879653003001901653002601931700001501957700001401972700001801986700001502004773009802019856008702117852000902204655001202213IND60729019920221121194054.0210926e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072901992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1166392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dongsen10aPlanning strategies of power-to-gas based on cooperative game and symbiosis cooperation  aPower-to-gas (PtG), as a promising technology proposed to store surplus renewable energy (RE), can hardly be commercialized for its low profitability. In this paper, three approaches are proposed in this paper to enhance the profitability of the PtG. Firstly, a cooperative union containing PtG is proposed and its sustainability analysis is undertaken based on Shapley Value method. Secondly, the PtG reaction heat, as an essential by-product of PtG which is valuable and therefore requires further study, is fully exploited for district heating in the operation of regional integrated energy system, which is solved by an improved SOCP method. Thirdly, a symbiosis cooperation mode is designed for wind power and PtG to enhance the benefit of PtG through optimization-based trading strategy, which is a MINLP model and solved by Big-M method. The results show that the daily profit of PtG is significantly increased with the cooperative union as the symbiosis cooperation mode can produce a 15.1% profit lift, meanwhile, exploitation of reaction heat can produce an 8.6% profit lift. Finally, our study reveals the conflict of interest between wind power and the cogeneration. A sensitivity study on the proportion of reaction heat used for district heating is performed to verify the mutually beneficial relation between PtG and the cogeneration. The findings of this paper can guide the commercialization of PtG.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acommercialization 3aenergy 3agame theory 3aheat 3amodels 3aprofitability 3asymbiosis 3awind power 0aPower-to-gas 0aCommercialization 0aCooperative union 0aReaction heat utilization 0aSymbiosis cooperation1 aGao, Ciwei1 aChen, Tao1 aGuo, Xiaoxuan1 aHan, Shuai0 tApplied energy.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 288 p.116639-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1166393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009200174300001600266520162100282592002801903596007301931650002702004650001402031650000902045650001502054650002202069651002102091700006002112773013302172856008202305852000902387655001202396IND60744233920221121032617.0210711e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074423392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-021-10117-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlanidin, Nicholas P.10aEcological predictors of lateral line asymmetry in stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)  ap. 609-629.  aThreespine stickleback exhibit a row of superficial neuromasts that project through the bony plates on each side of the trunk and which constitute an important sensory modality for detection of near-field water motion. Previously, we have shown that numbers of neuromasts on each structural plate are highly variable among populations. In the current paper, we expand this study to evaluate the extent of deviation from bilateral symmetry of 4344 fish in 57 natural and three transplant populations of threespine stickleback from lakes, streams and oceanic habitats of coastal British Columbia, predicting that neuromasts would be largely bilaterally symmetrical for optimal detection of external stimuli. In contrast, we found asymmetry in all populations, the greatest amount occurring on the anterior buttressing lateral plates and on populations with the fewest neuromasts. We found no consistent trends of signed (directional) asymmetry (SA) among the populations while relative absolute asymmetry (RAA) is lower in dystrophic (stained) habitats than in clearwater habitats (p < 0.001), except for fish with few neuromasts. Sexual dimorphism in RAA is also greater in dystrophic habitats (p < 0.001). Transplants from stained lakes to unstained ponds resulted in a 0.1% to 14% difference in RAA from the source population in less than 12 generations but varied in direction among experiments. Our data suggest a widespread tendency for populations exposed to reduced photic information to exhibit reduced asymmetry in their lateral line system, which can change rapidly in response to a new environment.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRC2354cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aasymmetry 3afish 3aneuromasts 3asexual dimorphism 3aBritish Columbia1 aReimchen, T.

University for hydrogen production and studies thermodynamically through energy and exergy approaches. The performance of the system is assessed based on the overall system energy and exergy efficiencies. The approach is further implemented to study the possible options for the highest amount of heat recovery within the cycle. Six different steam and heat recovery configurations are considered in this study based on the various streams recovered within the cycle, with each configuration having a different steam-to-copper molar ratio. The criteria for assessing the performance of each configuration are the exergy destruction of the heater-1 of the system, net thermal exergy, net heat input, and hydrolysis unit heat input, the temperature achieved after heat recovery and the overall system energy and exergy efficiencies. The temperature achieved after heat recovery and the steam-to-copper molar ratio are found to be the key aspects impacting the performance of each configuration. The overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the system without considering heat recovery are evaluated to be 6.8% and 10.4%, respectively while the highest energy and exergy efficiencies obtained after considering heat recovery are found to be 10.7% and 16.3% respectively which shows the influence of heat recovery on the performance of the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aclean energy 3aexergy 3aexhibitions 3aheat recovery 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrolysis 3alaboratories 3apaper 3asteam 3astreams 3atemperature 3aOntario 0aHydrogen 0aCopper-chlorine cycle 0aThermal management 0aEnergy 0aEfficiency1 aDincer, Ibrahim1 aGabriel, Kamiel0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2020 May 15, v. 212 p.112629-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1126293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245014300167300001600310520145300326592002801779650002201807650001301829650001901842650002001861650001701881650003501898650002001933650001101953650001301964650000901977650001801986650001502004650001602019651001002035653001602045653001802061653001902079653002002098653002502118700005502143700001402198700001802212700001402230700005002244700001502294700001602309773009802325856008702423852000902510655001202519IND60628489020221119101309.0190321e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062848902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.2142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Yaoyu10aAssessment of the potential and distribution of an energy crop at 1-km resolution from 2010 to 2100 in China – The case of sweet sorghum  ap. 395-407.  aBiofuel from energy crops will play an important role in supplying carbon-neutral fuel for the transport sector. However, there are large uncertainties regarding energy crop development and the energy crop potential and distribution need to be evaluated more comprehensively and systematically. In this study, we propose an integrated approach using the AquaCrop model, a geographic information system approach, and a scenario analysis and we conduct a land availability assessment with multiple factors including climate change, land use, soil, topography, regional crop management, and technological improvement to shed light on the potential production, distribution, and temporal-spatial variation of land suitable for sweet sorghum production in China. We evaluate a full range of spatial scales from 1-km resolution to a national assessment in four representative concentration pathways from 2010 to 2100. The results show that most provinces can plant sweet sorghum. The most suitable provinces for sweet sorghum production are Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, and Sichuan. The biofuel potential of sweet sorghum in high-slope farmland (0.30–0.73 EJ) and marginal land (11.98–15.18 EJ) can satisfy the biofuel goal in 2020 (0.12 EJ) and 2050 (6.70–8.60 EJ). Climate change and land-use change are critical factors influencing for the current implementation and long-term planning of energy crops in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abiofuels 3aclimate change 3acrop management 3aenergy crops 3ageographic information systems 3aland use change 3amodels 3aplanning 3asoil 3asweet sorghum 3atopography 3auncertainty 3aChina 0aEnergy crop 0aSweet sorghum 0aClimate change 0aLand use change 0aSpatial distribution1 aCai, Wenjia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4436-512X1 aWang, Can1 aHuang, Guorui1 aDing, Qun1 aYu, Le1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3115-20421 aLi, Haoran1 aJi, Duoying0 tApplied energy.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 239 p.395-407dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.2143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014500156300002000301520081600321592002801137650002201165650001501187650002001202650002601222650001101248650001001259650001201269650001201281650001301293650002301306650001601329700001901345700001901364700002001383700001401403700001601417700002001433700001801453700001901471773012401490856007401614852000901688655001201697IND60677172720221120071858.0191123e20191114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067717272DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra07301a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Ying10aUnusual adsorption behaviours and responsive structural dynamics via selective gate effects of an hourglass porous metal–organic framework  ap. 37222-37231.  aAn hourglass porous metal–organic framework, LIFM-12, constructed on a T-shaped flexible ligand with Cu²⁺ paddle-wheel clusters, shows temperature and gas adsorption responsive structural dynamics upon reversible molecular guest binding.

Legionella pneumophila infects lung macrophages and injects a plethora of different proteins into its host cell. Among these is DrrA/SidM, which catalyzes stable adenylylation of Rab1b, a regulator of endoplasmatic reticulum to Golgi trafficking, and thereby alters the function and interactions of this small GTPase. We employed time-resolved FTIR-spectroscopy to monitor the DrrA-catalyzed AMP-transfer to Tyr77 of Rab1b. A transient complex between DrrA, adenylylated Rab1b, and the pyrophosphate byproduct was resolved, allowing us to analyze the interactions at the active site. Combination of isotopic labeling and site-directed mutagenesis allowed us to derive the catalytic mechanism of DrrA from the FTIR difference spectra. DrrA shares crucial residues in the ATP-binding pocket with similar AMP-transferring enzymes such as glutamine synthetase adenylyltransferase or kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase, but provides the complete active site on a single subunit. We determined that Asp112 of DrrA functions as the catalytic base for deprotonation of Tyr77 of Rab1b to enable nucleophilic attack on the ATP. The study provides detailed understanding of the Legionella pneumophila protein DrrA and of AMP-transfer reactions in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLegionella pneumophila 3aactive sites 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abinding sites 3abyproducts 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ahumans 3aisotope labeling 3akanamycin 3amacrophages 3apathogens 3aproteins 3asite-directed mutagenesis1 aSchartner, Jonas1 aItzen, Aymelt1 aGoody, Roger

Owing to the rapid advances and boom in flexible/wearable electronics, CF materials endowed with excellent material properties have received great attention for building lightweight, cost-efficient and miniaturized flexible/wearable energy devices. Herein, a detailed overview of recent progress in wire/fiber-shaped flexible power devices made from micro-CFs is given for the first time. With an emphasis on electrode materials and architecture designs, CF-based wire/fiber energy devices including fiber nanogenerators, wire/fiber solar cells, wire-type batteries, fiber supercapacitors and integrated/hybrid fiber devices are discussed. Aiming to motivate more exciting applications, research directions and perspectives, efficient flexible wire-type CF energy devices are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acarbon fibers 3achemistry 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrodes 3aelectronics 3aenergy conversion 3asolar cells1 aZhang, Chaoqun1 aZhang, Shengsen1 aFang, Yueping1 aZou, Dechun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Feb. 7, v. 5, no. 6 p.2444-2459dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta07868k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04176naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001400169245014200183300001400325500001500339520168900354592002802043650002702071650002102098650001902119650001302138650001102151650002302162650001702185650001702202650003002219650003702249650001502286650002802301650001702329650001802346650001702364650002002381650001402401650001402415650003502429650001202464650005202476650002802528650003202556650004102588650003702629650001702666650001102683650003102694650004602725650000902771650000902780650005502789650002802844650005702872650004002929650002702969650003702996653001703033700001503050700001703065700001303082700001903095700001303114700001203127700001703139773011003156856008403266990002303350852000903373655001203382IND60097878020221118041739.0141104e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009787802DNAL7 a228244642pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.07.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ling10aNG, a novel PABA/NO-based oleanolic acid derivative, induces Human hepatoma cell apoptosis via a ROS/MAPK-dependent mitochondrial pathway  ap. 61-68.  a2019-12-06  aO²-(2,4-dinitro-5-{[2-(12-en-28-β–D- galactopyranosyl-oleanolate-3-yl) -oxy-2-oxoethyl]amino}phenyl)1-(N-hydroxyethylmethylamino)diazen-1-ium-1,2- diolate (NG), a novel PABA/NO-based derivative of oleanolic acid (OA), has been found to show potent antitumor activity both in vivo and in vitro. In the present study, NG could significantly reduce tumor volume and weight in the H22 solid tumor mouse model. Meanwhile, NG showed selective effects on the HepG2 cells including NO generation, cytotoxic effect and apoptosis, which were prevented by hemoglobin (NO scavenger). Moreover, NG-induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells was characteristic of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and enhanced Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio. The release of apoptotic inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c (Cyt c) from mitochondria and the activation of caspase-3, 9 were also detected, indicating that NG may induce apoptosis through a mitochondrial-mediated pathway. Simultaneously, NG treatment could lead to the activation of the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK but not ERK1/2. Treatment with SP600125 (an inhibitor of JNK) and SB203580 (an inhibitor of p38) prior to NG was found to reverse NG-induced apoptosis. Moreover, it was found that antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) blocked the induction of apoptosis and partly reversed the activation of JNK and p38, up-regulation of Bax, down-regulation of Bcl-2 and the activation of caspase-3 in NG-treated cells. Taking together, these findings suggest that NO can be released from NG, which induces apoptosis through a ROS/MAPK-mediated mitochondrial pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3amitochondrial membrane 3ahuman cell lines 3aoleanolic acid 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3amembrane potential 3anitric oxide 3acytotoxicity 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3ahemoglobin 3areactive oxygen species 3acytochrome c 3aanimal models 3amitochondria 3aphosphorylation 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 2a4-Aminobenzoic Acidxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aAzo Compoundsxpharmacology 2aCarcinoma, Hepatocellularxpathology 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aHep G2 Cells 2aHumans 2aLiver Neoplasmsxpathology 2aMAP Kinase Signaling Systemxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMice 2aMitochondriaxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aNitric Oxidexchemistry 2aOleanolic Acidxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSaponinsxpharmacology 2aXenograft Model Antitumor Assays 0aantioxidants1 aFu, Junjie1 aLi, Tingting1 aCui, Ran1 aLing, Jingjing1 aYu, Xing1 aJi, Hui1 aZhang, Yihua0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 691, no. 1-3 p.61-68dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.07.0313Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013300168300001600301520109500317592002801412650003001440650001801470650002101488650002501509650001601534650004101550650001801591650001801609650001801627650001601645650001501661650001701676650001501693650001901708700002501727700002101752700002001773773012801793856008201921852000902003655001202012IND60593528920221122024432.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059352892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-017-1326-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuzanskiy, Roman10aMetabolomic and physiological changes of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlorophyceae, Chlorophyta) during batch culture development  ap. 803-818.  aDuring mixotrophic batch culturing, the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii goes through S-shaped growth kinetics and cells consistently transit from division to death. Photosynthesis and respiration had two simultaneous maxima at the first half of the exponential growth phase and at the border of the stationary phase. GC-MS analysis detected about 300 compounds of which about 100 were identified. Differences in metabolite profiles were observed between cells sampled at different time points of the growth curve. Several data mining methods clearly indicated that metabolomes tended to group together in a time-dependent manner. Clustering analysis revealed three major groups of metabolites varied in concentration dynamic. The alterations in lipophilic compounds and carbohydrates took place even within the same phase of culture growth, which indicated complex rearrangements in cell biochemistry and physiology. Special attention was paid to alterations in the ratios between metabolite groups. The most significant ratio changes were discovered for pools of amino and fatty acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3acarbohydrates 3acluster analysis 3adevelopmental stages 3afatty acids 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agrowth curves 3agrowth models 3alipophilicity 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3amicroalgae 3aphotosynthesis1 aTarakhovskaya, Elena1 aShavarda, Alexey1 aShishova, Maria0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2018 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.803-818dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-017-1326-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245005200172300001500224520105100239592002801290650001701318650001901335650001001354650000901364650002201373650002201395650001501417650001401432650000701446650003501453650002101488650002601509700001801535700002001553700002701573700002101600700003501621700002301656773008901679852000901768856008101777930003301858946001101891655001201902IND4415076620221122061903.0160903e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441507662DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-008-0861-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatyanarayana Raju, T.12aA Stability-Indicating LC Method for Rimonabant  ap. 97-102.  aA simple, inexpensive and rapid isocratic LC method has been developed for the quantative determination of Rimonabant, an anti-obesity drug. The method can also be employed for the determination of Rimonabant and its impurities in the bulk drug. Degradation studies were performed on the bulk drug by heating to 60 °C, exposure to UV light at 254 nm, acid (0.5 N hydrochloric acid), base (0.5 N sodium hydroxide) and aqueous hydrolysis and oxidation with 3.0% v/v hydrogen peroxide. Considerable degradation was observed under oxidation conditions. Good resolution between the peaks corresponding to impurities produced during synthesis, degradation products and the analyte was achieved on a Phenomenex Gemini C18 LC column using a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of aqueous potassium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 3.0) and acetonitrile. The degradation samples were assayed against the reference standard of Rimonabant and the mass balance in each case was close to 99.5%.

When evaluated as a binder-free anode in Li-ion batteries, the as-obtained MoO₂@HPCNFs film exhibits excellent capacity retention with high reversible capacity (≥1055 mA h g⁻¹ at 100 mA g⁻¹) and good rate capability (425 mA h g⁻¹ at 2000 mA g⁻¹), which is much superior to most of the previously reported MoO₂-based materials. The synergistic effect of uniformly dispersed ultrasmall MoO₂ nanoparticles and a three-dimensionally hierarchical porous conductive network constructed by HPCNFs effectively improve the utilization rate of active materials, enhance the transport of both electrons and Li⁺ ions, facilitate the electrolyte penetration, and promote the Li⁺ storage kinetics and stability, thus leading to a greatly enhanced electrochemical performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon nanofibers 3aelectrochemistry 3aheat treatment 3alithium 3asynergism1 aGao, Guojun1 aWu, Zhipeng1 aXiang, Jun1 aLi, Xiaoqiang1 aGuan, Guangguang1 aZhang, Kaiyin0 tRSC advances.g2019 Nov. 18, v. 9, no. 64 p.37556-37561dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra07307h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245010300210300001800313506007600331520161400407592002802021506003702049650000802086650001802094650002202112650001602134650002402150650001702174650001302191650001202204653001602216653002202232653001702254653002302271653001202294700002002306700001902326773019102345856007902536852000902615655001202624IND60230454420221207115118.0150614e20150526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023045442DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14236821122doi7 aPMC44504072pmcid7 a259413752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnjiko, Rosemary M.10aSingle-cell mass spectrometry reveals small molecules that affect cell fates in the 16-cell embryo  ap. 6545-6550.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSpatial and temporal changes in molecular expression are essential to embryonic development, and their characterization is critical to understand mechanisms by which cells acquire different phenotypes. Although technological advances have made it possible to quantify expression of large molecules during embryogenesis, little information is available on metabolites, the ultimate indicator of physiological activity of the cell. Here, we demonstrate that single-cell capillary electrophoresis-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is able to test whether differential expression of the genome translates to the domain of metabolites between single embryonic cells. Dissection of three different cell types with distinct tissue fates from 16-cell embryos of the South African clawed frog ( Xenopus laevis ) and microextraction of their metabolomes enabled the identification of 40 metabolites that anchored interconnected central metabolic networks. Relative quantitation revealed that several metabolites were differentially active between the cell types in the wild-type, unperturbed embryos. Altering postfertilization cytoplasmic movements that perturb dorsal development confirmed that these three cells have characteristic small-molecular activity already at cleavage stages as a result of cell type and not differences in pigmentation, yolk content, cell size, or position in the embryo. Changing the metabolite concentration caused changes in cell movements at gastrulation that also altered the tissue fates of these cells, demonstrating that the metabolome affects cell phenotypes in the embryo.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aembryogenesis 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3aphysiological state 3apigmentation 3aproteins 3atissues 0asingle cell 0amass spectrometry 0ametabolomics 0aembryo development 0aXenopus1 aMoody, Sally A.1 aNemes, Péter,0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 May 26, v. 112, no. 21 p.6545-6550dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14236821123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245010500159300001400264520115400278592002801432650001501460650001601475650002001491650003501511650001401546650001201560650001201572650004101584650001101625650002301636650001301659650001501672650001301687650001201700651001001712700001701722700001801739700001901757700001601776773008801792852000901880856008101889930003301970946001102003655001202014IND4415076020221122061915.0160903e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441507602DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-008-0852-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ying12aA Pretreatment Method for GC–MS Determination of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Mollusk Tissues  ap. 65-71.  aAutomatic soxhlet extraction followed by silica gel cartridge cleanup process was developed as a pretreatment method for GC–MS determination of seven endocrine disrupting chemicals in mollusk tissues. Operation parameters including extraction time, adsorption flow rate and elution flow rate were optimized as 140 min, 2 mL min⁻¹ and 2 mL min⁻¹, respectively. Thirty percent dichloromethane in n-hexane and 70% dichloromethane in n-hexane were used as elution solvents in turn. Recovery rates were 93.7, 91.7, 84.5, 83.3, 88.4, 81.2, and 79.7% for nonylphenols (NPs), bisphenol A (BPA), 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), estrone (E1), 17α-estradiol (17α-E2), 17β-estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3), respectively. Acceptable relative standard derivations ranged from 8.5 to 12.1%. Method detection limits ranged from 0.27 to 0.68 ng g⁻¹ dry weight (dw), and quantitative detection limits ranged from 0.62 to 1.26 ng g⁻¹ dw. The method was successfully applied to five mollusk species in Dapeng Bay of China to verify its practicability, and NPs, BPA, EE2, E1 and 17α-E2 were detected in the range from 1.6 to 131.5 ng g⁻¹ dw.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abisphenol A 3adetection limit 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aestradiol 3aestriol 3aestrone 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahexane 3amethylene chloride 3amolluscs 3asilica gel 3asolvents 3atissues 3aChina1 aGuan, Yuntao1 aMizuno, Tadao1 aTsuno, Hiroshi1 aZhu, Wapeng0 tChromatographia.g2009 Jan., v. 69, no. 1-2 p.65-71dVieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-008-0852-73Available from publisher's site  a20090120b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02371naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245018500171300001600356520068400372592002801056650002801084650002101112650002101133650001501154650003301169650001901202650002201221650002101243650001301264653001301277653000701290653000801297653000901305653001401314653001201328653002201340653003401362653001701396653003101413700002201444700001901466700002001485700002201505700002301527700002301550700002401573700001901597773012201616856008201738852000901820655001201829IND60533064820221120174718.0160728e20140926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053306482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.08.1032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsukagoshi, Hikaru14aThe GH26 β-mannanase RsMan26H from a symbiotic protist of the termite Reticulitermes speratus is an endo-processive mannobiohydrolase: Heterologous expression and characterization  ap. 520-525.  aSymbiotic protists in the gut of termites are prominent natural resources for enzymes involved in lignocellulose degradation.

However, iron may also harm cells by catalyzing the generation of free radicals and promoting oxidative stress. Acquisition, transport, utilization and storage of iron are tightly controlled to meet physiological needs and prevent excessive accumulation of the metal within cells. Plasma transferrin has been known for years as a central player in iron metabolism, assigned to circulate iron in a soluble, non-toxic form and deliver it to the erythron and other tissues. Recent data uncovered an additional role of transferrin as an upstream regulator of hepcidin, a liver-derived peptide hormone that controls systemic iron traffic. SCOPE OF REVIEW: Here, we review basic features of iron metabolism, highlighting the function of transferrin in iron transport and cellular iron uptake. We further discuss the role of hepcidin as an orchestrator of systemic iron homeostasis, and the mechanisms underlying hepcidin regulation in response to various physiological cues. Emphasis is given on the role of transferrin on iron-dependent hepcidin regulation. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Transferrin exerts a crucial function in the maintenance of systemic iron homeostasis as component of a plasma iron sensing system that modulates hepcidin expression. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Proper expression of transferrin and hepcidin are essential for health, and disruption of their regulatory circuits is associated with iron-related disorders.

This coelomic fluid contains a complex mixture of small-molecule metabolites, including aromatic metabolites which are known to be species-specific, yet their actual identities remain unknown. We have aimed to characterize selected high-concentration coelomic fluid metabolites. The major aromatic compound in Eisenia veneta coelomic fluid is the rare metabolite α-nicotinamide riboside; and the major aromatic compound for Eisenia fetida is closely related to the (already characterized) metabolite of Eisenia andrei, which consists of two aromatic quinazoline-2,4-dione ring structures linked by N-acetylspermine. The biological function(s) of these metabolites in earthworms is unknown, but we hypothesize that they represent remnants of larger molecules, possibly bacterial in origin, that are recalcitrant to metabolism by earthworm enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEisenia andrei 3aEisenia fetida 3aearthworms 3aenzymes 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 0aEarthworms 0aCoelomic fluid 0aMetabolites 0aRiboflavin1 aWyatt, Morgan A.1 aLiebeke, Manuel1 aSoutham, Andrew D.1 aViant, Mark R.1 aBundy, Jacob G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1164-84650 tEuropean journal of soil biology.g2017 Jan.,  Feb., v. 78 p.17-19dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl597945x1164-55637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2016.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015100159300002000310520076000330592002801090650002401118650001401142650001401156650002101170650002401191650000901215650001201224650001301236650001301249650001901262650002201281650001101303650001601314650002101330650002101351650001601372700001401388700001601402700001901418700001701437773012401454856007401578852000901652655001201661IND60666954720221118123229.0190919e20141027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066695472DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra10885j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chunfeng10aSimple and green synthesis of nitrogen-, sulfur-, and phosphorus-co-doped carbon dots with tunable luminescence properties and sensing application  ap. 54060-54065.  aA simple and green approach to prepare water-soluble, nitrogen-, sulfur-, and phosphorus-co-doped carbon dots (N/S/P-CDs) by one step hydrothermal treatment of cucumber juice is reported. The resultant N/S/P-CDs possess a uniform morphology, a size of less than 10 nm, plentiful O and N functional groups as well as a limited amount of P and S functional groups, and exhibit good luminescence stability, high resistance to photobleaching, high solubility, and excitation-dependent emission behavior. It was also found that a higher reaction temperature favors the formation of N/S/P-CDs with smaller size and longer wavelength of photoluminescence emissions. Moreover, the N/S/P-CDs can be applied as a fluorescent probe for the detection of Hg²⁺ ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon quantum dots 3acucumbers 3aemissions 3afluorescent dyes 3ahot water treatment 3aions 3amercury 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3aphotobleaching 3aphotoluminescence 3asulfur 3atemperature 3avegetable juices 3awater solubility 3awavelengths1 aSun, Dong1 aZhuo, Kelei1 aZhang, Hucheng1 aWang, Jianji0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 27, v. 4, no. 96 p.54060-54065dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra10885j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245019800168520182800366592002802194650002002222650001502242650002102257650001902278650002002297650001702317650001502334650005002349650002402399653002202423653002602445653001902471653001702490653002102507700005202528700005302580700005802633700005902691700001402750700002102764700002002785773011102805856008602916852000903002655001203011IND60764054120221119113312.0220621e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076405412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2022.1231322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiapikos, T.10aQuantitative structure retention relationship (QSRR) modelling for Analytes’ retention prediction in LC-HRMS by applying different Machine Learning algorithms and evaluating their performance  aIn metabolomics, retention prediction methods have been developed based on the structural and physicochemical characteristics of analytes. Such methods employ regression models, harnessing machine learning algorithms mapping experimentally derived retention time (tR) analytes with various structural and physicochemical descriptors, known as Quantitative Structure Retention Relationships (QSRR) models. In the present study, QSRR models have been developed by applying four Machine Learning regression algorithms, i.e. Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRidgeR), Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression (XGBR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) using both linear and non-linear kernels, all tested and compared for their retention prediction ability on experimentally derived and on publicly available chromatographic data, using Molecular Descriptors to describe the physical, chemical or structural properties of molecules. Various configurations of the available datasets, in terms of the highly-correlated features levels (defined as the maximum absolute value of the Pearson’s correlation coefficient calculated between any pair of features) they contained, were analyzed in parallel. This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, of the effect of collinearity on the performance of QSRR predictive models. In the vast majority of cases studied there was no statistically significant difference in the performance of the generated QSRR predictive models among the specified dataset configurations, indicative of the ability of the selected regression algorithms to effectively handle collinearity. In terms of the individual performance of the selected regression algorithms, no pattern was found where one algorithm (or class of algorithms) stood out significantly relative to the others among the study datasets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aalgorithms 3achemical species 3achromatography 3adata collection 3ametabolomics 3aprediction 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3aregression analysis 0aMass spectrometry 0aLiquid chromatography 0aRetention time 0aCollinearity 0aMachine learning1 aZisi, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0223-91301 aKodra, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8824-55091 aKademoglou, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9685-89491 aDiamantidou, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1835-13461 aBegou, O.1 aPappa-Louisi, A.1 aTheodoridis, G.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 1191 p.123132-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2022.1231323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008600170506011700256506007600373520144400449592002801893506003701921653002101958653002101979653003702000653003402037653003102071653001902102653002002121700002202141700002202163773009202185856008502277852000902362655001202371IND60764098720221207112148.0220706e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076409872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cartre.2022.1001562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlderete, Bruno10aCharacterization and electrical analysis of carbon-based solid lubricant coatings  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe use of electrical devices has skyrocketed over the past decades, increasing the demand for electrical connectors worldwide. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to produce more reliable, energy and material efficient, and durable electrical contact material systems; particularly in low-redundancy systems, such as in passenger vehicles. This work analyzes the potential use of carbon nanoparticle coatings applied via electrophoretic deposition over copper substrates to reduce wear, require lower insertion forces, and to protect the connectors from atmospheric conditions, while reducing the gain on the overall resistance of the system. Four carbon nanoparticles were considered due to their well-known solid-lubricating capabilities, namely: graphite flakes, graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, and carbon nanohorns. Through a comprehensive characterization of the coatings, aspects like coating topography, compactness, thickness, elasticity, and electrical contact resistance were analyzed. Carbon nanotubes and nanohorns proved to have the highest potential. In addition to their previously documented outstanding solid-lubricity and environmental protection - after chemical modification of the coatings’ surfaces - these nanoparticles showed low resistance values for loads above 4 N, i.e., below 400 mΩ. Moreover, the coatings produced were thin and homogeneous, with adequate mechanical stability, and elastic behavior.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 0aCarbon nanohorns 0aCarbon nanotubes 0aElectrical connector lubrication 0aElectrical contact resistance 0aElectrophoretic deposition 0aGraphene oxide 0aGraphite flakes1 aMücklich, Frank,1 aSuarez, Sebastian0 tCarbon trends.g2022 Apr., v. 7 p.100156-dElsevier LtdwJournal:27699x2667-05697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cartre.2022.1001563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010400163300001400267520126100281592002801542650001601570650001501586650001101601650000901612650001901621650001401640650002401654653001801678653001501696653001201711653001501723653002001738653002401758700001601782700001601798700001401814773010201828856008401930852000902014655001202023IND60599082420221120043213.0180702e20141008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059908242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2014.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, M.10aEngineering risk mitigation measures for the landslide dams induced by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake  ap. 68-84.  aMore than 257 sizable landslide dams were induced by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, which required timely risk mitigation measures. This paper aims to summarize the engineering measures taken to mitigate the landslide-dam risks; provide a method for optimal design of spillways to minimize the risks; and quantitatively evaluate practical options for spillway design with a physically-based dam breach model. The engineering measures taken to mitigate the risks of 37 highly hazardous landslide dams induced by the Wenchuan earthquake are summarized. An optimization method is proposed and applied to the spillway design for the Tangjiashan landslide dam, which is the largest one caused by the Wenchuan earthquake. It is found that the peak outflow rate could be reduced from the recorded 6500m³/s to 2900m³/s using the optimal design. A spillway with a shallow and broad cross section is suitable for low-erodibility dams, while a spillway with a deep and narrow cross section is suitable for high-erodibility dams. A spillway with a large longitudinal gradient is beneficial for high-erodibility dams with large dam widths and gentle downstream dam slopes. A spillway close to one bank can reduce the peak outflow rate if the bank is erosion resistant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aearthquakes 3alandslides 3amodels 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3aspillways 3asystem optimization 0aLandslide dam 0aDam breach 0aErosion 0aLandslides 0aRisk assessment 0aWenchuan earthquake1 aZhang, L.M.1 aChang, D.S.1 aShi, Z.M.0 tEngineering geology.g2014 Oct. 08, v. 180 p.68-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2014.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014500166300001600311520144200327592002801769650004401797650001201841650002201853650002201875650001201897650001101909650000901920650002201929650001901951650003401970650001602004650002202020650002102042650001002063650001602073650000902089700001602098700001602114700001702130700002002147773011902167856008202286852000902368655001202377IND60624958120221121045847.0191115e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062495812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-018-1768-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoqian10aEvaluation of ultrasonic-assisted dyeing properties of fast-growing poplar wood treated by reactive dye based on grey system theory analysis  ap. 861-871.  aUltrasonic-assisted dyeing as a novel and eco-friendly method was utilized to improve decorative value of fast-growing tree species. The effects of ultrasonic-assisted dyeing parameters (e.g., temperature, dye concentration, ultrasonic power, dipping time, dyeing assistant and dye-fixing agent) on the properties of wood were investigated, and the parameters were optimized. Moreover, the main factors mentioned above were determined with grey system theory analysis. Analyses of chemical structure, thermostability, crystallinity, and microscopic morphologies were conducted using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. Results showed that dye uptake and K/S were influenced by the parameters in the following order: dye concentration > dye-fixing agent > dyeing assistant > dipping time > ultrasonic power > temperature. FTIR indicated that an ether bond was formed between the wood component and the reactive dye. TG and XRD demonstrated that the thermal stability and crystallinity of ultrasonic-assisted dyed wood were both improved. SEM revealed that dye molecules diffused into the cell cavity, wood vessel, aperture, and part of the wood microstructure such as pit membrane, which was mechanically damaged after the ultrasonic-assisted dyeing treatment and created new fluid channels for the dye.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPopulus 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystal structure 3adipping 3adyeing 3adyes 3amechanical damage 3amicrostructure 3ascanning electron microscopes 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3atrees 3aultrasonics 3awood1 aYu, Zhiming1 aZhang, Yang1 aQi, Chusheng1 aChang, Wen-lung0 tJournal of wood science.g2018 Dec., v. 64, no. 6 p.861-871dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-018-1768-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245021600165300001800381520116600399592002801565650001401593650002301607650003601630650002101666650000901687650001201696700002501708700002701733700002301760700002301783773013201806856007501938852000902013655001202022IND60539175420170615000000.0160815e20140625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053917542DNAL7 a10.1021/ja503596m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaifuku, Stephanie

A combination of ⁵⁷Fe Mössbauer and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopies of well-defined and in situ formed mesityl-iron(II)-SciOPP species combined with density functional theory (DFT) investigations provides the first direct insight into electronic structure, bonding and in situ speciation of mesityl-iron(II)-bisphosphines in the Kumada cross-coupling of MesMgBr and primary alkyl halides using FeCl₂(SciOPP). Combined with freeze-trapped solution Mössbauer studies of reactions with primary alkyl halides, these studies demonstrate that distorted square-planar FeMes₂(SciOPP) is the active catalyst for cross-coupling and provide insight into the molecular-level mechanism of catalysis. These studies also define the effects of key reaction protocol details, including the role of the slow Grignard addition method and the addition of excess SciOPP ligand, in leading to high product yields and selectivities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aferrous chloride 3airon 3aligands1 aAl-Afyouni, Malik H.1 aSnyder, Benjamin E.

However, it is still not clear how climate change‐driven extended periods of soil drying followed by flooding will affect soil‐P dynamics. We tested the hypothesis under laboratory conditions that soil antecedent conditions (moist/dry) determine the amount of P mobilised upon flooding. A series of controlled laboratory experiments were carried out by flooding samples of two contrasting soils (a Dystric Cambisol [Crediton series] and a Stagni‐Vertic Cambisol [Hallsworth series]), which had each been either dried (40°C for 10 days) or kept at field moisture conditions (25% moisture content). Flooding was simulated by maintaining a 10‐cm water column depth in mesocosms. Periodically collected water samples were analysed for dissolved reactive P (DRP), total dissolved P (TDP) and dissolved unreactive P (DUP). The onset of flooding significantly (p < 0.001) increased dissolved concentrations of all forms of P. The release of TDP coincided with a reduction in redox potential, suggesting reductive dissolution of P bearing iron/manganese (Fe/Mn) minerals as indicated by a significant positive correlation between TDP and dissolved Fe (r = 0.430, p < 0.001) and TDP and dissolved Mn (r = 0.622, p < 0.001). Flooding of the dried soils caused a significantly greater increase in the dissolved P concentrations of all forms of P relative to their moist‐flooded counterparts. This could be due to a combination of factors which are associated with soil drying and flooding. The Crediton dry‐flooded soils released higher concentrations of DRP upon flooding (e.g. 0.14 mg P L⁻¹ on day 1 after flooding) perhaps due to its higher concentrations of water‐ and NaHCO₃‐extractable P than the Hallsworth dry‐flooded (HDF) soil (0.03 mg P L⁻¹ on day 1 after flooding). However, most of the P in the water column of the dry‐flooded soils was unreactive, with the HDF soil releasing higher concentrations of DUP, likely due to its higher organic matter and microbial biomass P contents. The results suggest that flooding of dried soils has greater potential to enhance mobilisation of soil‐P than flooding of moist soils and thus has potential implications for soil fertility and surface water quality. HIGHLIGHTS: Flooding significantly increased dissolved concentrations of all forms of P. Dried soils released much greater P than their moist counterparts upon flooding. Increased amounts of P in the floodwater coincided with reductions in redox potential and biomass P. Soil with greater amount of biomass‐P and organic matter released greater amounts of dissolved unreactive P.  aPublisher supplied data  aBBS/E/C/000I0330cUKRI‐BBSRC  aBBS/E/C/000I0320cUKRI‐BBSRC  aBBS/E/C/000I0321cUKRI‐BBSRC  cKingston University London 3aCambisols 3aclimate 3agrasslands 3amanganese 3amicrobial biomass 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3aredox potential 3asoil fertility 3asurface water 3awater content 3awater quality1 aHooda, Peter S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2162-49151 aBlackwell, Martin S.

In order to quantitatively describe the load current during the CV charging period, an equivalent circuit model (ECM) based on the resistor-inductor (RL) network is proposed in this paper. Motivated by the current expression derived based on the conventional resistor-capacitor (RC) network-based ECM, an RL network-based ECM is developed to characterize the CV charging current. Then, the parallel-connected RL networks are employed to improve the model fidelity. The test data of four lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries in different aging states are employed to validate the proposed model. Comparative results show that the proposed 2nd-order ECM is the best choice, considering both the model accuracy and complexity. In addition, a simplified 2nd-order model is proposed, achieving a satisfactory accuracy with only three model parameters to be identified. Therefore, this model can be easily implemented in the battery management system (BMS).  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric potential difference 3airon phosphates 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amanagement systems 0aLithium-ion battery 0aElectric vehicles (EVs) 0aConstant-voltage (CV) charge 0aEquivalent circuit model (ECM) 0aResistor-inductor (RL) network1 aCai, Yingfeng1 aPan, Chaofeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5672-05741 aMi, Chris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5471-89530 tApplied energy.g2019 Aug. 09, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1137263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245010100161300001600262520109700278592002801375650001301403650001501416650002601431650001701457650001301474650002301487650002601510650001301536650001301549650002301562650002001585650001201605650000901617651002101626653001501647653002001662653002501682700001201707700001601719773009701735856007701832852000901909655001201918IND60643941220221119103000.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064394122DNAL7 a10.1139/cjb-2017-01542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHawkins, B.J.10aNitrate and ammonium uptake in 21 common species of moss from Vancouver Island, British Columbia  ap. 201-208.  aMosses play key ecological roles in water and nutrient retention in many ecosystems, yet relatively little is known of the functional characteristics of moss species, particularly nutritional characteristics. We investigated the net flux of ammonium, nitrate, and protons, using a microelectrode ion flux measurement system, in the gametophytes of 21 common species of moss from three contrasting locations in southern coastal British Columbia. The general location from which mosses were collected did not significantly affect ammonium or nitrate uptake. Proton efflux was greatest in mosses from locations with high rainfall. Rates of nitrate uptake differed among moss families, but there were no significant differences in uptake among species within families. Ammonium net flux differed among moss families, but also among species nested within family, with some species showing uptake and other showing ammonium efflux. In general, moss species native to dry habitats appeared to have higher rates of nitrogen uptake when ammonium and nitrate were available under favourable conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aecosystems 3afunctional properties 3agametophytes 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3amosses and liverworts 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrient retention 3anutritive value 3aprotons 3arain 3aBritish Columbia 0abryophytes 0anitrogen uptake 0aion flux measurement1 aMay, E.1 aRobbins, S.0 tBotany.g2018, v. 96, no. 3 p.201-208dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44657x1916-28047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2017-01543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245011000181520175800291592002802049650001502077650002802092650001402120650002302134650002902157650001102186650003102197650001902228650001502247650001202262653003102274653002802305653001902333653001602352653002402368700001902392700002302411773009802434856008702532852000902619655001202628IND60657037620221117041417.0201125e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065703762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1137272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiscitelli, Marco Savino10aRecognition and classification of typical load profiles in buildings with non-intrusive learning approach  aThe recent increasing spread of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) has enabled the collection of a huge amount of building related-data which can be exploited by both energy suppliers and users to gain insight on energy consumption patterns. In this context, data analytics-based methodologies can play a key role for performing advanced characterization, benchmarking and classification of buildings according to their typical energy use in the time domain. Traditionally, energy customers are classified according to their building end-use category. However, buildings belonging to the same category can exhibit very different energy patterns making ineffective this kind of a-priori categorization. For this reason, load profiling frameworks have been developed in the last decade to identify homogenous groups of buildings with similar daily energy profiles. The present study proposes a non-intrusive customer classification process, which does not use as predictive attributes in-field load monitoring data for the classification of unknown customers, but rather monthly energy bills and additional information on customers’ habits collected by means of a phone survey. The proposed classification process is developed by analysing hourly energy consumption data of 114 electrical customers of an Italian Energy Provider. The representative daily load profiles are grouped using the “Follow the Leader” clustering algorithm and a globally optimal decision tree is employed to build a supervised classification model. The model, compared to a baseline recursive partitioning tree, leads to an increase of accuracy of about 6%. Eventually, the procedure exploits energy bill data also for estimating the magnitude of typical load profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3abuildings 3aconsumers (people) 3adecision support systems 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3ainfrastructure 3amonitoring 3asurveys 0aBuilding energy management 0aCustomer classification 0aLoad profiling 0aData mining 0aEnergy benchmarking1 aBrandi, Silvio1 aCapozzoli, Alfonso0 tApplied energy.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 255 p.113727-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1137273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245011900169500002200288520157200310592002801882650001501910650001301925650002101938650002101959650001101980650001501991650001902006650002302025650001902048650001702067650001402084650001102098650001102109651001002120653003102130653003202161653000802193653001402201700001302215700001902228700001902247700001802266700001502284700001502299700001802314700001602332700001502348773007802363856008702441852000902528655001202537IND60563790520221121015851.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056379052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.02.1272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Yunjie10aImpact of size distributions of major chemical components in fine particles on light extinction in urban Guangzhou  aPre-press version  aTo evaluate the impact of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) size distribution on aerosol chemical and optical properties, dominant chemical components including water-soluble inorganic ions (WSII), organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) in PM1 and PM2.5, aerosol scattering coefficient (bsp), and aerosol absorption coefficient (bap) were collected synchronously at an urban site in Guangzhou, south China during a typical summer month in 2009 and a winter month in 2010. PM1 (sizes smaller than 1μm) constituted 77% and 63% of PM2.5 in summer and winter, respectively. From the reconstructed mass concentrations, the sum of SO42−, NO3− and NH4+ (SNA) distributed more in PM1 than in PM1–2.5 (PM2.5 minus PM1) in summer and the opposite was found in winter, while carbonaceous aerosols distributed more in PM1 in both summer and winter. With the aggravation of PM2.5 pollution, the mass fraction of PM1/PM2.5 increased for (NH4)2SO4 (AS), NH4NO3 (AN) and EC but decreased for organic matter (OM) in summer, and the opposite was found in winter. Bsp of PM1 and PM1–2.5 was estimated from the mass extinction efficiencies (MSEs) of the dominant chemical components, which showed good correlations (R2=0.99) with measured ones and those estimated using the IMPROVE formula. The fractional contributions of dominant chemical components to extinction coefficient (bext) were consistent with their respective mass size distributions, indicating the importance of chemically-resolved aerosol size distributions on aerosol optical properties and haze formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaerosols 3aammonium nitrate 3aammonium sulfate 3acarbon 3aextinction 3ainorganic ions 3aoptical properties 3aorganic matter 3aparticulates 3apollution 3asummer 3awinter 3aChina 0aAerosol optical properties 0aAerosol chemical components 0aPM1 0aPM1–2.51 aTao, Jun1 aZhang, Leiming1 aZhang, Renjian1 aLi, Shuanglin1 aWu, Yunfei1 aCao, Junji1 aWang, Xiaojia1 aMa, Qingxia1 aXiong, Zhe0 tScience of the total environment.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.02.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008900167300001600256500002000272500000900292520110700301592002801408650003401436650002001470650001901490650000901509650001901518650001601537650001401553650001801567650002201585650001401607650002101621650001001642700001901652700001601671700001701687700001801704773013601722856008301858961001301941852000901954655001201963IND60677169620221121033428.0220819e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067716962DNAL7 a10.3198/jpr2019.02.0010crg2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurke, John J.10aRegistration of Five Grain Sorghum Lines with Early‐Season Seedling Cold Tolerance  ap. 422-426.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aFive sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.)

Besides studies that have investigated the role of I in livestock nutrition, it is also important to know the transcriptomics changes in small ruminants following I supplementation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of I on the whole blood transcriptome in sheep. Fifteen lactating cross-bred ewes (3 to 4-year-old, 55 to 65 kg BW) at their late lactation period were enrolled in this study. At the beginning, all the animals had a 2-week acclimation period where they were fed with a basal diet which includes an adequate level of I (2 mg I/animal per day) in the form of calcium iodate (CaI₂O₆). Then, the ewes were randomly divided into two groups and fed in individual troughs: the control group (n = 5) was maintained on basal diet and the experimental group (I, n = 10) was fed for 40 days with a diet containing a high I supplementation (equivalent to 30 mg I/animal per day), in the form of potassium iodide. Whole blood and milk were collected individually at the beginning (T0) and after the 40 days of supplementation (T40). Iodine quantification was assessed in serum and milk sample. Microarray gene expression analysis was performed on whole blood and, filtering data using a fold change >2 with an adjusted P < 0.05, we identified 250 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the I group (T40 v. T0). Looking for biological processes associated with our DEGs, we found significant association with cell growth regulation. Thus, our study unveils the role of I supplementation on gene expression in sheep improving the knowledge about micronutrients in animal nutrition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3acell growth 3acrossbreds 3adiet 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aiodates 3aiodine 3alate lactation 3alivestock nutrition 3amicroarray technology 3amilk 3apotassium iodide 3athyroid gland 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0aiodine supplementation 0amicroarray 0apathway analysis 0asheep1 aElgendy, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2592-34481 aIanni, A.1 aMartino, C.1 aPalazzo, F.1 aGiantin, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0015-38001 aGrotta, L.1 aDacasto, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3637-56431 aMartino, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7878-93180 tAnimal.g2020 Apr., v. 14, no. 4 p.745-752dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311190024773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011900170300001600289520124100305592002801546650001501574650001701589650001101606650001401617650002301631650002301654650001801677650002101695650002901716653003001745653002401775653002701799653003701826653002801863653002901891700001701920700001601937700001501953700001901968700001401987700002002001773009802021856008702119852000902206655001202215IND60628486420221119101247.0190410e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062848642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.1252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaro-Ruiz, C.10aCoordination of optimal sizing of energy storage systems and production buffer stocks in a net zero energy factory  ap. 851-862.  aGreen smart factories will be one of the key elements of the future smart grids. They will play an active role in managing the volatility of power generated by renewable energy sources (RES). In order to do that, the green smart factories must set up energy management systems to control the production processes according to both the on-site power generation by RES and external signals sent by the system operators. The aim of the study is to size energy storage systems and production buffer stocks as the flexibility options, allowing the highest integration of power generated by volatile energy within a manufacturing system. The concept of the net zero energy factory is considered. Algorithms for coordinating the flexibility options optimally have been developed. These algorithms are based on mixed-integer linear programming and aim to maximize the matching between RES power generation and flexible demand. A case study is used to verify the framework results. Key performance indices, such as the system self-sufficiency index and the system self-consumption index have been considered for evaluating the solutions developed. Finally, sensitivity analysis has been performed to assess the robustness of the solutions found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aenergy 3afactories 3alinear programming 3amanagement systems 3amanufacturing 3apower generation 3arenewable energy sources 0aNet zero energy factories 0aFlexibility options 0aEnergy storage systems 0aOptimal manufacturing scheduling 0aProduction buffer stock 0aRenewable energy sources1 aLombardi, P.1 aRichter, M.1 aPelzer, A.1 aKomarnicki, P.1 aPavas, A.1 aMojica-Nava, E.0 tApplied energy.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 238 p.851-862dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.1253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245010500204300001800309506007600327520109300403592002801496506003701524650001201561650002001573650002001593650001301613650002001626653002301646653002301669653002901692653002101721653002701742700002201769700002601791700002001817773019101837856007902028852000902107655001202116IND60230450820221207102426.0150614e20150519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023045082DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15074021122doi7 aPMC44433062pmcid7 a259413582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xiong-jie10aNeuronal thresholds and choice-related activity of otolith afferent fibers during heading perception  ap. 6467-6472.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHow activity of sensory neurons leads to perceptual decisions remains a challenge to understand. Correlations between choices and single neuron firing rates have been found early in vestibular processing, in the brainstem and cerebellum. To investigate the origins of choice-related activity, we have recorded from otolith afferent fibers while animals performed a fine heading discrimination task. We find that afferent fibers have similar discrimination thresholds as central cells, and the most sensitive fibers have thresholds that are only twofold or threefold greater than perceptual thresholds. Unlike brainstem and cerebellar nuclei neurons, spike counts from afferent fibers do not exhibit trial-by-trial correlations with perceptual decisions. This finding may reflect the fact that otolith afferent responses are poorly suited for driving heading perception because they fail to discriminate self-motion from changes in orientation relative to gravity. Alternatively, if choice probabilities reflect top-down inference signals, they are not relayed to the vestibular periphery.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimals 3adecision making 3aneurophysiology 3aotoliths 3asensory neurons 0aneuronal threshold 0achoice probability 0apsychophysical threshold 0aotolith afferent 0aheading discrimination1 aDickman, J.

High-pressure sprays of IC2, bifenthrin, and water were applied during the peak nymphal (July) and adult (October) seasons of the vector tick. No ticks could be dragged on the IC2 grids within 2 wk of the July spray, and few adult ticks were found in October or the following April. Similarly, no adult ticks could be dragged 1.5 wk after the October IC2 spray, and few the following April. No ticks were found on the bifenthrin grids after either spray through the following April, whereas substantial numbers of ticks remained throughout on the grids sprayed with water. Thus, IC2 appears to be an effective, minimum-risk acaricide to control the vector tick of Lyme disease. 3adisease vectors 3aessential oils 3ano observed adverse effect level 3afield experimentation 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aanimal diseases 3aIxodes scapularis 3arisk assessment 3ahuman diseases 3adisease control 3apest control 3arosemary 3abifenthrin 3anontarget organisms 3aspraying 3aadverse effects 3amortality 3abiological control 3aLyme disease 3abotanical insecticides 2aAnimals 2aInsect Control 2aInsect Vectorsxdrug effects 2aInsecticidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aIxodesxdrug effects 2aLyme Diseasexprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aOils, Volatilexchemistryxpharmacology. 2aRosmarinusxchemistry 3aMaine 0aacaricides1 aLacombe, Eleanor H.1 aElias, Susan P.1 aLubelczyk, Charles B.1 aSt Amand, Theodore1 aSmith, Robert P.

To reach this goal, 203 females were used from their first artificial insemination to their sixth parturition. Throughout that period, 48 traits were recorded, considered to be performance, metabolic and immunological indicators. These traits were initially recorded in females’ first reproductive cycle. Later, removed females due to death or culling and those that were non-removed were identified. A first analysis was used to explore whether it was possible to classify females between those reaching and those not reaching up to the mean lifespan of a rabbit female (the fifth reproductive) cycle using information from the first reproductive cycle. The analysis results showed that 97% of the non-removed females were classified correctly, whereas only 60% of the removed females were classified as animals to be removed. The reason for this difference lies in the model’s characteristics, which was designed using early traits and was able to classify only the cases in which females would be removed due to performance, metabolic or immunologic imbalances in their early lives. Our results suggest that the model defines the necessary conditions, but not the sufficient ones, for females to remain alive in the herd. The aim of a second analysis was to find out the main early differences between the non-removed and removed females. The live weights records taken in the first cycle indicated that the females removed in their first cycle were lighter, while those removed in their second cycle were heavier with longer stayability (−203 and +202 g on average, respectively; P < 0.05). Non-removed females showed higher glucose and lower beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations in the first cycle than the removed females (+4.8 and −10.7%, respectively; P < 0.05). The average lymphocytes B counts in the first cycle were 22.7% higher in the non-removed females group (P < 0.05). The females removed in the first reproductive cycle presented a higher granulocytes/lymphocytes ratio in this cycle than those that at least reached the second cycle (4.81 v. 1.66; P < 0.001). Consequently, non-removed females at sixth parturition offered adequate body development and energy levels, less immunological stress and a more mature immune function in the first reproductive cycle. The females that deviated from this pattern were at higher risk of being removed from the herd.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aartificial insemination 3adeath 3aenergy 3afemales 3aglucose 3agranulocytes 3aherds 3aimmune response 3alongevity 3amodels 3aparturition 3arabbits 3arisk 0aearly reproduction 0ametabolism 0aperformance 0aimmune status 0arabbit females1 aArnau-Bonachera, A.1 aSelva, L.1 aViana, D.1 aLarsen, T.1 aCorpa, J.M.1 aPascual, J.J.1 aSavietto, D.0 tAnimal.g2020 Apr., v. 14, no. 4 p.780-789dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311190024893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013400157300001800291500002000309520106600329592002801395650002601423650002101449650001201470650001201482650000901494650001301503650001001516700002301526700002101549700002101570700002701591700002201618773012201640856007301762852000901835655001201844IND60587854020221119192937.0180102e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058785402DNAL7 a10.1111/are.129922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCupp, Aaron R10aSurvival and behavioural responses of cool and warm water fish sedated with AQUI‐S®20E (10% eugenol) at high loading densities  ap. 1576-1589.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study evaluated the effects of AQUI‐S®20E (10% eugenol) sedation on the survival and behaviour of yellow perch Perca flavescens (Mitchill) and Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus L. held in high loading densities.

Whereas the obvious protection mechanism of cover crops occurs through the canopy, plant roots perform multiple functions. It is important to consider the soil functions delivered by different root systems in order to increase the uptake of cover crops for sustainable soil and water management. A classification of cover crop root systems up to 0.6 m deep based on functional traits will allow us to better study their potential role in soil bio‐engineering, soil structural improvements for hydrological services and soil resource protection. This was a glasshouse experiment, using large 1‐m³ containers filled with loam soil, loose topsoil and compacted subsoil, in which seven cover crop species (oat, rye, buckwheat, vetch, radish, mustard, phacelia) were grown for 90 days. Root cores were taken at the end of the experiment, washed and imaged to determine root traits (total root length density, average root diameter, root specific length and root surface area) for both the topsoil and subsoil layers. Root identity was determined from a distinctive combination of single root traits and related to three soil functional variables, representing soil structural improvement, runoff mitigation and erosion control. The results showed that total root length and root surface area correlate well with aggregate stability and soil macroporosity. Buckwheat, mustard and rye had significantly greater aggregate stability, as well as 10, 8 and 7% greater microporosity, respectively, at the interface with the compacted layer when compared to the control bare soil. Furthermore, average root diameter negatively correlated with soil macroporosity, indicating that cover crops with a fine root system are more beneficial for creating pore‐space than those with thicker taproots. Selecting cover crop species with the right root traits is therefore crucial to improve soil health. HIGHLIGHTS: Roots of cover crops are a largely unexplored frontier for bio‐engineering of agricultural soils. Combinations of root traits were identified that most improve soil characteristics. Cover crops with finer root systems were better at enhancing porosity. Root length and surface area were most important for enhancing soil structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVicia 3aaggregate stability 3abioengineering 3abuckwheat 3acanopy 3acover crops 3aerosion control 3afine roots 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aloam soils 3aoats 3aporosity 3aradishes 3arunoff 3arye 3asoil quality 3asoil remediation 3asoil structure 3asubsoil 3asurface area 3atopsoil 3awater management1 aPutinica, Cristinel1 aOtten, Wilfred1 aDe Baets, Sarah0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2022 Jan., v. 73, no. 1 p.e13147-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl51589x1351-07547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.131473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245008900177520104400266592002801310650000801338650005201346650001601398650001601414650001001430650001901440650001401459650001501473650002601488650002501514650002401539650001501563650001201578651001101590653002201601653003701623653001401660653001801674700002701692700003501719700002901754700003501783700002401818700004001842700003901882700003001921773011901951856008802070852000902158655001202167IND60767779820221118021221.0220816e20220610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076777982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1539272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondelli, Giulliana10aFirst case of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in municipal solid waste leachate from Brazil  aThis work presents the first case of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in leachate collected from a transfer station in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. After calibration of the viral detection method already used for wastewater samples with a pilot leachate sample and virus fragments in laboratory, twelve polyethylene glycol concentrated leachates samples were tested by RT-qPCR. The results confirmed the presence of N1 gene in 9 of the 12 analyzed samples between epidemiological weeks 33 and 38 of the year 2021 (08/15/2021 to 09/19/2021). The occurrence of the N2 gene was only observed in 5 of the 12 samples. The concentration values for N1 and N2 genes varied between 3.1 and 4.6 log₁₀.GC·L⁻¹, which are values close to those measured in sanitary wastewater. This method showed to be a promising procedure to verify the presence of viral RNA in municipal solid waste leachate, being especially useful where there is no treatment system and sanitation infrastructure, which makes the conventional wastewater surveillance unfeasible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3acalibration 3aenvironment 3agenes 3ainfrastructure 3aleachates 3amonitoring 3amunicipal solid waste 3amunicipal wastewater 3apolyethylene glycol 3asanitation 3aviruses 3aBrazil 0aCOVID-19 pandemic 0aMunicipal solid waste management 0aLeachates 0aPublic health1 aSilva, Ednei Rodrigues1 aClaro, Ieda Carolina Mantovani1 aAugusto, Matheus Ribeiro1 aDuran, Adriana Feliciano Alves1 aCabral, Aline Diniz1 ade Moraes Bomediano Camillo, Lívia1 ados Santos Oliveira, Luísa Helena1 ade Freitas Bueno, Rodrigo0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 June 10, v. 824 p.153927-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1539273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245004200175300001600217500001100233520117000244592002801414596004801442596003901490650001401529650001101543650001301554650002301567650001401590650001401604650002601618650002301644650001601667650001201683700001801695700001801713700001901731700002701750700002401777773012801801856008301929852000902012655001202021IND60788242020221119121905.0220811e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078824202DNAL7 a10.1007/s13353-022-00703-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiśniewska, Karolina,10aMisdiagnosis in mucopolysaccharidoses  ap. 475-495.  aReview  aMucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) is a group of 13 hereditary metabolic diseases identified in humans (or 14 diseases if considering one MPS type described to date only in mice) in which an enzymatic defect results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in the lysosomes of cells. First of all, as a result of GAG storage, the proper functioning of the lysosome is disturbed; then, the cells, and finally, tissue, organs, and the whole organism malfunctions are observed. Due to the rarity, heterogeneity, and multi-systemic and progressive nature of MPS, they present a major diagnostic challenge. Due to the wide variation in symptoms and their similarity to other diseases, MPS is often misdiagnosed, usually as neurological diseases (like autism spectrum disorders, psychomotor hyperactivity, and intellectual disability) or rheumatology and orthopedic disorders (like juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Perthes disease, rickets, and muscular dystrophy). In this review article, we present the problems associated with the possibility of misdiagnosing MPS, discuss what diseases they can be confused with, and suggest ways to reduce these problems in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017/25/B/NZ2/00414cNarodowe Centrum Nauki  a1220/83/2021cUniwersytet Gdański 3aarthritis 3aautism 3agenetics 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ajuveniles 3alysosomes 3amucopolysaccharidosis 3amuscular dystrophy 3aorthopedics 3arickets1 aWolski, Jakub1 aGaffke, Lidia1 aCyske, Zuzanna1 aPierzynowska, Karolina1 aWęgrzyn, Grzegorz,0 tJournal of applied genetics.g2022 Sept., v. 63, no. 3 p.475-495dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2134x1234-19837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13353-022-00703-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245008800201300002000289506007600309520115700385592002801542506003701570650002101607650002201628650001401650700001801664700001701682700001901699700002101718700002401739773017701763856008301940852000902023655001202032IND4487030320221207131950.0120502e20110927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448703032DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11038201082doi7 aPMC31827072pmcid7 a219309512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hanqing13aTheconserved protein EF4 (LepA) modulates the elongation cycle of protein synthesis  ap. 16223-16228.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEF4 (LepA), a strongly conserved protein, is important for bacterial growth and functional protein biosynthesis under certain conditions and is quite similar structurally to the translocase EF-G. The elongation cycle in protein synthesis is characterized by ribosome oscillation between pretranslocation (PRE) and posttranslocation (POST) complexes. Here, using ensemble single turnover and equilibrium experiments, as well as single molecule FRET measurements, we demonstrate that EF4 can compete with EF-G for binding to the PRE complex. Such EF4 binding results in formation of a complex, denoted X3, that effectively sequesters a catalytically active ribosome, leading to a transient inhibition of elongation that provides a mechanism for optimization of functional protein synthesis. Earlier [Liu H, et al. (2010) J Mol Biol 396:1043â1052] we demonstrated that EF4 also reacts with POST complex, leading to the formation of a complex, I3, that appears to be identical with X3. Our present results strongly suggest that PRE complex is the principal target of EF4 action on translation, rather than POST complex as had been previously supposed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amicrobial growth 3aprotein synthesis 3aribosomes1 aChen, Chunlai1 aZhang, Haibo1 aKaur, Jaskiran1 aGoldman, Yale E.1 aCooperman, Barry S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Sept. 27, v. 108, no. 39 p.16223-16228dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11038201083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009200166500002200258520064500280592002800925653000800953653002200961653001400983653001400997653001701011700002401028700002801052700001701080700002501097700002501122700002501147700002101172700003401193700002001227773008001247856008101327852000901408655001201417IND60559908820221118043243.0161216s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055990882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cmi.2016.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuoti, Massimo10aIncidence and Progression to Cirrhosis of New HCV infections in Persons Living with HIV  aPre-press version  aTo estimate the incidence of HCV seroconversion and the risk of severe fibrosis/cirrhosis in HCV seroconverters among persons with HIV.We analyzed data on 4,059 persons with HIV enrolled in a cohort study in Italy.Incidence rate of seroconversion was 0.6/100 person-years overall, and drug users and men-who-have-sex-with-men were at highest risk.

Shrimp postlarvae (98.47 ± 8.6 mg) were fed for 32 days in tanks with water volume of 130 L and density of 1 individual L⁻¹. One control treatment and four biofloc treatments (BFT1, BFT2, BFT3 and BFT4) with adding different carbon sources including molasses, starch, wheat flour and mixture of them, respectively, were considered at equal weight ratios. According to the results, salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH were not significantly different among the biofloc treatments (P > 0.05). Maximum pH (8.27) and maximum dissolved oxygen (6.35 mg L⁻¹) were recorded in the control. Maximum (0.43 mg L⁻¹) and minimum (0.09 mg L⁻¹) ammonia were recorded in the control and BFT2, respectively (P < 0.05). Using simple carbohydrates (molasses and starch) lowered the ammonia concentration significantly. The highest increase in body weight (1640.43 ± 231.28 mg), growth rate, specific growth rate (8.97 ± 0.42% per day) and biomass (190.29 ± 26.83 mg) were found in BFT1 and the highest survival (90 ± 0.77%) was found in BFT4. The highest feed conversion (1.52 ± 0.23) and the lowest feed efficiency (66.81 ± 7.95) were observed in the control (P < 0.05). The proximate composition analysis revealed an increase in lipid and ash in biofloc treatments. Results indicated that using biofloc technology with zero‐water exchange system and adding carbon sources could help to recycle waste and improve the water quality. Moreover, the type of carbonaceous organic matter as a substrate for heterotrophic bacteria would be effective in degradation and metabolization of ammonia and nitrite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aammonia 3abacteria 3abiofloc technology 3abiomass 3abody weight 3acarbon 3afeed conversion 3alipids 3amolasses 3anitrites 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3apH 3apostlarvae 3aproximate composition 3asalinity 3aspecific growth rate 3astarch 3atanks 3awastes 3awater quality 3awheat flour1 aSajjadi, Mir Masoud1 aAlizadeh, Morteza1 aSourinejad, Iman0 tAquaculture research.g2017 Apr., v. 48, no. 4 p.1491-1501dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.129853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01143naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008000169300001200249500002200261520026900283592002800552650001900580650001000599650002600609700002000635773011900655856008200774852000900856655001200865IND60624958520221121045640.0191115e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062495852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-018-1777-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Masashi10aCorrection to: Quantification of visual inducement of knots by eye-tracking  ap. 881.  aPublished Erratum  aThe article Quantification of visual inducement of knots by eye-tracking, written by Masashi Nakamura and Takayuki Kondo, was originally published electronically on the publisher’s internet portal (currently SpringerLink) on 19 October, 2007 without open access.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3aknots 3aquantitative analysis1 aKondo, Takayuki0 tJournal of wood science.g2018 Dec., v. 64, no. 6 p.881-881dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-018-1777-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011700156300001800273520113700291592002801428650002101456650002401477650001701501650001501518650001801533650001001551650001901561650001201580650003101592650001401623650001801637650001901655650001401674650002201688700002101710700001801731700001901749700001801768700002001786700001901806773009801825856007501923852000901998655001202007IND60576767120221119200649.0170806e20130521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057676712DNAL7 a10.1021/la30513022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoo, Hyunhee10aMultifunctional Magnetic Nanoparticles Modified with Polyethylenimine and Folic Acid for Biomedical Theranostics  ap. 5962-5967.  aThis paper describes the preparation of magnetic nanoparticles modified with polyethylenimine (PEI)–folic acid (PF) conjugate and their potential biomedical applications. Magnetic nanoparticles modified with (3-(2-aminoethylamino)propyltrimethoxysilane) (AEAPS) were first prepared using a ligand exchange method to provide biocompatibility and hydrophilicity, and further conjugated with PF to carry gene and enhance specific uptake into cancer cells. We demonstrated the feasibility of the multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and as gene carriers for gene delivery. In vitro results revealed that the cytotoxicity of the multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles was lower compared to that of pristine magnetic nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrated the specific uptake of the magnetic nanoparticles modified with PF to KB cells using WI-38 cells as comparison by confocal microscopy. The PF-modified magnetic nanoparticles can potentially be employed as theranostic nanoplatforms for targeted gene delivery to cancer cells and simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3aconfocal microscopy 3acytotoxicity 3afolic acid 3agene transfer 3agenes 3ahydrophilicity 3aligands 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amagnetism 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apolyethyleneimine1 aMoon, Seung-Kwan1 aHwang, Taewon1 aKim, Yong Seok1 aKim, Joo-Hwan1 aChoi, Sung-Wook1 aKim, Jung Hyun0 tLangmuir.g2013 May 21, v. 29, no. 20 p.5962-5967dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla30513023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010300173520167000276592002801946650001901974650001001993650001502003650001002018650002102028650001102049650002002060650001402080650001702094650001702111650002502128650001202153650001802165650004102183651001302224653001402237653000902251653000902260653000802269653001602277700002002293700002702313700003302340700001802373773010802391856008602499852000902585655001202594IND60627859520221121111658.0210228e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062785952DNAL7 a10.1080/23311932.2018.14533172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNigussie, Afework10aLevel of aflatoxins in industrially brewed local and imported beers collected from Ethiopia market  aEighteen brands; 15 domestic and 3 imported beers were collected from different market across ten sub cities of Addis Ababa. Aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2 were determined by immuno-affinity column cleanup and reversed-phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) related to food quality and safety issues of the beer industries were also assessed. The result showed, out of twelve alcoholic domestic beer brands eleven were positive with a range of total aflatoxin between 1.23 and 12.47 μg/l and one brand was less than Limit of Detection. When comparing this research finding with other studies conducted in different countries, high aflatoxin level was detected in Ethiopian alcoholic beer. Conversely, aflatoxin was not detected in any of non-alcoholic domestic beer brands. Aflatoxin was detected but not quantified in all the three imported beer bands. On the other hand, knowledge about mycotoxin specifically aflatoxin in the beer factories was not satisfactory. In terms of their practice, only 35% of breweries are working under HACCP and most of breweries do not determines level of aflatoxin in incoming raw materials and final products in their laboratories. Fortunately, majority of the alcoholic domestic beer brands were less than 4 μg/l, which is the maximum allowable limit set by EU standard for total aflatoxins. However, two brands were found to be greater than 4 μg/l and unsafe for consumption and require action. Thus, government policymakers should incorporate aflatoxin legislation as mandatory standard and enforce to regulate in Ethiopian beers filling up the existing critical gap.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aHACCP 3aaflatoxins 3abeers 3abrewing industry 3acities 3adetection limit 3afactories 3afluorescence 3afood quality 3alaws and regulations 3amarkets 3araw materials 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3aEthiopia 0aaflatoxin 0abeer 0aHPLC 0aKAP 0alegislation1 aBekele, Tilahun1 aFekadu Gemede, Habtamu1 aZewdu Woldegiorgis, Ashagrie1 aYildiz, Fatih0 tCogent food & agriculture.g2018 Jan. 1, v. 4, no. 1 p.1453317-dCogentwJournal:21312x2331-19327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2018.14533173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04106naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003800132024001100170040001800181100002200199245014000221300001400361506017300375520196500548592002802513650002402541650001802565650001202583650001602595650002202611650001802633650002002651650001402671650002502685650001302710650001502723650002402738650001802762650002102780650000902801650001702810651001502827653001202842653000902854653002102863653002502884653001902909653002102928700002202949700002102971700002302992700001803015700002003033773011003053856008503163856011203248956008603360961001303446852000903459655001203468IND60006052820221214224403.0180905e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000605282DNAL7 a3154522aris7 a10113/605282hdl7 a10.1016/j.aeolia.2014.12.0052doi8 ans6800  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAubault, Hélène10aGrazing impacts on the susceptibility of rangelands to wind erosion: The effects of stocking rate, stocking strategy and land condition  ap. 89-99.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aAn estimated 110Mt of dust is eroded by wind from the Australian land surface each year, most of which originates from the arid and semi-arid rangelands. Livestock production is thought to increase the susceptibility of the rangelands to wind erosion by reducing vegetation cover and modifying surface soil stability. However, research is yet to quantify the impacts of grazing land management on the erodibility of the Australian rangelands, or determine how these impacts vary among land types and over time. We present a simulation analysis that links a pasture growth and animal production model (GRASP) to the Australian Land Erodibility Model (AUSLEM) to evaluate the impacts of stocking rate, stocking strategy and land condition on the erodibility of four land types in western Queensland, Australia. Our results show that declining land condition, over stocking, and using inflexible stocking strategies have potential to increase land erodibility and amplify accelerated soil erosion. However, land erodibility responses to grazing are complex and influenced by land type sensitivities to different grazing strategies and local climate characteristics. Our simulations show that land types which are more resilient to livestock grazing tend to be least susceptible to accelerated wind erosion. Increases in land erodibility are found to occur most often during climatic transitions when vegetation cover is most sensitive to grazing pressure. However, grazing effects are limited during extreme wet and dry periods when the influence of climate on vegetation cover is strongest. Our research provides the opportunity to estimate the effects of different land management practices across a range of land types, and provides a better understanding of the mechanisms of accelerated erosion resulting from pastoral activities. The approach could help further assessment of land erodibility at a broader scale notably if combined with wind erosion models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccelerated erosion 3aanimal growth 3aclimate 3aerodibility 3agrazing intensity 3agrazing lands 3aland management 3alivestock 3alivestock production 3apastures 3arangelands 3asoil erosion models 3astocking rate 3avegetation cover 3awind 3awind erosion 3aQueensland 0aAeolian 0aDust 0aSoil erodibility 0aRangeland management 0aStocking rates 0aLand degradation1 aWebb, Nicholas P.1 aStrong, Craig L.1 aMcTainsh, Grant H.1 aLeys, John F.1 aScanlan, Joe C.0 tAeolian research.g2015 June, v. 17 p.89-99dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:12141x1875-96377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aeolia.2014.12.0053Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/605283Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/15-009.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01868naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007000170300001800240520083600258592002801094650002201122650002401144650002101168650002001189650001501209650000901224650001601233650002501249650002001274700001601294700001701310700001801327773010401345856004801449852000901497655001201506IND50067703020221120134745.0130831e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006770302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-013-0374-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenkata Ramana, R.10aMonthly Rainfall Prediction Using Wavelet Neural Network Analysis  ap. 3697-3711.  aRainfall is one of the most significant parameters in a hydrological model. Several models have been developed to analyze and predict the rainfall forecast. In recent years, wavelet techniques have been widely applied to various water resources research because of their time-frequency representation. In this paper an attempt has been made to find an alternative method for rainfall prediction by combining the wavelet technique with Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The wavelet and ANN models have been applied to monthly rainfall data of Darjeeling rain gauge station. The calibration and validation performance of the models is evaluated with appropriate statistical methods. The results of monthly rainfall series modeling indicate that the performances of wavelet neural network models are more effective than the ANN models.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrologic models 3ameteorological data 3amodel validation 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3arain 3arain gauges 3astatistical analysis 3awater resources1 aKrishna, B.1 aKumar, S.

However, the use of zinc metal in practical cells has been challenging due to the formation of Zn dendrites, which could lead to unreliable electrochemical performance and safety issues. To overcome this problem, we present a high-capacity zinc-insertion-compound anode ZnₓMo₂.₅₊yVO₉₊z by inserting Zn²⁺ into an open-tunnel oxide host with a novel chemical Zn-insertion technique. The ultrafast chemical Zn-insertion is performed in ambient atmosphere with diethylene glycol (DEG) and zinc acetate (Zn(CH₃COO)₂) within 30 min. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Zn-containing insertion anode ever reported. ZnₓMo₂.₅₊yVO₉₊z can be used as an anode in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes for Zn-based batteries, with a capacity as high as 220 mA h g⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aanodes 3abatteries 3adendrites 3adiethylene glycol 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3azinc 3azinc acetate1 aManthiram, Arumugam0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Dec. 6, v. 4, no. 48 p.18737-18741dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta07747a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03986naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245016000170520214100330592002802471650001402499650002902513650002202542650002602564650002402590650002502614650001602639650001602655650001302671650002502684650001502709650001902724650001602743650001802759650001502777650001202792650001702804650002302821650002102844650001102865650001002876650002802886651001002914653002502924653001502949653001302964653002002977653002402997653002303021700001803044700001603062700001703078700001503095700001803110700001603128773011903144856008803263852000903351655001203360IND60767780020221118021145.0220517e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076778002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1539292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Fangbo10aLow-disturbance farming regenerates healthy deep soil toward sustainable agriculture - Evidence from long-term no-tillage with stover mulching in Mollisols  aCurrently, global agricultural development is in a critical period, as it contends with a growing population, degraded farmland, and serious environmental issues. Although low-disturbance practices are recommended to improve soil health, it is unclear whether such practices benefit critical deep soil functioning. Here, we compared the soil bacterial communities and physicochemical parameters across 3-m deep soil profiles in a Mollisol of Northeast China at the end of the dormant season after 10 years of farming under conventional tillage without stover mulching (CT), no-tillage without stover mulching (NTNS), and no-tillage with stover mulching (NTSM). We found that low-disturbance practices (NTNS and NTSM), compared with CT, evidently promoted soil bacterial species richness and diversity and enriched potential metabolic diversity. When compared to the bacterial communities in CT, the vertical dissimilarity of bacterial communities in NTNS decreased, while that in NTSM increased, indicating that no-tillage alone homogenized the composition of the bacterial community through soil depth profiles, but straw mulching enhanced the uniqueness of community composition at each layer. In comparison to CT, no-tillage with stover mulching significantly increased the soil water content and root-associated organic carbon (SEOC), and decreased soil pH. Mineral nitrogen declined with depth to 60 cm and then increased to its maximum at 250–300 cm under CT and at 120–150 cm under NTNS and NTSM. More mineral nitrogen at 0–150 cm under low-disturbance practices would provide more available nitrogen for crops in the coming growing season, while the accumulated nitrogen at 150–300 cm under CT may leach into the groundwater. Taken together, our results show that low-disturbance practices can regenerate whole-soil bacterial diversity and potential function, and promote water retention and nitrogen holding capacity within the root zone, thus reducing the dose of nitrogen fertilizer and mitigating nitrogen contamination to deep groundwater, ultimately contributing to agricultural sustainability in Mollisol regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMollisols 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural land 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3aconventional tillage 3aenvironment 3agroundwater 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3ano-tillage 3aorganic carbon 3arhizosphere 3asoil bacteria 3asoil depth 3asoil pH 3asoil quality 3asoil water content 3aspecies richness 3astover 3astraw 3asustainable agriculture 3aChina 0aRegenerative farming 0aNo-tillage 0aNitrogen 0aStover mulching 0aBacterial diversity 0aBacterial function1 aWang, Hongjun1 aXie, Hongtu1 aBao, Xuelian1 aHe, Hongbo1 aZhang, Xudong1 aLiang, Chao0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 June 15, v. 825 p.153929-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1539293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01918naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245011700207300001600324520093600340592002801276650002401304650002201328650001501350650001301365651001001378700002801388773012101416856008201537852000901619655001201628IND60744231620221121022004.0210710e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074423162DNAL7 a10.1007/s40009-020-01013-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMomin, Marcy D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8955-482410aEndophytic Bacteria Isolated from Ageratum conyzoides L. and Mikania micrantha Kunth of Mizoram, Northeast India  ap. 355-358.  aThe objective of the present study was (1) to isolate endophytic bacteria from Ageratum conyzoides L. and Mikania micrantha Kunth of shifting cultivation in Mizoram, (2) screen in vitro their potential for plant growth-promoting (PGPR) activities and (3) to identify endophytic bacteria positive for PGPR. A total of 9 endophytic bacteria showed positive for PGPR properties. Potential PGPR endophytic bacteria were selected for further characterization of their genotype 16S rRNA sequencing. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that isolated bacteria belong to six different genus and five families. This study helps us to understand the diversity of the endophytic bacteria from the selected plants of shifting cultivation and strengthen our research on endophytes of their potential for PGPR activities. Survival of endophytic bacteria under unfavourable conditions is an indicative of their resistance for biotic and abiotic stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgeratum conyzoides 3aMikania micrantha 3aendophytes 3agenotype 3aIndia1 aIbrahim, Kalibulla Syed0 tNational Academy science letters.g2021 Aug., v. 44, no. 4 p.355-358dSpringer IndiawJournal:21643x0250-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40009-020-01013-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01928naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009500161300002000256500001900276520080200295592002801097650001901125650002101144650001501165650001801180650002901198700003001227700003301257700003001290700002401320700002701344773012401371856007401495852000901569655001201578IND60677170020221120133330.0191123e20191114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067717002DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra03896e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArgudo, Pablo G.10aSubtle chemical modification for enrichment of Fmoc-amino acid at a phospholipid interface  ap. 37188-37194.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAmino acids including the Fmoc group (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) are bioinspired molecules that display intriguing features in self-assembly and biological applications.

Support vector regression (SVR) approach applies a simple linear regression in the high-dimensional feature space (Hilbert space) by using kernel functions and has many attractive features and profound empirical performances for small sample, nonlinearity and high dimensional dataset. However, the SVR modeling processing has computation complexity of order O(K×N3) (where N is the size of the training dataset, and K is the evaluation number of the parameter selection process). To forecast short-term power load accurately, quickly and efficiently, a sequential grid approach based support vector regression (SGA-SVR) is proposed in this work. Specifically, for a given data set, parameter regression surface is conducted in SVR modeling processing with its forecasting performance as dependent variable and the three parameters (ε,C,γ) as independent variables. Then, a novel grid algorithm is presented to provide a new way for fitting the parameter regression surface. The statistical inference is also given by introducing the asymptotic normality of a fixed grid point of parameters. The numerical experiments using SGA-SVR model demonstrate the superiority over the standard SVR model and accuracy of forecast is greatly improved especially for short-term forecasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3aenergy transfer 3aincome elasticities 3amodels 3aprices 3aregression analysis 3astatistical inference 0aElectric load forecasting 0aSupport vector regression 0aSubsampling 0aSequential grid approach 0aModel selection1 aChe, Jinxing1 aDeng, Chengzhi1 aLi, Li0 tApplied energy.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 238 p.1010-1021dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04092naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245010600196500002000302520232500322592002802647596006602675596003802741596008402779650002002863650003002883650001902913650001202932650001902944650002002963650001302983650001502996650002503011650001103036650002103047650001603068650002103084650002103105650001503126650002303141650001503164650001803179700002403197700001503221700002303236700001903259700002103278700003303299773013403332856007503466852000903541655001203550IND60768609320221118034229.0220225e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076860932DNAL7 a10.1111/ejss.131492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJian, Jinshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5272-536710aOn the use of air temperature and precipitation as surrogate predictors in soil respiration modelling  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoil respiration (RS), the soil‐to‐atmosphere CO₂ flux that is a major component of the global carbon cycle, is strongly influenced by local soil temperature (Tₛₒᵢₗ) and water content (SWC). Regional to global‐scale RS modelling thus requires this information at local scales, but few high‐quality, wall‐to‐wall (global) Tₛₒᵢₗ and SWC data exist. As a result, such modelling efforts commonly use air temperature (Tₐᵢᵣ) and monthly precipitation (Pₘ) as surrogate predictors, but their site‐scale accuracy and potential bias are unknown. Here, we used monthly data from 880 sites across a wide variety of different environmental conditions (i.e., climate, ecosystem type, elevation, vegetation leaf habit and drainage conditions) to determine the suitability of Tₐᵢᵣ as a surrogate for Tₛₒᵢₗ, and data from 507 sites to examine the suitability of Pₘ as a surrogate for SWC. Site‐specific linear and second‐order exponential non‐linear models were compared using model evaluation metrics (i.e., slope, p‐value of slope, root mean square error [RMSE], index of agreement and model efficiency). We found that Tₛₒᵢₗ and Tₐᵢᵣ are highly correlated and explain similar RS variability. In contrast, Pₘ is not a good surrogate for SWC, even though Pₘ explains a similar amount of RS variability to SWC. The wide variability in the site‐specific relationships between RS and SWC means that no single relationship can be used for large‐scale modelling. The results from this study support the use of Tₐᵢᵣ in continental‐to‐global scale RS models, and highlight the urgent need for continental‐to‐global scale SWC datasets for the modelling and evaluation of future soil carbon dynamics under global climate change. HIGHLIGHTS: The accuracy of air temperature and precipitation as surrogates in global soil respiration modelling is unknown. Monthly air temperature and soil temperature are strongly correlated and explained similar amounts of variability in soil respiration. Relationships between precipitation and soil water content are extremely variable by region, thus precipitation is a poor surrogate in global modelling. There is a need for accurate multiscale soil moisture datasets to evaluate future soil carbon dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE‐AC05‐76RL01830cTerrestrial Ecosystem Sciences Program  a160060cVirginia Tech Hatch Grant  aXDA20040202cStrategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adrainage 3aecosystems 3aglobal carbon budget 3aleaves 3amodel validation 3asoil carbon 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3avegetation 3awater content1 aSteele, Meredith K.1 aZhang, Lin1 aBailey, Vanessa L.1 aZheng, Jianqiu1 aPatel, Kaizad F.1 aBond‐Lamberty, Benjamin P.0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2022 Jan., v. 73, no. 1 p.e13149-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl51589x1351-07547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.131493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012600166300001600292500001900308520231700327592002802644650001602672650001202688650001702700650001502717650001702732650001402749650001602763650001202779650002902791653001202820653001602832653002202848653002502870653002402895700001502919700005602934773011202990856008103102852000903183655001203192IND60686787420221116234740.0200318e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068678742DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311190025322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollema, B.

Reproductive traits were available between 2005 and 2014 for 7857 litters from 1029 Large White and 858 Landrace sows. In 2012 and 2013, Hb levels, sow BW and sow back fat depth were measured on 348 sows with 529 litters 5 days prior to farrowing. In addition, Hb levels were available for 1127 one-day-old piglets from 383 litters (a maximum of three piglets per litter) of 277 sows with Hb levels. The average Hb levels in sows (sow Hb), their litters (litter Hb, based on average Hb of three piglets) and individual piglets (piglet Hb) were 112 ± 12.6 g/l, 103 ± 15.3 g/l and 105 ± 21.7 g/l, respectively. Heritabilities for Hb levels were 0.09 ± 0.07 for sow Hb, 0.19 ± 0.11 for litter Hb and 0.08 ± 0.05 for piglet Hb. Estimates for the permanent environment effect of sows were 0.09 ± 0.09 for sow Hb, 0.11 ± 0.12 for litter Hb and 0.12 ± 0.03 for piglet Hb. In comparison, heritabilities for both number of stillborn piglets and pre-weaning survival were lower (0.05 ± 0.01 and 0.04 ± 0.01). Sow BW had no significant heritability, while sow back fat depth was lowly heritable (0.10 ± 0.08). Positive genetic correlations were found between sow Hb and litter Hb (0.64 ± 0.47) and between litter Hb and sow back fat depth (0.71 ± 0.53). Higher litter Hb was genetically associated with lower number of stillborn piglets (−0.78 ± 0.35) and higher pre-weaning survival (0.28 ± 0.33). Negative genetic correlations between sow Hb and average piglet birth weight of the litter (−0.60 ± 0.34) and between piglet Hb and birth weight of individual piglets (−0.37 ± 0.32) indicate that selection for heavier piglets may reduce Hb levels in sows and piglets. Similarly, selection for larger litter size will reduce average piglet birth weight (rg: −0.40 ± 0.12) and pre-weaning survival (−0.57 ± 0.13) and may lead to lower litter Hb (−0.48 ± 0.27). This study shows promising first results for the use of Hb levels as a selection criterion in pig breeding programs, and selection for higher Hb levels may improve piglet survival and limit further reduction in Hb levels in sows and piglets due to selection for larger and heavier litters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarge White 3abackfat 3abirth weight 3ahemoglobin 3aheritability 3alandraces 3alitter size 3apiglets 3areproductive performance 0aAnaemia 0ahaemoglobin 0astillborn piglets 0apre-weaning survival 0asow characteristics1 aZwiers, S.1 aHermesch, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9647-59880 tAnimal.g2020 Apr., v. 14, no. 4 p.688-696dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311190025323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010600156300001800262500002000280520224400300592002802544650001002572650001702582650001502599650001802614650001802632650002202650650001302672651002102685651001402706651001002720700002702730700002102757773010802778856007302886852000902959655001202968IND60580791620221123025926.0171001e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058079162DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.130412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFica, Eliseo10aGeneral spatial spectral variation in rocky intertidal communities from three biogeographical regions  ap. 2354-2364.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Understanding general spatial patterns of multiple species is a central aim of biogeography. Spatial analyses of coastal marine assemblages have shown an emergent pattern in that the variability in population abundances increases with increasing spatial scale of observation; i.e. a “red” spectrum of variation in population abundances. However, the generalization of these patterns to other ecological levels and across biogeographical regions remains unexplored. Here, we evaluate the consistency of a reddened relationship between the scale of observation and the variance in ecosystem properties in sessile intertidal rocky‐shore assemblages across three biogeographical regions. LOCATION: Replicate sites located in temperate (southern‐central Chile), sub‐Antarctic (Chilean South Patagonia) and Antarctic (West Antarctic Peninsula) regions. METHODS: A total of 16,225 photo‐quadrants were used to analyse local patterns of total community cover, bare substratum, total algal cover and total invertebrate cover. We used spectral analyses in which the spatial variance of each property was decomposed along a gradient of increasing distances between observations. Cross‐semivariograms were used to analyse the spatial covariation of dominant taxa. RESULTS: The analysed ecosystem properties showed a general reddened spectrum of variation that resembled patchy configurations of local communities. Additionally, cross‐semivariance analyses indicated mainly negative relationships of covariation between the abundances dominant sessile species at each site, suggesting a general trend of spatial asynchrony between competing species. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing a general reddened pattern of spatial variation in relevant ecosystem‐level properties across the Pacific shore of South America, southern Patagonia and West Antarctic Peninsula. These patterns reflect the result of multiple biotic and abiotic processes that interact across spatial scales. In particular, we suggest that processes that generate spatial asynchrony between competing species, such as compensatory dynamics, are relevant to maintain the spatial structure of rocky‐shore communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3abiogeography 3aecosystems 3ainvertebrates 3alittoral zone 3aspectral analysis 3avariance 3aAntarctic region 3aArgentina 3aChile1 aDíaz, Eliecer Rodrigo1 aValdivia, Nelson0 tJournal of biogeography.g2017 Oct., v. 44, no. 10 p.2354-2364dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.130413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01619naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007600157300002000233520052700253592002800780650001400808650003400822650000900856650002400865650001300889650001800902650001300920650001600933650002600949700001500975700001500990700001701005700001601022773012401038856007401162852000901236655001201245IND60677170120221120122959.0191123e20191114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067717012DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra03999f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoon, S.

The prepared ultraviolet (UV) detectors based on SnO₂ NAs have high responsivity and high external quantum efficiency (EQE) under 20 μW cm⁻² UV light with only 1 V external bias voltage.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetectors 3aelectric potential difference 3agold 3ahot water treatment 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3atin dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation1 aZhang, Tao1 aLu, Qiaoqi1 aWang, Weihao1 aYe, Zhizhen0 tRSC advances.g2019 Nov. 14, v. 9, no. 64 p.37201-37206dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra03999f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002800125040001800153100001500171245011600186300001800302506002800320506005700348506007600405506003100481520105000512592002801562596009901590596007601689506003701765650002701802650001401829650002501843650001601868650001601884650003101900650001001931650002101941650001901962650001401981650001201995650001502007650001702022650001602039650001702055650002802072650002102100700001602121700002102137700001602158700001802174700001802192700001802210773012502228856007502353903002402428852000902452655001202461IND60657932420221207121144.0190823e20190814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065793242DNAL7 a10.1039/c9fo00778d2chorus7 a10.1039/c9fo00778d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Yiren10atrans-Trismethoxy resveratrol decreased fat accumulation dependent on fat-6 and fat-7 in Caenorhabditis elegans  ap. 4966-4974.  aResource is Open Access  aRoyal Society of Chemistry (RSC) License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  atrans-Trismethoxy resveratrol (TMR) is a methyl analog of resveratrol. It is found to exhibit enhanced biological effects compared to resveratrol, such as inhibition of cancer cell growth and pro-apoptotic activities. However, the role of TMR in lipid metabolism is not fully understood. In this study, we used Caenorhabditis elegans, an in vivo nematode model which has been widely applied in disease research, including research on obesity, to investigate the effect of TMR on lipid metabolism. Treatment with TMR (100 and 200 μM) for 4 days significantly reduced triglyceride accumulation (14% and 20% reduction over the control, respectively) of C. elegans, without affecting nematode growth, food intake and reproduction. Treatment with TMR significantly downregulated stearoyl-CoA desaturase genes, fat-6 and fat-7, accompanied by a decrease in the desaturation index of fatty acids, the ratio of oleic acid to stearic acid. These results suggest that TMR inhibits fat accumulation by downregulating stearoyl-CoA desaturase in C. elegans.  aPublisher supplied data  cCooperative State Research Education and Extension Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007014  cUniversity of Massachusetts Amherstdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000089750 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aapoptosis 3abioactive properties 3acell growth 3afood intake 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alipid metabolism 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aobesity 3aoleic acid 3areproduction 3aresveratrol 3astearic acid 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3atriacylglycerols1 aShen, Peiyi1 aChang, Amanda L.1 aQi, Weipeng1 aKim, Kee-Hong1 aKim, Daeyoung1 aPark, Yeonhwa0 tFood & function.g2019 Aug. 14, v. 10, no. 8 p.4966-4974dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9fo00778d3Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle01080naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008400163300001200247500002200259520015100281592002800432650001800460650001700478650001700495700002100512700001700533700001800550773011900568856008200687852000900769655001200778IND60624958820221121045818.0191115e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062495882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-018-1779-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawata, Kei10aCorrection to: Effect of decay on shear performance of dowel-type timber joints  ap. 882.  aPublished Erratum  aThe article Effect of decay on shear performance of dowel-type timber joints, written by Kei Sawata, Takanobu Sasaki, Shuichi Doi and Yasuo Iijima  aPublisher supplied data 3ajoints (wood) 3ashear stress 3awood defects1 aSasaki, Takanobu1 aDoi, Shuichi1 aIijima, Yasuo0 tJournal of wood science.g2018 Dec., v. 64, no. 6 p.882-882dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-018-1779-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245015100162300001600313520127400329592002801603650003401631650001301665650001401678650001901692650002201711650001701733700001601750700001601766700001701782773009001799852000901889856008101898930003301979946001102012655001202023IND4415074120221119095045.0160903e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441507412DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-008-0824-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lihong10aFingerprint Comparison Between Gegen Qinlian Preparations of Three Different Pharmaceutical Forms Including Decoction, Dispensing Granule and Pill  ap. 123-127.  aGegen Qinlian decoction, a favorite composite formula of Chinese medicine, has been made into various formulations. Pill and dispensing granule are currently very popular dosage forms for oral application. To ensure consistent therapeutic effects, fingerprint comparison between Gegen Qinlian preparations of three pharmaceutical forms including decoction, dispensing granule and pill is carried out to investigate influence of dosage forms on patterns of components in the composite formula. The fingerprint analysis demonstrates that, in relationship to baicalin with its area set to 1, most of the area ratios of 20 common peaks in decoction and dispensing granule vary little except the area ratio of puerarin (0.805 in decoction vs. 0.593 in dispensing granule), berberine (0.400 in dispensing granule vs. 0.283 in decoction) and the peak of baicalein, which originally observed in dispensing granule decrease substantially in decoction. However, in pills the area ratios of the common peaks are significantly different from those in dispensing granule except for peak 29. The inconsistencies among patterns of components in three types of Gegen Qinlian preparations, especially between dispensing granule and pill, may result in different pharmacological effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3abaicalin 3aberberine 3achromatography 3adrug formulations 3atherapeutics1 aLiu, Jining1 aWang, Qiang1 aChen, Jiahui0 tChromatographia.g2009 Jan., v. 69, no. 1-2 p.123-127dVieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-008-0824-y3Available from publisher's site  a20090120b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02189naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245006000166500001900226520103700245592002801282650001701310650001901327650002301346650001301369650001401382650001101396650001701407650001401424653001301438653001401451653002401465653001901489653001001508653000901518700006101527773010801588856008601696852000901782655001201791IND60729017620221121222458.0210322e20210510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072901762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1100452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKesh, Hari10aAdvances in melon (Cucumis melo L.) breeding: An update  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMelon (Cucumis melo L.) a member of family Cucurbitaceae is extensively cultivated for its fleshy fruits. Dependent upon the agroclimatic zones of cultivation along with the local preferences, melon displays substantial variability for phenotypic and biochemical attributes. Melon breeding has attained serious milestones throughout the prior century, and we hope this trend goes on to persist. However, experiments have to understand new genetic information for genes associated with the challenges imposed by climate change. The identification of useful genetic and metabolic variability in the form of landraces and wild relatives is helping for harvest diversification and broadening of the cultivated melon genetic base. Whereas significant information on melon genomics, and melon metabolomics, is advantageous for dissecting the inheritance of quintessential traits. Overall, this manuscript summarized details on development in melon breeding we hope this manuscript will act as an important resource for the melon breeders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis melo 3aclimate change 3agenetic background 3agenomics 3alandraces 3amelons 3ametabolomics 3aphenotype 0aBreeding 0aDiversity 0aGenetic engineering 0aMale sterility 0aMelon 0aQTLs1 aKaushik, Prashant1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3145-28490 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 May 10, v. 282 p.110045-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1100453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012300169300001600292520138200308592002801690596005701718650002501775650001801800650001901818650001701837650001301854650002201867650000901889650001401898650002001912650001101932650001901943650002101962650001901983650000902002650001002011650002102021700003002042700001702072700001602089773011902105856008202224852000902306655001202315IND60624958920221121045816.0191115e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062495892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-018-1752-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakada, Masatsugu10aCharacterization of lignin-derived products from various lignocellulosics as treated by semi-flow hot-compressed water  ap. 802-809.  aTo elucidate the decomposition behaviors of lignin from different taxonomic groups, five different lignocellulosics were treated with hot-compressed water (230 °C/10 MPa/15 min) to fractionate lignins into water-soluble portions, precipitates, and insoluble residues. The lignin-derived products in each fraction were characterized and compared. The delignification of monocotyledons [nipa palm (Nypa fruticans) frond, rice (Oryza sativa) straw, and corn (Zea mays) cob] was more extensive than that achieved for Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica, gymnosperm) and Japanese beech (Fagus crenata, dicotyledon angiosperm). The water-soluble portions contained lignin monomers like coniferyl alcohol and phenolic acids, while the precipitates contained higher molecular weight lignin with high content of ether-type linkages. Lignin in the insoluble residues was rich in condensed-type structures. In all five lignocellulosics, ether-type linkages were preferentially cleaved, while condensed-type lignin showed resistance to hot-compressed water. In the monocotyledons, lignin–carbohydrate complexes were cleaved and gave lignins that had higher molecular weights than those eluted from the woods. These differences would facilitate the delignification in monocotyledons. Such information provides useful information for efficient utilization of various lignocellulosics.  aPublisher supplied data  a16J11212cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aCryptomeria japonica 3aFagus crenata 3aNypa fruticans 3aOryza sativa 3aZea mays 3aconiferyl alcohol 3acorn 3acorn cobs 3adelignification 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amolecular weight 3aphenolic acids 3arice 3astraw 3awater solubility1 aRabemanolontsoa, Harifara1 aMinami, Eiji1 aSaka, Shiro0 tJournal of wood science.g2018 Dec., v. 64, no. 6 p.802-809dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-018-1752-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01774naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001700180245011200197300001800309506007600327520058100403592002800984506003701012650001201049650001201061650002301073650000901096650001301105650001801118650001201136700001801148700001801166773013201184856007501316852000901391655001201400IND60539176120221207093401.0160815e20140625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053917612DNAL7 a10.1021/ja503909c2doi7 aPMC40890652pmcid7 a249111582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhixun10aSoft Propargylic Deprotonation: Designed Ligand Enables Au-Catalyzed Isomerization of Alkynes to 1,3-Dienes  ap. 8887-8890.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBy functionalizing the privileged biphenyl-2-ylphosphine with a basic amino group at the rarely explored 3′ position, the derived gold(I) complex possesses orthogonally positioned “push” and “pull” forces, which enable for the first time soft propargylic deprotonation and permit the bridging of a difference of >26 pKₐ units (in DMSO) between a propargylic hydrogen and a protonated tertiary aniline.

Lamin B receptor (LBR) is such a protein implicated in chromatin anchorage to the nuclear envelope. METHODS: Molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the conformation of two LBR peptides containing four (human-) and five (turkey-orthologue) consecutive RS dipeptides, in their unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms and of a conserved peptide, in isolation and in complex with SRPK1. GST pull-down assays were employed to study LBR interactions. RESULTS: Unphosphorylated RS repeats adopt short, transient helical conformations, whereas serine phosphorylation induces Arginine-claw-like structures. The SRSRSRSPGR peptide, overlapping with the LBR RS repeats, docks into the known, acidic docking groove of SRPK1, in an extended conformation. Phosphorylation by SRPK1 is necessary for the association of LBR with histone H3. CONCLUSIONS: The C-terminal region of the LBR RS domain constitutes a recognition platform for SRPK1, which uses the same recognition mechanism for LBR as for substrates with long RS domains. This docking may promote unfolding of the RS repeats destined to be phosphorylated. Phosphorylation induces Arginine-claw-like conformations, irrespective of the RS-repeat length, that may facilitate interactions with basic partners. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our results shed light on the conformational preferences of an important class of repeats before and after their phosphorylation and support the idea that even short RS domains may be constituents of recognition platforms for SRPK1, thus adding to knowledge towards a full understanding of their phosphorylation mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnimalia 3aarginine 3achromatin 3adipeptides 3ahistones 3amolecular dynamics 3anuclear membrane 3aphosphorylation 3aserine1 aDrosou, Victoria1 aVlachakis, Dimitrios P.,1 aVoukkalis, Nikolas1 aGiannakouros, Thomas1 aVlassi, Metaxia0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 Jan., v. 1820, no. 1 p.44-55dElsevier B.V.x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245014900160300001800309500002000327520138400347592002801731650002001759650001001779650000801789650001801797650002201815650001001837650001501847650001901862650003301881650001201914650001401926650001901940650002001959651001101979651001101990700001802001700002202019700003002041700003002071773010802101856007302209852000902282655001202291IND60580791920221123025822.0171001e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058079192DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.130272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMíguez, Mónica10aCarex sect. Rhynchocystis (Cyperaceae): a Miocene subtropical relict in the Western Palaearctic showing a dispersal‐derived Rand Flora pattern  ap. 2211-2224.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: To evaluate how Cenozoic climate changes shaped the evolution and distribution of Carex section Rhynchocystis. LOCATION: Western Palaearctic and Afrotropical regions (Rand Flora pattern). METHODS: DNA regions ITS, ETS (nuclear), matK and rpl32‐trnLᵁᴬᴳ (plastid) were amplified for 86 samples of species from section Rhynchocystis. Phylogenetic and phylogeographical relationships were inferred using maximum parsimony, Bayesian inference and coalescent‐based species tree approaches. Divergence times and ancestral areas were also inferred. RESULTS: Carex section Rhynchocystis is a clade that diversified during the middle Miocene in Europe. Most cladogenesis events date to the middle and late Miocene. The Afrotropical group seems to have originated from a colonization event from Europe that occurred in the late Miocene. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Species of the section Rhynchocystis in the Western Palaearctic are Miocene relicts. Late Miocene‐Pliocene aridification of the Mediterranean rather than the more commonly reported Pleistocene glaciations seems to have shaped the phylogeography of the group. Putative Miocene‐Pliocene refugia were probably located in the Mediterranean peninsulas and islands, as well as in the eastern shores of the ancient Paratethys Sea. The colonization of Africa could have been facilitated by Miocene‐Pliocene global cooling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aCarex 3aDNA 3aMiocene epoch 3aPalearctic region 3aflora 3aglaciation 3aglobal cooling 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aislands 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3arefuge habitats 3aAfrica 3aEurope1 aGehrke, Berit1 aMaguilla, Enrique1 aJiménez‐Mejías, Pedro1 aMartín‐Bravo, Santiago0 tJournal of biogeography.g2017 Oct., v. 44, no. 10 p.2211-2224dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.130273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04357naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002500169245011300194300001600307520165700323592002801980650001902008650002802027650001702055650001202072650001502084650003802099650001602137650001102153650002802164650001702192650002302209650001302232650002402245650002702269650001802296650001402314650001702328650002202345650000902367650002802376650001302404650001702417650001202434650005402446650005302500650003302553650003002586650002402616650002702640650004102667650002502708650005802733650007802791650000902869650005502878650002602933650004802959650002503007650004703032650002503079650003903104650000903143650001703152650003503169700001703204700001703221700002003238700002103258700002003279773011203299856008403411990002303495852000903518655001203527IND60097876120221118064050.0141104e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009787612DNAL7 a228197072pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar Sharma, Dinesh10aNovel diallyldisulfide analogs ameliorate cardiovascular remodeling in rats with L-NAME-induced hypertension  ap. 198-208.  aDiallyldisulfide (DADS), an active principle of garlic (Allium sativum) is known for its antihypertensive properties. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of novel DADS analogs, against L-NAME induced hypertension in Wistar rats. The daily administration of L-NAME (50mg/kg) for six weeks along with DADS analogs (20mg/kg) significantly decreased the elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and also inhibited the decline in nitrite/nitrate (NOₓ) concentrations and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels. Adverse changes such as lipid peroxidation, protein damage and a decrease in the levels of antioxidant enzymes, were rectified after the administration of DADS analogs. Oral administration of DADS analogs preserved the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The ability of the DADS analogs to inhibit L-NAME induced hypertension was compared with Enalapril (15mg/kg), which was taken as a standard. The DADS analogs prevented L-NAME-induced cardio toxicity, which was also reflected at the microscopic level indicative of its cardio protective effects. DADS analogs induced vasorelaxation was completely abolished by the removal of the endothelium or by pre-treatment with L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. DADS analogs inhibited the calcium influx induced by phenylephrine (0.3μM) and high K⁺ (60mM) and this effect was completely abolished by pretreatment of L-NAME. Taken together, our results show that the DADS analogs induce vasorelaxation and have antihypertensive properties, which may be mediated through activation of eNOS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium sativum 3aantihypertensive effect 3aantioxidants 3acalcium 3acyclic GMP 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3aendothelium 3agarlic 3aguanosine monophosphate 3ahypertension 3alipid peroxidation 3anitrates 3aoral administration 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aphenylephrine 3apotassium 3apretreatment 3aprotective effect 3arats 3asystolic blood pressure 3atoxicity 3avasodilation 2aAnimals 2aAntihypertensive Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aAortaxdrug effectsxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effects 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCyclic GMPxmetabolism 2aDisulfidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxdrug effects 2aHypertensionxchemically inducedxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aMuscle, Smooth, Vascularxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aMyocardiumxpathology 2aNG-Nitroarginine Methyl Esterxpharmacology 2aNitratesxmetabolism 2aNitric Oxide Synthase Type IIIxmetabolism 2aNitritesxmetabolism 2aPeptidyl-Dipeptidase Axmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aVasoconstrictionxdrug effects1 aManral, Apra1 aSaini, Vikas1 aSingh, Avninder1 aSrinivasan, B.P.1 aTiwari, Manisha0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 691, no. 1-3 p.198-208dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.07.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013800159300001800297520136700315592002801682650001201710650001301722650002201735650002801757650001201785650001301797650001701810650001001827650002001837650001901857650002201876650001501898650002701913650001701940650001401957650001701971700001701988700001402005773013902019856007402158852000902232655001202241IND60618547720221120133952.0181030e20180307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061854772DNAL7 a10.1039/c7tb02592k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Jianchuan10aSalivary polypeptide/hyaluronic acid multilayer coatings act as “fungal repellents” and prevent biofilm formation on biomaterials  ap. 1452-1457.  aCandida-associated denture stomatitis (CADS) is a common, recurring clinical complication in denture wearers that can lead to serious oral and systemic health problems. Current management strategies are not satisfactory due to their short-acting and ineffective therapeutic effects. Here, we describe a new fungal biofilm controlling strategy using the polyelectrolyte layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly technology on denture materials. Conventional poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) denture material discs were functionalized with negatively charged poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) via plasma-initiated surface grafting, followed by repetitive alternating coating with the salivary antimicrobial polypeptide histatin 5 (H-5; cationic polymer) and hyaluronic acid (HA; anionic polymer). On the other hand, the H-5/HA LBL coatings (i.e., the outermost layer was H-5) inhibited fungal attachment/adhesion, significantly reduced fungal biofilm formation, and showed synergistic effects with the antifungal drug miconazole. LBL surface hydrophilicity was not the key mechanism in controlling Candida biofilm formation. The current approach demonstrates the utility of a new design principle for fabricating anticandidal denture materials, as well as potentially other related medical devices, for controlling fungal biofilm formation and combating insidious infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida 3aadhesion 3aantifungal agents 3abiocompatible materials 3abiofilm 3acoatings 3aelectrolytes 3afungi 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrophilicity 3amedical equipment 3amiconazole 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3apolypeptides 3asynergism 3atherapeutics1 aYeh, Chih-Ko1 aSun, Yuyu0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Mar. 7, v. 6, no. 10 p.1452-1457dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7tb02592k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005200152245010600204300001800310520117300328592002801501650001501529650002201544650002501566650001601591650001301607650001901620650001501639650001501654650001501669650001801684653002201702653001801724653001601742653002401758653002701782653002901809700001501838700001801853700001601871700001101887773010001898856008701998852000902085655001202094IND60628487120221119101420.0190325e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062848712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.1802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9412-099910aUncertainty estimation for wind energy conversion by probabilistic wind turbine power curve modelling  ap. 1356-1370.  aThis paper proposes probabilistic wind turbine power curve (WTPC) models to quantify the uncertainties of energy conversion and highly scattered relationships of actual wind speed to power. First, new model inputs (i.e. pitch angle and wind direction) and novel data clearing methods are presented to improve the model accuracy, which is rare in the previous studies. Second, the models are established based on three nonparametric algorithms, i.e. Monte Carlo, neural network, and fuzzy clustering. Third, to fill the research gap on model evaluation, the desirable properties of a probabilistic WTPC model are defined as expected variance ratio (EVR), and this index is formulated by calculating the cumulative gaps between the simulated and actual power distribution in each wind speed segment. Data from two Chinese wind farms are used to validate and compare the proposed methods using the mainstream deterministic index and the proposed EVR. Results show that (i) new model inputs and data clearing methods are able to improve the accuracy for probabilistic models regardless of the afterwards modelling method; (ii) fuzzy outperforms other probabilistic models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy conversion 3aprobabilistic models 3auncertainty 3avariance 3awind direction 3awind farms 3awind power 3awind speed 3awind turbines 0aEnergy conversion 0aData clearing 0aPitch angle 0aProbabilistic model 0aUncertainty estimation 0aWind turbine power curve1 aZhang, Hao1 aLiu, Yongqian1 aHan, Shuang1 aLi, Li0 tApplied energy.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 239 p.1356-1370dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.1803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03874naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011400160300001800274500002000292520219400312592002802506650001902534650001102553650001702564650001502581650001502596650001302611650001102624650001402635650001102649650002002660650001202680650002202692650001602714650001002730651002202740651002802762651001102790651002902801700001602830700002902846700002402875700001902899700002002918700002102938700002702959700002702986700002003013700002103033700002103054700001903075773010803094856007303202852000903275655001203284IND60580792020221123012536.0171001e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058079202DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.130382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamrichová, Eva10aPollen‐inferred millennial changes in landscape patterns at a major biogeographical interface within Europe  ap. 2386-2397.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: The regional co‐occurrence of contrasting bioclimatic elements (warm‐temperate, continental, boreal, arctic‐alpine) may be shaped by the distribution of their glacial or post‐glacial refugia. We tested this hypothesis using pollen proxies in a region where such refugia are expected, but not unequivocally demonstrated. LOCATION: East‐Central Europe (Western Carpathians and adjacent regions). METHODS: We compiled pollen spectra from 112 sites distributed across various landscapes for six time‐periods from the Late Glacial to the present. Compositional patterns were assessed by principal coordinates analyses (PCoA) with a sensitivity analysis based on a bootstrap technique. Site PCoA scores were interpolated geographically and correlated with palaeoclimatic models. RESULTS: Consistently over the last 15,000 years, the first ordination axis sorted samples according to the proportion of deciduous temperate trees, while the second axis consistently followed an altitudinal gradient that coincided with temperature. The principal gradient was more important than the altitudinal gradient except for the Late Glacial and Bronze & Iron Ages, when both gradients were of similar importance. The fine‐grained pattern in the present mountain landscape was formed as late as during early modern colonization. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Since the Late Glacial, the landscape has been differentiated into temperate, continental and cold regions. This finding supports the hypothesis that refugia are a key factor for understanding current biogeography in Central Europe. The Late Glacial occurrence of temperate trees is unlikely to be explained only by gradual migrations from southern Europe. Humid but relatively warm mountains hence might have acted as glacial refugia of temperate forest species, while lowlands and leeward basins might have acted as post‐glacial refugia of steppe grasslands. The strong contrast between forested (temperate) and more open continental landscapes during the Early Holocene seems to correspond with recent diversity patterns. Our results highlight the relevance of integrating past landscape trajectories into modern biogeographical models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3abasins 3abiogeography 3acold zones 3alandscapes 3alowlands 3amodels 3amountains 3apollen 3arefuge habitats 3asteppes 3atemperate forests 3atemperature 3atrees 3aCarpathian region 3aCentral European region 3aEurope 3aSouthern European region1 aPetr, Libor1 aJiménez‐Alfaro, Borja1 aJankovská, Vlasta,1 aDudová, Lydie1 aPokorný, Petr,1 aKołaczek, Piotr1 aZernitskaya, Valentina1 aČierniková, Malvína1 aBřízová, Eva1 aSyrovátka, Vít1 aHájková, Petra1 aHájek, Michal0 tJournal of biogeography.g2017 Oct., v. 44, no. 10 p.2386-2397dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.130383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245013900174300001600313520131600329592002801645650001101673650002001684650001501704650001901719650003801738650001301776650001701789650002201806650002001828650001401848650002101862650001301883650005801896650001301954653002201967653001401989653002302003653005402026700002202080773012202102856008202224852000902306655001202315IND60533063020221120170023.0160728e20140926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053306302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.08.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcPherson, Peter A.C.10a3,4-Dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine as a biomarker of oxidative damage in proteins: Improved detection using cloud-point extraction and HPLC  ap. 376-381.  aOxidized protein adducts are formed under conditions of oxidative stress and may represent a valuable biomarker for a variety of diseases which share this common aetiology. A suitable candidate biomarker for oxidized proteins is protein-bound 3,4-dihydroxyl-l-phenylalanine (l-DOPA), which is formed on 3′-hydroxylation of tyrosine residues by hydroxyl radicals. Existing methodologies to measure protein-bound l-DOPA employ lengthy acid hydrolysis steps (ca. 16h) which may cause artifactual protein oxidation, followed by HPLC with detection based on the intrinsic fluorescence of l-DOPA. We report a novel method for the measurement of protein-bound l-DOPA which involves rapid hydrolysis followed by pre-column concentration of 6-aminoquinolyl-derivatives using cloud-point extraction. The derivatized material is resolved by reversed-phase HPLC in less than 30min and has derivatization chemistry compatible with both UV and fluorescent detection, providing detection down to the femtomole level. The method provides identical results to those found with highly specific ELISA-based techniques and requires only basic instrumentation. The stability of the 6-aminoquinolyl-derivatives together with the fast and sensitive nature of the assay will be appealing to those who require large sample throughput.  aPublisher supplied data 3aL-dopa 3aacid hydrolysis 3abiomarkers 3aderivatization 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aetiology 3afluorescence 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ainstrumentation 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aproteins 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3atyrosine 0aProtein oxidation 0aBiomarker 0aProtein hydrolysis 0a6-Aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxyl-succinimidyl carbamate1 aTüremen, Bryn T.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Sept. 26, v. 452 p.376-381dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.08.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245008100174300001600255520142200271592002801693650001401721650001901735650001401754650001601768650001301784650002001797650001901817650001501836650001201851650001201863650001201875700002401887700002701911700002201938700001901960773012101979856008202100852000902182655001202191IND60744232320221121032454.0210710e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074423232DNAL7 a10.1007/s40009-020-00998-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRathore, Neeraj Kumar10aImage Forgery Detection Using Singular Value Decomposition with Some Attacks  ap. 331-338.  aTo improve the trustworthiness to assess the digital images by identifying authentic images and tampered images, this work is focused on Copy-Move based image Forgery Detection (CMFD) and classification using Improved Relevance Vector Machine (IRVM). In this paper, Biorthogonal Wavelet Transform with Singular Value Decomposition (BWT-SVD)-based feature extraction is applied to find the image forgery. The proposed method begins with dividing the test images into overlapping blocks, and then Biorthogonal Wavelet Transform (BWT) with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) applies to extract the feature vector from the blocks. After that, the feature vectors are sorts and the duplicate vectors are identified by the similarity between two successive vectors. The occurrences of clone vectors are identified on the basis of Minkowski distance and the threshold value. Then, similarity criteria result in the existence of forgery in images. To classify images into the category of authentic images or forged images, improved version of Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) uses, which leads to efficiency and accuracy of forged image identification process. Performance of proposed scheme tests by performing experiments on CoMoFoD database. The simulation results show that the proposed IRVM scheme attained high performance when compared with existing Copy-Move based image Forgery Detection schemes in MATLAB environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3adigital images 3aequipment 3aexhibitions 3aextracts 3agenetic vectors 3aimage analysis 3aoccurrence 3asorting 3atesting 3awavelet1 aJain, Neelesh Kumar1 aShukla, Prashant Kumar1 aRawat, UmaShankar1 aDubey, Rachana0 tNational Academy science letters.g2021 Aug., v. 44, no. 4 p.331-338dSpringer IndiawJournal:21643x0250-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40009-020-00998-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04366naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245016400189300001600353520187000369592002802239650001802267650001602285650001202301650001002313650002002323650001802343650002002361650001302381650001702394650001702411650000902428650001402437650001702451650003202468650001302500650001202513650007302525650006502598650002702663650004402690650003102734650002502765650005702790650000902847650003502856650002902891650002702920650000902947650002502956650006202981650001703043650003903060650004903099650003903148700002103187700002203208700002103230700002003251700002503271700002003296700002303316700002003339700002103359773011203380856008403492990002303576852000903599655001203608IND60097876420221118063904.0141104e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009787642DNAL7 a227966762pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.06.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÉrces, Dániel10aN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist therapy suppresses colon motility and inflammatory activation six days after the onset of experimental colitis in rats  ap. 225-234.  aWe set out to investigate the time-dependent colon motility and inflammatory changes in a rodent model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in order to estimate the efficacy of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist therapy administered 6 day after the acute inflammatory event. Anaesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to control (n=6) or colitis groups (n=18). The endogenous NMDA receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (n=6) or the synthetic analog SZR-72 (n=6) was administered 6 day after TNBS induction. Large bowel motility parameters, macrohaemodynamics and serosal microcirculatory changes were recorded; the severity of colonic damage was monitored by using in vivo confocal laser endomicroscopy. Nitrite/nitrate and nitrotyrosine levels, and xanthine oxidoreductase and myeloperoxidase activities were determined on colon biopsies; plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were compared with those under control and 1-day colitis (n=6) conditions. TNBS induction elevated the tissue inflammatory enzyme activities, proinflammatory cytokine release, and nitrite/nitrate and nitrotyrosine formation. The microscopic vascular and mucosal lesions were accompanied by significant increases in serosal microcirculation and frequent intestinal movements 6 day after colitis. The NMDA receptor antagonist treatments significantly decreased the signs of inflammatory activation and the levels of nitric oxide end-products, normalized the microcirculation and the rate of bowel movements in both NMDA receptor antagonist-treated colitis groups. Blockade of the enteric NMDA receptors 6 day after colitis induction concurrently influenced NO production-linked nitrosative stress and colon dysmotility and may therefore offer a possibility via which to inhibit the progression of inflammatory changes in the later phase of TNBS colitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantagonists 3acolitis 3acolon 3aenzyme activity 3ainterleukin-6 3amyeloperoxidase 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3apharmacology 3arats 3areceptors 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3axanthine 2aAnimals 2aColitisxchemically inducedxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aColonxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aGastrointestinal Motilityxdrug effects 2aHemodynamicsxdrug effects 2aInterleukin-6xblood 2aKynurenic Acidxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aMale 2aMicrocirculationxdrug effects 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aPeroxidasexmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartatexantagonists & inhibitors 2aTime Factors 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxblood 2aTyrosinexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aXanthine Dehydrogenasexmetabolism1 aVarga, Gabriella1 aFazekas, Borbála1 aKovács, Tamás,1 aTőkés, Tünde1 aTiszlavicz, László1 aFülöp, Ferenc1 aVécsei, László,1 aBoros, Mihály,1 aKaszaki, József0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 691, no. 1-3 p.225-234dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.06.0443Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016300168300001600331520129900347592002801646650001101674650002301685650001201708650001301720650001901733650001101752700001501763700001301778700001901791700001701810773010401827856008401931852000902015655001202024IND60111958420221116154653.0141110e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011195842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jingjing10aInfluence of the pathogenic mutations T188K/R/A on the structural stability and misfolding of human prion protein: Insight from molecular dynamics simulations  ap. 116-123.  aBACKGROUND: Prion diseases are associated with a conformational switch for PrP from PrPC to PrPSᶜ. Many genetic mutations are linked with prion diseases, such as mutations T188K/R/A with fCJD. SCOPE OF REVIEW: MD simulations for the WT PrP and its mutants were performed to explore the underlying dynamic effects of T188 mutations on human PrP. Although the globular domains are fairly conserved, the three mutations have diverse effects on the dynamics properties of PrP, including the shift of H1, the elongation of native β-sheet and the conversion of S2–H2 loop to a 3₁₀ helix. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Our present study indicates that the three mutants for PrP may undergo different pathogenic mechanisms and the realistic atomistic simulations can provide insights into the effects of disease-associated mutations on PrP dynamics and stability, which can enhance our understanding of how mutations induce the conversion from PrPC to PrPSᶜ. General significance Our present study helps to understand the effects of T188K/R/A mutations on human PrP: despite the three pathogenic mutations almost do not alter the native structure of PrP, but perturb its stability. This instability may further modulate the oligomerization pathways and determine the features of the PrPSᶜ assemblies.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 3amolecular dynamics 3amutants 3amutation 3aprion diseases 3aprions1 aNing, Lulu1 aRen, Hui1 aLiu, Huanxiang1 aYao, Xiaojun0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 Feb., v. 1820, no. 2 p.116-123dElsevier B.V.x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245010300165300001800268520121400286592002801500650001601528650002001544650001201564650001101576650002001587653002901607653002901636653002701665653001701692653002201709700005701731700001301788700001801801700001401819773010001833856008701933852000902020655001202029IND60628487420221119101518.0190326e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062848742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.1462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Wei10aDetermination of Transfer Capacity Region of Tie Lines in Electricity Markets: Theory and Analysis  ap. 1441-1458.  aIn power industries, it is a common practice to use an equivalent model of the external power network in an optimization model of the internal power network in order to protect data privacy. However, existing equivalent models cannot accurately consider the operational constraints of an external power network. In this paper, a unified equivalent model is proposed to precisely capture the transfer capacity region of tie lines. The operational constraints of the external power network are preserved via multi-parametric programming. The operational costs of the external power network are formulated as an explicit function of power transmission on tie lines. This unified equivalent model can consider both AC and DC tie lines. The intuitive difference between the transfer capacity of AC and DC tie lines is revealed from a new perspective. On this basis, a market model for the internal power network with the equivalence of the operational constraints for the external power network is presented. Two typical trading modes are considered: the bulk sale mode and the direct power purchase mode. The exact convex relaxation formulation of the market model is derived under the direct power purchase mode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy industry 3amarkets 3amodels 3aoperating costs 0aTransfer capacity region 0aUnified equivalent model 0aOperational constraint 0aMarket model 0aConvex relaxation1 aYang, Zhifang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6899-83031 aYu, Juan1 aYang, Gaofeng1 aWen, Lili0 tApplied energy.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 239 p.1441-1458dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.1463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245017000153300002000323500001900343520128100362592002801643650001401671650002501685650001301710650001001723650001201733650001701745650001701762650001901779650001201798650001701810650002601827700001901853700001801872700001301890700001701903700001801920700002001938773012401958856007402082852000902156655001202165IND60677170920221120123022.0191123e20191119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067717092DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra06136c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yang10aLong non-coding RNA TUG1 alleviates high glucose induced podocyte inflammation, fibrosis and apoptosis in diabetic nephropathy via targeting the miR-27a-3p/E2F3 axis  ap. 37620-37629.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDiabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in developed countries. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) is associated with mitochondrial function in podocytes in DN. However, the detailed mechanism of TUG1 in DN has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we found that the expression levels of TUG1 and E2F transcription factor 3 (E2F3) were downregulated, and microRNA-27a-3p (miR-27a-3p) level was upregulated in DN tissues and HG-treated podocytes. Function analysis indicated that TUG1 overexpression inhibited inflammation, fibrosis and apoptosis in HG-induced podocytes. Rescue experiments demonstrated that miR-27a-3p reversed the suppression effects of TUG1 on apoptosis, fibrosis and inflammation in HG-stimulated podocytes, while E2F3 abrogated the promotion effects of miR-27a-3p on apoptosis, fibrosis and inflammation in HG-induced podocytes. Mechanical analysis revealed that TUG1 regulated E2F3 expression via sponging miR-27a-3p. In conclusion, our findings suggested that TUG1 alleviates high glucose induced inflammation, fibrosis and podocyte apoptosis in diabetic nephropathy via targeting the miR-27a-3p/E2F3 axis, providing a potential therapeutic target for treatment of DN.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3adiabetic nephropathy 3afibrosis 3agenes 3aglucose 3ainflammation 3amitochondria 3anon-coding RNA 3ataurine 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factors1 aHuang, Denggao1 aZheng, Linlin1 aCao, Hui1 aGao, Yuanhui1 aYang, Yongmei1 aFan, Zhongcheng0 tRSC advances.g2019 Nov. 19, v. 9, no. 64 p.37620-37629dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra06136c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03796naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002400169245009600193300001600289520189300305592002802198650002602226650001802252650001202270650002202282650001102304650001702315650002602332650001802358650002302376650002702399650001002426650003302436650002702469650002902496650003402525650001102559650002402570650000902594650003602603650002902639650006302668650004702731650004602778650003502824650001602859650002902875700002702904700002402931700002302955773011202978856008403090990002303174852000903197655001203206IND60097876520221118063909.0141104e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009787652DNAL7 a228009342pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJansakul, Chaweewan10aRelaxant mechanisms of 3, 5, 7, 3′, 4′-pentamethoxyflavone on isolated human cavernosum  ap. 235-244.  aWe have investigated effects and mechanisms responsible for the activity of 3, 5, 7, 3′, 4′-pentamethoxyflavone (PMF) on isolated human cavernosum. PMF is the major flavone isolated from Kaempferia parviflora claimed to act as an aphrodisiac. PMF caused relaxation of phenylephrine precontracted human cavernosal strips, and this effect was slightly inhibited by Nᴳ-nitro-l-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, but not by ODQ (soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor), TEA (tetraethylammonium, blocker of voltage-dependent K⁺ channels) or glybenclamide (blocker of ATP-dependent K⁺ channels). PMF did not significantly inhibit the relaxant activity of glyceryltrinitrate or acetylcholine on human cavernosal strips precontracted with phenylephrine. In contrast, sildenafil (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) potentiated the relaxant activity of glyceryl trinitrate but not of acetylcholine. In normal Krebs solution with nifedipine (blocker of l-type Ca²⁺ channels), or in Ca²⁺-free Krebs solution, PMF caused a further inhibition of human cavernosum contracted with phenylephrine. In human cavernosum treated with thapsigargin (inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase) in Ca²⁺-free medium, PMF suppressed the concentration–response curve of human cavernosum to phenylephrine and a further suppression was found when SKF-96365 (a blocker of store-operated Ca²⁺ channels and Y-27632 (inhibitor of Rho-kinase)), but not nifedipine, were added sequentially. Thus, PMF had only a weak effect on the release of nitric oxide, and had no effect as a KATP- or KCₐ channel opener, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, a store-operated Ca²⁺ channel blocker or a Rho-kinase inhibitor. Therefore, these studies suggest that PMF causes relaxation of human cavernosum through voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels and other mechanisms associated with calcium mobilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKaempferia parviflora 3aacetylcholine 3acalcium 3aguanylate cyclase 3ahumans 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3aphenylephrine 3apotassium channels 3asarcoplasmic reticulum 2aAdult 2aCalcium Channelsxmetabolism 2aFlavonesxpharmacology 2aFlavonoidsxpharmacology 2aGuanylate Cyclasexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMale 2aMuscle Relaxationxdrug effects 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aPenisxblood supplyxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPhosphodiesterase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aPhosphoric Diester Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aPotassium Channelsxmetabolism 2aYoung Adult 2aZingiberaceaexchemistry1 aTachanaparuksa, Kuldej1 aMulvany, Michael J.1 aSukpondma, Youwapa0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 691, no. 1-3 p.235-244dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.07.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007600167300001600243520141600259592002801675650002201703650001201725650001101737650001701748650002401765650001901789650002101808650001301829650000901842700001501851700001601866700001601882700002101898700001501919773010401934856008402038852000902122655001202131IND60111958520221116154710.0141110e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011195852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrotta, R.10aInhibiting effect of αₛ₁-casein on Aβ₁–₄₀ fibrillogenesis  ap. 124-132.  aBACKGROUND: αₛ₁-Casein is one of the four types of caseins, the largest protein component of bovine milk. The lack of a compact folded conformation and the capability to form micelles suggest a relationship of αₛ₁-casein with the class of the intrinsically disordered (or natively unfolded) proteins. These proteins are known to exert a stabilizing activity on biomolecules through specific interaction with hydrophobic surfaces. In the present work we focused on the effect of αₛ₁-casein on the fibrillogenesis of 1–40 β-amyloid peptide, involved in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The aggregation kinetics of β-peptide in presence and absence of αₛ₁-casein was followed under shear at 37°C by recording the Thioflavine fluorescence, usually taken as an indicator of fibers formation. Measurements of Static and Dynamic Light Scattering, Circular Dichroism, and AFM imaging were done to reveal the details of αₛ₁-casein–Aβ₁–₄₀ interaction. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: αₛ₁-Casein addition sizably increases the lag-time of the nucleation phase and slows down the entire fibrillization process. αₛ₁-Casein sequesters the amyloid peptide on its surface thus exerting a chaperone-like activity by means a colloidal inhibition mechanism. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Insights on the working mechanism of natural chaperones in preventing or controlling the amyloid aggregation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3acasein 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobic bonding 3aimage analysis 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3amilk1 aCanale, C.1 aDiaspro, A.1 aTrapani, A.1 aBiagio, P.L.

Specifically, it is associated with aberrant bone remodeling, defective bone microstructure, poor bone quality, and growth retardation. The T2DM-associated impairment of bone elongation may result from a decrease in growth plate function, but the detailed mechanism has been unknown. The present study, therefore, aimed to test hypothesis that T2DM led to premature apoptosis of growth plate chondrocytes in Goto–Kakizaki (GK) type 2 diabetic rats, and thus triggered the compensatory responses to overcome this premature apoptosis, such as overexpression of Runt-related transcription factor (Runx)-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the essential mediators for bone elongation. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) of epiphyseal sections successfully revealed increases in chondrocyte apoptosis in the hypertrophic zone (HZ) and chondro-osseous junction of GK rats. Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis further confirmed the overexpression of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), Runx2 and VEGF, but not Indian hedgehog (Ihh) in the HZ. Analysis of blood chemistry indicated suppression of bone remodeling with a marked decrease in parathyroid hormone level. In conclusion, GK rats manifested a premature increase in chondrocyte apoptosis in the HZ of growth plate, and a compensatory overexpression of chondroregulatory proteins, such as PTHrP, Runx2, and VEGF. Our results, therefore, help explain how T2DM leads to impaired bone elongation and growth retardation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3aapoptosis 3ablood chemistry 3achondrocytes 3agene overexpression 3agrowth plate 3agrowth retardation 3ahematologic tests 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amicrostructure 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aparathyroid hormone 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3atranscription factors 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aChondrocyte apoptosis 0aGrowth plate 0aLongitudinal bone growth 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 0aVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1 aWongdee, Kannikar1 aCharoenphandhu, Narattaphol1 aSuntornsaratoon, Panan1 aKrishnamra, Nateetip0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Sept. 26, v. 452 p.395-401dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.08.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03676naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008300162300001800245500002000263520226100283592002802544650001702572650001402589650002602603650001502629650001402644650001702658650001202675650001202687650001702699650001102716650002502727650001402752650002502766651001502791651001402806651001802820651002002838700002102858700001702879700001802896700002602914700002002940700002002960773010802980856007303088852000903161655001203170IND60580792320221123012356.0171001e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058079232DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.130262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVicente, Natállia10aIn and out of the Neotropics: historical biogeography of Eneopterinae crickets  ap. 2199-2210.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Multiple biogeographical scenarios involving vicariance and different colonization routes can explain disjunct species distributions in the Southern Hemisphere. Here, we tested several alternative hypotheses in Eneopterinae crickets, a diverse subfamily presenting a disjunct worldwide distribution. We inferred a dated phylogeny of Eneopterinae and reconstructed their biogeographical history to unravel the origin of their present‐day distribution, focusing on their multiple origins in the Neotropics. LOCATION: Worldwide. METHODS: We sampled 62 eneopterine species representing all extant genera. We inferred their phylogenetic relationships through Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches based on four mitochondrial and three nuclear gene sequences. Divergence time estimates were inferred using Bayesian relaxed clock approaches and primary fossil calibrations. Biogeographical analyses were conducted with the default dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis (DEC) model and a variant model (DEC+J), which accounts for rare‐jump dispersal events. RESULTS: Our dating analyses showed that the Eneopterinae is far older than expected and its diversification can be traced back to the Late Cretaceous (c. 76 Ma). In this context, the most supported biogeographical scenario (under DEC+J) suggests that the Neotropics were colonized twice independently: first during the break‐up of Gondwana, when Antarctica, Australia and South America started separating (compatible with a vicariance event if relying on the result of the DEC model alone); later through a northern recolonization originating from Southeast Asia, likely related to a Holarctic Boreotropical distribution of an eneopterine lineage during the Eocene. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: We provided a dated worldwide biogeographical framework for the Eneopterinae crickets. Overall, the subfamily disjunct distribution pattern is better explained by both ancient and recent dispersal events. Whether this could reflect a widespread pattern in insect groups exhibiting a disjunct distribution remains to be investigated by studying other insect lineages. The information gathered here will also help foster new directions for future studies concerning the acoustic innovations of this clade.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEocene epoch 3aGryllidae 3aLate Cretaceous epoch 3aNeotropics 3aacoustics 3abiogeography 3afossils 3ainsects 3amitochondria 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3astatistical analysis 3aAntarctica 3aAustralia 3aSouth America 3aSouth East Asia1 aKergoat, Gael J.1 aDong, J.

The present study focuses on uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation rather than its inhibition as a trigger for such effects. METHODS: The reference weak uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol, fourteen naturally-occurring phenolic compounds identified as uncouplers in isolated rat liver mitochondria, and fourteen related compounds with little or no uncoupling activity were tested for enhancement of glucose uptake in differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells following 18h of treatment at 25–100μM. A subset of compounds were tested for suppression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity in H4IIE hepatocytes following 16h at 12.5–25μM. Metformin (400μM) was used as a standard in both assays. RESULTS: Dinitrophenol and nine of eleven compounds that induced 50% or more uncoupling at 100μM in isolated mitochondria enhanced basal glucose uptake by 53 to 269%; the effect of the 4′-hydroxychalcone butein was more than 6-fold that of metformin; negative control compounds increased uptake by no more than 25%. Dinitrophenol and four 4′-hydroxychalconoids also suppressed hepatocyte G6Pase as well as, or more effectively than metformin, whereas the unsubstituted parent compound chalcone, devoid of uncoupling activity, had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: Activities key to glycemic control can be induced by a wide range of weak uncouplers, including compounds free of difficult-to-metabolize groups typically associated with uncouplers. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Uncoupling represents a valid and possibly more efficient alternative to inhibition for triggering cytoprotective effects of therapeutic relevance to insulin resistance in both muscle and liver. Identification of actives of natural origin and the insights into their structure–activity relationship reported herein may lead to alternatives to metformin.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dinitrophenol 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3achalcone 3aenergy 3aglucose 3aglucose-6-phosphatase 3aglycemic control 3ahepatocytes 3ahomeostasis 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin resistance 3aliver 3ametformin 3amitochondria 3amuscles 3amyocytes 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3arats 3askeletal muscle 3astructure-activity relationships 3atherapeutics0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 Feb., v. 1820, no. 2 p.133-150dElsevier B.V.x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02086naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006500152245007600217500002200293520099200315592002801307650002401335650001101359650001801370650001201388653001201400653001101412653001301423653001601436653002401452653002101476700002201497700002701519773008201546856008701628852000901715655001201724IND60628487520221119101452.0190129e20190119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062848752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.1852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTashtoush, Bourhan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9424-518512aA comprehensive review of ejector design, performance, and applications  aPre-press version  aThe objective of this work is to provide a literature survey on the research attempts made in the field of ejector refrigeration systems and the studies made on the ejector as a component.

The strong electron withdrawing and steric hindrance effects of the chloride group in the molecules of CC could protect the amido bond from the attack of hydrogen ions (H⁺) or hydroxyl ions (OH⁻) under acidic or alkaline conditions, thus the resultant polyamide composite membranes could be stable in acidic or alkali aqueous solution. A more compact PA active layer could be developed via mixing PIP into the PEI aqueous solution, where the PIP molecules could fill the pores of the polymer networks. There was no obvious change in the surface morphologies, the chemical structures, and the rejection performances after immersing the resultant polyamine composite NF membranes in the strong acidic solution (pH 1) and the strong alkaline solution (pH 13) for 30 days, respectively. The rejection performances of this kind of polyamine composite NF membranes could be adjusted through adjusting the mass ratio of PEI to PIP in the aqueous phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aasymmetric membranes 3achemical structure 3achlorides 3acyanuric chloride 3ahydrogen ions 3amixing 3ananofiltration 3apH 3apiperazine 3apolyamides 3apolyamines 3apolyethyleneimine 3apolymerization 3aprotons 3aultrafiltration1 aMiao, Jing1 aHe, Yuantao1 aHong, Xinjun1 aTu, Kai1 aWang, Xi1 aChen, Shunquan1 aYang, Hao1 aZhang, Ling1 aZhang, Rui0 tRSC advances.g2019 Nov. 18, v. 9, no. 64 p.37546-37555dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra06528h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245012100166300001600287520099700303592002801300650001501328650001901343650003301362650002001395650002901415650001501444650001101459650002701470650001301497650001301510650001401523700002201537700001701559700001701576700002301593700001901616773009001635852000901725856008101734930003301815946001101848655001201859IND4415074320221119094513.0160903e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441507432DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-008-0833-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomárek, Karel,10aExtraction of Alkylphenols and Nonylphenol Mono- and Diethoxylates from Water Using Magnetically Modified Adsorbents  ap. 133-137.  aThis paper presents a new simple method of extraction of alkylphenols (APs) and nonylphenol mono- and diethoxylates (NP1EO and NP2EO) from water. For the extraction of these pollutants, magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) was tested and the results were compared with liquid–liquid extraction (LLE). Different types of adsorbents, such as Chromosorb, Tenax, Porapak and Chezacarb were magnetically modified and used for the preconcentration and isolation of the target compounds. The following four extraction parameters were optimized: time of sorption, time of elution, volumes of elution solvents and number of repeated elutions. The target analytes were isolated from spiked distilled and tap water, real samples from the river Elbe and the reservoir Rozkos and also from water phase after biodegradation tests of oxyethylated nonylphenols. Extracts of pollutants were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography (GC). Detection limits of the method were between 0.7 and 1 μg L⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3abiodegradation 3acapillary gas chromatography 3adetection limit 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3apollutants 3arivers 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asorption 3atap water1 aSafarikova, Mirka1 aHubka, Tomas1 aSafarik, Ivo1 aKandelova, Martina1 aKujalova, Hana0 tChromatographia.g2009 Jan., v. 69, no. 1-2 p.133-137dVieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-008-0833-x3Available from publisher's site  a20090120b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02930naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001100152245010400163520157500267592002801842650001201870650001701882650002901899650001501928650001901943650001401962651001001976653002801986653002802014653001202042653002002054653002802074700001702102700001602119700001602135700001602151700001802167700001302185700001602198700002002214700001502234700001702249773009802266856008702364852000902451655001202460IND60685168020221120112300.0200412e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068516802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.1071142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bo10aDeriving terrain factors from high-resolution lunar images: A case study of the Mons Rümker Region  aMons Rümker is a preferred candidate landing region for China's Chang'e-5 (CE-5) mission, from where it is of great significance to select safe landing areas. Lunar terrain factors from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, limited by their low resolutions (~10 m/pixel), are inapplicable to evaluating the lunar landing area safety, in spite of the fact that lunar remote sensing imagery has higher resolution (~50 cm/pixel). In this paper, we extracted terrain factors in divided square girds by the aid of the high-resolution Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Narrow-angle Camera (NAC) images, namely, flat area percentage (Fap), distribution pattern of uneven objects (NNI) based on the double-threshold Otsu method, and roughness based on gray level histogram analysis. Mons Rümker can be divided into four geological units, named as LD, B1, B2, and B3, respectively. Unit B1 has a higher roughness and a lower Fap. Unit B2 and B3 are characterized with the highest Fap and the lowest roughness. NNIs of Unit B1, B2, and B3 are >1 while LD's is <1. Thus, the distribution patterns of uneven objects in Unit LD are clustered but dispersed in all Unit B1, B2, and B3. This paper tends to take Fap and roughness as the main terrain factors to evaluate the safety for CE-5 landing in Mons Rümker with NNI being a supplement to Fap. According to Standard 1–3 mentioned in this paper, we would classify the divided square grids of the Mons Rümker region as the safe or unsafe areas, and then discriminate five potential landing areas for CE-5 probe safe landing.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3acase studies 3adigital elevation models 3alandscapes 3aremote sensing 3aroughness 3aChina 0aThe Mons Rümker region 0aChina's Chang'e-5 probe 0aLRO NAC 0aTerrain factors 0aPotential landing areas1 aZhang, Jiang1 aYue, Zongyu1 aYao, Peiwen1 aLi, Chenfan1 aChen, Shengbo1 aQiao, Le1 aFu, Xiaohui1 aLing, Zongcheng1 aChen, Jian1 aLiu, Shouxin0 tGeomorphology.g2020 June 01, v. 358 p.107114-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.1071143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245010300204300001600307500001900323520186700342592002802209650002202237650001202259650002002271650001602291650002402307650001702331650000902348650001202357650001602369653002502385653001002410653002402420653002102444653001102465700002402476700002202500700001502522700001602537700002302553700001902576773011202595856008102707852000902788655001202797IND60686787520221116235130.0200318e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068678752DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311190025442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTortereau, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1444-448110aGenetic parameters for feed efficiency in Romane rams and responses to single-generation selection  ap. 681-687.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFeeding costs represent one of the highest expenditures in animal production systems. Breeding efficient animals that express their growth potential while eating less is therefore a major objective for breeders. We estimated the genetic parameters for feed intake, feed efficiency traits (residual feed intake (RFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR)), growth and body composition traits in the Romane meat sheep breed. In these traits, selection responses to single-generation divergent selection on RFI were evaluated. From 2009 to 2016, a total of 951 male lambs were tested for 8 weeks starting from 3 months of age. They were weighed at the beginning and at the end of the testing period. Backfat thickness and muscle depth were recorded at the end of the testing period through ultrasound measurements. Feed intake was continuously recorded over the testing period using the automatic concentrate feeders. The heritability of RFI was estimated at 0.45 ± 0.08, which was higher than the heritability of FCR (0.30 ± 0.08). No significant genetic correlations were observed between RFI and growth traits. A favourable low negative genetic correlation was estimated between RFI and muscle depth (−0.30 ± 0.15), though additional data are needed to confirm these results. The selection of low RFI sires based on their breeding values led to the production of lambs eating significantly less concentrate (3% decrease in the average daily feed intake), but with the same growth as lambs from sires selected based on high RFI breeding values. We concluded that in meat sheep, RFI is a heritable trait that is genetically independent of post-weaning growth and body composition traits. A one-generation divergent selection based on RFI breeding values highlighted that substantial gains in feeding costs can be expected in selection schemes for meat sheep breeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal production 3abackfat 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agenetic correlation 3aheritability 3ameat 3amuscles 3aultrasonics 0aresidual feed intake 0asheep 0adivergent selection 0abody composition 0agrowth1 aMarie-Etancelin, C.1 aWeisbecker, J.-L.1 aMarcon, D.1 aBouvier, F.1 aMoreno-Romieux, C.1 aFrançois, D.,0 tAnimal.g2020 Apr., v. 14, no. 4 p.681-687dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311190025443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100004000143245009400183300001400277520102500291592002801316650001501344650002101359650002501380650001001405650001701415650001501432650002301447650001301470650002001483650001201503650001601515651001801531651001101549653002001560653002101580653001401601653001601615653002601631700004101657700002601698700003101724700001901755700003401774773009501808856007701903852000901980655001201989IND60643941820221119102949.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064394182DNAL7 a10.1139/cjb-2017-01672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiebert-Giesbrecht, Mickel Randolph10aHerb-chronology as a tool for determining the age of perennial forbs in tropical climates  ap. 73-78.  aAge in wild plant populations is one of the most elusive developmental parameters in plant biology. Several approaches take advantage of a plant’s morphological traits to determine developmental stages or plant age. Annual growth rings forming in woody tissues of perennial plants are one of the traits that have been widely used to determine the age of trees (dendrochronology) and, more recently, herbaceous perennials (herb-chronology). In temperate, alpine, and arctic climates, it has been reported that seasonal variations in climate lead to the formation of annual growth rings in herbaceous perennial forbs; however, to date, no similar studies have been carried out on plants from tropical regions. We have investigated the applicability of herb-chronology on the tropical plant Pentalinon andrieuxii (Müll. Arg.) B.F. Hansen & Wunderlin, a native vine of the Yucatan peninsula. Our results show that herb-chronology is a potentially useful tool in determining the age of plants growing in tropical climates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPentalinon 3adendrochronology 3adevelopmental stages 3aforbs 3agrowth rings 3aperennials 3aseasonal variation 3atree age 3atropical plants 3atropics 3awild plants 3aArctic region 3aMexico 0aherb-chronology 0atropical climate 0aplant age 0aApocynaceae 0aPentalinon andrieuxii1 aNovelo-Rodríguez, Candelaria Yuseth1 aDzib, Gabriel Rolando1 aCalvo-Irabién, Luz María1 avon Arx, Georg1 aPeña-Rodríguez, Luis Manuel0 tBotany.g2018, v. 96, no. 1 p.73-78dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44657x1916-28047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2017-01673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008600168520125800254592002801512653002601540653003301566653002201599653002201621653002201643700002001665773009001685856008501775852000901860655001201869IND60764099720221119190526.0220315e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076409972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meafoo.2022.1000222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJulrat, Sakol10aUse of dielectric mixture equations for the characterization of uncleaned peanuts  aDielectric properties measurement plays an important role for peanut quality assessment as it offers a unique characterization for each sample condition. In this study, four dielectric mixture models including linear, quadratic, cubic, and logarithmic equations, were used to characterize the dielectric properties of mixtures of cleaned peanuts and foreign materials. The peanut samples consisted of mixtures of cleaned unshelled peanuts mixed with a single type or multiple types of foreign materials (peanut shells, sticks, raisins (shriveled undeveloped kernels), and stones). The effective dielectric constants of these mixtures of cleaned unshelled peanuts and foreign materials were measured by a free-space-transmission technique at 10 GHz and 23 °C. The effective dielectric constants obtained from the measurements for the mixtures were compared to those calculated by using the four mixture equations. Results for the logarithmic equation provided the best estimates for the dielectric constants of mixtures of unshelled peanuts and foreign materials with a standard error of performance of 2.7%. Therefore, the logarithmic dielectric mixture model can be useful in developing dielectric-based algorithm for foreign material determination.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDielectric properties 0aDielectric mixture equations 0aForeign materials 0aMicrowave sensing 0aUnshelled peanuts1 aTrabelsi, Samir0 tMeasurement.g2022 Feb., v. 5 p.100022-dElsevier LtdwJournal:27960x2772-27597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meafoo.2022.1000223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03669naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245018800172520142500360592002801785650001401813650001201827650002601839650001601865650001601881650001601897650002301913650001001936650001701946650003401963650002001997653000902017653000902026653000902035653000702044653000902051653000802060653001002068653000802078653000802086653000802094653001002102653000802112653001002120653000802130653001002138653000902148653000702157653001202164653000802176653000802184653000802192653000902200653001002209653000802219653001002227653001102237653001002248653000802258653001102266653003002277653001402307653002602321653002902347653002302376700001702399700001802416700001402434700001102448700001702459700001602476700001802492700001802510700001602528700001302544700001802557773011902575856008802694852000902782655001202791IND60767780320221118021120.0220517e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076778032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1539332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Zhanchen10aPerfluorooctane sulfonate induces mitochondrial calcium overload and early hepatic insulin resistance via autophagy/detyrosinated alpha-tubulin-regulated IP3R2-VDAC1-MICU1 interaction  aPerfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), one kind of persistent organic pollutants, is associated with insulin resistance (IR) in general population. However, the exact mechanism is still obscure. In this study, we found that 50 μM PFOS caused IR in L-02 hepatocytes after 1 h, and induced autophagy and mitochondrial calcium (Ca²⁺) accumulation as early as 0.5 h. Inhibiting autophagy relieved mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload and then reversed IR. Mitochondria were aggregated at cell periphery, and extracellular Ca²⁺ from IP3R2 on the plasma membrane, rather than endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺, was the priority source of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake at early stages of PFOS exposure. Furthermore, we discovered that the linkage connecting autophagy and mitochondrial Ca²⁺ response was detyrosinated α-tubulin, which autophagy-dependently ascended, interacted with VDAC1 and enhanced the formation of IP3R2-VDAC1-MICU1 complex. Consistently, PFOS caused IR, activated autophagy, induced mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload, increased the level of detyrosinated α-tubulin, and promoted the formation of IP3R2-VDAC1-MICU1 complex in the liver of C57BL/6J mice exposed to 2.5 mg/kg/day PFOS for 6 weeks. This study clarified that autophagy and mitochondrial Ca²⁺ accumulation were the early and triggering event that caused PFOS-related IR, also unveiled a novel mechanism regulating mitochondrial Ca²⁺ homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautophagy 3acalcium 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aenvironment 3ahepatocytes 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin resistance 3aliver 3amitochondria 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aplasma membrane 0aPFOS 0aPFAS 0aPOPs 0aIR 0aT2DM 0aLC3 0aVDAC1 0aOMM 0aIMS 0aIMM 0aMICU1 0aMCU 0aMiro1 0aPTM 0aIP3R2 0a3-MA 0aER 0aα-KGDH 0aPDH 0aIDH 0aROS 0amPTP 0aGLUT4 0aPKC 0aIRS-1 0aTRPML1 0aTRAKs 0aCTT 0aPPARα 0aPerfluorooctane sulfonate 0aAutophagy 0aMitochondrial calcium 0aDetyrosinated α-tubulin 0aInsulin resistance1 aWang, Jianyu1 aQiu, Tianming1 aWu, Jialu1 aAn, Yu1 aShi, Xiaoxia1 aSun, Xiance1 aJiang, Liping1 aLiu, Xiaofang1 aYang, Guang1 aCao, Jun1 aYao, Xiaofeng0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 June 15, v. 825 p.153933-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1539333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245015300160300001500313520143300328592002801761650002701789650001601816650001201832650001001844650001401854650001601868650001101884650002101895650001101916650001601927653003101943653002401974653002001998653002702018700002302045700001902068773009602087856007702183852000902260655001202269IND60643941920221119103126.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064394192DNAL7 a10.1139/cjb-2017-01682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yanwen10aThermal acclimation of leaf respiration as a way to reduce source–sink imbalance at low temperatures in Erythronium americanum, a spring ephemeral  ap. 97-109.  aMany spring geophytes exhibit greater growth at colder than at warmer temperatures. Previous studies have suggested that there is less disequilibrium between source and sink activity at low temperatures, which delays leaf senescence and leads to higher accumulation of biomass in the perennial organ. We hypothesized that dark respiration acclimates to temperature at both the leaf and bulb levels, mainly via the alternative respiratory pathway, as a way to reduce source–sink imbalance. Erythronium americanum Ker-Gawl. was grown under three temperature regimes: 8/6 °C, 12/8 °C, and 18/14 °C (day/night). Plant respiratory rates were measured at both growth and common temperatures to determine whether differences were due to the direct effects of temperature on respiratory rates or to acclimation. Leaf dark respiration exhibited homeostasis, which together with lower assimilation at low growth temperature, most likely reduced the quantity of C available for translocation to the bulb. No temperature acclimation was visible at the sink level. However, bulb total respiration varied through time, suggesting potential stimulation of bulb respiration as sink limitation builds up. In conclusion, acclimation of respiration at the leaf level could partly explain the better equilibrium between source and sink activity in plants grown in low-temperatures, whereas bulb respiration responds to source–sink imbalance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErythronium americanum 3aacclimation 3abiomass 3abulbs 3ageophytes 3ahomeostasis 3aleaves 3arespiratory rate 3aspring 3atemperature 0asource–sink relationship 0athermal acclimation 0asink limitation 0aErythronium americanum1 aGérant, Dominique1 aLapointe, Line0 tBotany.g2018, v. 96, no. 2 p.97-109dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44657x1916-28047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2017-01683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014200170520126300312592002801575650001201603650002201615650002101637650002001658650002201678650001901700650001501719650000901734650002701743650001401770650001001784653002201794653002001816653001001836653002501846700002401871700002901895773010801924856008602032852000902118655001202127IND60627859920221121111240.0210228e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062785992DNAL7 a10.1080/23311932.2018.14590622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheriff, Oumer10aGenetic diversity studies using microsatellite markers and their contribution in supporting sustainable sheep breeding programs: A review  aMicrosatellites have been widely accepted and employed as useful molecular markers for measuring genetic diversity and divergence within and among populations. The various parameters developed so far to measure genetic diversity within and among populations are observed and expected heterozygosities (Hₒ and Hₑ), the mean number of alleles per locus, polymorphic information content, genetic distance and phylogenetic or tree building approach. The objective of this review was therefore to quantify the genetic diversity studies of domestic sheep populations using microsatellite markers and their contribution in supporting sustainable sheep breeding programs. From the review, it is possible to see that there was high within population genetic variations in all the studied sheep populations, poor level of population differentiations and high levels of inbreeding. On the other hand, low estimates of heterozygosities and mean number of alleles and employing only few and weak markers were observed in some of the studies. The gaps observed in the previous genetic diversity studies of the sheep populations may demand further works to reveal more information on the population structures and to start appropriate and sustainable breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abreeding programs 3agenetic distance 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3ainbreeding 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeny 3asheep 0agenetic diversity 0amicrosatellites 0asheep 0asustainable breeding1 aAlemayehu, Kefyalew1 aGonzález-Redondo, Pedro0 tCogent food & agriculture.g2018 Jan. 1, v. 4, no. 1 p.1459062-dCogentwJournal:21312x2331-19327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2018.14590623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245011300212300001600325520092400341592002801265650001101293650001001304650000901314650002401323650001301347650002001360650001801380650000901398651001201407653002101419653001801440653002101458700002501479700002001504773011301524856008801637852000901725655001201734IND60584699520221119185623.0190318e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058469952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.10.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTri, Doan Quang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3990-583810aUsing numerical modelling in the simulation of mass fish death phenomenon along the Central Coast of Vietnam  ap. 740-749.  aA two-dimensional model was used to reconstruct scenarios related to the mass fish death phenomenon that occurred along the Central Coast of Vietnam. First, a Weather Research Forecasting model was used to simulate the wind field during April 2016, and was then used as an input to the two-dimensional (2D) model. Second, the calibration of the 2D model showed high conformity in both the phases and amplitude between the simulated and observed water levels. The simulation results of two scenarios, S1 and S2, were highly recommended for explaining the mass fish death phenomenon that occurred along the coast from Ha Tinh Province to Thua Thien-Hue Province. The calculated results of water quality data combined with the toxic concentration measured in fish will ultimately enable the simulation of the delimiting pollution zones and will facilitate response solutions when a similar phenomenon occurs in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adeath 3afish 3amathematical models 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awind 3aVietnam 0aMass fish deaths 0aCentral Coast 0aNumerical models1 aLinh, Nguyen Thi Mai1 aDon, Nguyen Cao0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2018 Apr., v. 129, no. 2 p.740-749dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.10.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03790naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015600173300001400329520230100343592002802644650001102672650001402683650002102697650001602718650001102734650001902745650001802764650001502782650000902797650002402806650001402830650002002844650001102864650002202875650001502897650001402912651001502926653001602941653002502957653002202982653002203004653002303026700002103049700001903070773010203089856008403191852000903275655001203284IND60599083520221122124103.0180702e20140624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059908352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2014.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGartner, Joseph E.10aEmpirical models for predicting volumes of sediment deposited by debris flows and sediment-laden floods in the transverse ranges of southern California  ap. 45-56.  aDebris flows and sediment-laden floods in the Transverse Ranges of southern California pose severe hazards to nearby communities and infrastructure. Frequent wildfires denude hillslopes and increase the likelihood of these hazardous events. Debris-retention basins protect communities and infrastructure from the impacts of debris flows and sediment-laden floods and also provide critical data for volumes of sediment deposited at watershed outlets. In this study, we supplement existing data for the volumes of sediment deposited at watershed outlets with newly acquired data to develop new empirical models for predicting volumes of sediment produced by watersheds located in the Transverse Ranges of southern California. The sediment volume data represent a broad sample of conditions found in Ventura, Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties, California.The measured volumes of sediment, watershed morphology, distributions of burn severity within each watershed, the time since the most recent fire, triggering storm rainfall conditions, and engineering soil properties were analyzed using multiple linear regressions to develop two models. A “long-term model” was developed for predicting volumes of sediment deposited by both debris flows and floods at various times since the most recent fire from a database of volumes of sediment deposited by a combination of debris flows and sediment-laden floods with no time limit since the most recent fire (n=344). A subset of this database was used to develop an “emergency assessment model” for predicting volumes of sediment deposited by debris flows within two years of a fire (n=92). Prior to developing the models, 32 volumes of sediment, and related parameters for watershed morphology, burn severity and rainfall conditions were retained to independently validate the long-term model. Ten of these volumes of sediment were deposited by debris flows within two years of a fire and were used to validate the emergency assessment model. The models were validated by comparing predicted and measured volumes of sediment. These validations were also performed for previously developed models and identify that the models developed here best predict volumes of sediment for burned watersheds in comparison to previously developed models.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adatabases 3aempirical models 3aengineering 3afloods 3ainfrastructure 3amass movement 3aprediction 3arain 3asediment deposition 3asediments 3asoil properties 3astorms 3atopographic slope 3awatersheds 3awildfires 3aCalifornia 0aDebris flow 0aSediment-laden flood 0aHazard assessment 0aPost-fire erosion 0aVolume of sediment1 aCannon, Susan H.1 aSanti, Paul M.0 tEngineering geology.g2014 June 24, v. 176 p.45-56dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2014.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245009600206520136800302592002801670650002301698650001101721650001301732650002201745650001801767650001201785650001901797653001801816653002201834653001701856653001901873653002301892700005501915700006201970700001902032700001902051700006202070773011602132856008302248852000902331655001202340IND60764055520221119113345.0220509e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076405552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2022.1274832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgerer, Monika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3304-072510aGardening can relieve human stress and boost nature connection during the COVID-19 pandemic  aThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted social life. Gardens and yards have seemingly risen as a lifeline during the pandemic. Here, we investigated the relationship between people and gardening during the COVID-19 pandemic and what factors influenced the ability of people to garden. We examined survey responses (n = 3,743) from gardeners who reported how the pandemic had affected personal motivations to garden and their use of their gardens, alongside pandemic-related challenges, such as food access during the first wave of COVID-19 (May-Aug 2020). The results show that for the respondents, gardening was overwhelmingly important for nature connection, individual stress release, outdoor physical activity and food provision. The importance of food provision and economic security were also important for those facing greater hardships from the pandemic. While the literature on gardening has long shown the multiple benefits of gardening, we report on these benefits during a global pandemic. More research is needed to capture variations in public sentiment and practice – including those who do little gardening, have less access to land, and reside in low-income communities particularly in the global south. Nevertheless, we argue that gardening can be a public health strategy, readily accessible to boost societal resilience to disturbances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3ahumans 3apandemic 3aphysical activity 3apublic health 3asurveys 3aurban forestry 0aPublic health 0aUrban agriculture 0aFood systems 0aUrban greening 0aLandscape planning1 aLin, Brenda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6011-91721 aKingsley, Jonathan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8528-71641 aMarsh, Pauline1 aDiekmann, Lucy1 aOssola, Alessandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0507-60260 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2022 Feb., v. 68 p.127483-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2022.1274833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03718naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245013300198500002000331520242500351592002802776596005202804650002102856650002002877650001102897650001402908650001602922650001602938650000902954650001602963650001502979650001802994700005703012700005703069773013403126856007503260852000903335655001203344IND60768609820221118034042.0220225e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076860982DNAL7 a10.1111/ejss.131892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosskopf, Ulla1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3940-485710aEffects of mucilage concentration at different water contents on mechanical stability and elasticity in a loamy and a sandy soil  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMucilage released by plant roots affects hydrological and mechanical properties of the rhizosphere. The aim of this study was to disentangle the effects of the factors mucilage and soil moisture on a range of soil mechanical parameters in a sand and a loam. Both substrates were homogenised and filled into cylinders at bulk densities (ρb) of 1.26 and 1.47 g cm⁻³ for loam and sand, respectively. Chia seed (Salvia hispanica L.) mucilage concentrations of 0, 0.02, 0.2 and 2 g dry mucilage kg⁻¹ dry soil were tested at four different gravimetric water contents in loam (θg = 0.34, 0.19, 0.14 and 0.09 g g⁻¹) and three in sand (θg = 0.20, 0.06 and 0.04 g g⁻¹). To quantify the influence of water content on the effect of mucilage on mechanical soil properties, two sets of samples were prepared, one for a micro penetrometer test, the other to measure bulk soil properties. Penetration tests were performed at 120 mm h⁻¹ using a universal testing machine with a high‐precision sensor equipped with a penetrometer conus resembling a root. Mechanical energies were determined by calculating the area of the time–force curves. The energy required for a root to grow in a loam at permanent wilting point was decreased from 0.31 J in the control to 0.26 J in the 2 g kg⁻¹ mucilage treatment, whereas it increased from 0.05 J in the control to 0.08 J at the highest water content. Pre‐compression stress (σₚc), compression index (Cc), swelling index (Cₛ) and elasticity index were determined with a confined uniaxial compression test. σₚc was increased by addition of mucilage in both substrates whereas the response on compressibility and elasticity was specific to substrate and water content. Here mucilage had a stronger impact on sand—the substrate with lower initial compressibility and elasticity. We conclude that the effect of mucilage on soil mechanical properties and subsequently on plant growth depends on the combined response of substrate and water content. HIGHLIGHTS: The influence of soil moisture on the mechanical effects of mucilage concentration was examined. Mucilage decreased the energy required for root growth in a loam at the permanent wilting point. Higher mucilage concentrations increased compressibility and elasticity in sand. Effect of mucilage on mechanical parameters depends on interaction between substrate and moisture.  aPublisher supplied data  aPE 1523/10‐1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aSalvia hispanica 3acompressibility 3aenergy 3amucilages 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3asand 3asandy soils 3asoil water 3awater content1 aUteau, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1499-43441 aPeth, Stephan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9799-212X0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2022 Jan., v. 73, no. 1 p.e13189-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl51589x1351-07547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.131893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245015300210300001600363520108800379592002801467650001501495650002801510650001601538650001101554650001301565650002101578650001501599650002301614650001301637650003001650650002001680653002501700653001201725653002001737653003101757653002201788653001701810700001901827700001701846700001801863700001401881700001601895773011301911856008802024852000902112655001202121IND60584699720221119185244.0190318e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058469972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.10.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMancuso, F.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7217-513110aStatus of vulnerable Cystoseira populations along the Italian infralittoral fringe, and relationships with environmental and anthropogenic variables  ap. 762-771.  aWe analyzed the occurrence and status of infralittoral fringe populations of Cystoseira spp. (Fucales) at thirteen rocky sites around the Italian coastline, and explored the relationships with relevant environmental and anthropogenic variables. We found Cystoseira populations at 11 sites: most were scattered and comprised monospecific stands of C. compressa, and only 6 sites also supported sparse specimens of either C. amentacea var. stricta or C. brachycarpa. Coastal human population density, Chlorophyll a seawater concentrations, sea surface temperature, annual range of sea surface temperature and wave fetch explained most of the variation of the status of C. compressa. We hypothesize a generally unhealthy state of the Italian Cystoseira infralittoral fringe populations and identify multiple co-occurring anthropogenic stressors as the likely drivers of these poor conditions. Extensive baseline monitoring is needed to describe how Cystoseira populations are changing, and implement a management framework for the conservation of these valuable but vulnerable habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCystoseira 3aanthropogenic stressors 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3ahabitats 3ahuman population 3amonitoring 3apopulation density 3aseawater 3asurface water temperature 3awater pollution 0aCanopy-forming algae 0aFucales 0aCystoseira spp. 0aRocky infralittoral fringe 0aMediterranean Sea 0aHabitat loss1 aStrain, E.M.A.1 aPiccioni, E.1 aDe Clerck, O.1 aSarà, G.1 aAiroldi, L.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2018 Apr., v. 129, no. 2 p.762-771dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.10.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245014200168300001800310500002000328520166400348592002802012650004402040650001202084650001502096650001502111650002002126650001702146650004102163650001902204650001102223650001502234650001902249650001802268650000702286650001902293650001302312650003302325650001302358650002502371650001602396650001302412650002102425650001202446650003702458650001002495650003102505650001102536700001902547773013202566856007802698852000902776655001202785IND60589150720221119193207.0180202e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058915072DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2016009702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanihashemi, Solmaz12aA core–shell titanium dioxide polyaniline nanocomposite for the needle‐trap extraction of volatile organic compounds in urine samples  ap. 1985-1992.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe synthesized a titanium dioxide–polyaniline core–shell nanocomposite and implemented it as an efficient sorbent for the needle‐trap extraction of some volatile organic compounds from urine samples. Polyaniline was synthesized, in the form of the emeraldine base, dissolved in dimethyl acetamide followed by diluting with water at pH 2.8, using the interfacial polymerization method. The TiO₂ nanoparticles were encapsulated inside the conducting polymer shell, by adapting the in situ dispersing approach. The surface characteristics of the nanocomposite were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. After obtaining acceptable preliminary results, some selected volatile compounds, including chloroform, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and chlorobenzenes were used as model analytes to validate the enrichment properties of the prepared sorbent in conjunction with gas chromatography mass spectrometric detection. Important parameters influencing the extraction process such as extraction temperature, ionic strength, sampling flow rate, extraction time, desorption temperature, and time were optimized. The limits of detection and limits of quantification values were in the range of 0.5–3 and 2–5 ng/L, respectively, using time‐scheduled selected ion monitoring mode. The relative standard deviation percent with three replicates was in the range of 5–10%. The applicability of the developed needle‐trap method was examined by analyzing urine samples and the relative recovery percentages for the spiked samples were in the range of 81–105%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abenzene 3achloroform 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3aethylbenzene 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aionic strength 3amodels 3amonitoring 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorbents 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide 3atoluene 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aurine 3avolatile organic compounds 3axylene1 aBagheri, Habib0 tJournal of separation science.g2017 May, v. 40, no. 9 p.1985-1992dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2016009703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245010400205300001800309506007600327520156200403592002801965506003701993650002502030650001102055650001402066650001002080650001702090650001902107650002202126650001302148650002202161650001902183650001302202650002602215700001702241700002302258700002202281700002002303700001802323773017202341856007902513852000902592655001202601IND60178506220221207060255.0150604e20130205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017850622DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12143001102doi7 aPMC35683122pmcid7 a233415952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaz, Ali Ahmad10aTrifoliate encodes an MYB transcription factor that modulates leaf and shoot architecture in tomato  ap. 2401-2406.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLeaf morphology and the pattern of shoot branching determine to a large extent the growth habit of seed plants. Until recently, the developmental processes that led to the establishment of these morphological structures seemed unrelated. Here, we show that the tomato Trifoliate (Tf) gene plays a crucial role in both processes, affecting the formation of leaflets in the compound tomato leaf and the initiation of axillary meristems in the leaf axil. Tf encodes a myeloblastosis oncoprotein (MYB)-like transcription factor related to the Arabidopsis thaliana LATERAL ORGAN FUSION1 (LOF1) and LOF2 proteins. Tf is expressed in the leaf margin, where leaflets are formed, and in the leaf axil, where axillary meristems initiate. During tomato ontogeny, expression of Tf in young leaf primordia increases, correlating with a rise in leaf dissection (heteroblasty). Formation of leaflets and initiation of axillary meristems can be traced back to groups of pluripotent cells. Tf function is required to inhibit differentiation of these cells and thereby to maintain their morphogenetic competence, a fundamental process in plant development. KNOTTED1-LIKE proteins, which are known regulators in tomato leaf dissection, require Tf activity to exert their function in the basal part of the leaf. Similarly, the plant hormone auxin needs Tf activity to initiate the formation of lateral leaflets. Thus, leaf dissection and shoot branching rely on a conserved mechanism that regulates the morphogenetic competence of cells at the leaf margin and in the leaf axil.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aauxins 3abranching 3agenes 3agrowth habit 3aleaf primordia 3aoncogene proteins 3aontogeny 3aplant development 3aplant hormones 3atomatoes 3atranscription factors1 aRaman, Smita1 aMartinez, Ciera C.1 aSinha, Neelima R.1 aSchmitz, Gregor1 aTheres, Klaus0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Feb. 5, v. 110, no. 6 p.2401-2406dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12143001103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001900158245011300177300001600290520093100306592002801237650001901265650001801284650001001302650002901312650001201341650003001353650004101383650001801424650001101442650002501453650005001478650003501528650006001563650004201623650003201665650002301697653002201720653001701742653001801759653001601777653003701793653002801830653000901858700002201867700002001889700001801909700001601927700001601943700002201959773010601981852000902087856007602096655001202172IND4382032620221116163733.0181004e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438203262DNAL7 a168469962pmid7 a10.1354/vp.43-4-5412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuckles, E.

Surgical excision revealed the subcutaneous mass to be covered in haired skin with multiple glabrous areas and structures resembling a jaw with tooth buds, eyelids, and a tail. The mass deformed the host pup's skull. Histologic examination revealed a complete vertebra in the tail, teeth in the jaw, and areas resembling tongue and larynx. Class 1 MHC sequences amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the mass and the host twin were identical. The mass was diagnosed as a fetus in fetu, a rare congenital anomaly in which 1 conjoined twin is completely enclosed in the body of the other twin. The host pup died, and no additional defects were found; however, blubber levels of persistent organic pollutants were high. The cause of the congenital anomaly in this pup is uncertain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoca vitulina 3aembryogenesis 3atwins 3acongenital abnormalities 2aAnimals 2aDNAxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aFatal Outcome 2aFemale 2aFetusxabnormalities 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class Ixgenetics 2aHistocytochemistryxveterinary 2aPhocaxabnormalitiesxembryologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aTwins, Conjoinedxpathology 2aTwins, Monozygotic 0aCongenital defect 0acontaminants 0afetus in fetu 0aharbor seal 0amajor histocompatibility complex 0aPhoca vitulina richardi 0atwin1 aGulland, F.

These measures are advocated by food waste specialists and are thought to increase donations almost automatically. The article performs a theory-based evaluation using the method of realist synthesis to investigate the two measures, test their implicit assumptions, and provide a more complete picture of how the policy works. The results highlight the marginal importance of bureaucratic procedures in the cost structure of donations, the diverse responses of different donors and food rescue organisations, and the importance of considering the capacity and preferences of charities when an increase in donations is expected. Further, the analysis uncovers severe reputational risks that limit both the supply of and demand for food past the BBD, despite legal provisions promoting its donation.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood policy 3afood waste 3aItaly 0aFood donation 0aFood loss 0aRealist synthesis 0aTheory-based evaluation0 tFood policy.g2019 Aug. 05, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl9768x0306-91927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2019.1017493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03438naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245012000166300001800286500002000304520207300324592002802397650002102425650002602446650001402472650000902486650002402495650001502519650001402534650000902548650001402557650002802571650002302599650001302622650001402635650002502649650002002674650001202694650001902706700002002725700002302745700002502768773009302793856007302886852000902959655001202968IND60580789720221122224955.0171001e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058078972DNAL7 a10.1111/oik.037872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvangelista, Charlotte10aResource composition mediates the effects of intraspecific variability in nutrient recycling on ecosystem processes  ap. 1439-1450.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDespite the growing evidence for individual variation in trophic niche within populations, its potential indirect effects on ecosystem processes remains poorly understood. In particular, few studies have investigated how intraspecific trophic variability can modulate the effects of consumers on ecosystems through potential changes in nutrient excretion rates. Here, we first quantified the level of intraspecific trophic variability in 11 wild populations of the omnivorous fish Lepomis gibbosus. Outputs from stomach content and stable isotope analyses revealed that the degree of trophic specialization and trophic positions were highly variable between and within these wild populations. There was intrapopulation variation in trophic position of more than one trophic level, suggesting that individuals consumed a range of plant and animal resources. We then experimentally manipulated intraspecific trophic variability to assess how it can modulate consumer‐mediated nutrient effects on relevant processes of ecosystem functioning. Specifically, three food sources varying in nutrient quality (e.g. plant material, macro‐invertebrate and fish meat) were used individually or in combination to simulate seven diet treatments. Results indicated that intraspecific variability in growth and nitrogen excretion rates were more related to the composition of the diet rather than the degree of specialization, and increased with the trophic position of the diet consumed. We subsequently used microcosms and showed that critical ecosystem functions, such as primary production and community respiration, were affected by the variability in excretory products, and this effect was biomass‐dependent. These results highlight the importance of considering variation within species to better assess the effects of individuals on ecosystems and, more specifically, the effects of consumer‐mediated nutrient recycling because the body size and the trophic ecology of individuals are affected by a large spectrum of natural and human‐induced environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepomis gibbosus 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abody size 3adiet 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aexcretion 3afish 3afish meat 3aintraspecific variation 3amacroinvertebrates 3anitrogen 3aomnivores 3aprimary productivity 3astable isotopes 3astomach 3atrophic levels1 aLecerf, Antoine1 aBritton, J.

A general matching quantiles M-estimation (MQME) method is thus proposed, which is resistant to outlier observations of the target random variable. Given that in most applications, the number of variables p may be large, a ‘sparse’ representation is highly desirable. The MQME is combined with the adaptive Lasso penalty so it can select informative variables. An iterative algorithm based on M-estimation is developed to compute MQME. The proposed matching quantiles M-estimate is consistent, just like the MQE. Extensive simulations are provided, in which efficient finite-sample performance of the new method is demonstrated. In addition, an illustrative real case study is presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aleast squares 0aAdaptive Lasso 0aCross-validation 0aMatching quantiles 0aM-estimation 0aOutlier observations1 aWu, Yuehua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8858-12890 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2020 July, v. 147 p.106941-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2020.1069413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245010800206300002000314520091000334592002801244650002101272650001501293650001401308650002301322700005601345773013801401856008001539852000901619655001201628IND60626294420221120210021.0181220e20181120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062629442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b104582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaishi, Meghnath1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3854-770110aOscillatory Tunnel Magnetoresistance in a Carbon Nanotube Based Three-Terminal Magnetic Tunnel Junction  ap. 29062-29068.  aElectrostatic control of tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) in a carbon nanotube (CNT)-based three-terminal magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) is critical to the development of next-generation nanospintronics. Using a quantum transport approach that explicitly considers the electronic structure of the junction including the exchange-interaction effects due to spin alignments at the ferromagnetic electrodes, we have unraveled the origin behind the gate bias dependent modulation of the TMR in a single-walled CNT-based MTJ. Akin to the experimental observation, our calculation yields an oscillatory behavior in TMR with a strong variation in the amplitude and width of the magnetoresistance signal with gate bias. We attribute the gate-bias-driven nonlinear change in the strength of spin-dependent hybridization at the nanotube/contact interface as the main cause for the observed oscillatory feature in TMR.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrodes 3amagnetism 3aphysical chemistry1 aPati, Ranjit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7936-40200 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Nov. 20, v. 122, no. 50 p.29062-29068dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b104583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009900170300001800269520088400287592002801171650001801199650001301217650002101230650002501251650002401276650001501300650001901315650001201334650001301346650001101359650001801370650001601388650001401404650001501418700001501433700001801448700001701466773011701483856008501600852000901685655001201694IND60087266920221120122137.0141102e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008726692DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60662-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Manhong10aCharacteristics and aluminum reuse of textile sludge incineration residues after acidification  ap. 1999-2004.  aThe chemical composition and aluminum speciation of sludge incineration residue (SIR) were determined. Cementation of aluminum from sulfuric acid solution using SIR was studied. The results showed that acid-soluble inorganic aluminum was the predominant component in the sludge, and the total leached aluminum increased from 62.2% to 92.9% after incineration. Sulfuric acid dosage and reaction time were found to affect aluminum recovery positively. Conversely, the increase in temperature significantly inhibited recovery reactions. The optimized leaching condition was 1.66 g sulfuric acid per gram of SIR with a reaction time of 3 hr at 20°C, resulting in the highest aluminum leaching rate of 96.7%.

Ammonia‐oxidising bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) are involved in the first step of nitrification and are important to ecosystem function, especially where effluent discharge results in high nitrogen inputs. Here, we investigated the effect of a pulse addition of AgNPs on AOB and AOA ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene abundances and benthic nitrification potential rates (NPR) in low‐salinity and mesohaline estuarine sediments. Whilst exposure to 0.5 mg L⁻¹ AgNPs had no significant effect on amoA gene abundances or NPR, 50 mg L⁻¹ AgNPs significantly decreased AOB amoA gene abundance (up to 76% over 14 days), and significantly decreased NPR by 20‐fold in low‐salinity sediments and by twofold in mesohaline sediments, after one day. AgNP behaviour differed between sites, whereby greater aggregation occurred in mesohaline waters (possibly due to higher salinity), which may have reduced toxicity. In conclusion, AgNPs have the potential to reduce ammonia oxidation in estuarine sediments, particularly where AgNPs accumulate over time and reach high concentrations. This could lead to long‐term risks to nitrification, especially in polyhaline estuaries where ammonia‐oxidation is largely driven by AOB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aammonia 3aammonia monooxygenase 3aantimicrobial properties 3aecological function 3aeffluents 3aestuaries 3aestuarine sediments 3agenes 3ananosilver 3anitrification 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3arisk 3asalinity 3atoxicity 3awastewater treatment1 aStolpe, Björn1 aCole, Paula A.1 aLead, Jamie R.1 aSapp, Melanie1 aLyons, Brett P.1 aColbeck, I.q(Ian),1 aWhitby, Corinne0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2017 Feb., v. 19, no. 2 p.500-510dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.134413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245013500160300001200295520176500307592002802072596007902100650001302179650001602192650001702208650001302225650001902238650000902257650002302266650001002289650000902299650001802308650001002326700001502336700001602351700001202367700001402379700002002393700001302413700005402426773012902480856008302609852000902692655001202701IND60763625020221119045055.0220217e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076362502DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-021-02615-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Jie14aThe impact of different rotation regime on the soil bacterial and fungal communities in an intensively managed agricultural region  ap. 142.  aThe continuous wheat–maize planting has led to the increase in epidemic frequency of wheat diseases under climate change. Analyzation of the soil microbial composition in different rotation crops is essential to select alternative rotation regime. This study investigated the bacterial and fungal community abundance and composition, and potential microbe–microbe interactions in three rotations, including wheat–maize → spring maize (WMFS), wheat–soybean (WS) and continuous wheat–maize (WM) planting. The results revealed that there were 110, 156, and 195 bacterial, and 17, 8, and 15 fungal operational taxonomic units respectively enriched by WMFS, WS, and WM. WM increased the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and α-Proteobacteria in wheat, and the relative abundance and copy number of genus Fusarium in maize. WMFS and WS could decrease the abundance of Fusarium in summer-crop across the growth stages and in wheat at elongation. WS also increased the copy number of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in wheat at flowering and harvest. Network analysis revealed that WM resulted in simple and isolated wheat network with small modules dominating and none Nitrospirae and β-Proteobacteria in the main modules. WS formed interconnected and intricate wheat network with the maximum number of large modules and module connectors. Under WS, positive correlation between antagonistic Streptomyces (Actinobacteria) and genus Fusarium was found in wheat. Soil physicochemical properties explained the majority of the variation in bacterial and fungal β-diversity in wheat (P < 0.01).

The live IBD virus (IBDV) has a potential immunosuppressive effect. Currently available IBDV vaccines have shortcomings, prompting the development of safer and more effective vaccination approaches, including the use of the recombinant turkey herpesvirus vaccine expressing the immunogenic structural VP2 protein of IBDV (recombinant HVT (rHVT)-IBD). The objectives of this study were twofold: (i) to develop in vitro assays and molecular tools to detect the VP2 protein and gene and (ii) to evaluate cell-mediated immunity (CMI) induced by rHVT-IBD vaccination of day-old specific pathogen-free chickens. The VP2 protein expressed by rHVT-IBD-infected chicken embryo fibroblasts was detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence. Using molecular techniques, the VP2 gene was detected in various organs, providing a method to monitor vaccine uptake . rHVT-IBD vaccination induced CMI responses in specific pathogen-free chickens at 5 weeks. CMI was detected by measuring chicken interferon-gamma after ex vivo antigenic stimulation of splenocytes. Moreover, our results showed that the enzyme-linked immunospot approach is more sensitive in detecting chicken interferon-gamma than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The tools developed in this study may be useful in the characterization of new-generation recombinant vaccines and the cellular immune response they induce.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickens 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 3aMeleagrid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aimmunosuppression 3ainterferon-gamma 3acell-mediated immunity 3ainfectious bursal disease 3afinancial economics 3avaccination 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3asplenocytes 3agenes 3aviruses 3arecombinant vaccines 3ain vitro studies 3afibroblasts 3afluorescent antibody technique 3apoultry industry 0aELISPOT 0aChicken 0arecombinant HVT 0aMeleagrid herpesvirus 11 aRauw, Fabienne1 avan den Berg, Thierry1 aLambrecht, Bénédicte0 tAvian pathology.g2017 May 4, v. 46, no. 3 p.289-299dTaylor & Francisx1465-33387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2016.12650833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013300169300001800302520149300320592002801813650001101841650001101852650001101863650001501874650001501889650000901904650001101913650001801924650001101942650001401953651001801967651000901985700002701994700002702021700002702048700001702075773009302092856008102185852000902266655001202275IND60523197720221117230111.0160607e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052319772DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-016-0076-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz-Asencio, M.10aReconstruction of Recent Sedimentary Processes in a Carbonate Platform (Gulf of Batabano, Cuba) Using Environmental Radiotracers  ap. 1020-1034.  aRecent (past 100 years) sedimentary processes in the highly dynamic Gulf of Batabano (Cuba, Caribbean Sea) were investigated through the analyses of environmental radionuclides (e.g., ²¹⁰Pb, ²²⁶Ra, ¹³⁷Cs, ²³⁹,²⁴⁰Pu, and ¹⁴C) in nine sediment cores. We evaluated the mean mass accumulation rates (MARs) and the surface mixed layers (SMLs) in each sediment core. Based on these results, three sedimentary environments were identified in the study region. In the central zone, the sediments were mainly composed of carbonate transported from the southern area and showed elevated mass accumulation rates (MAR, 0.11–0.23 g cm⁻² year⁻¹) and relatively deep surface mixed layers (SML, 14–16 cm). The southwestern zone was characterized by lower MAR (0.05–0.08 g cm⁻² year⁻¹) and thinner SML (7–8 cm). In both areas, the long sediment mixing times in the SMLs (of 45–61 years) smoothed out the sedimentary records. The coastline sedimentary environments were characterized by higher MAR (0.30–0.57 g cm⁻² year⁻¹) and the sedimentary records displayed clear signatures of extreme climatic events such as the intensive rains in 1999 reported for La Coloma and the hurricanes Lili and Isodore in 2002. Our study shows that the application of the ²¹⁰Pb sediment dating method in dynamic costal zones is a challenging task but still may provide important information regarding sedimentation and mixing processes in the ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acesium 3acoasts 3aecosystems 3ahurricanes 3alead 3amixing 3aradionuclides 3aradium 3asediments 3aCaribbean Sea 3aCuba1 aCorcho-Alvarado, J.

In a complex heterogeneous environment or in face of ecological disturbance, the microbes adjust to fluctuating environmental conditions through a cascade of cellular and molecular systems. Their habitats differ from cold microcosms of Antarctica to the geothermal volcanic areas, terrestrial to marine, highly alkaline zones to the extremely acidic areas and freshwater to brackish water sources. The diverse ecological microbial niches are attributed to the versatile, adaptable nature under fluctuating temperature, nutrient availability and pH of the microorganisms. These organisms have developed a series of mechanisms to face the environmental changes and thereby keep their role in mediate important ecosystem functions. The underlying mechanisms of adaptable microbial nature are thoroughly investigated at the cellular, genetic and molecular levels. The adaptation is mediated by a spectrum of processes like natural selection, genetic recombination, horizontal gene transfer, DNA damage repair and pleiotropy-like events. This review paper provides the fundamentals insight into the microbial adaptability besides highlighting the molecular network of microbial adaptation under different environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA repair 3abrackish water 3acold 3aecological imbalance 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3anatural selection 3anutrient availability 3apH 3atemperature 3aAntarctica1 aAkhtar, Nahid1 aSher, Farooq1 aNavarrete, Acacio Aparecido1 aAmérico-Pinheiro, Juliana Heloisa Pinê1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6252-828X0 tArchives of microbiology.g2022 Feb., v. 204, no. 2 p.144-144dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-022-02757-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01528naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011800163300001600281520058500297592002800882650001600910650003800926650001100964700001800975700001800993700001801011773011901029856008101148852000901229655001201238IND60547896820221118022000.0160903e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054789682DNAL7 a10.1007/s12275-016-6027-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Su-Mi10aAmino acid residues in the Ler protein critical for derepression of the LEE5 promoter in enteropathogenic E. coli  ap. 559-564.  aEnteropathogenic E. coli causes attaching and effacing (A/E) intestinal lesions.

Many researchers have studied anthracene moieties as blue emitters, given their appropriate energy levels and good emission properties. We herein report two new deep blue-emitting anthracene derivatives that include p-xylene as moieties connecting the anthracene cores to side groups. We enhanced the efficiency by maximizing triplet–triplet fusion (TTF) without sacrificing emission color. The large steric hindrance imposed by the methyl groups of p-xylene creates a perpendicular geometry between p-xylene and the neighboring aromatic rings. Any extension of π-conjugation is thus disrupted, and the isolated core anthracene moiety emits a deep blue color with a high photoluminescence quantum yield. Moreover, the extensive steric hindrance suppresses vibration and rotation because the molecules are rigid. The high horizontal dipole ratio attributable to the large aspect ratio increases the outcoupling efficiency of the emitted light. Furthermore, the charge mobility and triplet harvesting ability are enhanced by decreasing the bulkiness of the side groups. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the bulkiness of the side group significantly impacted molecular density, which in turn affected the charge transport and TTF. We used two molecules, 2PPIAn (containing a phenyl side group) and 4PPIAn (containing a terphenyl side group), to form nondoped emission layers that exhibited maximum external quantum efficiencies of 8.9 and 7.1% with Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage coordinates of (0.150, 0.060) and (0.152, 0.085), respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthracenes 3acommercialization 3aenergy 3afluorescent dyes 3ageometry 3alight emitting diodes 3amoieties 3amolecular dynamics 3aphotoluminescence 3avibration 3axylene 0aanthracene 0ahorizontal dipole ratio 0acolor purity 0atriplet−triplet fusion 0aorganic light-emitting diode1 aHa, Yeon Hee1 aKwon, Soon-Ki1 aKim, Yun-Hi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8856-44141 aKim, Jang-Joo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4926-23460 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Mar. 02, v. 12, no. 13 p.15422-15429dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b211433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015700173300001600330520133600346592002801682650002201710650002201732650001201754650001401766650001101780650002401791650001501815650001201830650001101842651002001853653002001873653001501893653002201908653003101930653002301961653002801984700001902012700001802031700001902049700002102068773010302089856008602192852000902278655001202287IND60564509920221122093111.0190318e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056450992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2017.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlemany, Juliette12aA Bayesian two-stage biomass model for stock assessment of data-limited species: An application to cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) in the English Channel  ap. 131-143.  aCuttlefish is a key commercial species in the English Channel fishery in terms of landings and value. Age-based assessment methods are limited by time-consuming age determination with statoliths and the lack of stock assessment models tailored to this data-limited species. A two-stage biomass model is developed in the Bayesian state-space modelling framework that allows inferences to be made on the stock biomass at the start, middle and end of each fishing seasons between 1992 and 2014, while accounting for both process and measurement errors and to assimilate various sources of information. A method that uses ancillary length-frequency data is developed to provide an informative prior distribution for the biomass growth rate parameter g (E=0.89) and its annual variability (CV=0.1). The new model is a substantial improvement on the existing stock assessment method used by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas. Taking into consideration a time-varying g parameter provides a more ecologically meaningful model with regard to the sensitivity of the cuttlefish population dynamics to environmental fluctuations and improves model fit. The model also provides predictions of the unexploited biomass in winter, which is based on survey data, and helps manage the stock in the event of strong depletion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSepia officinalis 3aage determination 3abiomass 3afisheries 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3asurveys 3awinter 3aEnglish Channel 0aEnglish Channel 0aCuttlefish 0aSepia officinalis 0aBayesian state-space model 0aData-limited stock 0aTwo-stage biomass model1 aRivot, Etienne1 aFoucher, Eric1 aVigneau, Joel,1 aRobin, Jean-Paul0 tFisheries research.g2017 July, v. 191 p.131-143dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011500172300001600287520104500303592002801348650002001376650002201396650002301418650002201441650001001463650001401473650003001487650001801517650002201535650001101557651001001568700002101578700002501599773010601624856008101730852000901811655001201820IND60575426920221119231126.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057542692DNAL7 a10.1007/s40009-016-0535-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyyagari, Vijaya Sai10aOptimization of the Isolation Procedure of Genomic DNA from a Mucus Laden Pulmonate Gastropod, Achatina fulica  ap. 109-112.  aGenomic DNA of good quality is a prerequisite in molecular biology studies involved in deciphering the information contained in the molecules that are chosen for studying the evolutionary interrelationships among taxa. Genomic DNA should be free of contaminants which may otherwise interfere while performing PCR. This is particularly essential while isolating genomic DNA from gastropods due to the presence of large amounts of mucopolysaccharides in their tissues. In the present study, we have developed a new method for obtaining high quality genomic DNA from a pulmonate snail Achatina fulica, which secretes a large amount of mucus. In this method, we have obtained good quality genomic DNA, compatible for downstream molecular biology applications like PCR and sequencing of 16S rDNA. The yield of the genomic DNA was 2790 µg/ml. This method may be extended for isolating high quality genomic DNA from different gastropods native to Indian sub-continent, which serves as a starting point for studying their phylogenetic affinities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchatina fulica 3achemical elements 3aglycosaminoglycans 3amolecular biology 3amucus 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3asnails 3aIndia1 aNaravula, Jalaja1 aSreerama, Krupanidhi0 tNational Academy science letters.g2017 Apr., v. 40, no. 2 p.109-112dSpringer Indiax0250-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40009-016-0535-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01895naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245014400174300001600318520075300334592002801087650002401115650002101139650002401160650002101184650001301205650000701218650001401225650001201239650001101251650000901262650001001271700002001281700001701301773010401318856009001422852000901512655001201521IND60547975020221116222236.0160903e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054797502DNAL7 a10.1023/B:BIOP.0000023877.21262.a52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBennett, I.J.14aThe Influence of Ammonium Nitrate, pH and Indole Butyric Acid on Root Induction and Survival in Soil of Micropropagated Eucalyptus globulus  ap. 355-360.  aRooting of Eucalyptus globulus shoots was influenced by the concentration of the indole butyric acid (IBA) and NH₄ ⁺ in the root-induction medium. Optimum plantlet vigor and survival were achieved using low concentrations (1 – 2.5 μM) of IBA and when NH₄NO₃ was removed. Removal of NH₄ ⁺ also had a significant effect on medium pH, its presence caused a decrease in pH as the culture period proceeded. When different nitrate compounds (excluding NH₄NO₃) were used as the nitrogen source, the medium pH was more stable and this was associated with higher root production. The higher root production, in association with appropriate IBA concentrations, produced plantlets with higher survival and better growth on transfer to soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aammonium nitrate 3aindole butyric acid 3amicropropagation 3anitrogen 3apH 3aplantlets 3arooting 3ashoots 3asoil 3avigor1 aMcDavid, D.A.J.1 aMcComb, J.A.0 tBiologia plantarum.g2003 Nov., v. 47, no. 3 p.355-360dKluwer Academic Publishersx0006-31347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:BIOP.0000023877.21262.a53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010600171300001500277520093800292592002801230596004401258650001201302650002001314650002301334650003001357650001501387650001101402650001301413650002301426650002201449650001001471651001601481700002201497700002401519773010901543856008201652852000901734655001201743IND60627309220221118031553.0190128e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062730922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-018-09915-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCripps, Michael G.10aFolivory impact of the biocontrol beetle, Cassida rubiginosa, on population growth of Cirsium arvense  ap. 91-101.  aThe folivorous beetle, Cassida rubiginosa Müller (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), was released in New Zealand in 2007 as a biocontrol agent against the pasture weed, Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. The impact of the beetle on shoot population density and spread was assessed over two years on isolated experimental plots within an established population of the weed. Four folivory treatments were imposed by applying 0, 5, 10 or 20 larvae per shoot. Folivory in the 10 and 20 larvae per shoot treatments caused C. arvense population declines of 29% and 75%, respectively, although this effect was not consistent between the two years. Shoot spread was reduced in both years where 10 or 20 larvae per shoot were applied. This study represents the first post-release assessment of this biocontrol agent in New Zealand, and indicates that average densities of ≥ ten larvae per shoot can reduce population density and spread of C. arvense.  aPublisher supplied data  a401499cMinistry for Primary Industries 3aCassida 3aCirsium arvense 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aherbivores 3alarvae 3apastures 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3aweeds 3aNew Zealand1 aJackman, Sarah D.1 aVan Koten, Chikako,0 tBioControl.g2019 Feb., v. 64, no. 1 p.91-101dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870036x1386-61417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-018-09915-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01705naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001500187245010500202300001800307506007600325520041700401592002800818506003700846650001300883650001600896650001300912650002100925650001800946650001300964650001100977650002500988650001301013700001801026700001701044700001801061773012701079856008001206852000901286655001201295IND60128087120221207131214.0150501e20150226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012808712DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.01481-142doi7 aPMC43195872pmcid7 a256145772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTushar, L.10aDraft Genome Sequence of Spirochaeta sp.

In this study, the recombinant human secreted ecto-domain of the small isoform of Stabilin-2 (s190) was purified from cell culture and evaluated for direct binding with a multitude of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) using a fluorescence polarization-based assay. The tested ASOs varied in their backbone composition, modification of the ribose 2′ position, overall length of the oligo, and sequence of the nucleotide bases. A fully phosphorothioate (PS) ASO with a 5–10–5 pattern of flanking 2′-O-methoxyethyl modifications was then used to test the effects of pH and salt concentration on receptor binding. These tests concluded that the PS backbone was the primary determinant for ASO binding and that decreasing pH and increasing salt generally increased the rate of ligand dissociation and fit within the biological parameters expected of a constitutive recycling receptor. These results will be useful in the rational design of therapeutic oligonucleotides for enhancing their affinity or avoidance of the Stabilin receptors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell culture 3adissociation 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3aligands 3anucleic acids 3aoligonucleotides 3apH 3areceptors 3aribose 3asalt concentration 3atherapeutics1 aMiller, Colton M.1 aSeth, Punit P.1 aHarris, Edward N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7045-10400 tBiochemistry.g2018 Mar. 28, v. 57, no. 14 p.2061-2064dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b001263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012400161300001600285520156200301592002801863650001901891650002701910650002701937650001501964650001701979650002401996650001002020650001802030650001502048650002002063650002602083650001302109650002902122650001602151650002102167650001502188650002402203650003702227700002202264700002302286700001502309700001502324700001202339700001602351773011602367856008102483852000902564655001202573IND60573872820221120191152.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057387282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-016-1165-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pi,10aSensitivities to nitrogen and water addition vary among microbial groups within soil aggregates in a semiarid grassland  ap. 129-140.  aWe investigated whether enhanced nitrogen (N) and water inputs would redistribute the microbial community within different soil aggregate size classes in a field manipulation experiment initiated in 2005. Distribution of microbial groups was monitored in large macroaggregates (>2000 μm), small macroaggregates (250–2000 μm), and microaggregates (<250 μm) in a semiarid grassland. Both arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and saprophytic fungi were the most abundant in soil macroaggregates. The gram-negative bacteria were more abundant in soil microaggregates. Total phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentration in general and actinomycetes in particular decreased with N addition under ambient precipitation but was unaffected by combined additions of N and water within the three soil aggregate fractions as compared to control plots. In contrast, the abundance of saprophytic fungi decreased with combined N and water addition, but it was not affected by N addition under ambient precipitation. The abundance of gram-positive bacteria increased with N addition under both ambient and elevated water conditions for all soil aggregate fractions. In summary, the higher short-term nutrient and water availabilities provoked a shift in soil microbial community composition and increased total PLFA abundance irrespectively of the level of soil aggregation. In the long term, this could destabilize soil carbon pools and influence the nutrient limitation of soil biota within different soil aggregate size classes under future global change scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aarid lands 3acarbon sinks 3acommunity structure 3afungi 3aglobal change 3agrasslands 3amicroaggregates 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3asaprophytes 3asoil aggregation 3asoil biota 3asoil microorganisms 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aDorodnikov, Maxim1 aDijkstra, Feike A.1 aYang, Shan1 aXu, Zhuwen1 aLi, Hui1 aJiang, Yong0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2017 Jan., v. 53, no. 1 p.129-140dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0178-27627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-016-1165-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245014700169300001600316506002800332520138100360592002801741506003701769650001801806650001501824650001601839650003001855650002901885650001501914650002301929650001101952650001201963650001801975651001401993653003102007653001802038653001402056653002202070700001402092700002002106773010202126856008002228852000902308655001202317IND60764682020221207094638.0211116e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076468202DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d1802332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWIBOWO, DWI NUGROHO10aShort Communication: Benthic macroinvertebrate diversity as biomonitoring of organic pollutions of river ecosystems in Central Java, Indonesia  ap. 671-676.  aResource is Open Access  aWibowo DN, Setijanto, Santoso S. 2017. Short Communication: Benthic macroinvertebrate diversity as biomonitoring of organic pollutions of river ecosystems in Central Java, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 18: 671-676. Benthic macroinvertebrates are mainly aquatic insects that spend most of their lives in the freshwater ecosystems. The physical, chemical, and biological conditions of rivers have a direct influence towards aquatic insects (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera EPT) which make them good indicators of stream water quality. We examined the use of benthic macroinvertebrates diversity as a biomonitoring tool to assess organic pollution levels in three rivers in Purwokerto city during March to October 2011. Our objective was to test the sensitivity of benthic macroinvertebrates especially Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) diversity to organic pollution levels reflected by biological oxygen demand (BOD) concentrations. A total of 27 sites with different BOD levels were surveyed in three different rivers (Logawa, Banjaran, and Pelus) during the period of March to October 2011. The results revealed no correlation of benthic macroinvertebrate diversity (EPT index) to BOD levels. It could be concluded that in the use of EPT index as bioindicators of waters condition, the number of samples, sampling time, and location should be considered.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEphemeroptera 3aPlecoptera 3aTrichoptera 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afreshwater 3amacroinvertebrates 3arivers 3astreams 3awater quality 3aIndonesia 0abenthic macroinvertebrates 0abiomonitoring 0adiversity 0aorganic pollution1 aSETIJANTO1 aSANTOSO, SLAMET0 tBiodiversitas.g2017 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 p.671-676dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d1802333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012900160300001600289520145100305592002801756650001201784650002301796650001201819650001301831650002001844650001001864650001301874650002401887650001801911650001801929650002801947650001301975650002001988650001502008650001602023650001802039700002102057700001702078700001602095700001702111700001602128700002102144700001502165773011602180856008102296852000902377655001202386IND60573872920221120191258.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057387292DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-016-1167-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Rui14aThe effect of temperature and moisture on the source of N2O and contributions from ammonia oxidizers in an agricultural soil  ap. 141-152.  aIn recent years, identification of the microbial sources responsible for soil N₂O production has substantially advanced with the development of isotope enrichment techniques, selective inhibitors, mathematical models and the discoveries of specific N-cycling functional genes. However, little information is available to effectively quantify the N₂O produced from different microbial pathways (e.g. nitrification and denitrification). Here, a ¹⁵N-tracing incubation experiment was conducted under controlled laboratory conditions (50, 70 and 85% water-filled pore space (WFPS) at 25 and 35 °C). Nitrification was the main contributor to N₂O production. At 50, 70 and 85% WFPS, nitrification contributed 87, 80 and 53% of total N₂O production, respectively, at 25 °C, and 86, 74 and 33% at 35 °C. The proportion of nitrified N as N₂O (P N₂O) increased with temperature and moisture, except for 85% WFPS, when P N₂O was lower at 35 °C than at 25 °C. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were the dominant ammonia oxidizers, but both AOA and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were related to N₂O emitted from nitrification. AOA and AOB abundance was significantly influenced by soil moisture, more so than temperature, and decreased with increasing moisture content. These findings can be used to develop better models for simulating N₂O from nitrification to inform soil management practises for improving N use efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aagricultural soils 3aammonia 3abacteria 3adenitrification 3agenes 3aisotopes 3amathematical models 3anitrification 3anitrous oxide 3anutrient use efficiency 3aoxidants 3asoil management 3asoil water 3atemperature 3awater content1 aHayden, Helen L.1 aSuter, Helen1 aHu, Hangwei1 aLam, Shu Kee1 aHe, Jizheng1 aMele, Pauline M.1 aChen, Deli0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2017 Jan., v. 53, no. 1 p.141-152dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0178-27627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-016-1167-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245009200159300001800251520162100269592002801890650001401918650001101932650001501943650000901958650000901967650002301976650001501999650002102014650002502035650001502060700002102075773015702096856007702253852000902330655001202339IND60772722820221118004342.0220409s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077272282DNAL7 a10.13031/trans.127922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHer, Younggu10aIdentification of Hydrologically Sensitive Areas Considering Watershed Process Dynamics  ap. 1891-1906.  aHydrologically sensitive areas (HSAs) largely control watershed response to rainfall, along with water and pollutant transport processes. Thus, their identification is critical in watershed management planning. Although watershed processes have been studied enough to provide a good understanding of HSA dynamics, only a few concepts and methods are available for HSA delineation, and they rely on spatial indices that do not consider temporal variation in hydrologic processes. This study introduces alternative concepts and methods to delineate HSAs. Three unique maps showing watershed dynamics were created using the outputs of a long-term hydrologic simulation implemented with a grid-based distributed model. The spatial distributions of HSAs identified using the newly proposed methods were compared with those of topographic indices. Results demonstrated that the new methods highlight transport processes, such as routing (or connection) and travel time, and the roles of soil and land covers, which have not been the focus of other concepts and approaches for HSA identification. In contrast to topographic index-based approaches, the proposed methods provided HSA boundaries with clear physical meanings to improve the interpretability and applicability of HSA maps. The methods are expected to enhance our ability to tackle water issues for improved water resource management by providing unique concepts and alternative ways to explicitly delineate HSAs.

In a high-tunnel greenhouse, T. asperellum was more persistent than M. anisopliae. Jalapeño pepper was more vulnerable to powdery mildew than arbol pepper. In the field, the fungi did not control powdery mildew in jalapeño pepper. In arbol pepper, both fungal species reduced disease severity to a level similar to that of a chemical control.

In the present study, two strains collected from ant carton in Thailand and Malaysia were found to represent hitherto undescribed species. Morphological, physiological, phylogenetic data and basic genome information are provided for their classification. Because of the relatively large phylogenetic distances with known species confirmed by overall genome data, large subunit (LSU) and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA sequences were sufficient for taxonomic circumscription of the species. The analyzed strains clustered with high statistical support as a clade in the family Trichomeriaceae. Morphologically they were rather similar, lacking sporulation in vitro. In conclusion, Incumbomyces delicatus and Incumbomyces lentus were described as new species based on morphological, physiological and phylogenetic analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetothyriales 3aFormicidae 3aclassification 3afungi 3agenome 3ainformation 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alifestyle 3amycology 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3asporulation 3astrains 3aMalaysia 3aThailand 0aAnt carton 0aChaetothyriales 0aPhylogeny 0aTrichomeriaceae1 aAhmed, Sarah A.1 aMenezes da Silva, Nickolas1 aAl-Hatmi, Abdullah M.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5206-26471 aMayer, Veronika E.1 aDeng, Shuwen1 aKang, Yingqian1 aSybren de Hoog, G.1 aShi, Dongmei0 tFungal biology.g2021 Apr., v. 125, no. 4 p.276-284dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2020.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011500168300001800283520158100301592002801882596005001910650001201960650001301972650002101985650001702006650001302023650000902036650001102045650001902056650001102075650001402086650000802100651001302108700002302121700003002144773016602174856008202340852000902422655001202431IND60517824620221118052954.0191003e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051782462DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-5853-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadhum, Safaa A.10aEvaluation and assessment of baseline metal contamination in surface sediments from the Bernam River, Malaysia  ap. 6312-6321.  aThe Bernam River is one of the most important rivers in Malaysia in that it provides water for industries and agriculture located along its banks. The present study was conducted to assess the level of contamination of heavy metals (Cd, Ni, Cr, Sn, and Fe) in surface sediments in the Bernam River. Nine surface sediment samples were collected from the lower, middle, and upper courses of the river. The results indicated that the concentrations of the metals decreased in the order of Sn > Cr > Ni > Fe > Cd (56.35, 14.90, 5.3, 4.6, and 0.62 μg/g¹ dry weight). Bernam River sediments have moderate to severe enrichment for Sn, moderate for Cd, and no enrichment for Cr, Ni, and Fe. The contamination factor (CF) results demonstrated that Cd and Sn are responsible for the high contamination. The pollution load index (PLI), for all the sampling sites, suggests that the sampling stations were generally unpolluted with the exception of the Bagan Tepi Sungai, Sabak Bernam, and Tanjom Malim stations. Multivariate techniques including Pearson’s correlation and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to apportion the various sources of the metals. The results suggested that the sediment samples collected from the upper course of the river had lower metal concentrations, while sediments in the middle and lower courses of the river had higher metal concentrations. Therefore, our results can be useful as a baseline data for government bodies to adopt corrective measure on the issues related to heavy metal pollution in the Bernam River in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  aRef:20346cMinistry of High Education in Iraq 3acadmium 3achromium 3acluster analysis 3aheavy metals 3aindustry 3airon 3anickel 3apollution load 3arivers 3asediments 3atin 3aMalaysia1 aIshak, Mohd Yusoff1 aZulkifli, Syaizwan Zahmir0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Apr., v. 23, no. 7 p.6312-6321dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5853-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245012400181300001600305520179900321592002802120650000802148650001502156650001502171650001602186650001602202650001702218650001002235650002002245650001302265650001502278650001102293650004302304650002202347650002602369650001302395650002602408650003502434650001302469650001702482650001902499653003502518653003302553653002602586653001502612653001202627653001702639700002502656700002202681773009202703856008602795852000902881655001202890IND60630673520221117012801.0191231e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063067352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTortajada-Genaro, Luis A.10aConsumer electronics devices for DNA genotyping based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification and array hybridisation  ap. 424-431.  aConsumer electronic technologies offer practical performances to develop compact biosensing systems intended for the point-of-care testing of DNA biomarkers. Herein a discrimination method for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms, based on isothermal amplification and on-chip hybridisation, was developed and integrated into user-friendly optical devices: e.g., USB digital microscope, flatbed scanner, smartphone and DVD drive. In order to adequately identify a single base change, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was employed, with high yields (8 orders) within 45 min. Subsequently, products were directly hybridised to the allele-specific probes attached to plastic chips in an array format. After colorimetric staining, four consumer electronic techniques were compared. Sensitive precise measurements were taken (high signal-to-noise ratios, 10-μm image resolution, 99% scan-to-scan reproducibility). These features confirmed their potential as analytical tools, are a competitive alternative to fluorescence scanners, and incorporate additional advantages, such as user-friendly interface and connectivity for telemedicine needs. The analytical performances of the integrated platform (assay and reader) in the human samples were also excellent, with a low detection limit (100 genomic DNA copies), and reproducible (<15%) and cheap assays (< 10 €/test). The correct genotyping of a genetic biomarker (single-nucleotide polymorphism located in the GRIK4 gene) was achieved as the assigned genotypes agreed with those determined by using sequencing. The portability, favourable discriminating and read-out capabilities reveal that the implementation of mass-produced low-cost devices into minimal-specialised clinical laboratories is closer to becoming a reality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3acolorimetry 3aelectronics 3afluorescence 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahumans 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3amobile telephones 3apoint-of-care testing 3ascanners 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astaining 3atelemedicine 3auser interface 0aSingle-nucleotide polymorphism 0aIsothermal DNA amplification 0aPoint-of-care testing 0aSmartphone 0aScanner 0aCompact disc1 aYamanaka, Eric Seiti1 aMaquieira, Ángel0 tTalanta.g2019 June 01, v. 198 p.424-431dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03531naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245012800170506002800298520185400326592002802180506003702208650001602245650002602261650001202287650001402299650001602313650001802329650002102347650002002368650001602388650001702404650001502421650002302436650001802459650001102477650002102488650002902509650001702538650001302555650001802568653001602586653001702602653001602619653001702635653001202652700001402664700002002678700002902698700002002727700002502747773009202772856008002864852000902944655001202953IND60764682320221207092425.0211122e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076468232DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2107592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerawati, Vivi Endar14aThe effect of fermented duckweed (Lemna minor) in feed on growth and nutritional quality of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)  aResource is Open Access  aHerawati VE, Pinandoyo, Darmanto YS, Rismaningsih N, Widarto S, Radjasa OK. 2020. The effect of fermented duckweed (Lemna minor) in feed on growth and nutritional quality of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Biodiversitas 21: 3350-3358. One of the raw materials used for making tilapia fish feed is soybean meal. Soybean prices continue to rise and currently reach 4,500 rupiah/kg, so that alternative feed ingredients that are cheap and environmentally friendly need to be sought. Alternative feed ingredients that can be utilized in making feed, one of which is Lemna minor meal. Duckweed (Lemna minor) which has a high nutrient content, such as 23.47% crude protein, 3.99% crude fat, 29.92% crude fiber, 23.6% ash, and 19.02% nitrogen-free extract, will be the best candidate as an alternative feed ingredient. This study aims to find growth performance and nutritional quality of tilapia fed by different feed formulations using different amounts of fermented L. minor meal. The dosage treatments of feed with fermented L. minor meal are 0% (A), 2.5% (B), 5% (C), and 7.5% (D). Feeding of tilapia using fermented L. minor meal has a significant effect (P<0.05) on total feed consumption, feed utilization efficiency, protein efficiency ratio, and relative growth rate, and had no significant effect (P>0.05) on survival rate. The results found that the best biomass weight, total feed consumption, feed utilization efficiency, relative growth rate, protein efficiency ratio, and survival rate value was in the treatment B (usage of 2.5 % L. minor meal) which were 38.58g, 110.17g, 70.10%, 2.01%, 1.98%, and 94.44%, respectively. The best nutritional quality was in the treatment B (usage of 2.5 % L. minor meal) which was amino acid lysine, the highest value of amino acid lysine was 25.22% and the highest value of linoleic fatty acid was 4.37%.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLemna minor 3aOreochromis niloticus 3abiomass 3acrude fat 3acrude fiber 3acrude protein 3afeed composition 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afermentation 3afish feeds 3agrowth performance 3alinoleic acid 3alysine 3anutrient content 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3asoybean meal 3asoybeans 3asurvival rate 0aaquaculture 0afermentation 0alemna minor 0anatural feed 0atilapia1 aPINANDOYO1 aDARMANTO, Y.S. 1 aRISMANINGSIH, NURMANITA 1 aWINDARTO, SETO 1 aRADJASA, OCKY KARNA 0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 June, v. 21, no. 7dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2107593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245019900173300001200372520105700384592002801441650002901469650001301498650002001511650001901531650002601550650001101576650000701587650001501594650003701609650001401646650001501660650001601675700002401691700002001715700002101735700001701756700002201773773012501795856008101920852000902001655001202010IND60547975420221116223131.0160911e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054797542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-016-2999-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLang, Firmin Semboung10aBiodegradation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Mangrove Sediments Under Different Strategies: Natural Attenuation, Biostimulation, and Bioaugmentation with Rhodococcus erythropolis T902.1  ap. 297.  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are pollutants that occur in mangrove sediments. Their removal by bacteria often depends on specific characteristics as the number of benzene rings they possess and their solubility. Their removal also depends on environmental factors, such as pH, temperature, oxygen, and the ability of the endogenous or exogenous microflora to metabolize hydrocarbons. With the aim of treating mangrove sediments polluted by hydrocarbons in a biological way, a biodegradation experiment was conducted using mangrove sediments artificially contaminated with a mixture of four PAHs. The study used Rhodococcus erythropolis as an exogenous bacterial strain in order to assess the biodegradation of the PAH mixture by natural attenuation, biostimulation, bioaugmentation, and a combination of biostimulation and bioaugmentation. The results showed that the last three treatments were more efficient than natural attenuation. The biostimulation/bioaugmentation combination proved to be the most effective PAH degradation treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodococcus erythropolis 3abacteria 3abioaugmentation 3abiodegradation 3aenvironmental factors 3aoxygen 3apH 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asediments 3asolubility 3atemperature1 aDestain, Jacqueline1 aDelvigne, Frank1 aDruart, Philippe1 aOngena, Marc1 aThonart, Philippe0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2016 Sept., v. 227, no. 9 p.297-297dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-2999-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02024naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010500165300001200270520094800282592002801230650003001258650001201288650001701300650001901317650002601336650003401362650002501396650001501421700001701436700001801453773012501471856008101596852000901677655001201686IND60547975520221116223114.0160911e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054797552DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-016-2969-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaeza, Rocío10aPolyhydroxyalkanoate Biosynthesis from Paper Mill Wastewater Treated by a Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor  ap. 299.  aOne potential way for organic matter recovering contained in paper mill effluents can be obtaining polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA).

In proposed method, the PolSAR image is first segmented using the mean-shift method. Then, in each segment obtained from the mean shift, the first moment of color for the three color components of L* a* b* color space is obtained. On the other hand, a texture feature vector for each pixel of the image is formed corresponding to the texture edge energy at different directions with Gabor filter. Then, a new spectral clustering method is used to combine texture and color features. The results show that the proposed method is effective in PolSAR image segmentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aenergy 3apolarimetry 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atexture1 aRahmani, Masoumeh0 tNational Academy science letters.g2017 Apr., v. 40, no. 2 p.117-120dSpringer Indiax0250-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40009-016-0513-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245010700163300002000270520186100290592002802151650002302179650001302202650001802215650002002233650002202253650001102275650001102286650002502297650001602322650001602338653002002354653002002374653002402394653003502418653002002453700002102473700002602494700006102520773014202581856007902723852000902802655001202811IND60687562420210318000000.0210318e20200318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068756242DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b214842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubiak, Tomasz10aDirection-Specific Release from Capsules with Homogeneous or Janus Shells Using an Ultrasound Approach  ap. 15810-15822.  aA variety of approaches have been developed to release contents from capsules, including techniques that use electric or magnetic fields, light, or ultrasound as a stimulus.

Thus, the controllable and direction-specific release from microcapsules in a simple and effective way is still a great challenge. This greatly limits the use of microcapsules in applications where targeted and directional release is desirable. Here, we present a convenient ultrasonic method for controllable and unidirectional release of an encapsulated substance. The release is achieved by using MHz-frequency ultrasound that enables the inner liquid stretching, which imposes mechanical stress on the capsule’s shell. This leads to the puncturing of the shell and enables smooth liberation of the liquid payload in one direction. We demonstrate that 1–4.3 MHz acoustic waves with the intensity of a few W/cm² are capable of puncturing of particle capsules with diameters ranging from around 300 μm to 5 mm and the release of the encapsulated liquid in a controlled manner. Various aspects of our route, including the role of the capsule size, ultrasound wavelength, and intensity in the performance of the method, are studied in detail. We also show that the additional control of the release can be achieved by using capsules having patchy shells. The presented method can be used to facilitate chemical reactions in micro- and nanolitre droplets and various small-scale laboratory operations carried in bulk liquids in microenvironment. Our results may also serve as an entry point for testing other uses of the method and formulation of theoretical modeling of the presented ultrasound mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3adroplets 3aencapsulation 3amagnetic fields 3amechanical stress 3amodels 3asounds 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3awavelengths 0apatchy capsules 0aparticle shells 0adirectional release 0aultrasound-responsive droplets 0aacoustic stress1 aBanaszak, Joanna1 aJózefczak, Arkadiusz1 aRozynek, Zbigniew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0785-70880 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Mar. 18, v. 12, no. 13 p.15810-15822dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b214843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245008100161300001600242520195900258592002802217650001402245650002002259650001502279650002502294650001402319650001302333650000902346650001502355650001602370650001802386650000902404650001402413650001502427650002402442650001202466650001302478651001002491700002302501700002002524700002002544773015502564856007702719852000902796655001202805IND60772723220221118161554.0220422s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077272322DNAL7 a10.13031/trans.128032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalcante, Aldo10aEstimating the Total Lubricant Oil Consumption Rate in Agricultural Tractors  ap. 197-204.  aLubrication effectiveness is of paramount importance for the durability of machine components and efficient transmission of power. In addition to reducing the wear and friction of moving parts, lubricants remove potentially damaging heat and impurities and reduce the oxidation and corrosion of components. In agricultural tractors, lubricant oils are used in the engine, transmission, hydraulic system, front and rear axles, steering, and braking systems. This means that a substantial amount of oil must be changed at regular intervals, as recommended by manufacturers. This leads to a significant total oil consumption rate whose estimation is related to accurate accounting of tractor operating costs and to environmental impact analysis (e.g., LCA) of mechanized agricultural operations. The objective of this study was to propose a new general equation to estimate the total hourly lubricant oil consumption rate (HTOC) of agricultural tractors as a function of the rated engine power by extending the definition of lubricant oil consumption rate given by ASABE Standard D497.7. To this end, a linear regression analysis was conducted on a training dataset of 91 tractor models retrieved from OECD Code 2 reports. After validation with a dataset of 164 tractor models, the resulting equation for estimating the total lubricant oil consumption had an R2 = 0.75 and prediction RMSE of 0.033 kg h-1. The equation was finally applied to an independent dataset of actual oil lubricant consumption rates obtained from a field survey of 118 agricultural tractors operating in northern Italy. Application of the equation to the field survey data showed an R2 of 0.89 and RMSE of 0.010 kg h-1 between predicted and actual values. Overall, the considered statistical indicators (r, R2, RMSE, PBIAS, and NSE) pointed to a satisfactory prediction capability of the equation.

Yet, the associated effects on metal mobilization and potential distortion in bioavailability were not well documented. In this study, contaminated river sediment was treated by Ca(NO₃)₂ and CaO₂ in bench studies. Through the investigation of AVS removal, organic matter removal, the changes in sediment oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), microbial activity, and other indigenous parameters, the effects on metal bioavailability, bioaccessibility, and fraction redistribution in sediment were evaluated. The major mechanisms for sediment treated by Ca(NO₃)₂ and CaO₂ are biostimulation with indigenous denitrifying bacteria and chemical oxidation, respectively. After applying Ca(NO₃)₂ and CaO₂, the decreases of metal concentrations in the treated sediment were insignificant within a 35-day incubation period. However, the [SEMₜₒₜ-AVS]/f OC increased near to the effective boundary of toxicity (100 μmol g⁻¹ organic carbon (OC)), indicating that both bioavailability and bioaccessibility of metals (Cu, Zn, and Ni) to benthic organisms are enhanced after remediation. Metals were found redistributed from relatively stable fractions (oxidizable and residual fractions) to weakly bound fractions (exchangeable and reducible fractions), and the results are in line with the enhanced metal bioavailability. Compared with Ca(NO₃)₂, CaO₂ led to higher enhancement in metal bioavailability and bioaccessibility, and more significant metal redistribution, probably due to its stronger chemical reactive capacity to AVS and sediment organic matter. The reactions in CaO₂-treated sediment would probably shift from physicochemical to biochemical heterotrophic oxidation for sediment organic matter degradation. Therefore, further investigation on the long-term metal redistribution and associated mobility as well as bioavailability is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data  a51208145cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aJCYJ20130402100505795cShenzhen Knowledge Innovation Plan 3abenthic organisms 3abioavailability 3acalcium nitrate 3acalcium peroxide 3acarbon 3acopper 3adenitrifying bacteria 3amicrobial activity 3anickel 3aodors 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aredox potential 3aremediation 3arivers 3asediments 3asulfides 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aZhang, Zhen1 aMao, Yanqing1 aYan, Dickson Y.

Strain CB4T was found to be strictly aerobic, Gram-stain-positive, rod-shaped, motile and formed creamy greyish colonies on nutrient agar. The major fatty acids were identified as iso-C15 : 0 and iso-C16 : 0, and the predominant isoprenoid quinone as MK-7. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained glycine and alanine as the diagnostic amino acids and phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine, phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol and an unidentified aminophospholipid as the polar lipids. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain CB4T was 46.5 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, showed that strain CB4T forms a deep branch within the genus Aneurinibacillus, sharing the highest level of sequence homology with Aneurinibacillus aneurinilyticus DSM 5562T (96.5 %). On the basis of the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic characteristics, strain CB4T is considered to represent a novel species within the genus Aneurinibacillus, for which the name Aneurinibacillus soli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CB4T ( = KCTC 33505T = CECT 8566T). An emended description of the genus Aneurinibacillus is also proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAneurinibacillus aneurinilyticus 3aDNA 3aagar 3aalanine 3achemotaxonomy 3afatty acids 3amicrobiology 3amountain soils 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptidoglycans 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3aKorean Peninsula1 aKim, Kwang-gyu,1 aEom, Mi Kyung1 aKim, Jong-Shik1 aKim, Dae-Shin1 aKo, Suk-Hyung1 aLee, Jung-Sook0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2014 Nov., v. 64, no.

Dormant weed seed banks could be greatly depleted by application of a chemical that stimulates early‐season germination and then kills the young seedlings. Fluridone, a phytoene desaturase‐inhibiting herbicide that can also break seed dormancy, was assessed for its efficacy in this regard. RESULTS: The germination of fluridone‐treated Lolium rigidum seeds was stimulated on soils with low organic matter, and almost 100% seedling mortality was observed, while the treatment was only moderately effective on a high‐organic‐matter potting mix. Seedlings from wheat, canola, common bean and chickpea seeds sown on fluridone‐treated sandy loam were bleached and did not survive, but lupins and field peas grew normally. CONCLUSION: This proof‐of‐concept study with fluridone suggests that it may be possible to design safe and effective molecules that act as germination stimulants plus herbicides in a range of crop and soil types: a potentially novel way of utilising herbicides to stimulate seed bank germination and a valuable addition to an integrated weed management system.

Thus far, single‐codon non‐synonymous mutations of EPSPS (5‐enolypyruvylshikimate‐3‐phosphate synthase) have been rare and, relative to other herbicide mode of action target‐site mutations, unconventionally weak in magnitude for resistance to glyphosate. However, it is possible that weeds will emerge with non‐synonymous mutations of two codons of EPSPS to produce an enzyme endowing greater resistance to glyphosate. Today, target‐gene duplication is a common glyphosate resistance mechanism and could become a fundamental process for developing any resistance trait. Based on competition and substrate selectivity studies in several species, rapid vacuole sequestration of glyphosate occurs via a transporter mechanism. Conversely, as the chloroplast requires transporters for uptake of important metabolites, transporters associated with the two plastid membranes may separately, or together, successfully block glyphosate delivery. A model based on finite glyphosate dose and limiting time required for chloroplast loading sets the stage for understanding how uniquely different mechanisms can contribute to overall glyphosate resistance. © 2014 The Authors.

MBF integrates elements of X-radiographic seed quality assessment and mark-recapture methods from wildlife population sampling. Given a sample drawn from a population, individual seeds with attributes targeted for separation are labelled with a mark which biases the subsequent removal probability of other, non-marked seeds in the lot during grading and processing, after returning the sample to the population. Bias in the marking filter, in the form of extra mass or density added to seeds, minimizes the likelihood that uncertainty due to sampling error in the prior estimate will result in empty seeds remaining in the population during processing. In two experiments, a ponderosa pine seed lot was partitioned into empty and filled fractions with an air column separator. Powder dye talc was used for marking in the first trial, with low bias (<1%) and a small sample size (n = 150) with dry (2% moisture content) and soaked (26% moisture content) seed lots. A second trial conducted with two coats of spray paint used for marking and a larger sample size (n = 400) resulted in removal of 100% of non-filled seeds in the population. A simulation was conducted to evaluate sample statistics upon which to base the value of threshold bias, τ, below which seeds in an X-rayed sample should be marked to achieve consistent separation. Estimating the marking threshold based on quantiles of filled seeds most consistently resulted in removal of the non-filled fraction. MBF is a useful method for statistically linking one or more individual seed quality attributes extracted from X-ray image analysis with population-level processing of seed lots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus ponderosa 3aX-radiation 3aconifers 3adyes 3aimage analysis 3aseed quality 3aseeds 3atalc 3auncertainty 3awater content 3awildlife1 aDavis, Anthony S.0 tNew forests.g2012 Mar., v. 43, no. 2 p.169-184dSpringer-Verlagx0169-42867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-011-9271-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245007000207300001100277506007600288520173900364592002802103506003702131650001302168650001502181650003902196650001902235650001502254650001902269650001302288650003102301650003002332650003302362700001302395700001802408700001402426700001402440700001502454700001702469773011202486856008202598852000902680655001202689IND60523345020221207131253.0180619e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052334502DNAL7 a10.1186/s12983-016-0158-92doi7 aPMC49068442pmcid7 a273034372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuan, Yongying10aVisualization of the 3D structures of small organisms via LED-SIM  ap. 26.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Innovative new techniques that aid in the visualization of microscopic anatomical structures have improved our understanding of organismal biology significantly. It is often challenging to observe internal 3D structures, despite the use of techniques such as confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and others. In the current paper, we assess LED-SIM (DMD-based LED-illumination structured illumination microscopy), which facilitates the acquisition of nano- and micro-3D structures of small organisms in a high-resolution format (500 nm in the XY-plane and 930 nm along the Z-axis). RESULTS: We compare other microstructural imaging techniques (involving conventional optical microscopy, CLSM and Micro-CT) with LED-SIM to assess the quality (e.g. resolution, penetration depth, etc.) of LED-SIM images, as well as to document the potential short-comings of LED-SIM. Based on these results we present an optimized set of protocols to ensure that LED-SIM arthropod and nematode samples with different cuticles or textures are prepared for analysis in an optimal manner. Six arthropod and nematode specimens were tested and shown to be suitable for LED-SIM imaging, which was found to yield high resolution 3D images. CONCLUSIONS: Although LED-SIM still must be thoroughly tested before it is widely accepted and the Z-axis resolution still requires improvement, this technique offers distinct high quality 3D images. LED-SIM can be highly effective and may provide high quality 3D images for zoological studies following the guidelines of sample preparation presented in the current paper.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNematoda 3aarthropods 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adigital images 3aguidelines 3aimage analysis 3alighting 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amicro-computed tomography 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aDan, Dan1 aZhang, Mengna1 aBai, Ming1 aLei, Ming1 aYao, Baoli1 aYang, Xingke0 tFrontiers in zoology.g2016 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.26-26dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001775x1742-99947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12983-016-0158-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245013500169506002800304520141800332592002801750506003701778650002001815650002501835650002001860650002001880650001901900650001401919650002301933650001001956653003001966653002401996653002802020653002502048700001802073700002202091773009302113856008002206852000902286655001202295IND60764683020221207092855.0211122e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076468302DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2111222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSUSANTO, AGUS HERY 10aMolecular characteristics of two phenotypically identical species of Asteraceae based on the intergenic spacer trnT(UGU)-trnL(UAA)  aResource is Open Access  aSusanto AH, Dwiati M, Pratiwi S. 2020. Molecular characteristics of two phenotypically identical species of Asteraceae based on the intergenic spacer trnT(UGU)-trnL(UAA). Biodiversitas 21: 5164-5169. Ogiera (Eleutheranthera ruderalis) and nodeweed (Synedrella nodiflora) are two different weed species belonging to the family Asteraceae commonly found in tropical regions. At a glance, both species show highly identical morphology, thus leading to difficulty in distinguishing between them. Therefore, molecular data based on particular markers are required. Here, we use an intergenic spacer (IGS) in the cpDNA, i.e., trnT(UGU)-trnL(UAA), as the molecular marker to reveal the difference between the two species. A pair of PCR universal primers, i.e., B48557 as the forward primer and A49291 as the reverse primer, were employed to amplify the marker. Sequence alignment was performed by the use of ClustalW implemented in Bioedit version 7.0.4.1. The results revealed that some differences with respect to both indel and base substitution were observed. Overall, this led to longer IGS trnT(UGU)-trnL(UAA) sequences of E. ruderalis than those of S. nodiflora. Although no direct relationship between the genetic and phenotypic dissimilarities was proven, coincidence seemed likely to exist. This provides molecular evidence that the two phenotypically similar species are genetically different from each other.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEleutheranthera 3aSynedrella nodiflora 3achloroplast DNA 3agenetic markers 3aintergenic DNA 3aphenotype 3asequence alignment 3aweeds 0aeleutheranthera ruderalis 0agenetic differences 0aigs trnt(ugu)-trnl(uaa) 0asynedrella nodiflora1 aDwiati, Murni1 aPratiwi, Salabila0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Oct., v. 21, no. 11dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2111223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100006200190245006700252300001800319506007600337520135100413592002801764506003701792650002501829650001701854650001201871650001601883650002501899650001201924700002401936700005401960700002102014700006402035773011802099856008302217852000902300655001202309IND60598704420221207111733.0180702e20180319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059870442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b001402doi7 aPMC61925182pmcid7 a295537182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedley, Anthony M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1034-507210aRole of HSP90 in the Regulation of de Novo Purine Biosynthesis  ap. 3217-3221.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDespite purines making up one of the largest classes of metabolites in a cell, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms that facilitate efficient purine production. Under conditions resulting in high purine demand, enzymes within the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway cluster into multienzyme assemblies called purinosomes. Purinosome formation has been linked to molecular chaperones HSP70 and HSP90; however, the involvement of these molecular chaperones in purinosome formation remains largely unknown. Here, we present a new-found biochemical mechanism for the regulation of de novo purine biosynthetic enzymes mediated through HSP90. HSP90–client protein interaction assays were employed to identify two enzymes within the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, PPAT and FGAMS, as client proteins of HSP90. Inhibition of HSP90 by STA9090 abrogated these interactions and resulted in a decrease in the level of available soluble client protein while having no significant effect on their interactions with HSP70. These findings provide a mechanism to explain the dependence of purinosome assembly on HSP90 activity. The combined efforts of molecular chaperones in the maturation of PPAT and FGAMS result in purinosome formation and are likely essential for enhancing the rate of purine production to meet intracellular purine demand.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3aenzymes 3ametabolites 3amolecular chaperones 3apurines1 aKarras, Georgios I.1 aZhang, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6686-16451 aLindquist, Susan1 aBenkovic, Stephen J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3680-34810 tBiochemistry.g2018 Mar. 19, v. 57, no. 23 p.3217-3221dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b001403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245011900156300001800275500002000293520164100313592002801954650002301982650001502005650001502020650001602035650001902051650001502070650001502085650001102100650001302111650002602124650002102150650001802171650001502189650001402204650001402218650002702232650001902259650001902278700002702297700002202324700001802346700002002364700001902384700002202403700001702425700001802442700002202460700001602482700002402498773009202522856007202614852000902686655001202695IND60586752520221120060112.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058675252DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.20292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLind, Eric M.10aIncreased grassland arthropod production with mammalian herbivory and eutrophication: a test of mediation pathways  ap. 3022-3033.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIncreases in nutrient availability and alterations to mammalian herbivore communities are a hallmark of the Anthropocene, with consequences for the primary producer communities in many ecosystems.

We quantified arthropod biomass after manipulating soil nutrient availability and wild mammalian herbivory, using identical methods across 13 temperate grasslands. Of experimental increases in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, only treatments including nitrogen resulted in significantly increased arthropod biomass. Wild mammalian herbivore removal had a marginal, negative effect on arthropod biomass, with no interaction with nutrient availability. Path analysis including all sites implicated nutrient content of the primary producers as a driver of increased arthropod mean size, which we confirmed using 10 sites for which we had foliar nutrient data. Plant biomass and physical structure mediated the increase in arthropod abundance, while the nitrogen treatments accounted for additional variation not explained by our measured plant variables. The mean size of arthropod individuals was 2.5 times more influential on the plot‐level total arthropod biomass than was the number of individuals. The eutrophication of grasslands through human activity, especially nitrogen deposition, thus may contribute to higher production of arthropod consumers through increases in nutrient availability across trophic levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthropocene epoch 3aarthropods 3aecosystems 3aenergy flow 3aeutrophication 3agrasslands 3aherbivores 3ahumans 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrient content 3apath analysis 3aphosphorus 3aphytomass 3apotassium 3asecondary productivity 3asoil nutrients 3atrophic levels1 aLa Pierre, Kimberly J.1 aSeabloom, Eric W.1 aAlberti, Juan1 aIribarne, Oscar1 aFirn, Jennifer1 aGruner, Daniel S.1 aKay, Adam D.1 aPascal, Jesus1 aWright, Justin P.1 aYang, Louie1 aBorer, Elizabeth T.0 tEcology.g2017 Dec., v. 98, no. 12 p.3022-3033dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.20293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245006600160300001800226520126900244592002801513596007901541650000801620650002001628650001901648650002101667650001201688650001701700650002201717650002401739651002801763700001801791700002101809773015701830856007701987852000902064655001202073IND60772723720221118161317.0220409s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077272372DNAL7 a10.13031/trans.128142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodyn, Dorota10aImpact of Fogging System on Thermal Comfort of Lactating Sows  ap. 1933-1938.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a simple fogging system on the microclimate of a farrowing room and the sows’ welfare, which was analyzed through physiological indicators such as respiration rate, and rectal and skin surface temperature. Of 42 lactating sows, 21 were housed in a section (section I) of the farrowing room with a high-pressure fogging system, while the other group (n = 21) were housed without any cooling treatment (section II). Significant differences were found between mean values of microclimatic parameters. The air temperature in section I with active cooling was 2.1°C (p = 0.01) lower than in section II; however, the cooling induced a significant (p = 0.01) increase (18.6%) in air relative humidity. The mean temperature-humidity index (THI) was 0.8 lower (p = 0.05) in the cooled section. The fogging system had a significant impact on the reduction of respiration rate. Rectal and skin surface temperatures were at similar levels in both groups of sows. Based on this study, future research is needed to continue the development of this system as well as new technologies that would be applicable for the climate conditions of central and eastern Europe.

We developed and tested a real-time (Q-)PCR assay for the species-specific detection of C. perfringens that targets the phospholipase C (plc) gene and includes an internal amplification control (IAC), making it possible to identify false-negative results, which are common due to the high level of PCR inhibition by food compounds. The CPplc-IAC real-time PCR (RTi-PCR) assay was 100% selective, as shows with 36 Clostridium strains and 85 non-Clostridium strains, with an analytical sensitivity of 1 genome equivalent (GE) in 23% of the reactions and 10 GE in 100% of the reactions. The quantification was linear (R ² = 0.9990) over a 7-log dynamic range, down to 10 GE, with a PCR efficiency E = 0.841. The applicability of this RTi-PCR assay was assessed in milk samples. The assay detected as few as 300 spores in 25 mL of artificially contaminated raw sheep milk with 78% probability and 30 spores in 25 mL with 50% probability. It also has accuracy of 83.03 to 151.18%, as shown by an evaluation of the correspondence between RTi-PCR assay results and the number of spores per milliliter determinated by standard plating. This RTi-PCR method was effective for the detection and quantification of C. perfringens in milk having an important applicability in the control of this pathogen in the dairy food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium perfringens 3aanalytical methods 3adetection limit 3aewe milk 3afood industry 3afoodborne illness 3agenes 3ahumans 3amilk 3apathogens 3aphospholipase C 3aprobability 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3araw milk 3aspores1 aLópez-Enríquez, Lorena1 aRodríguez-Lázaro, David,0 tFood analytical methods.g2017 May, v. 10, no. 5 p.1139-1147dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-017-0821-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012200169300001600291520140200307592002801709650001701737650001401754650001001768650002701778650002201805650001901827650001301846650001401859650003901873650001101912650001601923650001001939650003101949651001301980700001701993700001402010700001202024700001702036700001702053700001802070773008102088856008102169852000902250655001202259IND60547898020221118022037.0160903e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054789802DNAL7 a10.1007/s13237-016-0171-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangpakdee, Wiwat10aCharacterization of chromosomal rearrangements in pileated gibbon (Hylobates pileatus) using multiplex-FISH technique  ap. 131-135.  aHere we aimed to characterize evolutionary conserved chromosomal rearrangements of pileated gibbon (H. pileatus, HPI) compared to human using multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) technique. Khon Kaen Zoo, Thailand, kindly provided the blood specimen of this gibbon. Lymphoblast cells were cultured from male HPI by standard method; chromosome preparation was done following standard protocols. All 24 human (Homo sapiens, HSA) chromosome probes (M-FISH probe set) were applied on HPI. Results indicated that male HPI had diploid chromosome numbers of 2n = 44; the karyotype consists of metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes. During evolution chromosomes of HPI underwent certain rearrangements when compared with human chromosomes and showed 55 conserved regions of different sizes. Majority of HPI chromosomes are constituted of regions being homologous to two or more human chromosomes. The remainder appeared to be conserved, such as HPI chromosomes 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, X and Y which were homologous to only one human chromosome, each. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using all 24 HSA probes on HPI; the genetic data may be additionally useful for comparison of gibbons, both within and between genera, to elucidate and clarify more regarding evolutionary lineage of animals in the order primates derived from the same common ancestor known so far.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHomo sapiens 3aHylobates 3ablood 3achromosome aberrations 3achromosome number 3acultured cells 3adiploidy 3aevolution 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3ahumans 3akaryotyping 3amales 3asubmetacentric chromosomes 3aThailand1 aPhimphan, S.1 aLiehr, T.1 aFan, X.1 aPinthong, K.1 aPatawang, I.1 aTanomtong, A.0 tNucleus.g2016 Aug., v. 59, no. 2 p.131-135dSpringer Indiax0029-568X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13237-016-0171-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01828naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245008700171300001800258520081800276592002801094650000801122650001701130650001701147650001501164650001901179650002001198650002601218700006001244773011801304856008301422852000901505655001201514IND60598704520221119192350.0180702e20180316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059870452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b001412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Caitlin M.10aLabeling for Quantitative Comparison of Imaging Measurements in Vitro and in Cells  ap. 1929-1938.  aQualitative imaging of biomolecular localization and distribution inside cells has revolutionized cell biology. Most of these powerful techniques require modifications to the target biomolecule. Over the past 10 years, these techniques have been extended to quantitative measurements, from in-cell protein folding rates to complex dissociation constants to RNA lifetimes. Such measurements can be affected even when a target molecule is just mildly perturbed by its labels. Here, the impact of labeling on protein (and RNA) structure, stability, and function in cells is discussed via practical examples from the recent literature. General guidelines for selecting and validating modification sites are provided to bring the best from cell biology and imaging to quantitative biophysical experiments inside cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3acell biology 3adissociation 3aguidelines 3aimage analysis 3aprotein folding 3aquantitative analysis1 aGruebele, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9291-81230 tBiochemistry.g2018 Mar. 16, v. 57, no. 13 p.1929-1938dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b001413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245009100211500001900302520187600321592002802197650001102225650001302236650001302249650000902262650001302271650001202284653001902296653001902315653002102334653004102355653002302396700006202419700006402481773012102545856008302666852000902749655001202758IND60719548420221117235633.0210223e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071954842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tcam.2020.1004992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCallin, Ashlee J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8245-106110aPyometra Management Practices in the High Quality, High Volume Spay-Neuter Environment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPyometra management in the high quality, high volume spay-neuter (HQHVSN) environment is not well documented. The goal of this study was to identify pyometra management practices and patient outcomes in the HQHVSN environment. An electronic survey was piloted and distributed to HQHVSN clinics using Survey Monkey via email lists and social media. A total of 118 responses were received from June to July 2020. Respondents were distributed across the United States with the majority of clinics associated with a shelter (75%). Clinics performed a median of 25 spays and neuters per day and 5000 per year. Most clinics (86%) were willing to treat nonincidental pyometras at least sometimes, and nearly all of these clinics (97%) were willing to accept pyometra referrals. Of these clinics, nearly all (95%) felt they had the necessary resources to treat most pyometras that presented and that a pyometra case was only modestly disruptive to their surgery flow. Most clinics (70%) charged a fee for treatment, charging a median of $200 for dogs and $125 for cats. This is much lower as compared to the estimated ranges for private practice ($600-$2500) and emergency hospitals ($1500-$3579). The majority of patients that HQHVSN clinics accepted for treatment were seen the same day (50%) or next day (42%). These clinics estimated that of the animals who presented, 76% were BAR or QAR, 20% were depressed or nonambulatory, and 4% were obtunded and lateral. Estimated survival for these treated groups were 98%, 80%, and 38%, respectively. HQHVSN clinics may represent a resource for treating pyometras when treatment is disruptive to the schedule of a private practice or clients present with financial limitations. There is an opportunity for HQHVSN and private practice to form a partnership to leverage the strengths of both models and improve access to care for pets.  aPublisher supplied data 3ae-mail 3amedicine 3apatients 3apets 3apyometra 3asurveys 0aanimal shelter 0aaccess to care 0ashelter medicine 0ahigh quality high volume spay-neuter 0aovariohysterectomy1 aHough, Veronica A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1447-50261 aKreisler, Rachael E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5562-55210 tTopics in companion animal medicine.g2021 Mar., v. 42 p.100499-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000157x1938-97367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcam.2020.1004993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010400171300001400275520119500289592002801484650001801512650001501530650001401545650002001559650001901579650001101598650001101609650001301620650001601633700002701649700002301676773011601699856008101815852000901896655001201905IND60573873720221121025302.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057387372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00427-016-0563-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulakova, Milana A.10aEarly mesodermal expression of Hox genes in the polychaete Alitta virens (Annelida, Lophotrochozoa)  ap. 69-74.  aHox genes are the key regulators of axial regionalization of bilaterian animals. However, their main function is fulfilled differently in the development of animals from different evolutionary branches. Early patterning of the developing embryos by Hox gene expression in the representatives of protostomes (arthropods, mollusks) starts in the ectodermal cells. On the contrary, the instructive role of the mesoderm in the axial patterning was demonstrated for vertebrates. This makes it difficult to understand if during the axial regionalization of ancestral bilaterians Hox genes first expressed in the developing mesoderm or the ectoderm. To resolve this question, it is necessary to expand the number of models for investigation of the early axial patterning. Here, we show that three Hox genes of the polychaete Alitta virens (formerly Nereis virens, Annelida, Lophotrochozoa)—Hox2, Hox4, and Lox5—are expressed in the mesodermal anlagen of the three future larval chaetigerous segments in spatially colinear manner before the initiation of Hox expression in the larval ectoderm. This is the first evidence of sequential Hox gene expression in the mesoderm of protostomes to date.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlitta virens 3aarthropods 3aevolution 3agene expression 3ahomeotic genes 3alarvae 3amodels 3amolluscs 3avertebrates1 aBakalenko, Nadezhda I.1 aNovikova, Elena L.0 tDevelopment genes and evolution.g2017 Jan., v. 227, no. 1 p.69-74dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0949-944X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00427-016-0563-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013600166300001800302520157800320592002801898650001201926650002601938650002601964650001601990650001102006650002002017650001002037650001702047650004202064650001802106650001302124650001402137650001102151650004302162650005202205650001802257650001502275650002502290700001302315700002102328700003302349700002902382773016602411856008202577852000902659655001202668IND60517825820221118053000.0191003e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051782582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-5843-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapoor, Vikram10aUse of functional gene expression and respirometry to study wastewater nitrification activity after exposure to low doses of copper  ap. 6443-6450.  aAutotrophic nitrification in biological nitrogen removal systems has been shown to be sensitive to the presence of heavy metals in wastewater treatment plants. Using transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) data, we examined the effect of copper on the relative expression of functional genes (i.e., amoA, hao, nirK, and norB) involved in redox nitrogen transformation in batch enrichment cultures obtained from a nitrifying bioreactor operated as a continuous reactor (24-h hydraulic retention time). 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene next-generation sequencing showed that Nitrosomonas-like populations represented 60–70 % of the bacterial community, while other nitrifiers represented <5 %. We observed a strong correspondence between the relative expression of amoA and hao and ammonia removal in the bioreactor. There were no considerable changes in the transcript levels of amoA, hao, nirK, and norB for nitrifying samples exposed to copper dosages ranging from 0.01 to 10 mg/L for a period of 12 h. Similar results were obtained when ammonia oxidation activity was measured via specific oxygen uptake rate (sOUR). The lack of nitrification inhibition by copper at doses lower than 10 mg/L may be attributed to the role of copper as cofactor for ammonia monooxygenase or to the sub-inhibitory concentrations of copper used in this study. Overall, these results demonstrate the use of molecular methods combined with conventional respirometry assays to better understand the response of wastewater nitrifying systems to the presence of copper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aammonia monooxygenase 3abacterial communities 3abioreactors 3acopper 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheavy metals 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aLi, Xuan1 aChandran, Kartik1 aImpellitteri, Christopher A.1 aSanto Domingo, Jorge W.,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Apr., v. 23, no. 7 p.6443-6450dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5843-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011700163300001800280520121600298592002801514596005801542596005801600596007801658596006501736596008401801650002301885650001201908650002001920650002701940650002401967650000901991650002002000650001102020650001402031651001002045700001502055700001602070700001402086700001402100700001202114773016602126856008202292852000902374655001202383IND60517825920221117172041.0191003e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051782592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-5801-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Silin14aThe concentration and chemical speciation of arsenic in the Nanpan River, the upstream of the Pearl River, China  ap. 6451-6458.  aThe concentration and chemical speciation of arsenic (As) in different environmental matrixes (water, sediment, agricultural soils, and non-agricultural soils) were investigated in the Nanpan River area, the upstream of Pearl River, China. The results did not show any obvious transport of As along the flow direction of the river (from upstream to downstream). Total As concentrations in sediment were significantly different from those in agricultural soil. According to the comparison to quality standards, the As in sediments of the studied area have potential ecological risks and a minority of the sampling sites of agricultural soils in the studied area were polluted with As. As speciations were analyzed using sequential extraction and the percentage of non-residual fraction in sediment predominated over residual fraction. We thus believe that As in the studied area was with low mobility and bioavailability in sediment, agricultural soils, and non-agricultural soils. However, the bioavailability and mobility of As in sediment were higher than in both agricultural and non-agricultural soils, and thus, special attention should be paid for the risk assessment of As in the river in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data  a41173124cthe National Scientific Foundation of China  a41303092cthe National Scientific Foundation of China  a2010CI109cthe Recruitment Program of Highly-Qualified Scholars in Yunnan  a2013Y119cEducational Commission of Yunnan Province of China  a111417cthe Key Scientific Research Foundation of Southwest Forestry University 3aagricultural soils 3aarsenic 3abioavailability 3achemical concentration 3achemical speciation 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asediments 3aChina1 aZhao, Ning1 aZhou, Dequn1 aWei, Rong1 aYang, Bin1 aPan, Bo0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Apr., v. 23, no. 7 p.6451-6458dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5801-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245005600168300001600224500001100240520106900251592002801320650002501348650002001373650004201393650001301435650001901448650001701467650002001484773011201504856008101616852000901697655001201706IND60547976320221116222215.0160903e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054797632DNAL7 a10.1007/s12374-016-0200-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Dong-Hoon10aFunctional diversity of microRNA variants in plants  ap. 303-310.  aReview  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that play a crucial role in plant growth, development, and stress responses by regulating target gene expression. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, it has been facilitated to identify new miRNAs, as well as diversity and variability of miRNA variants. miRNA variants share the sequences with other closely related miRNAs and contain length and/or sequence variations at the 5’-, 3’-ends, as well as internal positions. They originate from the same miRNA precursor or from the diversity of members in the same miRNA family. It has been reported that tissue- or condition-specific variation in the relative abundance of different miRNA variants could contribute to differential functions of those in development or stress responses. In addition, the diversity of miRNA variants affects stability, loading efficiency onto AGO, and target selection. In this review, the diversification of miRNA sequences and the evidences of the distinct functional role of miRNA variants will be discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3afunctional diversity 3agene expression 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3aplant growth 3astress response0 tJournal of plant biology =.g2016 Aug., v. 59, no. 4 p.303-310dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1226-92397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12374-016-0200-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245004400173300001400217500001100231520087100242592002801113596004601141650001401187650001501201650001001216650002001226650001001246650001701256650001701273650001301290650001901303650001801322700006101340700002601401700001901427773011701446856008201563852000901645655001201654IND60627310320221116220435.0190514e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062731032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-018-2628-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlica, Roxana-Andreea10aFumaric acid: production and separation  ap. 47-57.  aReview  aFumaric acid is a valuable compound used in foods, beverages, detergents, animal feed, pharmaceuticals and miscellaneous industrial products.

In this context, numerous studies focus on improving the fermentation process not only by using renewable raw material and genetically modified microorganisms, but also by developing and applying different downstream techniques for easy recovery of fumaric acid from the fermented broth. This review presents the main methods for production and separation of fumaric acid, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of these and the potential economic impact in industry.  aPublisher supplied data  aPN-III-P4-ID-PCE-2016-0100cCNCS-UEFISCDI 3abeverages 3adetergents 3adrugs 3aeconomic impact 3afeeds 3afermentation 3afumaric acid 3aindustry 3amicroorganisms 3araw materials1 aKloetzer, Lenuţa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2541-46861 aGalaction, Anca-Irina1 aCaşcaval, Dan0 tBiotechnology letters.g2019 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.47-57dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-018-2628-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245017900166300001500345520166700360592002802027650002202055650001002077650001902087650002002106650001702126650004302143650002102186650001402207650001802221650001502239650000902254650001502263650002702278650002002305650002902325650004402354653001802398653003302416653002402449653004002473653003602513653002402549700001602573700001402589700005502603700001602658700001802674700005102692700005402743773009102797856008602888852000902974655001202983IND60630674620221117013335.0190410e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063067462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2019.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yanqiu10aIntegration of stable isotope labeling derivatization and magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction for measurement of neurosteroids by in vivo microdialysis and UHPLC-MS/MS  ap. 97-106.  aIn this work, a novel strategy of stable isotope labeling derivatization (SILD) combined with magnetic dispersive solid-phase extraction (MDSPE), has been proposed for simultaneous monitoring of neurosteroids changes linked to Parkinson's disease (PD) by in vivo microdialysis. The developed method was based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) detection using multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. In this study, a new pair of stable isotope labeling reagents d0-/d3-3-N-methyl-2′-carboxyl Rhodamine 6G (d0-/d3-MCR6G), were designed and synthesized for derivatizing neurosteroids in rat blood microdialysates and neurosteroid standards, respectively. d3-MCR6G labeled neurosteroids standards were used as internal standard for the following pretreatment and UHPLC-MS/MS quantification to minimize the deviations caused by complex matrix and ion suppression effects in mass spectrometry analysis. Under the optimized derivatization and extraction conditions, good linearities of eight neurosteroids were obtained with correlation coefficients R2 values > 0.98. The limits of detection (LODs) and quantitation (LOQs) ranged from 0.06 to 0.12 pg/mL and 0.30–0.40 pg/mL, respectively. Taken together, the established method exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity, excellent accuracy, convenience and high efficiency. It was applied for the simultaneous and dynamic measurement of multiple neurosteroids in normal and PD rat blood microdialysates. This method would be expected to be potentially useful for the monitoring and drug treatment of PD and related neurological disorders in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3ablood 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3adrug therapy 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aisotope labeling 3amagnetism 3amicrodialysis 3amonitoring 3arats 3arhodamines 3asolid phase extraction 3astable isotopes 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aNeurosteroids 0aIsotope-coded derivatization 0aMagnetic separation 0aTriple quadrupole mass spectrometry 0aIn vivo microdialysis technique 0aParkinson's disease1 aSun, Luping1 aWang, Xin1 aZhu, Shuyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9632-81871 aYou, Jinmao1 aZhao, Xian-En1 aBai, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1542-02971 aLiu, Huwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6540-96570 tTalanta.g2019 July 01, v. 199 p.97-106dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245018000201300002000381520155400401592002801955650001501983650001501998650002002013650003002033650002602063650001302089650001702102650001602119650001302135650001402148650002002162653001202182653002702194653001302221653000802234653000902242653001302251700006302264700002202327700006002349773014202409856007802551852000902629655001202638IND60687563120221122053651.0200401e20200227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068756312DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b218462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeon, Seokmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1230-906X10aKinetics of Dimethyl Methylphosphonate Adsorption and Decomposition on Zirconium Hydroxide Using Variable Temperature In Situ Attenuated Total Reflection Infrared Spectroscopy  ap. 14662-14671.  aThe decomposition mechanisms of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), a widely used simulant for organophosphorus chemical warfare agents (CWAs), are relatively well understood from previous studies. However, there still lacks a quantitative description of DMMP decomposition kinetics under ambient conditions that is relevant for sequestration applications. We investigated adsorption and decomposition kinetics of DMMP on amorphous zirconium hydroxide (ZH) using variable-temperature in situ attenuated total reflection (ATR) infrared spectroscopy. We demonstrate that quantifying DMMP decomposition kinetics using conventional methods, where the integrated absorbance of P–O vibrational modes is monitored, can be inaccurate because these spectra are also convoluted with C–O vibrational modes from transient surface methoxy species that are not proportional to DMMP decomposition due to methanol desorption. Here, we propose to use the ρ(PCH₃) modes as an alternative way to track DMMP adsorption and decomposition reactions. On the basis of density functional theory (DFT) simulations and comparisons to relatively unreactive monoclinic zirconia (m-ZrO₂), we assign the deconvoluted components of the ρ(PCH₃) region and use it to monitor decomposition products over time at various temperatures. Because the PCH₃ group is present in many toxic organophosphorus compounds, tracking the PCH₃ bands in time-dependent IR spectra is useful for measuring surface kinetics of CWAs and their simulants on various decontamination materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aadsorption 3adecontamination 3adensity functional theory 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amethanol 3aphosphonates 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3azirconium 3azirconium oxide 0aZr(OH)4 0achemical warfare agent 0asimulant 0aCWA 0aDMMP 0asorption1 aSchweigert, Igor V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9474-77671 aPehrsson, Pehr E.1 aBalow, Robert B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2407-01050 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 27, v. 12, no. 13 p.14662-14671dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b218463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245009600159300001800255520139500273592002801668650003001696650000801726650001301734650001401747650001901761650001601780650001701796650001201813650001601825650001301841650001201854650001701866650002501883650000701908650003001915650001401945650001801959650002001977650001101997700001502008700001802023700001502041700002202056773017902078856007802257852000902335655001202344IND60118188720221122130606.0141126e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011818872DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.064345-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yu-Fan10aClostridium algifaecis sp. nov., an anaerobic bacterial species from decomposing algal scum  ap. 3844-3848.  aTwo anaerobic bacterial strains, MB9-7T and MB9-9, were isolated from decomposing algal scum and were characterized using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strains MB9-7T and MB9-9 are closely related to each other (99.7 % similarity) and they are also closely related to Clostridium tyrobutyricum (96.5 %). The two strains were Gram-stain positive and rod-shaped. Growth occurred at 20–45 °C, at pH 4.0–8.0 and at NaCl concentrations of up to 2 % (w/v). Acid was produced from glucose, xylose and mannose. Products of fermentation in PYG medium were mainly butyrate, acetate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The predominant cellular fatty acids were C14 : 0 and C16 : 0. The cellular polar lipids comprised phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, two glycolipids, one phospholipid, one aminophospholipid and two aminolipids. The DNA G+C contents of strain MB9-7T and MB9-9 were 27.9 and 28.7 mol%, respectively. These results support the assignment of the new isolates to the genus Clostridium and also distinguish them from other species of the genus Clostridium. Hence, it is proposed that strains MB9-7T and MB9-9 represent a novel species of the genus Clostridium, with the suggested name Clostridium algifaecis sp. nov. The type strain is MB9-7T ( = CGMCC 1.5188T = DSM 28783T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium tyrobutyricum 3aDNA 3aacetates 3abutyrates 3acarbon dioxide 3afatty acids 3afermentation 3aglucose 3aglycolipids 3ahydrogen 3amannose 3amicrobiology 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asodium chloride 3axylose1 aZheng, Hui1 aWu, Qing-long1 aYang, Hong1 aLiu, Shuang-Jiang0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2014 Nov., v. 64, no.

Based on the corner reflector (CR) evaluation, it was found that the co-pol channel imbalance phase may exceed the maximum tolerance in the distributed standard product, i.e., ±10°. The ground-deployed CRs are the most precise way to calibrate the phase error. However, the Mongolia calibration site of Gaofen-3 is a temporal calibration field, and the calibration time is limited for the periodic evaluation over the 8-year satellite life. In this paper, to accelerate the Gaofen-3 calibration mission, we propose an improved unitary zero helix (IUZH) framework to fully replace the use of CRs when estimating the co-pol channel imbalance phase by the use of natural media. Compared with our previous works (Shi et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2020), this novel algorithm presents three main contributions to remote sensing society. Firstly, we believe that this natural media calibration technique could replace the use of CRs, to satisfy the radar design specification, and that this natural media calibration technique could be more than just a substitute in an emergency event when there are no CRs deployed in-scene. Secondly, the IUZH framework is less dependent on choosing the particular reference targets, such as isolated point-like objects or Amazon forest. As a result, it will help radar researchers to relax the constraint of selecting references, and will make the non-CR calibration task easier in satellite or airborne cases. Last but not least, the proposed technique simultaneously derives the calibration phase after the sensor has completed a long-strip observation, which will significantly accelerate the Gaofen-3 external calibration mission, at little cost and time-consuming. The experiments with more than 500 images demonstrate that the phase bias of the Gaofen-3 standard product can be robustly calibrated, even when CRs are unavailable in the scene. The HH and VV imbalance phase with the IUZH method is generally found to be less than 4°. The potential phase error of the Gaofen-3 product is thus significantly suppressed, and the calibration accuracy satisfies the 10° design specification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acalibration 3aforests 3apolarimetry 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aAmazonia 3aMongolia 0aPolarimetric synthetic aperture radar 0aGaofen-3 0aImage quality1 aLi, Pingxiang1 aYang, Jie1 aSun, Hanwei1 aZhao, Lingli1 aZhang, Liangpei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6890-36500 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2020 Feb., v. 160 p.229-243dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

We evaluated the effect of heat exposure on time to adult emergence with pupae of both early and late populations in three experiments. Heat exposure consisted of 12 h at 25 degrees C followed by 12 h at 35 degrees C for different periods of time (10-30 d). In the first experiment, the time to emergence at 20 degrees C was sharply reduced in most samples of pupae of the late population kept in an incubator and exposed to heat relatively early in diapause. However, regardless of the duration of exposure, pupal development always stalled at a threshold of approximately equal to 50 d to emergence. In the second experiment, heat exposure increased time to emergence in most samples of pupae of the late population brought from outdoors immediately before the onset of high soil temperature. These pupae also took approximately equal to 50 d to emergence after the end of the heat exposure, despite being more advanced in diapause than the pupae in the previous experiment. In the last experiment, short heat exposure accelerated, and longer exposure delayed development of pupae of the early population. As in the previous experiments, emergence occurred approximately equal to 50 d after the end of the heat exposure. These results suggest that a heat-induced quiescence is a likely cause for the developmental delay observed in pupae of the late population through summer. Furthermore, the similar time to emergence after heat exposure of both pupae of early and late populations suggests that a discrete quiescence-sensitive period occurs during a specific stage of pupal development in the blueberry maggot. This is the first report of a heat-induced quiescence interrupting diapause development in the blueberry maggot or any Rhagoletis fruit flies. 3aeclosion 3apupal development 3apupae 3aphenology 3aheat stress 3adiapause 3aduration 3aRhagoletis mendax 3atemperature 3ablueberries 3aVaccinium corymbosum 0aquiescence-sensitive period 0adevelopmental stages 0alate population 0aearly population1 aPolavarapu, S.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2005 Apr., v. 34, no. 2 p.292-297dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-34.2.2923Available from publisher's Web site  a20060104b20060202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/11/03  aOther US 7aarticle02803naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011100172300001800283520115400301536023201455592002801687596000801715650002701723650002301750650002701773650002401800650002501824650002301849650001801872650002001890650002201910650001601932650001501948650001301963650001301976653002201989653002502011700001802036700001602054700002102070700002202091773012502113856008602238852000902324655001202333IND60758535920221122212144.0220112e20211202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075853592DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2020.17568032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCimmino, Alessio10aIsolation of 2,5-diketopiperazines from Lysobacter capsici AZ78 with activity against Rhodococcus fascians  ap. 4969-4977.  aInhibitory activity of the biocontrol bacterial strain Lysobacter capsici AZ78 is related to the production of cyclo(l-Pro-l-Tyr), a 2,5-diketopiperazine with in vitro and in vivo toxic activity against Phytophthora infestans and Plasmopara viticola. Further investigation of culture filtrate organic extracts showed its ability to produce other 2,5-diketopiperazines. They were isolated and identified by spectroscopic (¹H NMR and ESIMS) and physic (specific optical rotation) methods as cyclo(l-Pro-l-Val), cyclo(d-Pro-d-Phe), cyclo(l-Pro-l-Leu), and cyclo(d-Pro-l-Tyr). When tested against the phytopathogenic Gram-positive bacterium Rhodococcus fascians LMG 3605, cyclo(l-Pro-l-Val) showed a toxic activity similar to chloramphenicol at a comparable concentration. Overall, these data suggest that 2,5-diketopiperazines represent a class of metabolites characterizing the metabolome of L. capsici AZ78.

However, the underlying mechanism of this phase and the morphological transformations has rarely been explored. In this study, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques were used to determine the changes in structure and morphology of LiAlO₂ samples lifted by a focused ion beam. In accordance with X-ray diffraction analysis, TEM images show that under H-rich conditions the rhombohedral α-LiAlO₂ transforms to tetragonal γ-LiAlO₂ phase with the appearance of the (101)-terminated octahedral-shaped γ-LiAlO₂ crystallites. We further support, and plausibly rationalize, the observed transformations using density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The DFT computed surface energies of γ-LiAlO₂ reveal that the {101} surface becomes the lowest energy surface upon H-adsorption, thus leading to formation of observed octahedral geometry. Contrary to stabilization of γ-LiAlO₂ surfaces upon H passivation, DFT revealed H adsorption on α-LiAlO₂ surfaces to be energetically unfavorable. This contrasting behavior of α-LiAlO₂ and γ-LiAlO₂ under H-rich environments could be a potential driving force for the observed α-LiAlO₂ to γ-LiAlO₂ phase transformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acarbonates 3acrystallites 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3afuels 3aphase transition 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aBatra, Rohit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1098-70351 aRamprasad, Rampi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4630-15651 aSingh, Prabhakar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5000-49020 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Dec. 03, v. 122, no. 50 p.28797-28804dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b097163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245013100214300001600345506007600361520157600437592002802013506003702041650002102078650001802099650002002117650001802137650002602155650001302181650001702194650001002211650001202221650001702233650001302250650001402263650001102277650001102288650001302299650001702312650001902329650003302348650002102381650001502402700002502417700002902442700002202471773010302493856008102596852000902677655001202686IND60523892320221207105519.0160630e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052389232DNAL7 a10.1007/s12639-014-0519-22doi7 aPMC49275012pmcid7 a274133142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsmail, Khadiga Ahmed10aComparison between the effect of Lawsonia inermis and flubendazole on Strongyloides species using scanning electron microscopy  ap. 415-422.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStrongyloides species is a helminth of worldwide distribution primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It is the only soil-transmitted helminth with the ability for autoinfection so; it may lead to severe systemic manifestations especially in immunosuppressed patients. Chemotherapy is currently considered the best therapeutic option for strongyloidiasis but some drugs are expensive and others have side effects as nausea, diarrhea and headache. Strongyloides larva is resistant to most chemical agents so, search for plant extracts may provide other effective but less expensive treatment. Lawsonia inermis Linn, popularly known as Henna, has been proven to have antihelminthic, antibacterial and antifungal properties. The current study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of Lawsonia inermis on Strongyloides spp. In vitro using scanning electron microscopy. Fifty Strongyloides species. larvae and free living females were incubated with different concentrations of Lawsonia (1, 10, 100 mg/ml), for different incubation periods (24, 48, 72 and 96 h) in comparison to the same concentrations of flubendazole at the same different time points. The results showed that Lawsonia inermis in a concentration of 10 mg/ml incubated with Strongyloides spp. female for 24 h affected the parasite cuticular surface in the form of transverse and longitudinal fissures and transverse depression in comparison to no cuticular change with flubendazole (100 mg/ml). This suggests that Lawsonia inermis may be a promising phytotherapeutic agent for strongyloidiasis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLawsonia inermis 3aStrongyloides 3aadverse effects 3aanthelmintics 3aantifungal properties 3adiarrhea 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3afemales 3aflubendazole 3aheadache 3ahelminths 3alarvae 3anausea 3apatients 3aphytotherapy 3aplant extracts 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astrongyloidiasis 3asubtropics1 aIbrahim, Ayman Nabil1 aAhmed, Mona Abdel-Fattah1 aHetta, Mona Hafez0 tJournal of parasitic diseases.g2016 June, v. 40, no. 2 p.415-422dSpringer Indiax0971-71967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12639-014-0519-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03739naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245011500175300001500290520200900305592002802314650002002342650001502362650001202377650002602389650001302415650001002428650002902438653001802467653002402485653002102509653002102530653002502551653001202576700003202588700002602620700002902646700002902675700003102704700002602735700002902761700002602790700002902816700005602845700002902901773020602930856008803136852000903224655001203233IND60679111220221117031243.0200117e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067911122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2019.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsco, Lucas Prado12aA convolutional neural network approach for counting and geolocating citrus-trees in UAV multispectral imagery  ap. 97-106.  aVisual inspection has been a common practice to determine the number of plants in orchards, which is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. Deep learning algorithms have demonstrated great potential for counting plants on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne sensor imagery. This paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to address the challenge of estimating the number of citrus trees in highly dense orchards from UAV multispectral images. The method estimates a dense map with the confidence that a plant occurs in each pixel. A flight was conducted over an orchard of Valencia-orange trees planted in linear fashion, using a multispectral camera with four bands in green, red, red-edge and near-infrared. The approach was assessed considering the individual bands and their combinations. A total of 37,353 trees were adopted in point feature to evaluate the method. A variation of σ (0.5; 1.0 and 1.5) was used to generate different ground truth confidence maps. Different stages (T) were also used to refine the confidence map predicted. To evaluate the robustness of our method, we compared it with two state-of-the-art object detection CNN methods (Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet). The results show better performance with the combination of green, red and near-infrared bands, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), R² and Normalized Root-Mean-Squared Error (NRMSE) of 2.28, 9.82, 0.96 and 0.05, respectively. This band combination, when adopting σ = 1 and a stage (T = 8), resulted in an R², MAE, Precision, Recall and F1 of 0.97, 2.05, 0.95, 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. Our method outperforms significantly object detection methods for counting and geolocation. It was concluded that our CNN approach developed to estimate the number and geolocation of citrus trees in high-density orchards is satisfactory and is an effective strategy to replace the traditional visual inspection method to determine the number of plants in orchards trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus sinensis 3aalgorithms 3acameras 3amultispectral imagery 3aorchards 3atrees 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 0aDeep learning 0aMultispectral image 0aUAV-borne sensor 0aObject detection 0aCitrus tree counting 0aOrchard1 aArruda, Mauro dos Santos de1 aMarcato Junior, José1 ada Silva, Neemias Buceli1 aRamos, Ana Paula Marques1 aMoryia, Érika Akemi Saito1 aImai, Nilton Nobuhiro1 aPereira, Danillo Roberto1 aCreste, José Eduardo1 aMatsubara, Edson Takashi1 aLi, Jonathan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7899-00491 aGonçalves, Wesley Nunes0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2020 Feb., v. 160 p.97-106dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

S.10aPhotoinduced Superhydrophilicity: A Kinetic Study of Time Dependent Photoinduced Contact Angle Changes on TiO2 Surfaces  ap. 17647-17655.  aTransparent TiO₂ thin films were prepared on quartz substrates via a reverse micelle, sol–gel, spin-coating technique. The time dependence of the TiO₂ film photoinduced superhydrophilicity (PISH) was measured by goniometric observation of the contact angle, θ, of sessile water drops at the film surfaces. In these measurements, the TiO₂ substrate was illuminated by 315 nm light and drops were sequentially applied at a range of illumination times. Using a model for the wetting of heterogeneous surfaces derived by Israelachvili and Gee, these measurements were used to calculate the time dependence of f₂, the fractional surface coverage of the TiO₂ surface by adventitious contaminating organics (Israelachvili, J. N.; Gee, M. L. Contact angles on chemically heterogeneous surfaces. Langmuir1989, 5, 288). Extending this model to include a Langmuir–Hinshelwood based kinetic analysis of f₂ as a function of time allowed for calculation of an expected value for θ immediately prior to illumination, that is, at illumination time t = 0. Such expected values of θ at t = 0 were calculated using two possible values of θ₁, the contact angle on a pristine unilluminated homogeneous TiO₂ surface: (i) θ₁ = 4° as suggested by, inter alia, Zubkov et al. (Zubkov, T.; Stahl, D.; Thompson, T. L.; Panayotov, D.; Diwald, O.; Yates, J. T. Ultraviolet Light-Induced Hydrophilicity Effect on TiO₂(110)(1 × 1). Dominant Role of the Photooxidation of Adsorbed Hydrocarbons Causing Wetting by Water Droplets. J. Phys. Chem. B2005, 109, 15454); and (ii) where θ₁ = 25°, as suggested by Fujishima et al., representative of a more hydrophobic homogeneous TiO₂ surface that reconstructs upon exposure to ultraband gap illumination into a hydrophilic surface where θ₁ → 0° (Fujishima, A.; Zhang, X.; Tryk, D. A. TiO₂ photocatalysis and related surface phenomena Surf. Sci. Rep.2008, 63, 515). Analysis of data from our experiments and from selected literature sources demonstrates better agreement between these calculated and experimental values of θ at t = 0 when θ₁ is taken to be 4°, implying that an uncontaminated TiO₂ surface is inherently hydrophilic. The results of this study are discussed in the context of the current debate over the origin of the photoinduced superhydrophilic effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3adroplets 3ahydrocarbons 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3akinetics 3alighting 3amicelles 3amodels 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotooxidation 3aquartz 3atitanium dioxide1 aBoxall, Colin1 aDenison, Kieth R.0 tLangmuir.g2012 Dec. 21, v. 28, no. 51 p.17647-17655dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla30266493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245013500200300001800335520143800353592002801791650001501819650001501834650001901849650001801868650001401886650001201900650001901912650001501931650001201946650001501958650001801973650000901991650001902000650001602019650002502035650002002060653002102080653001702101653001502118653001902133653003002152700001402182700001602196700001602212700001302228700002102241700001702262773013902279856007802418852000902496655001202505IND60631289920221119093554.0190220e20190123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063128992DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b218582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMi, Hao-Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0894-937110aHighly Durable Superhydrophobic Polymer Foams Fabricated by Extrusion and Supercritical CO₂ Foaming for Selective Oil Absorption  ap. 7479-7487.  aThe severe water contamination caused by oil leakage is calling for low-cost and high-performance absorbent materials for selective oil removal. In this study, a scalable green method was proposed to produce polypropylene (PP)/poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) composite foams via conventional processing techniques including twin-screw extrusion and supercritical carbon dioxide foaming. To produce the superhydrophobic foam, micro- and nanosized PTFE particles were melt blended with PP and subsequently foamed. Ascribed to the nanofibrillation of microsized PTFE during processing, the fabricated foam exhibited a special highly porous structure with PTFE nanofibrils and nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the pore surfaces within the PP matrix, which resulted in a remarkably high water contact angle of 156.8° and a low contact angle hysteresis of 1.9°. Unlike traditional surface-modified superhydrophobic absorbers, the foams prepared are entirely superhydrophobic, which means that they remain superhydrophobic when being fractured or cut. Moreover, they are highly durable and maintained the superhydrophobicity when subjected to ultrasonication and mechanical sanding. When used in selective oil absorption, the durable foams exhibited excellent absorption efficiency and high stability in repetitive and long-term use. These advantages make the PP/PTFE foam a promising superabsorbent material for water remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acontact angle 3aextrusion 3afoaming 3ahydrophobicity 3ahysteresis 3amelting 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3apolypropylenes 3aremediation 3aultrasonic treatment 3awater pollution 0asuperhydrophobic 0apolymer foam 0adurability 0aoil absorption 0apoly(tetrafluoroethylene)1 aJing, Xin1 aLiu, Yuejun1 aLi, Lengwan1 aLi, Heng1 aPeng, Xiang-Fang1 aZhou, Huamin0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Jan. 23, v. 11, no. 7 p.7479-7487dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b218583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245009000199300002000289520063400309592002800943596009800971596009801069596009101167596010801258596010801366596008901474596011201563650002001675650001101695650001201706650001401718700001901732700005901751700002001810700001901830700002101849700002201870700001901892700006101911700002101972700006101993773015002054856007702204852000902281655001202290IND60793797720221122003850.0220921e20220906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079379772DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c049952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpitz, Leonie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1028-354810aEntropy-Assisted, Long-Period Stacking of Honeycomb Layers in an AlB₂-Type Silicide  ap. 16866-16871.  aConfigurational entropy can impact crystallization processes, tipping the scales between structures of nearly equal internal energy.

Possible consequences of polytype formation on magnetism in Gd₂PdSi₃ are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP21K13877cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  aJP22H04463cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  aNAcBundesministerium f?r Bildung und Forschungdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002347  aJPMJCR1874cCore Research for Evolutional Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003382  aJPMJCR20T1cCore Research for Evolutional Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003382  aNAcIketani Science and Technology Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100008656  aJPMJPR20L7cPrecursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100009023 3acrystallization 3aenergy 3aentropy 3amagnetism1 aNomoto, Takuya1 aKitou, Shunsuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2349-140X1 aNakao, Hironori1 aKikkawa, Akiko1 aFrancoual, Sonia1 aTaguchi, Yasujiro1 aArita, Ryotaro1 aTokura, Yoshinori1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2732-49831 aArima, Taka-hisa1 aHirschberger, Max1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1780-16190 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Sept. 06, v. 144, no. 37 p.16866-16871dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c049953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011400165300001200279520143900291592002801730650001201758650002201770650001101792650002001803650001501823650002201838650001501860650001501875650001901890650002201909650001601931650001701947651002101964700002601985773013302011856008102144852000902225655001202234IND60523195020221117230122.0160807e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052319502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-016-5392-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYildiz, Selin10aMonitoring urban growth by using segmentation-classification of multispectral Landsat images in Izmit, Turkey  ap. 393.  aAssessing the spatial land use and land cover (LULC) information is essential for decision making and management of landscapes. In fact, LULC information has been changed dramatically in fast-growing cities. This results in wrong land use problems due to unplanned and uncontrolled urbanization. The planning and evaluating of limited natural resources under the pressure of a growing population can be possible when a precise land use management plan is established. Therefore, it is imperative to monitor continuous LULC changes for future planning. Remote sensing (RS) technique is used for determining changes in LULC in urban areas. In this study, we have focused on Izmit, which is one of a growing number of metropolitan cities where the impact of the spatial growing period on LULC has been assessed over the past 30 years by using RS data. We have utilized the segmentation process and supervised classification of Landsat satellite images for four different dates (1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015). The outcome of this research can be summarized by significant changes in the shares of urban areas and farmland LULC classes. The overall observed increase in urban area class is up to 2177 ha between 1985 and 2015 period and this dramatic change has resulted in the decline of 1211 ha of farmland. Another conclusion is that the new residential areas have been created to the north, south and east of Izmit during this period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aagricultural land 3acities 3adecision making 3aland cover 3aland use planning 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3aresidential areas 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aTurkey (country)1 aDöker, Mehmet Fatih,0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2016 July, v. 188, no. 7 p.393-393dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-016-5392-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245014000162300001800302520100900320592002801329650001201357650001401369650001001383650002501393650001701418650001801435650001501453650001401468650002401482650002101506653002001527653002401547653002601571653000901597653001401606700005501620700001801675700001601693700005601709700005301765773013901818856007801957852000902035655001202044IND60631290020221119091659.0190220e20190129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063129002DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b218862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xiaofei10aRemote Induction of Cell Autophagy by 2D MoS₂ Nanosheets via Perturbing Cell Surface Receptors and mTOR Pathway from Outside of Cells  ap. 6829-6839.  aThe ability of nanoparticles to induce adverse consequences in human cells relies on their physical shapes. In this aspect, how two-dimensional nanoparticles differ from three-dimensional nanoparticles is not well-known. To elucidate this difference, combined experimental and theoretical approaches are employed to compare MoS₂ nanosheets with 5-layer and 40-layer thicknesses for their cellular effects and the associated molecular events. At a concentration as defined by the nanosheet surface areas (10 cm²/mL), 40-layer nanosheets are internalized by cells, whereas 5-layer nanosheets mostly bind to the cell surface without internalization. Although they alter different autophagy-related genes, a common mechanism is that they both perturb cell surface protein amyloid precursor proteins and activate the mTOR signaling pathway. Our findings prove that the perturbation of cellular function without nanoparticle internalization has significant nanomedicinal and nanotoxicological significances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3aautophagy 3agenes 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananomedicine 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3areceptors 3asignal transduction 3asurface proteins 0aMoS2 nanosheets 0asignal transduction 0acell surface receptor 0amTOR 0aautophagy1 aJia, Jianbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1703-67341 aLuo, Zhenren,1 aSu, Gaoxing1 aYue, Tongtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8329-167X1 aYan, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7970-67640 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Jan. 29, v. 11, no. 7 p.6829-6839dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b218863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03806naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100002200174245011600196300001600312520228200328592002802610650002402638650001502662650001202677650001702689650002602706650001902732650000702751650001702758650001502775650001402790650002002804650002302824650001602847650001302863650001602876650003102892650001302923650005102936650003402987650002403021650001603045700003403061773011903095856008903214852000903303655001203312IND50060238520221118202816.0141111e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006023852DNAL7 a231770572pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLianou, Alexandra10aStrain variability of the biofilm-forming ability of Salmonella enterica under various environmental conditions  ap. 171-178.  aThe biofilm-forming ability of 60 Salmonella enterica strains was assessed at different pH values (3.8–7.0), NaCl concentrations (0.5–8.0%) and temperatures (4–37°C). A total of 4320 biofilm formation tests (60 strains×12 different environmental conditions×6 replicates) were carried out. Biofilm formation was evaluated in tryptone soy broth after 48h of incubation in polystyrene microtiter plates using crystal violet staining, and its quantification was based on the difference between the optical density measurements of the test and negative control (uninoculated) samples (ΔOD₅₈₀ₙₘ). The tested strains formed biofilms under a wide range of environmental conditions, while extensive strain variability was observed with the mean ΔOD₅₈₀ₙₘ values ranging from 0 to 2.388 depending on the strain and the condition evaluated. The strain variability of biofilm formation was affected by all three of the environmental parameters tested, and appeared to increase as the environmental conditions became less favorable for the organism. In addition, the increase in the strain variability caused by pH was found to be much greater than that caused by NaCl or temperature. For example, the coefficient of variation (CV=standard deviation/mean∗100) of ΔOD₅₈₀ₙₘ among the tested strains at pH 7.0–0.5% NaCl-37°C was 104%, while at pH 3.8–0.5% NaCl-37°C, pH 7.0–8.0% NaCl-37°C and pH 7.0–0.5% NaCl-8°C was 351.5%, 204.1% and 175.6%, respectively. The optimum conditions for biofilm formation, providing the maximum ΔOD₅₈₀ₙₘ, varied significantly among the tested strains. Among the evaluated conditions, most of the S. enterica strains were clustered as forming their highest amount of biofilm at pH 5.5 (35 strains; 58.3%), at 0.5% NaCl (29 strains; 48.3%) and at 25°C (32 strains; 53.3%). No relationships were observed between the biofilm-forming ability of the strains and their serotype or their growth kinetic behavior as this was evaluated in a previous study. The findings of this study provide useful information in advancing the current understanding of strain variability, as well as in strain selection for the evaluation of the efficacy of disinfection/sanitation procedures against biofilm formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella enterica 3aabsorbance 3abiofilm 3adisinfection 3aenvironmental factors 3agentian violet 3apH 3apolystyrenes 3asanitation 3aserotypes 3asodium chloride 3astrain differences 3atemperature 2aBiofilms 2aEnvironment 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aSalmonella entericaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTemperature1 aKoutsoumanis, Konstantinos P.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 160, no. 2 p.171-178dElsevier B.V.x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008900166300001800255520168600273592002801959650001901987650001302006650002102019650001602040650002202056650000902078650002302087650000902110650001602119650001402135650000702149650001402156650001902170650002302189650001602212700001302228700001902241700001502260773011702275856008502392852000902477655001202486IND60087265220221120142331.0141102e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008726522DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60654-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jinlan10aEnhanced bioremediation of oil contaminated soil by graded modified Fenton oxidation  ap. 1873-1879.  aGraded modified Fenton's (MF) oxidation is a strategy in which H₂O₂ is added intermittently to prevent a sharp temperature increase and undesired soil sterilization at soil circumneutral pH versus adding the same amount of H₂O₂ continuously. The primary objective of the present study was to investigate whether a mild MF pre-oxidation such as a stepwise addition of H₂O₂ can prevent sterilization and achieve a maximum degradation of tank oil in soil. Optimization experiments of graded MF oxidation were conducted using citric acid, oxalic acid and SOLV-X as iron chelators under different frequencies of H₂O₂ addition. The results indicated that the activity order of iron chelates decreased as: citric acid (51%) > SOLV-X (44%) > oxalic acid (9%), and citric acid was found to be an optimized iron chelating agent of graded MF oxidation. Three-time addition of H₂O₂ was found to be favorable and economical due to decreasing total petroleum hydrocarbon removal from three time addition (51%) to five time addition (59%). Biological experiments were conducted after graded MF oxidation of tank oil completed under optimum conditions mentioned above. After graded oxidation, substantially higher increase (31%) in microbial activity was observed with excessive H₂O₂ (1470 mmol/L, the mol ratio of H₂O₂:Fe²⁺ was 210:1) than that of non-oxidized soil. Removal efficiency of tank oil was up to 93% after four weeks. Especially, the oil fraction (C₁₀-C₄₀) became more biodagradable after graded MF oxidation than its absence. Therefore, graded MF oxidation is a mild pretreatment to achieve an effective bioremediation of oil contaminated soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioremediation 3achelates 3achelating agents 3acitric acid 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3amicrobial activity 3aoils 3aoxalic acid 3aoxidation 3apH 3apetroleum 3apolluted soils 3asoil sterilization 3atemperature1 aXin, Lei1 aHuang, Tinglin1 aChang, Kim0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2011 Nov., v. 23, no. 11 p.1873-1879dElsevier B.V.x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(10)60654-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01798naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012400160300002000284520064900304592002800953650002500981650001301006650001001019650001901029650001901048650001101067650001801078650001601096650001501112700001901127700001801146700002001164700002101184700002201205773010101227856007501328852000901403655001201412IND60576703020221119035654.0170806e20121221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057670302DNAL7 a10.1021/la303316w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyagawa, Hayato10aFabrication of Transparent Antifouling Thin Films with Fractal Structure by Atmospheric Pressure Cold Plasma Deposition  ap. 17761-17765.  aAntifouling surface with both superhydrophobicity and oil-repellency has been fabricated on glass substrate by forming fractal microstructure(s).

Understanding and evaluating the cooling process is crucial. In this context, numerical modelling techniques such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can provide complementary insights to experimental measurements. Fruit come in a variety of shapes that are also cultivar-dependent. In this work, CFD modelling was combined with X-ray computed tomography (CT) to explore the differences in cooling characteristics of different pear fruit cultivars in cardboard boxes, as determined by variable fruit shape. First, CT images of boxes randomly filled with pear fruit were obtained. Next, horizontal forced-air cooling experiments with three different pear cultivars (cv. ‘Doyenné’, cv. ‘Conference’ and cv. ‘Durondeau’) were conducted in a pre-cooling setup. After CT image reconstruction of the box and fruit CAD geometry, CFD simulations with the actual pear filling were developed and validated with experimentally-obtained cooling profiles. The experimental data agreed very well with simulation results of three cultivars. Shape differences led to internal porosity variation of the fruit filled box that determined local airflow patterns and cooling behaviour. The cooling time of individual pears in a box differed up to 4 h and large differences in cooling time between the boxes with different pear cultivars were observed. Individual fruit shapes clearly influence cooling behaviour. This work demonstrates that cooling results depend on the filling pattern, so that several fillings need to be accounted for to have a realistic statistical average, which can be achieved by a previously developed shape model combined with discrete element modelling and CFD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aair flow 3acardboard 3acultivars 3afruit morphology 3afruits 3ageometry 3apears 3aporosity 3araw fruit 3atechnology 3atemperature 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aPear 0aForced-air cooling 0aBiological variability 0aX-ray computed tomography1 aVan De Looverbosch, T.1 aWang, Z.1 aJanssen, S.1 aVerboven, P.1 aDefraeye, T.1 aNicolaï, B.M.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2020 Apr., v. 162 p.111098-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.1110983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014200168300001800310520097700328536016801305592002801473650001101501650001601512650002301528650001101551650003101562650001401593650001501607650001701622650001801639650002201657650001501679650001101694650001201705650001701717650001301734653002001747653001401767653001801781700002201799700002001821700002001841700002401861700002501885700002901910700003001939700001901969773012501988856008602113852000902199655001202208IND60758536520221122212204.0220112e20211202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075853652DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2020.17580962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCirmi, Santa10aAnti-inflammatory effect of a flavonoid-rich extract of orange juice in adult zebrafish subjected to Vibrio anguillarum-induced enteritis  ap. 5350-5353.  aInflammation-related pathologies remain a serious health problem with high costs for the community. Citrus flavonoids are known to possess important pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory activity. In this study we evaluated the effects of a flavonoid-rich extract of orange juice (OJe) in an experimental model of enteritis induced by Vibrio anguillarum in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). Administration of V. anguillarum through live feed (Artemia nauplii) for three consecutive days caused evident signs of enteritis in zebrafish. Three days of treatment with OJe before the pathogenic insult resulted in a remarkable reduction of tissue inflammatory events as well as a molecular down-regulation of the inflammatory genes such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα. Our data suggest that OJe counteracts the inflammation of zebrafish intestinal mucosa, indicating that the pool of flavonoids present in orange juice could be useful for the prevention of enteritis.  aResearch was supported by a grant from Sicily Region (PO FESR Sicilia 2007-2013, CUP G73F11000050004, project “MEPRA”, n°133 of Linea d’Intervento 4.1.1.1).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aDanio rerio 3aVibrio anguillarum 3aadults 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aenteritis 3aflavonoids 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestinal mucosa 3alive feeds 3amodels 3anauplii 3aorange juice 3aresearch 0aCitrus sinensis 0azebrafish 0aenterocolitis1 aRandazzo, Basilio1 aRusso, Caterina1 aMusumeci, Laura1 aMaugeri, Alessandro1 aMontalbano, Giuseppe1 aGuerrera, Maria Cristina1 aLombardo, Giovanni Enrico1 aLevanti, Maria0 tNatural product research.g2021 Dec. 2, v. 35, no. 23 p.5350-5353dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2020.17580963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015300163300001600316520155000332592002801882650002301910650002201933650003701955650001501992650001702007650001702024650001102041650002202052650001402074650001502088650001302103650001502116650001102131650001802142650001302160650001702173650002002190650003302210650001102243650002102254650003702275653002202312653003202334653001502366653001502381653001802396700001702414700001602431700001602447700001602463700001602479773012502495856008302620852000902703655001202712IND60625076320221120084939.0210121e20190307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062507632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ying10aConstruction of core-shell mesoporous carbon nanofiber@nickel cobaltite nanostructures as highly efficient catalysts towards 4-nitrophenol reduction  ap. 377-386.  aWe herein report small sized nickel cobaltite (NiCo₂O₄) nanosheets (103–144 nm × 71–97 nm) firmly coated on mesoporous carbon nanofibers (MCNFs), as active and stable catalysts for degradation of 4-nitrophenol in sewage with NaBH₄ as the reductant. MCNFs with surface O-functionalities were first constructed by morphology-conserved transformation of zinc-trimesic acid fibers, which provide scaffolds to anchor trisodium citrate-induced Ni-Co hydroxide nanosheets. Upon calcination, the resultant core-shell MCNF@NiCo₂O₄ nanostructures were fabricated and characterized by SEM, TEM, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and N₂ adsorption/desorption techniques. The anchored NiCo₂O₄ nanosheets were dense (75 wt%) but well-dispersed on the surface of MCNF (pore size 4.0 nm), and proved to be highly active and stable towards the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. It showed a large activity factor of 2.53 s⁻¹ g⁻¹, exceeding most transition metal oxide catalysts, and MCNF@NiCo₂O₄ could be cycled at least 20 times without obvious loss of activity. Temperature-programmed desorption and reduction by hydrogen (H₂-TPD and H₂-TPR) studies showed that, the metal oxide dispersion and thereby the amount of H₂ adsorbed were enhanced, and the interfacial interaction was also strengthened. These should be responsible for the excellent activity and stability of MCNF@NiCo₂O₄ towards 4-nitrophenol reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aaminophenols 3aborohydrides 3acarbon 3acarbon nanofibers 3acatalysts 3adesorption 3ahydrogen 3ananosheets 3anickel 3ap-nitrophenol 3aporosity 3aporous media 3areducing agents 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asewage 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aNiCo2O4 nanosheet 0aMesoporous carbon nanofiber 0aSmall size 0aCore-shell 0a4-Nitrophenol1 aZeng, Dehong1 aShao, Shuai1 aHao, Shijie1 aZhu, Gangli1 aLiu, Baijun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Mar. 07, v. 538 p.377-386dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245008300169300002000252520118300272592002801455650001301483650001301496650001801509650001901527650001901546650001201565650001601577700001801593700001701611773010101628856007501729852000901804655001201813IND60576703120221119035715.0170806e20121221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057670312DNAL7 a10.1021/la303375v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, William Yeong Liang10aEffect of a Rupturing Encapsulated Bubble in Inducing the Detachment of a Drop  ap. 17656-17665.  aDroplet-based microfluidics is inherently based on the ability to control the motion of liquid drops. In most situations, drops are required to be controlled individually. Here, we examine how the rupture of an encapsulated bubble causes the detachment of a drop previously pinned on an incline. When the drop is located on a horizontal surface with a low liquid–solid adhesion energy (such as water on a superhydrophobic surface), the entire drop is propelled vertically off the surface without the input of an external energy source. From an energy balance, we determined that the majority of the stored surface energy is consumed by the formation of a large jet. When a surfactant is introduced into the system, the adhesion energy is then too large to overcome, resulting in a pinned oscillating drop. We also show that the process can be used to selectively cause drops to slide (at usually stable inclines) on a hydrophobic surface. The required sliding angle was decreased by almost 20° for a 48 μL water drop and a 10 μL bubble. This process enables the selective pinning and depinning of drops, a method that may prove useful for future droplet control techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3adroplets 3aencapsulation 3aenergy balance 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3asurfactants1 aNeild, Adrian1 aNg, Tuck Wah0 tLangmuir.g2012 Dec. 21, v. 28, no. 51 p.17656-17665dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla303375v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010400160300001800264500002000282520206200302592002802364650001902392650003202411650001102443650001002454650002002464650001202484650001902496650002602515650001302541650001902554650001902573650002502592650001502617650001102632650001402643651001802657700001902675700002402694700002202718700001902740700002002759700001702779700001802796700001702814773010702831856007302938852000903011655001203020IND60571821420221121233542.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057182142DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.129212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRemy, Cécile C.10aWildfire size alters long‐term vegetation trajectories in boreal forests of eastern North America  ap. 1268-1279.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Wildfire activity is projected to increase under global warming in many parts of the world. Knowledge of the role of these disturbances in shaping the composition of boreal forests is needed to better anticipate their future impacts. Here, we investigate the incidence of wildfire activity (burned biomass, frequency and size) on multi‐millennia vegetation trajectories in two coniferous boreal forest regions that display different types of vegetation composition and relief. We hypothesize that this difference in vegetation results from dissimilar wildfire activity during the Holocene. LOCATION: Conifer‐dominated boreal forests in Quebec‐Labrador, eastern North America. METHODS: Fire and vegetation histories during the last 8000 years were reconstructed and compared through analyses of charcoal and pollen records extracted from nine lacustrine deposits located in two spruce‐moss forests: the western region, co‐dominated by Pinus banksiana, and the eastern region, co‐dominated by Abies balsamea. RESULTS: Between 7000 and 2000 cal. yr bp, the western region experienced fewer fires than the eastern region, but they were larger in size. The main species adapted to fire, P. banksiana and Alnus viridis ssp. crispa, progressively co‐dominated with Picea sp.. Conversely, in the eastern region, P. banksiana and A. viridis ssp. crispa were very rare, and Picea sp. co‐dominated with non‐fire‐adapted A. balsamea and Betula sp.. Then, around 2000 cal. yr bp, fires decreased in frequency but were larger in size in the eastern region than in the western one, thus allowing densification of P. banksiana and A. viridis ssp. crispa in these landscapes. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: In the coniferous boreal forests of eastern North America, fire size was relatively more important in determining the long‐term vegetation trajectories in comparison with fire frequency. Changes in the rate of occurrence of large‐fire episodes will have significant impacts on vegetation dynamics over the next decades under continuing warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies balsamea 3aAlnus viridis subsp. crispa 3aBetula 3aPicea 3aPinus banksiana 3abiomass 3aboreal forests 3abotanical composition 3acharcoal 3afire frequency 3aglobal warming 3alacustrine sediments 3alandscapes 3apollen 3awildfires 3aNorth America1 aLavoie, Martin1 aGirardin, Martin P.1 aHély, Christelle1 aBergeron, Yves1 aGrondin, Pierre1 aOris, France1 aAsselin, Hugo1 aAli, Adam A.0 tJournal of biogeography.g2017 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.1268-1279dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.129213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245006700156300001600223520102400239592002801263650001901291650002401310650002701334650001001361650001601371650002301387650001601410650001501426650002001441650001701461650001301478700001401491700002001505700001601525700002201541700001801563773014201581856007401723852000901797655001201806IND60662029420221117025212.0190904e20120202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066202942DNAL7 a10.1039/c1em10687b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Quan10aEnantioselective aquatic toxicity of current chiral pesticides  ap. 465-472.  aChiral pesticides are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment, and their enantioselectivities in aquatic toxicity are known to be complicated. The difference in enantioselective effects between enantiomers may sometimes differ by approximately 100-fold or more, which makes it important to incorporate enantioselective effects into the risk assessment of chiral pesticides. In this paper, we reviewed relevant work on the aquatic toxicity of chiral pesticides with an emphasis on the enantioselective aquatic toxicity under both chronic and acute exposure conditions. We provided a personal account of the importance of studies on molecular mechanisms of developmental toxicity and specific endpoints such as vitellogenin, yolk sac edema and pericardial edema in future research. Given the widespread use of chiral pesticides, we suggest that a more comprehensive understanding of the significance of enantioselective aquatic toxicity will be very helpful in improving risk assessment and regulation of chiral pesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute exposure 3aaquatic environment 3adevelopmental toxicity 3aedema 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3apericardium 3apesticides 3arisk assessment 3avitellogenin 3ayolk sac1 aWang, Cui1 aZhang, Xiaofeng1 aJin, Daqing1 aHuang, Changjiang1 aZhao, Meirong0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2012 Feb. 2, v. 14, no. 2 p.465-472dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1em10687b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04039naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245017100197300002000368520166200388592002802050596007002078596007002148596006102218596008502279596008302364596006602447596010102513596006602614650001402680650002002694650002402714650002102738650001402759650001202773650001202785650001702797650001602814700006802830700002002898700002202918700002202940700005902962700002003021700002103041700002003062700001903082700001803101700006003119700005903179773014903238856007703387852000903464655001203473IND60793798320221121234341.0220921e20220825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079379832DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c054992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xingui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2659-800710aDiscovery of XL01126: A Potent, Fast, Cooperative, Selective, Orally Bioavailable, and Blood–Brain Barrier Penetrant PROTAC Degrader of Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2  ap. 16930-16952.  aLeucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is one of the most promising targets for Parkinson’s disease. LRRK2-targeting strategies have primarily focused on type 1 kinase inhibitors, which, however, have limitations as the inhibited protein can interfere with natural mechanisms, which could lead to undesirable side effects. Herein, we report the development of LRRK2 proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), culminating in the discovery of degrader XL01126, as an alternative LRRK2-targeting strategy. Initial designs and screens of PROTACs based on ligands for E3 ligases von Hippel–Lindau (VHL), Cereblon (CRBN), and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) identified the best degraders containing thioether-conjugated VHL ligand VH101. A second round of medicinal chemistry exploration led to qualifying XL01126 as a fast and potent degrader of LRRK2 in multiple cell lines, with DC₅₀ values within 15–72 nM, Dₘₐₓ values ranging from 82 to 90%, and degradation half-lives spanning from 0.6 to 2.4 h. XL01126 exhibits high cell permeability and forms a positively cooperative ternary complex with VHL and LRRK2 (α = 5.7), which compensates for a substantial loss of binary binding affinities to VHL and LRRK2, underscoring its strong degradation performance in cells. Remarkably, XL01126 is orally bioavailable (F = 15%) and can penetrate the blood–brain barrier after either oral or parenteral dosing in mice. Taken together, these experiments qualify XL01126 as a suitable degrader probe to study the noncatalytic and scaffolding functions of LRRK2 in vitro and in vivo and offer an attractive starting point for future drug development.  aPublisher supplied data  a094090/Z/10/ZcWellcome Trustdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100004440  a100476/Z/12/ZcWellcome Trustdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100004440  a875510cH2020 Healthdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010677  a311460cFP7 Ideas: European Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100011199  aMC_UU_00018/1cMedical Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000265  aH-1701cParkinson's UKdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000304  aPD/BD/114281/2016cFunda??o para a Ci?ncia e a Tecnologiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001871  aNAcOno Pharmaceuticaldhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100013170 3aapoptosis 3abioavailability 3ablood-brain barrier 3adrug development 3ahalf life 3aligands 3aligases 3apermeability 3aproteolysis1 aKalogeropulou, Alexia F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5185-76941 aDomingos, Sofia1 aMakukhin, Nikolai1 aNirujogi, Raja S.1 aSingh, Francois1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1696-98151 aShpiro, Natalia1 aSaalfrank, Anton1 aSammler, Esther1 aGanley, Ian G.1 aMoreira, Ruy,1 aAlessi, Dario R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2140-91851 aCiulli, Alessio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8654-16700 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Aug. 25, v. 144, no. 37 p.16930-16952dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c054993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006500146245012800211300002000339520166300359592002802022650002202050650002802072650002102100650002302121650001902144650001802163650002502181773013802206856008002344852000902424655001202433IND60626293120221121044135.0181220e20181127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062629312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b100432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlonos, Panagiotis A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7222-612X10aDynamics of Molecules Physically Adsorbed onto Metal Oxide Nanoparticles: Similarities between Water and a Flexible Polymer  ap. 28825-28829.  aWater at interfaces is considered present and important within almost all physical processes. Interfacial water shows nonbulk properties, however, its structure/organization and dynamics are on a still open debate. In parallel to that, the interfacial polymer in nanocomposites exhibits modified structure and dynamics, the latter characteristic being widely considered responsible for the improved nanocomposite properties. One of the most suitable tools for studying dynamics of a variety of small molecules and macromolecules is broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS), mainly due to its high resolving power. BDS is employed here in combination with isothermal hydration and has proved quite illuminating in recording for the first time striking similarities in the dynamics behavior between water molecules and flexible polydimethylsiloxane macromolecules, when the latter molecules are individually adsorbed physically on the attractive surfaces of metal oxide nanoparticle. The qualitative similarities between water and polymer interfacial dynamics, for example, in their exhibiting time-scale and the elevation of the respective activation energy upon increasing of interfacial molecules fraction, lay most probably at the origins of the same main surface-adsorbed molecule interaction, i.e.. the hydrogen bonding. Whereas, the quantitative differences in molecular dynamics, e.g., slower, more energetically demanding, and cooperative interfacial dynamics for the polymer than for water, arise from the different scale of the two molecular motions (<1 nm for water and ≥1 nm for the polymer) and/or from alternations in interfacial layer density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3adielectric spectroscopy 3ahydrogen bonding 3amolecular dynamics 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apolydimethylsiloxane0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Nov. 27, v. 122, no. 50 p.28825-28829dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b100433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009600173300001800269520173300287592002802020650001202048650002602060650001902086650001102105650001702116650001302133650001402146650001402160650001102174650001202185650002302197650001002220651001502230700001902245700002402264700002502288700002502313700002802338700002302366700002202389700002102411773009302432856008102525852000902606655001202615IND60523195720221117225924.0160607e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052319572DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-015-0056-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosencranz, Jordan A.10aBalanced Sediment Fluxes in Southern California’s Mediterranean-Climate Zone Salt Marshes  ap. 1035-1049.  aSalt marsh elevation and geomorphic stability depends on mineral sedimentation. Many Mediterranean-climate salt marshes along southern California, USA coast import sediment during El Niño storm events, but sediment fluxes and mechanisms during dry weather are potentially important for marsh stability. We calculated tidal creek sediment fluxes within a highly modified, sediment-starved, 1.5-km² salt marsh (Seal Beach) and a less modified 1-km² marsh (Mugu) with fluvial sediment supply. We measured salt marsh plain suspended sediment concentration and vertical accretion using single stage samplers and marker horizons. At Seal Beach, a 2014 storm yielded 39 and 28 g/s mean sediment fluxes and imported 12,000 and 8800 kg in a western and eastern channel. Western channel storm imports offset 8700 kg exported during 2 months of dry weather, while eastern channel storm imports augmented 9200 kg imported during dry weather. During the storm at Mugu, suspended sediment concentrations on the marsh plain increased by a factor of four; accretion was 1–2 mm near creek levees. An exceptionally high tide sequence yielded 4.4 g/s mean sediment flux, importing 1700 kg: 20 % of Mugu’s dry weather fluxes. Overall, low sediment fluxes were observed, suggesting that these salt marshes are geomorphically stable during dry weather conditions. Results suggest storms and high lunar tides may play large roles, importing sediment and maintaining dry weather sediment flux balances for southern California salt marshes. However, under future climate change and sea level rise scenarios, results suggest that balanced sediment fluxes lead to marsh elevational instability based on estimated mineral sediment deficits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aMediterranean climate 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3asalt marshes 3asamplers 3asea level 3asediments 3astorms 3astreams 3asuspended sediment 3atides 3aCalifornia1 aGanju, Neil K.1 aAmbrose, Richard F.1 aBrosnahan, Sandra M.1 aDickhudt, Patrick J.1 aGuntenspergen, Glenn R.1 aMacDonald, Glen M.1 aTakekawa, John Y.1 aThorne, Karen M.0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2016 July, v. 39, no. 4 p.1035-1049dSpringer USx1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-015-0056-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009400161300001800255500002000273520186900293592002802162650003402190650002402224650002502248650001302273650002102286650001302307650001202320650001302332650001002345650001202355650001002367650001102377650001602388650001502404650001502419651002602434651001202460700002102472700002402493700001802517700002202535700001802557773010702575856007302682961001202755852000902767655001202776IND60571821520221120181529.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057182152DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.129322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarter, Vachel A.10aClimate variability and fire effects on quaking aspen in the central Rocky Mountains, USA  ap. 1280-1293.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Our understanding of how climate and fire have impacted quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) communities prior to the 20th century is fairly limited. This study analysed the period between 4500 and 2000 cal. yr bp to assess the pre‐historic role of climate and fire on an aspen community during an aspen‐dominated period. LOCATION: Long Lake, south‐eastern Wyoming, central Rocky Mountains, USA. METHODS: Sedimentary pollen and charcoal were analysed to reconstruct the vegetation and fire history for a subalpine catchment currently dominated by lodgepole pine. Modern pollen‐climate relationships were applied to the fossil pollen spectra to interpret past climate variability. Nonparametric ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests were used to determine whether the reconstructed climate and fire parameters were different throughout the study period. RESULTS: The modern pollen‐climate data suggest a c. 150‐year long drought centred on 4200 cal. yr bp, which caused the aspen ecotone to shift upslope. Between 3950 and 3450 cal. yr bp, an anomalous period of abundant quaking aspen pollen (Populus) occurred at the study site. Optimal climatic conditions coupled with frequent fires facilitated local quaking aspen dominance for roughly 500 years. After 3450 cal. yr bp, Populus pollen declined coincident with a return to less frequent fires and conifer dominance. Reconstructed climate variables from 550 cal. yr bp to present suggest conditions were not favourable for quaking aspen establishment at Long Lake. The Tukey HSD test confirms that the period of abundant Populus pollen was significantly different than any other period during this study. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Quaking aspen shifted upslope in response to warmer temperatures, and persisted for roughly 500 years as a result of optimal climatic conditions and frequent fire events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aanalysis of variance 3acharcoal 3aclimatic factors 3aconifers 3adrought 3aecotones 3afires 3afossils 3alakes 3apollen 3atemperature 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aRocky Mountain region 3aWyoming1 aBrunelle, Andrea1 aMinckley, Thomas A.1 aShaw, John D.1 aDeRose, R.

The obtained value and the phonon dispersion curves of the Pb nanofilm measured with HAS are in excellent agreement with the first-principles calculations when the influence of the substrate and the interface on the interaction of electrons and phonons is taken into account. Consideration of this effect is obviously very important for such small thicknesses as a single Pb wetting layer.

However, IPWEs for MSMs can be inefficient and unstable if weights are estimated by maximum likelihood. To improve the performance of IPWEs, covariate balancing weight (CBW) methods have been proposed and recently extended to MSMs. However, existing CBW methods for MSMs are inflexible for practical use because they often do not handle dependent censoring, nonbinary treatments, and longitudinal outcomes (instead of eventual outcomes at a study end). In this paper, we propose a joint calibration approach to CBW estimation for MSMs that can accommodate (1) both time‐varying confounding and dependent censoring, (2) binary and nonbinary treatments, (3) eventual outcomes and longitudinal outcomes. We develop novel calibration restrictions by jointly eliminating covariate associations with both treatment assignment and censoring processes after weighting the observed data sample (i.e., to optimize covariate balance in finite samples). Two different methods are proposed to implement the calibration. Simulations show that IPWEs with calibrated weights perform better than IPWEs with weights from maximum likelihood and the “Covariate Balancing Propensity Score” method. We apply our method to a natural history study of HIV for estimating the effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy on CD4 cell counts over time.  aPublisher supplied data  aMR/M025152/1cMedical Research Council  aMC_UU_00002/8cMedical Research Council 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aantiretroviral agents 3anatural history 3aprobability 3astatistical analysis 3atherapeutics1 aSu, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0919-34620 tBiometrics.g2022 Mar., v. 78, no. 1 p.115-127dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16956x0006-341X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.134113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001900147245013300166300001600299520121000315592002801525650001201553650002001565650000901585650001601594650001101610650001101621650002101632650002301653650001201676650001901688650002001707650001101727650001501738700002101753700001801774773008001792856008301872852000901955655001201964IND4470753620221119155732.0150812e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447075362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2012.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMustonen, Sari10aFamiliarity with and affective responses to foods in 8–11-year-old children. The role of food neophobia and parental education  ap. 777-780.  aThe present study investigated whether the familiarity with and affective responses to foods are predicted by the individual trait food neophobia and by parental education in school children. The cross-sectional data collection involved children (N=208, 8- and 11-year-old) from Helsinki, and their parents. A questionnaire assessing children’s food neophobia with Food Neophobia Scale (FNS), and familiarity with and affective responses to 36 foods was completed by parents. Children with low FNS were familiar with a larger number of foods than those with high FNS. High FNS was associated with low pleasantness assessment of most food groups, including cheese, fruit/vegetables, fish, starch/cereals, and ethnic/exotic. Children of well educated parents had tasted a larger number of foods, thus displaying lower behavioral neophobia, and had lower FNS scores than children of less educated parents. Both low FNS scores and high parental education predicted the number of tasted foods. Parental education was not associated with pleasantness ratings (exception: cheese). To conclude, high food neophobia lowers the pleasantness ratings of foods, and parental education moderates behavioral neophobia.  aPublisher supplied data 3acheeses 3adata collection 3afish 3afood groups 3afruits 3agrains 3ahigher education 3aintroduced species 3aparents 3aquestionnaires 3aschool children 3astarch 3avegetables1 aOerlemans, Patty1 aTuorila, Hely0 tAppetite.g2012 June, v. 58, no. 3 p.777-780dElsevier Ltdx0195-66637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2012.01.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245009500210300001600305506007600321520160000397592002801997506003702025650001602062650000902078650002102087650001402108650001402122650000902136650001702145650001402162650001202176650001202188650002402200650001002224650000902234650001402243650001602257650001102273650001002284650002002294650001302314651000902327700001702336773010302353856008102456852000902537655001202546IND60523893520221207113802.0160630e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052389352DNAL7 a10.1007/s12639-014-0495-62doi7 aPMC49274772pmcid7 a274132942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirzaei, Mohammad14aThe role of sheep in the epidemiology of Sarcocystis spp. in Tabriz area northwest of Iran  ap. 285-288.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe parasites of genus Sarcocystis are among the most commonly found parasites in domestic ruminants and some species of Sarcocystis can generate important economic loss when causing clinical and subclinical disease. In the present study, three techniques—direct inspection, impression smears and digestion method—were used for the diagnosis of Sarcocystis infection in 130 slaughtered sheep in Tabriz abattoir from April 2013 to October 2013. A total of 620 slaughtered sheep were selected randomly and their oesophagus and diaphragm were inspected using naked eye examination. In the second stage, 130 carcasses out of the 620 which had no apparent infection were selected randomly and their meat investigated using two techniques: impression smear with staining and pepsin digestion. The percentage of macroscopic cysts found in the oesophagus and diaphragm muscle was 5.64 and 2.74 %, respectively, and microscopically, infection was found in 100 % of the organs. There was no significant difference between different ages or between males and females. Although all of the sheep were found to be infected with Sarcocystis, majority of the cysts were demonstrated microscopically. This suggests that meat should be cooked sufficiently, since a macroscopic inspection may not provide true results. Also, it has of grea t importance the farmers to be trained not to feed their dogs and cats with uncooked meat, and the abattoir remnants to be burned, in order to be effectively broken of infection cycle between the intermediate and the definitive hosts in Tabriz city, northwest of Iran.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSarcocystis 3acats 3adefinitive hosts 3adiaphragm 3adigestion 3adogs 3aepidemiology 3aesophagus 3afarmers 3afemales 3afinancial economics 3amales 3ameat 3aparasites 3aparasitoses 3apepsin 3asheep 3aslaughterhouses 3astaining 3aIran1 aRezaei, Hadi0 tJournal of parasitic diseases.g2016 June, v. 40, no. 2 p.285-288dSpringer Indiax0971-71967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12639-014-0495-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013100167300001600298520115100314536028701465592002801752596001601780650001501796650002001811650001601831650001901847650001901866650001701885650002901902700001901931700001801950700001201968700001701980700001501997700001302012773011602025856008602141852000902227655001202236IND60763623420221119044803.0220120e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076362342DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2021.20000612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Huina10aModified statistically homogeneous pixel selection for use with a non-local adaptive multilook approach for small SAR datasets  ap. 151-161.  aMultitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) technique is an important approach for surface deformation monitoring. Nonlocal adaptive multilooking approach has potential benefits for the filtering and coherence estimation in the data preprocessing steps of MT-InSAR technique. The kernel of nonlocal adaptive multilooking approach lies in the selection of statistically homogeneous pixels (SHPs). Various amplitude-based strategies, such as DespecKS and its variations, have been proposed for selecting SHPs. However, the detection rates of these methods are usually unsatisfactory in the case of small data sets. To overcome this limitation, SHPs are selected based on the adaptive joint data vector, which encompasses both time dimensional samples and spatial information. In this letter, the outliers of the time dimensional samples are removed first based on a revised boxplot method. Additionally, image segmentation and L1 norm are both introduced to adaptively construct joint data vector in the preset window. Experiments on five TSX images are used to verify the reliability and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.  aThis work was supported by State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Enviroment of Effects on Electronics and Information System (CEMEE) (CEMEE2020K0303B), and the Key Projects of National Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LQ19F010006,LQ19F020009,LQ20D010007) .  aPublisher supplied data  aLQ19F010006 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3adeformation 3aimage analysis 3ainterferometry 3aspatial data 3asynthetic aperture radar1 aWang, Mengyuan1 aZhang, Jingke1 aWu, Han1 aTeng, Xuyang1 aZhong, Hua1 aWu, Chao0 tRemote sensing letters.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 13, no. 2 p.151-161dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12304x2150-70587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2021.20000613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005400142245014800196300002000344520169700364592002802061596008002089596009802169596007502267650001302342650001302355650001102368650001502379650001102394650001202405650001302417650001602430650001602446700001802462700005802480700005802538700001502596700001602611700006202627773015002689856007702839852000902916655001202925IND60793798720221121234428.0220921e20220907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079379872DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c061242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Lili1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2099-847210aLowering of Reaction Rates by Energetically Favorable Hydrogen Bonding in the Transition State. Degradation of Biofuel Ketohydroperoxides by OH  ap. 16984-16995.  aKetohydroperoxides (KHPs) are oxygenates with carbonyl and hydroperoxy functional groups, and they are generated under combustion and atmospheric conditions. Their fate is crucial for secondary organic aerosol formation in the troposphere and for the ignition processes of biofuels in advanced combustion engines. We investigated the thermodynamics and kinetics of nine hydrogen abstraction reactions from four ether KHPs by OH. We find that the rate constants are strongly affected by entropic effects whose estimation requires a consideration of higher-energy conformers of the transition state. A density functional was selected for these reactions by comparison to coupled cluster calculations, and it was used for calculations by multistructural canonical transition-state theory with multidimensional tunneling over the temperature range of 200–2000 K. We find that the effect of multistructural torsional anharmonicity is very large and quite different for the various ether KHP reactions. A leading cause of the structural dependence is the dominance of entropic factors due to the lack of hydrogen bonding in some of the higher-energy conformers of the transition states. Four of the reactions involve abstraction from the α-carbon (the carbon vicinal to the hydroperoxide group); they exhibit nonmonotonic temperature dependence with complex fuel-specific dependence. The rate constants for abstraction from a non-α-carbon of a given KHP can be faster than the ones for abstraction from an α-carbon; in two cases, this is due to entropy, and in one case, the non-α-carbon abstraction has a lower energy barrier. Tunneling and recrossing effects are also found to be important.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE-SC0015997cU.S. Department of Energydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000015  a51906060cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2021HSC-UE006cProgram of Hefei Science Center CASdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aaerosols 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aentropy 3ahydrogen 3atemperature 3atroposphere1 aLian, Liuchao1 aWang, Zhandong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1535-23191 aCheng, Zhanjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7480-54131 aHe, Yunrui1 aCui, Jintao1 aTruhlar, Donald G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7742-72940 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Sept. 07, v. 144, no. 37 p.16984-16995dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c061243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245017800163300002000341520130200361592002801663650001301691650001101704650001401715650001001729650002001739650001601759650001301775650001201788650000901800650000901809650001301818650001701831650002201848650002301870650001601893700005501909700001501964700001801979700001301997700001802010700001402028700001302042700001502055700002002070700001402090773013802104856008002242852000902322655001202331IND60626293420221121044145.0181220e20181123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062629342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b101072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qianqian10aExcitonic Luminescence Engineering in Tervalent-Europium-Doped Cesium Lead Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals and Their Temperature-Dependent Energy Transfer Emission Properties  ap. 29044-29050.  aCesium lead halide (CsPbX₃ (X = Cl, Br, I)) perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have shown excellent prospects in lighting, display, and lasing fields owing to their excellent photoluminescence (PL) properties. To dope rare earth ions into halide perovskite, CsPbX₃ (X = Cl, Br, I) NC hosts not only inherit the excellent narrow linewidth excitonic properties but also yield unique photoluminescence emission. Herein, engineering of such excitonic luminescence is achieved for Eu³⁺-doped CsPbCl₃–ₓBrₓ (x = 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3) solid solution NCs for the first time. The singly doped NCs present wide color gamut emission covering the whole visible spectrum. The blue-to-green range (400–520 nm) emission is covered by tunable excitonic photoluminescence of CsPbX₃ NCs. Besides, there is a broad red spectral region (590–700 nm) originating from the emission of the tervalent europium ions in NCs. Meanwhile, a noticeable spin-polarized ⁵D₀ → ⁷F₁–₆ emission of Eu³⁺ ions is obtained owing to energy transfer from excitons to dopants. Moreover, the energy transfer is temperature-dependent, which originates from the increase of nonradiative transition probability, leading to the decrease of the PL intensity of NC hosts and the increase of the PL intensity of dopants.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromides 3acesium 3achlorides 3acolor 3aenergy transfer 3aengineering 3aeuropium 3aiodides 3aions 3alead 3alighting 3ananocrystals 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysical chemistry 3aprobability1 aLiu, Yufeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2733-77331 aChen, Peng1 aHou, Jingshan1 aSun, Yan1 aZhao, Guoying1 aZhang, Na1 aZou, Jun1 aXu, Jiayue1 aFang, Yongzheng1 aDai, Ning0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Nov. 23, v. 122, no. 50 p.29044-29050dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b101073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007900169300001800248520110400266536016401370592002801534596000801562650002401570650001401594650001601608650001101624650001601635650001901651650000901670650001301679650001701692653002701709653001201736700001401748700001501762700001101777700001401788700003301802700001901835700001901854700001401873773012501887856008602012852000902098655001202107IND60758537220221123014805.0220112e20211202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075853722DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2020.17621882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYaseen, Aftab10aFerroptosis inhibitory constituents from the fruits of Cullen corylifolium  ap. 5364-5368.  aIn current study, we studied the phytochemicals of Cullen corylifolium (fruits) in which we identify twenty compounds, including two coumarins (1 and 2), three coumestans (3–5), fourchalcone (6–9), three dihydroflavones (10–12), four isoflavones (13–16), one flavonoid (17) and three meroterpenes (18–20).

Compounds 3 and 18 showed the most potent inhibition with the IC₅₀ values of 5.21 μM and 5.41 μM, respectively. Moreover, molecular docking study showed that compound 3 possessed tremendous inhibitory affinity for human 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and Kelch-like ECH-related protein 1: nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Keap1-Nrf2) protein-protein interactions, two important ferroptosis-related targets. These findings indicate that compound 3 (psoralidin) may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of ferroptosis-related diseases.  aThis work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC0505106) and Sichuan Science and Technology Program (2017SZ0020).  aPublisher supplied data  a106 3aCullen corylifolium 3acoumarins 3aferroptosis 3ahumans 3aisoflavones 3ameroterpenoids 3amice 3aresearch 3atherapeutics 0aferroptosis inhibitors 0aphenols1 aYang, Fan1 aZhang, Xia1 aLi, Fu1 aChen, Bin1 aFaraag, Ahmed Hassan Ibrahim1 aWang, Ming-Kui1 aShen, Xiao-Fei1 aWang, Lun0 tNatural product research.g2021 Dec. 2, v. 35, no. 23 p.5364-5368dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2020.17621883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245008600166300001600252500002000268520149600288592002801784650001801812650002401830650001101854650003101865650003101896650002201927650002001949650002601969650001401995650001302009650001502022650001202037650002002049650001302069651001502082700002002097700001802117700002202135700001902157700001902176773012802195856008002323852000902403655001202412IND60588017220221119055518.0180118e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058801722DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.136302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStuart, Rhona K.10aCopper toxicity response influences mesotrophic Synechococcus community structure  ap. 756-769.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPicocyanobacteria from the genus Synechococcus are ubiquitous in ocean waters. Their phylogenetic and genomic diversity suggests ecological niche differentiation, but the selective forces influencing this are not well defined. Marine picocyanobacteria are sensitive to Cu toxicity, so adaptations to this stress could represent a selective force within, and between, ‘species’, also known as clades. Here, we compared Cu stress responses in cultures and natural populations of marine Synechococcus from two co‐occurring major mesotrophic clades (I and IV). Using custom microarrays and proteomics to characterize expression responses to Cu in the lab and field, we found evidence for a general stress regulon in marine Synechococcus. However, the two clades also exhibited distinct responses to copper. The Clade I representative induced expression of genomic island genes in cultures and Southern California Bight populations, while the Clade IV representative downregulated Fe‐limitation proteins. Copper incubation experiments suggest that Clade IV populations may harbour stress‐tolerant subgroups, and thus fitness tradeoffs may govern Cu‐tolerant strain distributions. This work demonstrates that Synechococcus has distinct adaptive strategies to deal with Cu toxicity at both the clade and subclade level, implying that metal toxicity and stress response adaptations represent an important selective force for influencing diversity within marine Synechococcus populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSynechococcus 3acommunity structure 3acopper 3aecological differentiation 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic variation 3agenomic islands 3amicroarray technology 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3aregulon 3astress response 3atoxicity 3aCalifornia1 aBundy, Randelle1 aBuck, Kristen1 aGhassemain, Majid1 aBarbeau, Kathy1 aPalenik, Brian0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2017 Feb., v. 19, no. 2 p.756-769dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.136303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02181naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245013900164300002000303520096300323592002801286650001401314650002101328650001701349650002301366650002101389650001301410650001301423700001501436700002101451700005101472700001501523700005401538773013801592856008001730852000901810655001201819IND60626293520221121034043.0181220e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062629352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b101652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yunong10aReal-Time Study of the Disequilibrium Transfer in Vanadium Flow Batteries at Different States of Charge via Refractive Index Detection  ap. 28550-28555.  aStudying the disequilibrium transfer of the electrolyte in vanadium redox flow batteries is essential for the application of the batteries. Due to the lack of proper detection techniques, the real-time study of the disequilibrium transfer is difficult. In this paper, a real-time refractive index detector with high resolution is developed to study the material transfer in the positive electrolyte at different states of charge. It is found that the rapid imbalance of the electrolyte occurs at the initial state of battery operation, and the disequilibrium transfer rate of materials in the electrolyte accelerates with an increase of the state of charge. During the charge/discharge process, the disequilibrium transfers of vanadium and sulfate show different behaviors. This real-time refractive index detector is beneficial for studying the electrochemical process of vanadium flow batteries and helpful to the optimization of the operational parameter.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aphysical chemistry 3arefractive index 3asulfates 3avanadium1 aMa, Kaijie1 aKuang, Xiangrong1 aLiu, Le1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6944-54171 aSun, Yunxu1 aXi, Jingyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7618-85000 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Nov. 30, v. 122, no. 50 p.28550-28555dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b101653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245007700201300001800278520047100296592002800767650001300795650002300808650001500831650001300846650001300859700002300872700002300895700002400918700005900942700001501001700001801016700002401034700006001058700005801118700006401176773014601240856007601386852000901462655001201471IND60631290920221119091740.0190220e20190130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063129092DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b077052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Kali A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3632-061510aAcid-Triggered, Acid-Generating, and Self-Amplifying Degradable Polymers  ap. 2838-2842.  aWe describe the 3-iodopropyl acetal moiety as a simple cleavable unit that undergoes acid catalyzed hydrolysis to liberate HI (pKₐ ∼ −10) and acrolein stoichiometrically.

In order to evaluate the effects of herbal extracts to control avian coccidiosis, 180 one-day-old broiler chickens were randomly divided into nine equal groups, as follows: (1) Biarum bovei (2) Nectaroscordum tripedale(3) Dorema aucheri (4) Cichorium intybus (5) Prangos ferulaceae (6) diclazuril (7) Artemisia absinthium (8) infected control (9) uninfected control (each contains two groups). Administration of herbal extracts and supplementation of diclazuril was began 2 days before challenge and lasted for the duration of the experiment. The chicks of all the groups except uninfected control group were inoculated orally with sporulated oocysts (3 × 10³ oocysts of Eimeria tenella) on the day 22 of age. The criteria employed were: body weight, feed conversion ratio, blood in feces, survival rate, lesion scoring, number of oocyst output per gram feces and histopathological changes. For histopathological evaluation, on day 12 post inoculation three birds from each group were randomly selected and humanly sacrificed. N. tripedale and diclazuril revealed better results in terms of growth performance, lesion score, extent of bloody diarrhea and oocyst count as compared to other herbal extracts. The increase in the severity of lesions was observed in groups of D. aucheri, A. absinthium, B. bovei, P. ferulaceae, C. intybus, diclazuril and N. tripedale, respectively. In conclusion, the current study showed that herbal extracts were effective in control of coccidiosis caused by the E. tenella infection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArtemisia absinthium 3aBiarum 3aCichorium intybus 3aDorema 3aEimeria tenella 3aPrangos 3ablood 3abody weight 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3acoccidiosis 3adiarrhea 3adiclazuril 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3afeces 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3agrowth performance 3ahistopathology 3ain vivo studies 3aoocysts 3asurvival rate1 aFirouzi, Sobhan1 aNili, Hasan1 aRazavi, Mostafa1 aAsadi, Seyedeh Leili1 aDaneshi, Sajad0 tJournal of parasitic diseases.g2016 June, v. 40, no. 2 p.401-407dSpringer Indiax0971-71967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12639-014-0517-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245014000176300001800316520134000334592002801674650001101702650001201713650001701725650001101742650001501753650002601768650001401794650001501808650001501823651001001838700003201848700003101880700002801911700003301939700003701972773009302009856008102102852000902183655001202192IND60523196120221117230018.0160607e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052319612DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-015-0060-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz-Delgado, Mª Carmen10aWrack Removal as Short-Term Disturbance for Talitrus Saltator Density in the Supratidal Zone of Sandy Beaches: an Experimental Approach  ap. 1113-1121.  aA distinctive feature of sandy beaches is the stranded wrack, which represents a key element in the maintenance of their biodiversity and ecosystem function. However, these materials are commonly removed from beaches worldwide. In October–November 2012, a field experiment following an M-BACI design was conducted to assess the effect of wrack removal on sandhopper populations on two sandy beaches on the Atlantic southwest coast of Spain. The beaches, Levante (36°33′N, 6°13′W) and Cortadura (36°28′N, 6°15′W) differed in their morphodynamics (dissipative and intermediate, respectively) and in the dominant wrack sources (seagrasses vs. macroalgae). Wrack removal diminished the density of the sandhopper, Talitrus saltator, a dominant species in the supratidal zone especially under wrack, but the difference between impacted and control plots was short-lived (several days). Juvenile sandhoppers appeared more sensitive to this disturbance than adults, although this was found only at Levante. This study highlights the adaptability of this sandhopper to a single wrack removal event and shows that the magnitude of the effect is likely dependent on the particular characteristics of individual beaches. The consequences of frequent wrack removal from these beaches on sandhopper populations remain to be determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abeaches 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3aecosystems 3afield experimentation 3ajuveniles 3amacroalgae 3aseagrasses 3aSpain1 aVierheller Vieira, Jenyffer1 aReyes-Martínez, Mª José1 aBorzone, Carlos Alberto1 aSánchez-Moyano, Juan Emilio1 aGarcía-García, Francisco José0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2016 July, v. 39, no. 4 p.1113-1121dSpringer USx1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-015-0060-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03471naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245016600168300002000334520163400354592002801988650002902016650002602045650002502071650002202096650001002118650001202128650002102140650001202161650001102173650002002184650002802204650002002232650001602252650002702268650002802295650000902323650002002332650001602352650001002368650001802378650002002396650001802416650002102434650001202455650001202467650002902479650000902508700002402517700002102541700002802562700001802590700002202608773014902630856008102779852000902860655001202869IND60584570120221118110616.0171025e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058457012DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-0158-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaleh, Hamida M.10aEfficacy of α-lipoic acid against cadmium toxicity on metal ion and oxidative imbalance, and expression of metallothionein and antioxidant genes in rabbit brain  ap. 24593-24601.  aTo explore the protective efficacy of α-lipoic acid (ALA) against Cd-prompted neurotoxicity, young male New Zealand rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were divided randomly into four groups. Group 1 (control) received demineralized water. Group 2 (Cd) administered cadmium chloride (CdCl₂) 3 mg/kg bwt. Group 3 (ALA) administered ALA 100 mg/kg bwt. Group 4 (Cd + ALA) administered ALA 1 h after Cd. The treatments were administered orally for 30 consecutive days. Cd-induced marked disturbances in neurochemical parameters were indicated by the reduction in micro- and macro-elements (Zn, Fe, Cu, P, and Ca), with the highest reduction in Cd-exposed rabbits, followed by Cd + ALA group and then ALA group. In the brain tissues, Cd has significantly augmented the lipid hydroperoxides (LPO) and reduced the glutathione (GSH) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase enzyme activities but had an insignificant effect on the antioxidant redox enzymes. Administration of ALA effectively restored LPO and sustained GSH and TAC contents. Moreover, Cd downregulated the transcriptional levels of Nrf2, MT3, and SOD1 genes, and upregulated that of Keap1 gene. ALA treatment, shortly following Cd exposure, downregulated Keap1, and upregulated Nrf2 and GPx1, while maintained MT3 and SOD1 mRNA gene expression in the rabbits’ brain. These data indicated the ALA effectiveness in protecting against Cd-induced oxidative stress and the depletion of cellular antioxidants in the brain of rabbits perhaps due to its antioxidant, free radical scavenging, and chelating properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNew Zealand White rabbit 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant genes 3abrain 3acadmium 3acadmium chloride 3acalcium 3acopper 3aenzyme activity 3afree radical scavengers 3agene expression 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3airon 3alipid peroxides 3alipoic acid 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3ametallothionein 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3arabbits 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3azinc1 aEl-Sayed, Yasser S.1 aNaser, Sherif M.1 aEltahawy, Abdelgawad S.1 aOnoda, Atsuto1 aUmezawa, Masakazu0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Nov., v. 24, no. 31 p.24593-24601dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0158-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011700164300001600281520109800297592002801395650001501423650002201438650001501460650002201475650002501497650001301522650001801535650001101553650002301564650001601587700001601603700001801619773010501637856008101742990002301823852000901846655001201855IND60093030820221117031104.0141103e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009303082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.07.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Guixia10aKinetic and thermodynamic study of 1-naphthol adsorption from aqueous solution to sulfonated graphene nanosheets  ap. 185-190.  aThe sulfonated graphene nanosheets were prepared from graphene oxides. The kinetic and thermodynamic adsorption of 1-naphthol from aqueous solution on the sulfonated graphene nanosheets were investigated under ambient conditions. The results of 1-naphthol kinetic adsorption on sulfonated graphene indicated that the adsorption was inclined to stack on the surface of graphene nanosheets with low activation energy. The thermodynamic parameters calculated from the temperature dependent adsorption isotherms indicated that the adsorption was a spontaneous and endothermic process, and the adsorption was in good agreement with the theory of non-bonding interaction intensity. The adsorption capacities of 1-naphthol on sulfonated graphene nanosheets are ∼2.3mmol/g at 293.15K, and ∼6.4mmol/g at 313.15 and 333.15K, which are the highest adsorption capacity of todays’ nanomaterials. The results suggest that the sulfonated graphene nanosheets may be a promising suitable candidate for the preconcentration of 1-naphthol from large volume of aqueous solutions in real work in near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-naphthol 3aactivation energy 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical engineering 3agraphene 3ananomaterials 3aoxides 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature1 aLi, Jiaxing1 aWang, Xiangke0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 173, no. 1 p.185-190dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.07.0723Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245013600179520140200315592002801717650001701745650002101762650001201783650001601795650002301811650001401834650001201848650001801860650001101878650001801889650002101907650000701928650003901935650001601974650002701990650001302017653002902030653001402059653002202073653004102095653002002136700002302156700002702179700002202206700002102228773010202249856008602351852000902437655001202446IND60726646120221122042330.0211030e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072664612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1066502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-García, Ricardo10aBiological protein precipitation: A green process for the extraction of cucumisin from melon (Cucumis melo L. inodorus) by-products  aCucumisin (CUC) from industrial melon by-products was separated for the first time through biological precipitation using carrageenan (CRG). This approach could represent a cost-effective and environmentally friendly process for the industries, avoiding the use of expensive equipment and toxic salts or solvents, such as butanol and ethanol. In this study, biological precipitation of proteins from melon by-products using CRG was studied and compared with conventional precipitation with ammonium sulphate. Different methods were applied for the identification and characterization of isolated proteins, including SDS-PAGE gel, FPLC and proteolytic activity assays. The isolated CUC confirmed a molecular weight of 68 kDa and showed highly stable proteolytic (PA) and milk-clotting (MCA) activities in a wide range of CaCl₂ (20–60 mM), pH (5–7) and temperatures (30–85 °C). Melon peel extract demonstrated to possess significant PA (4.24 U/mg protein) and MCA (191.50 MCU/mg protein), but such values were increased by ammonium sulphate precipitation (1.60 and 2.06-folds, respectively), and specially a noticeable increment was observed by biological precipitation with 2.11 and 17.65-folds, respectively, demonstrating the capability to be an effective strategy to isolate and purify CUC, allowing a yield of 0.17 g CUC/100 g of by-products and keeping its biological properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis melo 3aammonium sulfate 3abutanol 3acarrageenan 3acost effectiveness 3aequipment 3aethanol 3ahydrocolloids 3amelons 3amilk clotting 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteolysis 3asustainable technology 3atoxicity 0aBiological precipitation 0aCucumisin 0aMelon by-products 0aMilk-clotting and proteolytic enzyme 0aPolyelectrolyte1 aCampos, Débora A.1 aAguilar, Cristóbal N.1 aMadureira, Ana R.1 aPintado, Manuela0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2021 July, v. 116 p.106650-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1066503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012200166520170900288592002801997650003202025650002302057650001402080650002402094650002002118650002002138650001102158650001802169650001502187650001802202650002002220650001302240650001402253650001302267650002102280650001402301653002902315653002602344653002302370653002802393653001902421700001302440700001402453700001702467700001302484700001302497773010202510856008602612852000902698655001202707IND60726646220221120212500.0211030e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072664622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1066512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Tong14aThe enhanced fatty acids flavor release for low-fat cheeses by carrier immobilized lipases on O/W Pickering emulsions  aLow-fat cheeses have flavor defects due to low fat content resulting in an insufficient free fatty acids (FFA) flavor release. Lipase immobilization is an attractive approach to increase the efficiency of lipid hydrolysis and FFA release. Here, α-lactalbumin (α-lac) nanotubes (NTs) formed by self-assembly of partially hydrolyzed α-lac peptides were applied as an immobilization carrier for lipases. The aim is to increase the lipase activity and compromise its flavor defects in low-fat cheeses by lipase immobilization on NTs (Lipase-NTs). Firstly, the lipase activity was improved 68% for Lipase-NTs compared with free lipase. Enzyme kinetics analysis suggested that NTs immobilization increased the affinity of lipase to substrate and reduced the potential energy barrier for enzyme reaction. Then Lipase-NTs were applied to stabilize the oil-in-water Pickering emulsion which enlarged reaction areas and improved the accessibility of lipase to substrate. The NTs-lipase emulsion system enhanced the lipase catalytic efficiency, the Lipase-NTs could hydrolyze and release 1.5 times higher amount of FFA compared to free lipases with the identical triglycerides contents by titration measurement. Lipase-NTs milk fat O/W Pickering emulsions were added in low-fat cheese to replace all the original milk fat during the cheese processing. Lipase-NTs O/W emulsion added low-fat cheese showed a twice amount of FFA release compared with normal low-fat cheese containing identical milk fat contents measured by GC-MS. This work provides the inspiration on creating flavor enhanced low-fat foods by lipase immobilization strategy which can improve the enzyme activity and promote the FFA flavor release.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatalytic activity 3aemulsions 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme kinetics 3aflavor 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrolysis 3alipid content 3alow fat cheeses 3amilk fat 3ananotubes 3apeptides 3apotential energy 3atitration 0aα-lactalbumin nanotubes 0aLipase immobilization 0aPickering emulsion 0aImmobilization carriers 0aLow-fat cheese1 aLiu, Bin1 aWang, Ran1 aHuang, Yutao1 aLuo, Jie1 aLi, Yuan0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2021 July, v. 116 p.106651-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1066513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245010200174300001600276520123400292592002801526650001201554650002501566650001201591650001001603650001101613650001701624650001301641651001101654700002201665700001801687700001701705700002001722773010501742856008101847990002301928852000901951655001201960IND60093031020221117030604.0141103e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009303102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.07.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Ghouti, Mohammad A.10aExtraction and separation of vanadium and nickel from fly ash produced in heavy fuel power plants  ap. 191-197.  aIn Jordan, large amounts of fly ash (FA) are produced as a result of burning heavy fuel in power plants. Extraction of metals from FA is an important industrial/environmental issue to assess metals’ mobility and applications. Large amounts of metals (V, Ni, Fe, Ca, Mg, Na, and K) were easily leached from FA under acidic, basic, and neutral conditions and this makes disposal of this material an important environmental issue. Extraction and separation of vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni) from FA is achieved using Akita's procedure with some modifications. In the first step, Ni is selectively eluted from FA using NH₄OH solution and then precipitated using Na₂S. The Ni/V ratio in final precipitate was 27. On the other hand, V is extracted from Ni-free-FA using Na₂CO₃ solution, recovered by 0.1M tri-ethylamine/toluene, and precipitated by NH₄Cl. The V/Ni ratio in the final precipitate was 55. The adopted method showed a reasonable recovery for both metals from FA, 56 and 45% from Ni and V, respectively. The earlier attempts indicated that separation of V/Ni by precipitation using OH⁻ or CO₃ ²⁻ was not successful where both the metals did not precipitate from solution in the presence of other elements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3achemical engineering 3afly ash 3afuels 3anickel 3apower plants 3avanadium 3aJordan1 aAl-Degs, Yahya S.1 aGhrair, Ayoup1 aKhoury, Hani1 aZiedan, Mahmoud0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 173, no. 1 p.191-197dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.07.0803Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003900147245014400186300002000330520143700350592002801787650001601815650001601831650002201847650001301869650001901882650001401901650002101915650001201936650002201948650001101970650001301981650001401994650002002008700002902028700004402057700002502101700003802126773014902164856008102313852000902394655001202403IND60584571020221118110641.0171025e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058457102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-0041-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Costa Soares, Izabelle Cristina10aFunctional group influences on the reactive azo dye decolorization performance by electrochemical oxidation and electro-Fenton technologies  ap. 24167-24176.  aElectrochemical water treatment technologies are highly promising to achieve complete decolorization of dyebath effluents, as demonstrated by several studies reported in the literature. However, these works are focused on the treatment of one model pollutant and generalize the performances of the processes which are not transposable since they depend on the pollutant treated. Thus, in the present study, we evaluate, for the first time, the influence of different functional groups that modify the dye structure on the electrochemical process decolorization performance. The textile azo dyes Reactive Orange 16, Reactive Violet 4, Reactive Red 228, and Reactive Black 5 have been selected because they present the same molecular basis structure with different functional groups. The results demonstrate that the functional groups that reduce the nucleophilicity of the pollutant hinder the electrophilic attack of electrogenerated hydroxyl radical. Thereby, the overall decolorization efficiency is consequently reduced as well as the decolorization rate. Moreover, the presence of an additional chromophore azo bond in the molecule enhances the recalcitrant character of the azo dyes as pollutants. The formation of a larger and more stable conjugated π system increases the activation energy required for the electrophyilic attack of •OH, affecting the performance of electrochemical technologies on effluent decolorization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aLewis bases 3aactivation energy 3aazo dyes 3adecolorization 3aeffluents 3aelectrochemistry 3afabrics 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amodels 3amoieties 3aoxidation 3awater treatment1 ada Silva, Djalma Ribeiro1 ado Nascimento, José Heriberto Oliveira1 aGarcia-Segura, Sergi1 aMartínez-Huitle, Carlos Alberto,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Nov., v. 24, no. 31 p.24167-24176dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0041-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007800170500001900248520142000267592002801687650002101715650001601736650001501752650001701767650001301784650001301797650001501810653001201825653001201837653002101849653002301870653002501893700006001918700003201978773011202010856008202122852000902204655001202213IND60726646720221122031623.0210503e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072664672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2021.1120252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSepahvand, Marzieh10aPlasmonic nanoparticles for colorimetric detection of nitrite and nitrate  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIrregular and unknowingly use of chemical compounds is a serious threat to the environment, human health, and other living organisms attributable and intensified by the growing population and increasing demand for food. Nitrite and nitrate are among those compounds that are widely used in agricultural and industrial products. Therefore on-site, rapid, simple, and accurate monitoring of nitrite/nitrate is highly desirable. In this review, while emphasizing the importance of nitrite and nitrate in food chain safety and health of living organisms, their measurement methods, in particular, nanoplasmonic colorimetric sensors are comprehensively discussed based on the researches in this field. Nanoplasmonic-based sensors have proved to be successful in comparison with traditional methods due to their low cost, biocompatibility, high sensitivity and selectivity, and most importantly, the ability to visually detect and be used on-site to measure nitrite and nitrate. The design principle of nanoplasmonic sensors will be presented into two categories of aggregation- and etching-based detection followed by their applications in nitrite detection. The nitrate measurement will be discussed based on either direct detection of nitrate or indirect strategy in which nitrate is reduced to nitrite by enzymes or metals. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects in this topic will be described and outlined.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acolorimetry 3afood chain 3ahuman health 3anitrates 3anitrites 3atoxicology 0aNitrite 0aNitrate 0aVisual detection 0aGold nanoparticles 0aSilver nanoparticles1 aGhasemi, Forough1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1093-20581 aSeyed Hosseini, Hossein Mir0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2021 Mar., v. 149 p.112025-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2021.1120253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015400168500001900322520108700341592002801428650003001456650002901486650002101515650001201536650004301548650002201591650001701613650001501630650001601645653001401661653003401675653002801709653001801737700002501755700002101780700001801801700002101819773011201840856008201952852000902034655001202043IND60726646820221122031648.0210503e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072664682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2021.1120302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhataee, Alireza10aFrontiers in conventional and nanomaterials based electrochemical sensing and biosensing approaches for Ochratoxin A analysis in foodstuffs: A review  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHighly sensitive and rapid methods for the Ochratoxin A (OTA) detection as a main class of Ochratoxins (OT) in various food samples is significant.

A summary of the current limitations and future challenges in OTA analysis are described, which efficiently provide a pathway for further developments and applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillary electrophoresis 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrochemistry 3aenzymes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aochratoxin A 3atoxicology 3avoltammetry 0aMycotoxin 0aSensing and biosensing assays 0aElectrochemical methods 0aFood toxicity1 aSohrabi, Hessamaddin1 aArbabzadeh, Omid1 aKhaaki, Pegah1 aMajidi, Mir Reza0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2021 Mar., v. 149 p.112030-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2021.1120303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013700163300001600300520117900316592002801495650002201523650001401545650002301559650002701582650002501609650002301634650001801657650001301675650000901688650000901697650001801706650001301724650001101737650002501748650001401773700001701787700001301804773010501817856008101922990002302003852000902026655001202035IND60093031720221117030258.0141103e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009303172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.07.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Shaoyu10aDegradable, injectable poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-based hydrogels with low gelation concentrations for protein delivery application  ap. 241-250.  aCMC-g-PNIPAAm copolymers were developed by decorating the backbone of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) with linear chains of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), with the ultimate aim of synthesizing a biodegradable and injectable hydrogel that also possesses a low gelation concentration. Their aqueous solutions were found to undergo a reversible subphysiological phase transition at the concentration of 2wt%. The value is much lower than that reported for many PNIPAAm-based copolymers. The phase transition behavior, gelation time, injectability, viscosity, swelling, degradation and cytocompatibility were explored. The model drug lysozyme was easily incorporated into the hydrogel by mixing with the gel precursors prior to heating. In vitro release of lysozyme from the in situ forming hydrogel was studied. Secondary and tertiary structure analysis and biological assays of the released protein showed that encapsulation and release did not affect the protein conformation and functionality. These results indicate that this biocompatible and injectable hydrogel system may be useful as a potential vehicle for therapeutic proteins for sustained release applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abioassays 3abiopharmaceuticals 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3achemical engineering 3acomposite polymers 3aencapsulation 3agelation 3agels 3aheat 3ahydrocolloids 3alysozyme 3amixing 3aprotein conformation 3aviscosity1 aLiu, Mingzhu1 aNi, Boli0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 173, no. 1 p.241-250dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.07.0523Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245012000173300001400293520144100307592002801748650002601776650002201802650001501824650001501839650001301854650002201867650002501889650001601914650001701930650001701947650001401964650001101978650000701989650003501996650002302031650002502054650001702079650001602096650001602112700001802128700001302146700001302159700001402172773010302186856008102289990002302370852000902393655001202402IND60093032120150227000000.0141103e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009303212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaghouane-Boudiaf, H.10aTreatment of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol by MgAl–SDBS organo-layered double hydroxides: Kinetic and equilibrium studies  ap. 36-41.  aClay-based adsorbents were synthesized by incorporating anionic surfactants sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), into calcined magnesium aluminum layered double hydroxide (MgAl–C) via ion exchange. The sample has been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy and B.E.T measurement. The result shows that SDBS adsorption on the calcined phase is enhanced by reconstruction of a matrix hydrotalcite intercalated by the dodecylbenzenesulfonate with basal spacing of 30Å, which is larger than that of MgAl–CO₃. The product which is an organophilic layered double hydroxide or organo-LDH (MgAl–SDBS) was examined for their ability to adsorb organic pollutant. The adsorption of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP) from aqueous solutions by MgAl–SDBS hydrotalcite was investigated in a batch mode. The influence of solution pH, initial TCP concentration and temperature has been tested in kinetic runs. The results showed that the kinetic adsorption could be described by a pseudo-second order model very well. The equilibrium isotherm for TCP uptake was fitted to the Langmuir model with correlation coefficient R² of 0.998 at low concentrations and 0.992 for all concentrations. Its maximum adsorption amount is 240.5mg/g from this model, while the real amount is 160mg/g at 298K and pH 4. The negative value of ΔG° and the positive value of ΔH° indicate the spontaneous and endothermic nature of the process.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4,5-trichlorophenol 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical engineering 3acorrelation 3ahydrotalcite 3aion exchange 3amagnesium 3amodels 3apH 3asodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate 3asorption isotherms 3aspatial distribution 3aspectroscopy 3asurfactants 3atemperature1 aBoutahala, M.1 aTiar, C.1 aArab, L.1 aGarin, F.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 173, no. 1 p.36-41dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.07.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013500166300002000301520097900321592002801300650002501328650002201353650002501375650001701400650001401417650001401431650001001445651001001455773014901465856008101614852000901695655001201704IND60584572020221120082215.0171025e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058457202DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-0273-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAckah, Michael10aInformal E-waste recycling in developing countries: review of metal(loid)s pollution, environmental impacts and transport pathways  ap. 24092-24101.  aCrude or primitive recycling practices are often adopted in material resource recovery from E-waste in developing nations. Significant human health and environmental impacts may occur because of such practices. Literature on metal(loid)s pollution during E-waste processing is fragmented. Here, I review the health and environmental impacts of E-waste recycling operations and transport pathways of metal(loid)s, dispersed during operations. This paper is organised into five sections. Section 1 relates to the background of global E-waste generation and legal/illegal trade, citing specific cases from Ghana and other developing nations. Section 2 provides a brief information on sources of metal(loid)s in E-waste. Section 3 describes characteristics of informal E-waste recycling operations in developing nations. Section 4 examines the health and environmental impacts in E-waste recycling while section 5 evaluates major transport pathways of metal(loid)s contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aelectronic wastes 3aenvironmental impact 3ahuman health 3apollution 3arecycling 3atrade 3aGhana0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Nov., v. 24, no. 31 p.24092-24101dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0273-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010200165300001600267500001500283520127900298592002801577650001201605650001601617650001101633650001101644650001701655650000901672650002501681650002201706650001201728650002301740650001601763650002301779650001101802650001501813653001301828700001501841700001401856773010501870856008101975990002302056852000902079655001202088IND60093033520221117030227.0141103e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009303352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.07.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zhenxia10aAdsorption equilibrium and kinetics of p-xylene on chromium-based metal organic framework MIL-101  ap. 150-157.  a2019-12-06  aThe adsorption and diffusion properties of p-xylene on the chromium-terphthalate-based crystals (MIL-101) and the surface energy of MIL-101 were investigated by using gravimetric and inverse gas chromatography (IGC) techniques. The nanocrystal MIL-101 (∼100nm) was synthesized by using microwave irradiation method. Adsorption isotherms and kinetic curves of p-xylene on the MIL-101 were measured at temperatures of (288, 298, 308 and 318) K and vapor pressures up to 6 mbar, respectively. Results show that the amount adsorbed of p-xylene on the synthesized MIL-101 was up to 10.9mmol/g at 288K and 6 mbar. The isosteric adsorption heat of p-xylene on the MIL-101 was in the range of 24.8–44.3kJ/mol, which decreased with an increase in amount adsorbed of p-xylene on the MIL-101. The diffusion coefficients of p-xylene within the MIL-101 were in the range of 2.80–10.1×10⁻¹⁰cm²/s at 288–318K with activation energy of 30.9kJ/mol. Three polar probes (acetone, toluene and p-xylene) were used to characterize the surface property of the MIL-101 by using IGC technique. IGC measurement results showed that the specific component (ΔGₐ ˢ) of the free energy of adsorption for polar probe molecules on the MIL-101 followed the order: p-xylene>toluene>acetone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3atemperature 3aenergy 3axylene 3ananocrystals 3aheat 3achemical engineering 3aactivation energy 3atoluene 3asorption isotherms 3airradiation 3agas chromatography 3avapors 3aadsorption 0acrystals1 aLi, Xuemei1 aLi, Zhong0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 173, no. 1 p.150-157dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.07.0513Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100005900188245009300247300001100340506007600351520173300427592002802160506003702188650002202225650001902247650002402266650001302290650001302303650001502316650001002331650003002341650001402371650002502385650001002410650003502420650001002455700002002465700002302485773012202508856008202630852000902712655001202721IND60584573020221207142546.0200605e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058457302DNAL7 a290658682pmid7 aPMC56559112pmcid7 a10.1186/s12711-017-0351-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaoul, Jérôme1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3140-443310aUsing a very low-density SNP panel for genomic selection in a breeding program for sheep  ap. 76.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Building an efficient reference population for genomic selection is an issue when the recorded population is small and phenotypes are poorly informed, which is often the case in sheep breeding programs. Using stochastic simulation, we evaluated a genomic design based on a reference population with medium-density genotypes [around 45 K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] of dams that were imputed from very low-density genotypes (≤ 1000 SNPs). METHODS: A population under selection for a maternal trait was simulated using real genotypes. Genetic gains realized from classical selection and genomic selection designs were compared. Genomic selection scenarios that differed in reference population structure (whether or not dams were included in the reference) and genotype quality (medium-density or imputed to medium-density from very low-density) were evaluated. RESULTS: The genomic design increased genetic gain by 26% when the reference population was based on sire medium-density genotypes and by 54% when the reference population included both sire and dam medium-density genotypes. When medium-density genotypes of male candidates and dams were replaced by imputed genotypes from very low-density SNP genotypes (1000 SNPs), the increase in gain was 22% for the sire reference population and 42% for the sire and dam reference population. The rate of increase in inbreeding was lower (from − 20 to − 34%) for the genomic design than for the classical design regardless of the genomic scenario. CONCLUSIONS: We show that very low-density genotypes of male candidates and dams combined with an imputation process result in a substantial increase in genetic gain for small sheep breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreeding programs 3adams (mothers) 3agenetic improvement 3agenomics 3agenotype 3ainbreeding 3amales 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotype 3apopulation structure 3asheep 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asires1 aSwan, Andrew A.1 aElsen, Jean-Michel0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2017 Dec., v. 49, no. 1 p.76-76dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x1297-96867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12711-017-0351-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03939naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001900188245010900207300001100316506007600327520161100403592002802014596005002042596002502092596004902117596005402166596005402220596003102274596002402305596002202329596002902351506003702380650001602417650001902433650003802452650002602490650001702516650001702533650001002550650001302560650001502573650004202588650001702630650002802647650003502675650001202710651001102722700002402733700001902757700002402776700002202800700002102822700002102843700002202864700002202886700002102908700002502929700002102954700002102975700002002996773012203016856008203138852000903220655001203229IND60584573120221207144144.0200605e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058457312DNAL7 a290658592pmid7 aPMC56559092pmcid7 a10.1186/s12711-017-0352-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLetaief, Rabia10aIdentification of copy number variation in French dairy and beef breeds using next-generation sequencing  ap. 77.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Copy number variations (CNV) are known to play a major role in genetic variability and disease pathogenesis in several species including cattle. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of CNV in eight French beef and dairy breeds using whole-genome sequence data from 200 animals. Bioinformatics analyses to search for CNV were carried out using four different but complementary tools and we validated a subset of the CNV by both in silico and experimental approaches. RESULTS: We report the identification and localization of 4178 putative deletion-only, duplication-only and CNV regions, which cover 6% of the bovine autosomal genome; they were validated by two in silico approaches and/or experimentally validated using array-based comparative genomic hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping arrays. The size of these variants ranged from 334 bp to 7.7 Mb, with an average size of ~ 54 kb. Of these 4178 variants, 3940 were deletions, 67 were duplications and 171 corresponded to both deletions and duplications, which were defined as potential CNV regions. Gene content analysis revealed that, among these variants, 1100 deletions and duplications encompassed 1803 known genes, which affect a wide spectrum of molecular functions, and 1095 overlapped with known QTL regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is a large-scale survey of CNV in eight French dairy and beef breeds. These CNV will be useful to study the link between genetic variability and economically important traits, and to improve our knowledge on the genomic architecture of cattle.  aPublisher supplied data  aGenSSeq project from Selgen metaprogramcINRA  aAAP-GA MutatedcINRA  aBovCNV project from Selgen metaprogramcINRA  aANR-09-GENM-011cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  aANR-10-GENM-018cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  aANR-10-GENM-018cApis-Gene  aReproSeqcApis-Gene  aSexSeqcApis-Gene  aBovSeqcRégion Limousin0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeef cattle 3abioinformatics 3acomparative genomic hybridization 3acopy number variation 3adairy breeds 3adairy cattle 3agenes 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3apathogenesis 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asurveys 3aFrance1 aRebours, Emmanuelle1 aGrohs, Cécile1 aMeersseman, Cédric1 aFritz, Sébastien1 aTrouilh, Lidwine1 aEsquerré, Diane1 aBarbieri, Johanna1 aKlopp, Christophe1 aPhilippe, Romain1 aBlanquet, Véronique1 aBoichard, Didier1 aRocha, Dominique1 aBoussaha, Mekki0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2017 Dec., v. 49, no. 1 p.77-77dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x1297-96867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12711-017-0352-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012300168520152200291592002801813650003401841650002201875650002501897650001701922650001801939650001201957650002401969650001601993650003602009650001802045650002102063650002402084650001502108650001902123650001102142650002102153650002102174650001902195650001602214650002002230650001702250651001002267653002402277653001402301700001702315700001702332700001602349700005302365773011702418856008602535852000902621655001202630IND60699549420221119091005.0200831e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069954942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1126922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zenggen10aPhytochemical profiles, nutritional constituents and antioxidant activity of black wolfberry (Lycium ruthenicum Murr.)  aBlack wolfberry (Lycium ruthenicum, LR) is one of edible and medicinal fruits used widely in West China and contains many nutritional and health benefits of bioactive components. In this study, the phytochemical profiles and nutritional constituents in LR berries from seven production regions were systematically investigated and analyzed quantitatively. And the antioxidant activity of LR berry extracts was also measured by several methods, including DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and ORAC assays. Dietary fibers, soluble sugars, organic acids, minerals and vitamin C were rich in LR berries, and low variation of nutritional constituent contents were detected in these regions. Furthermore, the concentration of the functional components (such as polyphenols, phenolic acids, flavonoids and polysaccharides) varied significantly in LR berries from different regions, and there were no significant differences of these components in the wild and cultivated berries from the same region. Generally, these functional components had significantly positive correlations with antioxidant activity, with exception for total flavonoids and total carotenoids. Overall, LR berries from Qaidam Basin of Qinghai, not only represented abundant nutritional constituents and phenolics, polysaccharides and betaine, but possessed significantly higher antioxidant activity than those of the other production regions, indicating that they can conduct as excellent sources of antioxidants used in nutraceutical formulations and functional foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aLycium ruthenicum 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abetaine 3abioactive compounds 3acarotenoids 3achemical constituents of plants 3adietary fiber 3adietary minerals 3adietary supplements 3aflavonoids 3afruit extracts 3afruits 3afunctional foods 3anutrient content 3aphenolic acids 3apolyphenols 3apolysaccharides 3asmall fruits 3aChina 0aNutritional profile 0aPhenolics1 aLiu, Baolong1 aWen, Huaixiu1 aTao, Yanduo1 aShao, Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9587-60930 tIndustrial crops and products.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 154 p.112692-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1126923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01496naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245010300169300001800272520035200290592002800642650001200670650003600682650002100718650002300739650002300762650002500785650001200810650001200822700002100834700002200855700005700877773012000934856008301054852000901137655001201146IND60608379120221120092237.0180807e20180406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060837912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b006432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrakash, Rashmi10aRu(II)-Catalyzed C–H Activation and Annulation Reaction via Carbon–Carbon Triple Bond Cleavage  ap. 2297-2300.  aAn unprecedented Ru(II)-catalyzed C–H activation and annulation reaction, which proceeds via C–C triple bond cleavage, is reported.

Six professionally-trained panelists evaluated two tomato soup products randomly served at four temperatures: 25, 40, 55, and 70 °C, and rated intensities of 29 attributes. Trained panelists found that five attributes changed with sample temperature of tomato soup. A total of 103 consumers also evaluated the same tomato soup products served at four temperatures using check-all-that-apply (CATA) ballots related to sensory attributes and emotional responses. The 27 emotional and 20 sensory attributes differed significantly among samples of two product types served at four temperatures. A principal component analysis showed that variation in sensory attributes could better be explained by product type rather than sample temperature, while emotional-response variation was attributed more to sample temperature than to product type. Sensory and emotional drivers of liking were also found to differ with sample temperature. Another study in which 66 consumers characterized sensory and emotional attributes of purified water at the four temperatures was conducted. Consumer emotional responses to water samples changed with sample temperature, while sensory perception varied only minimally. In conclusion, our findings provide empirical evidence that sample temperature significantly influences both emotional responses and sensory attributes, and temperature effects vary with the type of food.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aprincipal component analysis 3asensation 3asensory properties 3asoups 3atemperature 3atomatoes 0aSensory perception 0aAcceptance 0aEmotional response 0aTomato soup 0aCheck-all-that-apply1 aSeo, Han-Seok0 tFood quality and preference.g2020 Dec., v. 86 p.104005-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2020.1040053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009800169520133600267592002801603650001701631650001601648650002101664650001101685650001501696650002301711650001101734650001401745650002201759650001401781650001901795650001301814650001601827650001801843650001801861653001501879653001001894653002401904653001701928700003201945700002701977700001902004700002102023700002002044773009602064856008702160852000902247655001202256IND60699551020221119084929.0210820e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069955102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.1074302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuek, Su Lee10aContribution of lipid towards acrylamide formation during intermittent frying of French fries  aThis study aims to investigate the influence of lipid towards acrylamide formation during intermittent frying of French fries. A total of 80 frying cycles were performed on par-fried potato strips in different vegetable oils namely as red palm olein, palm olein, sunflower oil and soybean oil while acrylamide in French fries were analysed. Oil was sampled for every sixteenth cycle of frying and subjected to physico-chemical analyses, i.e. peroxide value (PV), p-anisidine value (p-AV), total oxidation (TOTOX) value and free fatty acid (FFA). A weak positive but significant correlation and contribution were found between acrylamide concentration in French fries with p-AV (r = 0.254, P ≤ 0.05) and FFA (r = 0.253, P ≤ 0.05); however, this was not the case of PV and TOTOX value. Indeed, contribution of FFA (beta = 186, P ≤ 0.05) towards acrylamide formation was stronger than p-AV (beta = 4.60, P ≤ 0.05). Except for palm olein, the number of frying cycle significantly affected acrylamide concentration in French fries. Lowest acrylamide concentration (452 ± 5.6 μg/kg) was observed when palm olein is used as frying media. Overall, diverse effects of oil types and frying cycles reported in the literature were possibly due to weak association of lipid oxidation and hydrolysis with acrylamide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrench fries 3aacrylamides 3afree fatty acids 3afrying 3ahydrolysis 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3aoxidation 3ap-anisidine value 3apalm oils 3aperoxide value 3apotatoes 3asoybean oil 3asunflower oil 3avegetable oil 0aAcrylamide 0aLipid 0aIntermittent frying 0aFrench fries1 aAhmad Tarmizi, Azmil Haizam1 aAbd Razak, Raznim Arni1 aJinap, Selamat1 aNorliza, Saparin1 aSanny, Maimunah0 tFood control.g2020 Dec., v. 118 p.107430-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.1074303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01350naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005500149245012500204300001800329520032900347592002800676650001600704650002600720650001800746650001300764650001100777700006000788773012000848856008300968852000901051655001201060IND60608380620221119214413.0180807e20180411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060838062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b006712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShalev, Ori1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1628-834X14aThe Lithiation/Oxygenation Approach to Calix[6]arenes Selectively Functionalized at a Pair of Opposite Methylene Bridges  ap. 2324-2327.  aLithiation of the calix[6]arene methyl ether 2 followed by reaction with O₂ yields derivatives with two opposite methylene groups hydroxylated.

It was suggested that the zigzag-shaped architecture stabilizes the newly discovered α-ketocarbenium ions derived from orthoquinone-containing polycyclic aromatic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBronsted acids 3aabsorption 3aaromatic compounds 3achemical reactions 3aions 3amoieties 3apolycyclic compounds 3aspectral analysis 3asulfuric acid1 aKawabata, Yuta1 aMatsuda, Masaki1 aSumimoto, Michinori1 aIshikawa, Hayato1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3884-25830 tOrganic letters.g2018 Apr. 13, v. 20, no. 9 p.2534-2537dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.8b006823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245010600217500001900323520102500342592002801367650001901395650001401414650001601428650001201444650002501456650001601481650001401497700001801511700002201529700001801551700002001569773011101589856008601700852000901786655001201795IND60699552520221120075232.0200809e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069955252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2020.1047892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhikari, Bhaskar Mani1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5709-608010aImpact of incorporation of CO2 on the melting, texture and sensory attributes of soft-serve ice cream  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effect of CO₂ dissolution (2000 ppm) on the churning, melting, textural, and sensory properties of soft-serve ice cream was investigated. Ultrasound vibration was applied before churning through a transducer flanged beneath the ice cream mix vessel (at 5 °C) to create CO₂ micro/nanobubbles in the carbonated samples. The ice cream mix (28.5% total solids) with 2000 ppm CO₂ and 60 s ultrasound treatment displayed significantly higher overrun values (∼88%) than the controls (no treatments ∼26%; sonicated only ∼46%). The churning time for the carbonated samples (∼52 min) was much lower than the non-carbonated samples (∼65 min). The melting rate of carbonated soft-serve (∼1.5 g min⁻¹) was lower than that of the untreated ice cream (2.43 g min⁻¹). The carbonated and sonicated soft-serve was the softest among all. Evaluation by a consumer panel showed that soft-serve churned with dissolved CO₂ and ultrasound treatment significantly improved the overall sensory properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aice cream 3ananobubbles 3atexture 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3avibration1 aTruong, Tuyen1 aPrakash, Sangeeta1 aBansal, Nidhi1 aBhandari, Bhesh0 tInternational dairy journal.g2020 Oct., v. 109 p.104789-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2020.1047893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01534naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245008200165300001800247520046600265592002800731650001000759650001400769650002300783650002100806650002300827650002200850650001400872650002100886700001900907700005800926773012000984856008301104852000901187655001201196IND60608381620221119214400.0180807e20180418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060838162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b006922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Zhi-Ji10aHighly Selective Pd-Catalyzed Direct C–F Bond Arylation of Polyfluoroarenes  ap. 2543-2546.  aA directing-group-free palladium-catalyzed direct arylation of simple polyfluoroarenes with arylboronic acids through selective C–F bond activation is described.

Continuous operation of MBfR further confirmed that higher solubilized hydrogen was favorably affecting acetate and ethanol titer and rate, and methane purity. Moreover, by retaining biomass on the outer surface of hollow fiber, the highest biogas purity (96.7%) and acetate and ethanol production rates (37.8 and 13.5 mmol L⁻¹d⁻¹) were achieved at a hydraulic retention time of 2.0 d. Meanwhile, the CO₂ and hydrogen conversion efficiency reached to the maximum of 93.8% and 98.1%, respectively.

Extracellular polymeric substances increased from 149.5 to 387.7 mg/g VSS after salinity (0.75 wt%) treatment, in turn accelerating granulation. Partial nitrification was maintained under the salinity condition due to the relative high activity and abundance of AOB, and the observed nitrite accumulation ratio averaged 98.9%. Salinity favored glycogen-accumulating organisms over polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs)/denitrifying-PAOs, with the abundance of Candidatus_Competibacter increasing from 4.86% to 15.34% and the simultaneous partial nitrification–denitrification efficiency increasing from 74.4% to 91.1%, promoting N-removal potential.

However, traditional biological approach can hardly meet the standard due to the short hydraulic retention time (HRT) and nitrite accumulation. A Membrane Electro-Bioreactor (MEBR) was developed for ammonia removal enhancement and in-situ electrochemical membrane fouling mitigation. The fouling mechanism was first found to proceed via the standard filtration model. The flux decrease was mainly caused by an internal pore clogging phenomenon. Membrane fouling resistance was enhanced by increasing anode potential from 0 to 1.4 V vs. SCE (Saturated Calomel Electrode).

Aiming to identify the best condition which maximized liquid yield, the effects of operational conditions mass load, temperature, and heating rate were evaluated using Experimental Design and Response Surface Methodology techniques and optimized with Differential Evolution methodology. The composition of liquid fraction was analyzed by GC–MS and the effect of the same operational conditions in nitrogenous compounds formation was analyzed. The separation of nitrogenous compounds was evaluated by extraction and adsorption techniques. The results indicated that the heating rate significantly impacted both the liquid yield and the formation of the nitrogenous compounds. At optimal conditions, a maximum liquid yield of 64.59% was obtained. The extraction and adsorption processes showed to be promising routes for the purification of nitrogenous compounds, however, extraction was more selective to separate them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrospira platensis 3aadsorption 3aexperimental design 3aliquids 3amicroalgae 3apyrolysis 3aresponse surface methodology 3atechnology 3atemperature 0aFine chemistry 0aBio-oil 0aHeterocyclic compounds 0aExtraction1 aAlonso, C.G.1 aLeal, W.G.O.1 aSchultz, E.L.1 aAndrade, L.A.1 aOstroski, I.C.0 tBioresource technology.g2020 Oct., v. 313 p.123709-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1237093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005800152245018800210500001900398520135000417592002801767650002201795650001301817650001201830650002301842650002101865650001201886650001101898650001801909650001101927650001901938650002101957650001501978650001601993650002502009653002402034653002802058653002702086653002002113653002502133653003102158700006102189700002002250700001902270700001902289700001602308773010702324856008702431852000902518655001202527IND60699556920221121061111.0200726e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069955692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1056212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Kiat Moon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1126-965710aSynergistic ultrasound-assisted organosolv pretreatment of oil palm empty fruit bunches for enhanced enzymatic saccharification: An optimization study using artificial neural networks  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe efficiency of ultrasonic-assisted organosolv in pretreating oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) was investigated in this study. The effect of temperature, time, sonication power, ethanol concentration and presence of different types of catalysts were examined. The ultrasonic-assisted organosolv pretreatment was found to be significantly affected by temperature, time and sonication power. These parameters were further subjected to process optimization study using Leverburgh Marquee artificial neural networks (ANNs). An empirical model with good predictive accuracies (R-squared value of 0.9084) was generated. From the morphology study, pretreated EFB showed significant structural disruption through the breakage of hemicellulose and lignin bonds, leading to the enhancement of enzymatic saccharification. A maximum reducing sugars of 356 mg/g biomass (7.12 g/L) was obtained at optimized conditions of 48.2 °C, 30 min and 55% (192.5 W) sonication power. The relatively high yield of reducing sugars associated with lower lignin content compared to raw EFB also suggested the effectiveness of ultrasonic-assisted organosolv in pretreating EFB. Therefore, this synergistic approach could pave the way for a more efficient and cost-effective pretreatment process for the production of various bioproducts and biofuels in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acost effectiveness 3aempirical models 3aethanol 3afruits 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3alignin content 3asaccharification 3asonication 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment 0aEmpty fruit bunches 0aOrganosolv pretreatment 0aUltrasound irradiation 0aDelignification 0aProcess optimization 0aArtificial neural networks1 aZanil, Mohd Fauzi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3744-29591 aChan, Kok Keong1 aChin, Zhi Ping1 aLiu, Yee Chian1 aLim, Steven0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2020 Aug., v. 139 p.105621-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1056213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245014900182520145500331592002801786650001001814650002201824650002601846650001501872650001701887650001601904650001401920650001901934650001601953650001801969650001501987650001002002651001002012653002702022653002002049653001502069653002302084653001602107700001702123700005602140700001602196773011102212856008602323852000902409655001202418IND60699557720221121061146.0220103e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069955772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1094432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez-Gamboa, Gastón10aOenological potential and health benefits of Chinese non-Vitis vinifera species: An opportunity to the revalorization and to breed new varieties  aThe wine industry is focused on the producing wine mostly from European grapevine varieties (Vitis vinifera L.). China has experienced a significant growth of the vineyard surface, based on the cultivation of these grapevine varieties. Currently, China has become one of the countries with the largest surface of planted vineyards in the world. In the last years, there has been a trend to oenologically and viticulturally revalorize certain autochthonous grapevine species. China holds a great diversity of Vitis species, which are being the focus of study. This could be an important alternative for the diversification of wine production, providing new products with a strong identity. Additionally, the varietal homogenization has increased the vineyard genetic vulnerability in relation to the emergence of grapevine diseases and their resistance to chemical fungicides. In this way, non-Vitis vinifera species are characterized by having a high resistance to a wide range of biotic and abiotic factors, which can bring an opportunity to breed new varieties. However, there is little available information about the oenological potential of these species, which makes it a current interesting topic. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the oenological potential of non-Vitis vinifera species found in China, discussing their potential effects on human health and thus, to propose some Chinese wild grapes for their use in breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3abreeding programs 3aenvironmental factors 3afungicides 3anew products 3anew variety 3avineyards 3awild relatives 3awine grapes 3awine industry 3awinemaking 3awines 3aChina 0aHybrid Vitis varieties 0aVitis amurensis 0aV. davidii 0aV. quinquangularis 0aV. vinifera1 aLiu, Shu-Yan1 aSun, XiangYu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3417-93231 aFang, Yulin0 tFood research international.g2020 Nov., v. 137 p.109443-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1094433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01664naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245016300169300001800332520053700350592002800887650001500915650001100930650001400941650002300955650002300978650002101001650002201022650001901044700006301063773012001126856008301246852000901329655001201338IND60608386520221121220259.0180807e20180417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060838652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b008142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChennaiah, Ande10aOne-Step TEMPO-Catalyzed and Water-Mediated Stereoselective Conversion of Glycals into 2-Azido-2-deoxysugars with a PIFA–Trimethylsilyl Azide Reagent System  ap. 2611-2614.  aAn unprecedented water-mediated and TEMPO-catalyzed, one-step, highly regiospecific and stereoselective functionalization of glycals to 2-azido-2-deoxysugars has been developed using a PIFA–Me₃SiN₃ reagent system in the presence of Bu₄NHSO₄ as a phase-transfer catalyst.

The nitrogen removal efficiency and the microbial community composition in the bioreactor were investigated. The results showed that the aged refuse bioreactor removed more than 90 % of total nitrogen in the leachate under the nitrogen loading rate (NLR) of 0.74 g/kg (vs) day, and the total nitrogen removal rate decreased to 62.2 % when NLR increased up to 2.03 g/kg (vs) day. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed that the average cell number of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in the bioreactor was 1.58 × 10(8) cells/g, which accounted for 0.41 % of total bacteria. The number of anammox bacteria in the reactor was 1.09 × 10(8) cells/g, which accounted for 0.27 % of total bacteria. Isotopic (15)N tracing experiments showed that nearly 10 % of nitrogen was removed by anammox. High-throughout 454 pyrosequencing revealed that the predominant bacteria in the bioreactor were Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Gemmatimonadetes, including various nitrifiers and denitrifiers with diverse heterotrophic and autotrophic metabolic pathways, supporting that nitrogen was removed through different pathways in this aged refuse bioreactor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aProteobacteria 3abacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3abioreactors 3acommunity structure 3alandfill leachates 3amicrobial communities 3amunicipal solid waste 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aAmmoniaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBacteriaxchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNitrogenxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aWaste Disposal Facilities 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aLv, Zhuo1 aHu, Chong1 aYang, Xuezhi1 aLi, Xiangzhen0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2013 Oct., v. 97, no. 20 p.9225-9234dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-012-4623-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100002300191245008000214300001600294500001900310506007600329506003100405520098200436592002801418596007501446596010101521596004401622596004401666596004501710596006701755596007101822506003701893650001701930650001601947650001701963650001701980650001101997650001302008650002102021650000902042650001902051700001102070700001402081700002702095700002602122700001602148700002402164700001102188700002802199700002402227700002702251773012502278856008502403852000902488655001202497IND60699559620221207102938.0200913e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069955962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.06.0092chorus7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonilla-Bird, N.J.10aEffect of copper oxide nanoparticles on two varieties of sweetpotato plants  ap. 277-286.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aLittle information is available on the interaction of CuO nanoparticles (nCuO) with tuberous roots. In this study, Beauregard-14 (B-14, low lignin) and Covington (COV, high lignin) sweetpotato varieties were cultivated until maturity in soil amended with nCuO, bulk copper oxide (bCuO) and CuCl2 at 25–125 mg/kg. The Cu treatments had no significant influence on chlorophyll content. Gas exchange parameters were not affected in B-14. In COV, however, at 125 mg/kg treatments, bCuO reduced the intercellular CO2 (11%), while CuCl2 increased it by 7%, compared with control (p ≤ 0.035). At 25 mg/kg nCuO increased the length of COV roots (20.7 ± 2.0 cm vs. 14.6 ± 0.8 cm, p ≤ 0.05). In periderm of B-14, nCuO, at 125 mg/kg, increased Mg by 232%, while the equivalent concentration of CuCl2 reduced P by 410%, compared with control (p ≤ 0.05). The data suggest the potential application of nCuO as nanofertilizer for sweetpotato storage root production.  aPublisher supplied data  cEnvironmental Protection Agencydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001589  cNational Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparitiesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006545  cNIHdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUniversity of Texas Systemdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007130  cUniversity of Texas at El Pasodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000113490 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochemistry 3achlorophyll 3acupric oxide 3agas exchange 3alignin 3aperiderm 3aplant physiology 3asoil 3asweet potatoes1 aYe, Y.1 aAkter, T.1 aValdes-Bracamontes, C.1 aDarrouzet-Nardi, A.J.1 aSaupe, G.B.1 aFlores-Marges, J.P.1 aMa, L.1 aHernandez-Viezcas, J.A.1 aPeralta-Videa, J.R.1 aGardea-Torresdey, J.L.0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2020 Sept., v. 154 p.277-286dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012700167300001600294500001900310520133900329592002801668650002401696650001201720650001201732650001601744650002001760650002301780650001901803650001201822650002001834650002101854650001901875650003801894650001401932650002501946650001301971653001701984653001902001700001802020700001702038700001902055773012502074856008502199852000902284655001202293IND60699560120221119102257.0200913e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069956012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Minling10aFoliar graphene oxide treatment increases photosynthetic capacity and reduces oxidative stress in cadmium-stressed lettuce  ap. 287-294.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe application of graphene oxide (GO) in the environment can have a positive or negative effect on the toxicity of pollutants, but the effect of GO on cadmium (Cd²⁺)-stressed lettuce has not yet been thoroughly studied. Therefore, we assessed the potential effects of foliar GO sprays on photosynthesis and antioxidant systems in Cd-stressed lettuce. We found that the foliar application of 30 mg L⁻¹ of GO could significantly reduce signs of Cd²⁺ toxicity in lettuce. We observed increased net photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance, transpiration rates, chlorophyll content, primary maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, actual quantum yield, photosynthetic electron transport rates, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase and oxygenase concentrations, and biomass in Cd²⁺-stressed lettuce treated with GO. In addition, the foliar application of 30 mg L⁻¹ of GO reduced the accumulation of the reactive oxygen species O·̄₂ and H₂O₂, malondialdehyde content, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The decreased antioxidant enzyme activity could have been due to the decrease in reactive oxygen species. Cd²⁺ pollution is highly destructive to agricultural products, and the foliar application of GO provides a new potential tactic to improve the tolerance of plants to heavy metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abiomass 3acadmium 3achlorophyll 3aenzyme activity 3afoliar application 3agraphene oxide 3alettuce 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosynthetic electron transport 3apollution 3astomatal conductance 3atoxicity 0aAntioxidants 0aPhotosynthesis1 aChang, Xipeng1 aYang, Yujuan1 aSong, Zhengguo0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2020 Sept., v. 154 p.287-294dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01456naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245006000167300001800227520045800245592002800703650002300731650002300754650001500777650001600792700001900808700005900827700005500886773012100941856008301062852000901145655001201154IND60608388920221119214616.0180807e20180416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060838892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b008732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoguchi, Yuka10aTotal Synthesis of Selligueain A, a Sweet Flavan Trimer  ap. 2857-2861.  aThe first total synthesis of selligueain A (4), a plant-derived sweet polyphenol, has been achieved.

By using mitochondrial markers (16S and COI) we examined the temporal variation of populations in Cadiz Bay, Spain (hotspot for introductions in Europe) in between 2010 and 2017; as well as their linkage with foreign populations in its native and introduced distribution ranges. Cadiz Bay populations exhibited a connection with several European introduced populations (Iberian Peninsula, Canary Islands, Mediterranean Sea and The Netherlands), eastern USA, Sea of Japan and Australia. We found no evidence to support a Brazilian origin (one potential native area) of the Iberian Peninsula populations. We identified a progressive decrease in haplotype diversity and a low connectivity at the end of the monitoring period in one of the stations. Human-mediated changes in propagule pressure, and unfavorable environmental fluctuations are probably responsible for this. Meanwhile, populations in Cadiz Bay count on numerous foreign donors that could easily refuel the propagule input by exchanging gene flow. This implies that a vector regulation strategy has the potential of compromising the success of established non-native populations, which usually undergo vulnerability periods due to the challenging conditions of marinas. The use of molecular tools in a time series approach is then useful to identify the ideal time window to put in action management measures so that they are cost-effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaprella 3acost effectiveness 3aevolution 3agene flow 3ageographical distribution 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondria 3aresearch 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis 3aAustralia 3aEastern United States 3aIberian Peninsula 3aMediterranean Sea 3aNetherlands 3aSea of Japan 3aSpain 0aGenetic monitoring 0aRecreational boating 0aVector regulation 0aPropagule pressure 0aMarinas 0aVulnerability window1 aRos, M.1 aGuerra-García, J.M.1 aFaasse, M.1 aSantos, A.M.1 aCabezas, M.P.0 tMarine environmental research.g2021 Apr., v. 166 p.105266-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2021.1052663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245012800165300002000293520141400313592002801727650001301755650001101768650002801779650001401807650001701821650001601838650002301854650001201877650002201889700002501911700001301936700002001949700001401969700002101983773013402004856007802138852000902216655001202225IND60584552620221122233452.0171025e20171025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058455262DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b071212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurrows, Lauren
C.10aComputationally Guided Catalyst Design in the Type I Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Pauson–Khand Reaction of Allenyl Acetates  ap. 15022-15032.  aThe Rh(I)-catalyzed allenic Pauson–Khand reaction (APKR) is an efficient, redox-neutral method of synthesizing α-acyloxy cyclopentenones. An enantioselective APKR could provide access to chiral, nonracemic α-acyloxy and α-hydroxy cyclopentenones and their corresponding redox derivatives, such as thapsigargin, a cytotoxic natural product with potent antitumor activity. Rapid scrambling of axial chirality of allenyl acetates in the presence of Rh(I) catalysts enables the conversion of racemic allene to enantiopure cyclopentenone product in a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT). A combined experimental and computational approach was taken to develop an effective catalytic system to achieve the asymmetric transformation. The optimization of the denticity, and steric and electronic properties of the ancillary ligand (initially (S)-MonoPhos, 58:42 er), afforded a hemilabile bidentate (S)-MonoPhos-alkene-Rh(I) catalyst that provided α-acyloxy cyclopentenone product in up to 14:86 er. Enantioselectivity of the Rh(I)-(S)-MonoPhos-alkene catalyst was rationalized using ligand-substrate steric interactions and distortion energies in the computed transition states. This asymmetric APKR of allenyl acetates is a rare example of a Type I DyKAT reaction of an allene, the first example of DyKAT in a cyclocarbonylation reaction, and the first catalyst-controlled enantioselective APKR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aallene 3aantineoplastic activity 3acatalysts 3acytotoxicity 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3aligands 3aoptical isomerism1 aJesikiewicz, Luke T.1 aLu, Gang1 aGeib, Steven J.1 aLiu, Peng1 aBrummond, Kay M.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Oct. 25, v. 139, no. 42 p.15022-15032dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b071213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245016300160300001800323520116700341592002801508650002201536650002101558650001501579650001501594650002501609650001301634650001201647650002001659650001901679650002301698650000701721650002301728650001601751700001901767700001901786773010701805856008101912990002301993852000902016655001202025IND60093010920221119053456.0141103e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009301092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGobi, K.10aAdsorptive removal of Methylene Blue using novel adsorbent from palm oil mill effluent waste activated sludge: Equilibrium, thermodynamics and kinetic studies  ap. 1246-1252.  aWaste activated sludge (WAS) from palm oil mill effluent (POME) treatment plant was used to adsorb Methylene Blue (MB) in a batch system. The WAS was prepared at lower temperature compared to the previous studies. Parameters such as initial MB concentration, pH, and temperature were studied for their effects on the adsorption process. Results showed that the uptake of MB increased with an increase in both the initial MB concentration and the pH, and decreased with an increase in temperature. Both the Langmuir and the Freundlich Isotherms are fit to explain the MB adsorption on WAS. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of WAS was found to be 66.23mg/g at 30°C. The kinetic data for this study fit well the pseudo-second-order kinetic with a R² more than 0.95. Thermodynamic analysis was performed by evaluating the Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG°), enthalpy (ΔH°), and entropy (ΔS°) of the process. The evaluation showed that the MB adsorption process onto WAS is an exothermic process and is spontaneous in nature. Hence, this work reveals that the use of POME WAS is an innovative application of a local waste product as an adsorbent for MB removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aactivated sludge 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3achemical engineering 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aheat production 3amethylene blue 3aoil mill effluents 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature1 aMashitah, M.D.1 aVadivelu, V.M.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 July 15, v. 171, no. 3 p.1246-1252dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245014900210500001900359520182600378592002802204650001702232650001402249650001002263650001902273651002202292653001802314653002002332653002202352653001802374653003202392700001502424700002802439700001902467773009802486856008502584852000902669655001202678IND60726628320221119152635.0210527e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072662832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2021.1023902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelobonye, Keone1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6652-626210aAssessing the potential of an effective density-based measure against accessibility models for evaluation and prioritisation of activity centres  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWhile the debate around monocentric versus polycentric urban structures persists, a growing number of traditionally monocentric cities are pursuing a transformation agenda towards the polycentric structure. The decisions of locating and prioritising the additional centres is often based on an accessibility score, leaving out other essential factors such as the spatial variations of labour density and agglomeration externalities. This paper conducts an empirical investigation on the suitability of accessibility measures in identifying, evaluating and prioritising metropolitan activity centres (ACs), and proposes an effective density-based measure for the purpose. The proposed effective job/labour density measure integrates both a proximity dimension and a scale/size dimension, and is therefore more comprehensive than the accessibility measure. The two measures (accessibility and effective density) are applied to a case study of strategic-level ACs in the metropolitan region of Perth, Western Australia, and ACs are ranked based on their separate accessibility and effective density scores. Generally, the ACs performed poorly under both measures, with many non-AC zones having much better accessibility and effective job/labour density scores (than those designated as ACs). Nevertheless, the results show that the two measures produce markedly different ranking/prioritisation outcomes, suggesting that studies or policies that merely rely on the accessibility measure to make AC prioritisation (or exclusion) decisions could be misleading. By virtue of being more comprehensive with an integration of proximity and scale dimensions, and the ability to estimate economic agglomeration, the proposed effective density measure is, argued to be better suited and more reliable than a mere accessibility score.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ageography 3alabor 3aprioritization 3aWestern Australia 0aAccessibility 0aActivity centre 0aEffective density 0aAgglomeration 0aEmployment decentralisation1 aZhou, Heng1 aXia, Jianhong (Cecilia)1 aMcCarney, Gary0 tApplied geography.g2021 Mar., v. 128 p.102390-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2021.1023903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011900167300001800286520091100304592002801215650001101243650001401254650002501268650001101293650001201304650002301316650001301339650002401352650001101376650001401387650001001401650001601411700001701427700001901444773010701463856008101570990002301651852000901674655001201683IND60093011320221119004210.0141103e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009301132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzkan, Göksel10aActive carbon-supported Ni, Ni/Cu and Ni/Cu/Pd catalysed steam reforming of ethanol for the production of hydrogen  ap. 1270-1275.  aThis work aims at producing hydrogen from ethanol using active carbon-supported nickel based catalysts. Steam reforming of ethanol is carried out in a tubular reactor at a temperature range of 150–700°C using nickel, nickel/copper and nickel/copper/palladium catalysts supported with active carbon. The selectivity values towards hydrogen obtained from the reactions using the different catalysts are compared. The results show that the selectivity of all the catalysts studied towards hydrogen increases with increase in temperature up to the temperature of 450°C and the active carbon-supported Ni/Cu/Pd catalyst gives the highest selectivity towards hydrogen. Beyond this temperature, the selectivity values of the catalyst containing palladium continue to decrease. It is concluded that the highest selectivity of hydrogen is given by the catalyst containing palladium at the temperature of 450°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3achemical engineering 3acopper 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3anickel 3apalladium 3asteam 3atemperature1 aGök, Serdar1 aÖzkan, Gülay0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 July 15, v. 171, no. 3 p.1270-1275dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.0513Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03945naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245011900155300002000274520274500294592002803039650001603067650001603083650001703099650001103116650002503127650001503152650001303167650001703180700001603197700001303213700001603226700002403242700001603266700002203282700002203304773013403326856007803460852000903538655001203547IND60584553220180904000000.0171025e20171025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058455322DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b075122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Lili10aDirect Detection of the Open-Shell Singlet Phenyloxenium Ion: An Atom-Centered Diradical Reacts as an Electrophile  ap. 15054-15059.  aA new photoprecursor to the phenyloxenium ion, 4-methoxyphenoxypyridinium tetrafluoroborate, was investigated using trapping studies, product analysis, computational investigations, and laser flash photolysis experiments ranging from the femtosecond to the millisecond time scale. These experiments allowed us to trace the complete arc of the photophysics and photochemistry of this photoprecursor beginning with the initially populated excited states to its sequential formation of transient intermediates and ultimate formation of stable photoproducts. We find that the excited state of the photoprecursor undergoes heterolysis to generate the phenyloxenium ion in ∼2 ps but surprisingly generates the ion in its open-shell singlet diradical configuration (¹A₂), permitting an unexpected look at the reactivity of an atom-centered open-shell singlet diradical. The open-shell phenyloxenium ion (¹A₂) has a much shorter lifetime (τ ∼ 0.2 ns) in acetonitrile than the previously observed closed-shell singlet (¹A₁) phenyloxenium ion (τ ∼ 5 ns). Remarkably, despite possessing no empty valence orbitals, this open-shell singlet oxenium ion behaves as an even more powerful electrophile than the closed-shell singlet oxenium ion, undergoing solvent trapping by weakly nucleophilic solvents such as water and acetonitrile or externally added nucleophiles (e.g., azide) rather than engaging in typical diradical chemistry, such as H atom abstraction, which we have previously observed for a triplet oxenium ion. In acetonitrile, the open-shell singlet oxenium ion is trapped to generate ortho and para Ritter intermediates, one of which (para) is directly observed as a longer-lived species (τ ∼ 0.1 ms) in time-resolved resonance Raman experiments. The Ritter intermediates are ultimately trapped by either the 4-methoxypyridine leaving group (in the case of para addition) or trapped internally via an essentially barrierless rearrangement (in the case of ortho addition) to generate a cyclized product. The expectation that singlet diradicals react similarly to triplet or uncoupled diradicals needs to be reconsidered, as a recent study by Perrin and Reyes-Rodríguez (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014, 136, 15263) suggested the unsettling possibility that singlet p-benzyne could suffer nucleophilic attack to generate a naked phenyl anion. Now, this study provides direct spectroscopic observation of this phenomenon, with an atom-centered open-shell singlet diradical reacting as a powerful electrophile. To the question of whether a nucleophile can attack a singly occupied molecular orbital, the answer is apparently yes, at least if another partially occupied orbital is available to avoid violation of the rules of valence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aLewis bases 3aacetonitrile 3aazides 3aheterolytic cleavage 3aphotolysis 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy1 aQiu, Yunfan1 aLan, Xin1 aZhu, Ruixue1 aPhillips, David Lee1 aLi, Ming-De1 aDutton, Andrew S.1 aWinter, Arthur H.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Oct. 25, v. 139, no. 42 p.15054-15059dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b075123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010200171300001800273520116300291592002801454650001501482650001501497650002201512650001201534650002501546650001301571650001101584650000701595650002301602650001601625700002501641700001801666700002301684773010701707856008101814990002301895852000901918655001201927IND60093012120221119004145.0141103e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009301212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.04.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGranados-Correa, F.10aComparison of the Cd(II) adsorption processes between boehmite (γ-AlOOH) and goethite (α-FeOOH)  ap. 1027-1034.  aBoehmite and goethite were synthesized and characterized to compare their adsorptive properties for Cd(II) from aqueous solutions. The influences of different parameters, such as contact time, initial cadmium concentration, pH and temperature, on the adsorption processes were investigated. It was found that the Cd(II) adsorption on boehmite was higher than that for goethite, according to the adsorption isotherms. Kinetic studies also showed that the relative adsorption rate of boehmite was similar to that of goethite, and the adsorption processes was described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. In both cases, equilibrium was reached within 24h, and the uptake was affected by intraparticle diffusion. Furthermore, the Cd(II) adsorption behaviors on both of the oxy-hydroxide adsorbents were described reasonably well by the Freundlich isotherm model. For both adsorbents, the Cd(II) adsorption was maximized with basic pH values and was negligible with acid pH values when equilibrium was reached. Lastly, the thermodynamic parameters (ΔH⁰, ΔG⁰ and ΔS⁰) showed that Cd(II) adsorption by both materials was endothermic and spontaneous.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acadmium 3achemical engineering 3agoethite 3amodels 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature1 aCorral-Capulin, N.G.1 aOlguín, M.T.1 aAcosta-León, C.E.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 July 15, v. 171, no. 3 p.1027-1034dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.04.0553Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245019300165300001800358520098300376592002801359650002101387650000801408650001201416650001201428650001401440650002501454650002501479650001301504650001901517650001301536650001801549650001201567650001601579700002801595773010701623856008101730990002301811852000901834655001201843IND60093012320221119004551.0141103e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009301232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalaika, Anna10aModification of activated carbon with different agents and catalytic performance of products obtained in the process of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation coupled with nitrobenzene hydrogenation  ap. 1348-1355.  aCoupling of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with nitrobenzene hydrogenation (ODE-N), over activated carbons catalysts, has been investigated.

An assay has been developed for quantitative analysis of cellular polySia expression. This was achieved by extracting and purifying released polySia from glycoproteins by mild acid hydrolysis and optimised organic extraction. The polySia was further hydrolysed into Sia monomers, followed by fluorescent labelling and quantitative analysis. The assay was qualified utilising endoneuraminidase-NF to remove polySia from the surface of C6-ST8SiaII cancer cells (EC₅₀ = 2.13 ng/mL). The result was comparable to that obtained in a polySia-specific cellular ELISA assay. Furthermore, the assay proved suitable for evaluation of changes in polySia expression following treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of polysialylation. Given the importance of polySia in multiple disease states, notably cancer, this is a potentially vital tool with applications in the fields of drug discovery and glycobiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid hydrolysis 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3aglycomics 3aglycoproteins 3apolysaccharides 3aprognosis 3aquantitative analysis 3asialic acid 0aPolysialic acid 0aSialic acid 0aQuantitative analysis 0aCell-based method 0aInhibitor screening1 aElkashef, Sara M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6438-01161 aPatel, Anjana1 aRibeiro Morais, Goreti1 aShnyder, Steven D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4647-23401 aLoadman, Paul M.1 aPatterson, Laurence H.1 aFalconer, Robert A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6426-44300 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 May 01, v. 259 p.117741-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1177413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013800166520113700304592002801441650001501469650001801484650002101502650001801523650002201541650001501563650001901578650000901597650000701606650001301613650001601626650001501642650001701657650001501674650001601689653003001705653002201735653003201757653002401789653002501813700002001838700001301858700001801871700005601889700001701945700001801962773010701980856008602087852000902173655001202182IND60726629920221119152705.0220606e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072662992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1177502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xin10aSuperhydrophobic cellulose acetate/multiwalled carbon nanotube monolith with fiber cluster network for selective oil/water separation  aPorous cellulose acetate/carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CA/OMWNTs) monolith with superhydrophobicity (155°) and superoleophilicity (∼0°) was first prepared using a facile and green phase separation method.

Besides, the CA/OMWNTs monolith also could continuously and rapidly separate oils/organic solvents from oil/water mixtures via a simple and home-made pump-assisted adsorption device, showing potential application in large-area remediation of oily wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon nanotubes 3acarboxylation 3acellulose acetate 3adurability 3ahydrophobicity 3aoils 3apH 3aporosity 3aremediation 3aseparation 3asurface area 3awastewater 3awettability 0aPorous composite monolith 0aCellulose acetate 0aMultiwalled carbon nanotube 0aSuperhydrophobicity 0aOil/water separation1 aWang, Bingzhong1 aWang, Bo1 aFeng, Yuezhan1 aHan, Wenjuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0137-10411 aLiu, Chuntai1 aShen, Changyu0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 May 01, v. 259 p.117750-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1177503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245006800159300002000227520099900247592002801246650002101274650002101295650001501316650000901331700002001340700001801360700002301378700002801401700001601429700002401445773013401469856007801603852000901681655001201690IND60584554620221121231339.0171025e20171025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058455462DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b083702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZang, Yaping10aElectronically Transparent Au–N Bonds for Molecular Junctions  ap. 14845-14848.  aWe report a series of single-molecule transport measurements carried out in an ionic environment with oligophenylenediamine wires. These molecules exhibit three discrete conducting states accessed by electrochemically modifying the contacts. Transport in these junctions is defined by the oligophenylene backbone, but the conductance is increased by factors of ∼20 and ∼400 when compared to traditional dative junctions. We propose that the higher-conducting states arise from in situ electrochemical conversion of the dative Au←N bond into a new type of Au–N contact. Density functional theory-based transport calculations establish that the new contacts dramatically increase the electronic coupling of the oligophenylene backbone to the Au electrodes, consistent with experimental transport data. The resulting contact resistance is the lowest reported to date; more generally, our work demonstrates a facile method for creating electronically transparent metal–organic interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold1 aPinkard, Andrew1 aLiu, Zhen-Fei1 aNeaton, Jeffrey B.1 aSteigerwald, Michael L.1 aRoy, Xavier1 aVenkataraman, Latha0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Oct. 25, v. 139, no. 42 p.14845-14848dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b083703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245015700160300002000317520140400337592002801741650002201769650002401791650001201815650001401827650001401841650001301855650001401868650001101882650001301893650002201906700001301928700001701941700001701958700001401975700001901989773013402008856007802142852000902220655001202229IND60584555420221122034532.0171025e20171025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058455542DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b085792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCong, Xuefeng10aLow-Valent, High-Spin Chromium-Catalyzed Cleavage of Aromatic Carbon–Nitrogen Bonds at Room Temperature: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study  ap. 15182-15190.  aThe cleavage of aromatic carbon–nitrogen bonds catalyzed by transition metals is of high synthetic interest because such bonds are common in organic chemistry. However, few metal catalysts can be used to selectively break C(aryl)–N bonds in electronically neutral molecules. We report here the first low-valent, high-spin chromium-catalyzed cleavage of C(aryl)–N bonds in electronically neutral aniline derivatives at room temperature. By using simple and inexpensive chromium(II) chloride as precatalyst, accompanied by an imino auxiliary, the selective arylative and alkylative C–C coupling of C(aryl)–N bonds can be achieved. Crossover experiments indicate that a low-valent chromium species, formed in situ by reduction of CrCl₂ with Grignard reagent, is responsible for the catalytic cleavage of C(aryl)–N bonds. DFT calculations show that facile insertion of the C(aryl)–N bond by chromium(0) can take place in a high-spin quintet (S = 2) ground state, whereas the lower-spin singlet (S = 0) and triplet (S = 1) states are inaccessible in energy. It was found that both donation of the sole paired d electrons in the d⁶ shell of high-spin chromium(0) to the antibonding orbital of the C(aryl)–N bond and the nitrogen ligating interaction to the metal center with its lone pair play important roles in the cleavage of the C(aryl)–N bond by the zerovalent chromium species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGrignard reagents 3aambient temperature 3aaniline 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3achromium 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3anitrogen 3aorganic chemistry1 aFan, Fei1 aMa, Pengchen1 aLuo, Meiming1 aChen, Hui1 aZeng, Xiaoming0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Oct. 25, v. 139, no. 42 p.15182-15190dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b085793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02267naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013700163500001900300520108400319592002801403650002701431650001601458650001501474650001501489650001501504650001301519650001301532650000901545653002201554653002101576653002601597653001901623700001501642700001201657773012101669856008201790852000901872655001201881IND60726631020221119202144.0210322e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072663102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2021.1040372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Han-jie12aA deep-sea pathogenic Bacillus subtilis isolate employs different strategies to escape the killing of teleost and murine complements  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis G7 was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent and is pathogenic to pathogenic to fish (Japanese flounder) and mice. G7 is able to survive in host sera and phagocytes. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanism of G7 serum resistance. We found that (i) the remaining complement activity was very low in G7-incubated flounder serum but high in G7-incubated mouse serum; (ii) cleaved C3 and C5 components were detected on flounder serum-incubated G7 but not on mouse serum-incubated G7; (iii) abundant uncleaved C5 was localized in G7-incubated mouse, but not flounder, serum; (iv) G7-incubated flounder, but not mouse, serum exhibited strong chemotactic activity; (v) pre-treatment with low-dose lysozyme abolished the serum resistance of G7. Hence, G7 activates flounder complement but is protected from complement-mediated destruction by its cell wall structure, while G7 prevents the activation of mouse complement. These results indicate that G7 employs different mechanisms to avoid the complement killing of different hosts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3ablood serum 3acell walls 3achemotaxis 3acomplement 3aflounder 3alysozyme 3amice 0aBacillus subtilis 0aSerum resistance 0aComplement activation 0aImmune evasion1 aLi, Mo-fei1 aSun, Li0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2021 June, v. 119 p.104037-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2021.1040373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03852naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245018300214520218700397592002802584650001102612650001702623650001502640650002402655650002102679650001302700650001302713650002002726650003102746650001102777650001702788650002002805650001702825650002002842650002202862650001802884653002702902653001102929653003202940653003302972653002103005653002003026653001203046653000803058700006003066773012603126856008503252852000903337655001203346IND60726631520221119202036.0220205e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072663152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2021.1101952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Kaori Uchiumi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1943-110210aDifferential gene expression and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage cells from horses with mild/moderate neutrophilic or mastocytic inflammation on BAL cytology  aMild to moderate equine asthma syndrome (mEAS) affects horses of all ages and breeds. To date, the etiology and pathophysiology of mEAS are active areas of research, and it remains incompletely understood whether mEAS horses with different immune cell ‘signatures’ on BAL cytology represent different phenotypes, distinct pathobiological mechanisms (endotypes), varied environmental conditions, disease severity, genetic predispositions, or all of the above. In this descriptive study, we compared gene expression data from BAL cells isolated from horses with normal BALF cytology (n = 5), to those isolated from horses with mild/moderate neutrophilic inflammation (n = 5), or mild/moderate mastocytic inflammation (n = 5). BAL cell protein lysates were analyzed for cytokine/chemokine levels using Multiplex Bead Immunoassay, and for select proteins using immunoblot. The transcriptome, determined by RNA-seq and analyzed with DEseq2, contained 20, 63, and 102 significantly differentially expressed genes in horses with normal vs. neutrophilic, normal vs. mastocytic, and neutrophilic vs. mastocytic BALF cytology, respectively. Pathway analyses revealed that BAL-isolated cells from horses with neutrophilic vs. normal cytology showed enrichment in inflammation pathways, and horses with mastocytic vs. normal cytology showed enrichment in pathways involved in fibrosis and allergic reaction. BAL cells from horses with mastocytic mEAS, compared to neutrophilic mEAS, showed enrichment in pathways involved in alteration of tissue structures. Cytokine analysis determined that IL-1β was significantly different in the lysates from horses with neutrophilic inflammation compared to those with normal or mastocytic BAL cytology. Immunoblot revealed significant difference in the relative level of MMP2 in horses with neutrophilic vs. mastocytic mEAS. Upregulation of mRNA transcripts involved in the IL-1 family cytokine signaling axis (IL1a, IL1b, and IL1R2) in neutrophilic mEAS, as well as KIT mRNA in mastocytic mEAS, are novel, potentially clinically relevant, findings of this study. These findings further inform our understanding of inflammatory cell subtypes in mEAS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasthma 3acell biology 3achemokines 3adescriptive studies 3adisease severity 3aetiology 3afibrosis 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahorses 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunopathology 3ainflammation 3apathophysiology 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome 0aEquine asthma syndrome 0aHeaves 0aInflammatory airway disease 0aRecurrent airway obstruction 0aAsthma phenotype 0aGene expression 0aRNA-seq 0aBAL1 aSheats, M.

The H-SAPO-34 membrane was ion-exchanged with alkaline earth cations. A comparison study was conducted to obtain the separation performance of different cation-exchanged membranes. The CO₂ permeances reduced with cation-exchanged membranes in the order of Ca²⁺>Mg²⁺>Sr²⁺>Ba²⁺. The highest increase in CO₂/CH₄ separation selectivity of about 240% was obtained by ion-exchanging the H-SAPO-34 membrane with Ba²⁺. Separation of equimolar of CO₂ and CH₄ was conducted at different separation temperatures and pressure differences across the Ba-SAPO-34 membrane. The maximum CO₂/CH₄ separation selectivity of 103 with CO₂ permeance of 37.6×10⁻⁸mol/m²sPa was obtained for equimolar feed mixture of CO₂ and CH₄ at 303K and 100kPa pressure difference across Ba-SAPO-34 membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3achemical engineering 3amicrowave treatment 3atemperature1 aAhmad, Abdul Latif1 aBhatia, Subhash0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 July 15, v. 171, no. 3 p.1053-1059dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245012500161300002000286520127300306592002801579650001501607650001501622650001201637650001101649650004901660650001301709650001301722700001901735700001401754700001301768700002201781700001601803700002501819773013401844856007801978852000902056655001202065IND60584556720221120204840.0171025e20171025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058455672DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b091672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKe, Xian-Sheng10aHetero Cu(III)–Pd(II) Complex of a Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene-Fused Bis-dicarbacorrole with Stable Organic Radical Character  ap. 15232-15238.  aBis-dicarbacorrole (bis-H₃) with two adj-CCNN subunits was synthesized by incorporating a dibenzo[g,p]chrysene moiety into the macrocyclic structure. The two trianionic cores in bis-H₃ can stabilize two Cu(III) ions (bis-Cu) or concurrently a Cu(III) cation and a Pd(II) ion in the form of a hetero bis-metal complex (mix-Cu/Pd). As prepared, mix-Cu/Pd displays organic π radical character, as confirmed by various techniques, including electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, femtosecond transient absorption measurements, and DFT calculations. Radical formation is ascribed to one-electron transfer from the dicarbacorrole backbone to the Pd center allowing the d⁸ Pd(II) center to be accommodated in a square planner coordination geometry. Nucleus-independent chemical shift and anisotropy of the induced current density calculations provide support for the conclusion that bis-H₃ and bis-Cu both display antiaromatic character and contain two formally 16 π-electron dicarbacorrole subunits. On this basis, we suggest that mix-Cu/Pd is best considered as containing a fused 15 π-electron nonaromatic radical subunit and a 16 π-electron antiaromatic subunit. The spectroscopic observations are consistent with these assignments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanisotropy 3acations 3acopper 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ageometry 3amoieties1 aHong, Yongseok1 aTu, Peiyu1 aHe, Qing1 aLynch, Vincent M.1 aKim, Dongho1 aSessler, Jonathan L.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Oct. 25, v. 139, no. 42 p.15232-15238dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b091673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010200165300001600267520111200283592002801395650001301423650002501436650001901461650001801480650000901498650001801507650000901525650003001534650001301564700001201577700001901589773010501608856008101713990002301794852000901817655001201826IND60093015820221119004345.0141103e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009301582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.04.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Neng-min10aCatalytic dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls in subcritical water by Ni/Fe nanoparticles  ap. 919-925.  aThe present study was carried out to better understand the reactivity of nanoscale Ni/Fe particles towards the dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) contained in waste capacitor oil and the corresponding dechlorination mechanism in subcritical water. Batch experiments showed that nanoscale Ni/Fe particles could more quickly and effectively dechlorinate PCBs stepwise as compared to nanoscale zerovalent iron (n-ZVI) and nano-Ni⁰. The dechlorination products were much more centralized in the presence of Ni/Fe than other particles, and biphenyl, cyclohexyl-benzene and 1-alkyl-benzenes were the main products which can be used as raw chemicals. Moreover, catalytic hydrogenation by virtue of introduction of Ni⁰ as catalyst can not only result in rapid dechlorination but also avoid formation of toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons. The reactivity of nanoscale Ni/Fe can retain in subcritical water for rapid catalytic hydrodechlorination. This process poses the prospect of recovery of valuable chemicals in the course of disposal of hazardous PCB-containing capacitor oil or transformer oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiphenyl 3achemical engineering 3adechlorination 3ahydrogenation 3airon 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3atoxicity1 aYi, Li,1 aZhang, Fu-Shen0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 July 15, v. 171, no. 3 p.919-925dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.04.0413Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245013000159300002000289520181900309592002802128650003402156650001202190650001302202650001402215650002302229650001102252650001702263650002602280650002002306650000902326650001502335650001102350650001102361650001502372650001202387650001402399650001602413650001302429650000902442700002102451700002602472700001402498700002002512700001602532700002602548700002402574700002302598700002002621700001902641773013402660856007802794852000902872655001202881IND60584557220221120071558.0171025e20171025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058455722DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b093652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhanyong10aFine-Tuning the Activity of Metal–Organic Framework-Supported Cobalt Catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane  ap. 15251-15258.  aFew-atom cobalt-oxide clusters, when dispersed on a Zr-based metal–organic framework (MOF) NU-1000, have been shown to be active for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane at low temperatures (<230 °C), affording a selective and stable propene production catalyst. In our current work, a series of promoter ions with varying Lewis acidity, including Ni(II), Zn(II), Al(III), Ti(IV) and Mo(VI), are anchored as metal-oxide,hydroxide clusters to NU-1000 followed by Co(II) ion deposition, yielding a series of NU-1000-supported bimetallic-oxo,hydroxo,aqua clusters. Using difference envelope density (DED) analyses, the spatial locations of the promoter ions and catalytic cobalt ions are determined. For all samples, the promoter ions are sited between pairs of Zr₆ nodes along the MOF c-axis, whereas the location of the cobalt ions varies with the promoter ions. These NU-1000-supported bimetallic-oxide clusters are active for propane ODH after thermal activation under O₂ to open a cobalt coordination site and to oxidize Co(II) to Co(III), as evidenced by operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Co K-edge. In accord with the decreasing Lewis acidity of the promoter ion, catalytic activity increases in the following order: Mo(VI) < Ti(IV) < Al(III) < Zn(II) < Ni(II). The finding is attributed to increasing ease of formation of Co(III)–O• species and stabilization of a cobalt(III)-oxyl/propane transition state as the Lewis acidity of the promoter ions decreases. The results point to an increasing ability to fine-tune the structure-dependent activity of MOF-supported heterogeneous catalysts. Coupled with mechanistic studiescomputational or experimentalthis ability may translate into informed prediction of improved catalysts for propane ODH and other chemical reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aacidity 3aaluminum 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3acoordination polymers 3adehydrogenation 3aions 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3apropane 3apropylene 3atemperature 3atitanium 3azinc1 aPeters, Aaron W.1 aPlatero-Prats, Ana E.1 aLiu, Jian1 aKung, Chung-Wei1 aNoh, Hyunho1 aDeStefano, Matthew R.1 aSchweitzer, Neil M.1 aChapman, Karena W.1 aHupp, Joseph T.1 aFarha, Omar K.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Oct. 25, v. 139, no. 42 p.15251-15258dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b093653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01850naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012800166300001600294520077500310592002801085650001501113650001501128650002501143650001401168650002001182650001101202650001101213650002301224700001701247700001801264773010501282856008101387990002301468852000901491655001201500IND60093016220221119004135.0141103e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009301622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.04.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jianhan10aEquilibria and kinetics of phenol adsorption on a toluene-modified hyper-cross-linked poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) resin  ap. 951-957.  aA series of novel toluene-modified hyper-cross-linked poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) resins were synthesized and the adsorption behaviors of the synthesized resins toward phenol were investigated from aqueous solution. Among the synthesized five resins, HJ-L15 possessed the largest adsorption capacity toward phenol. The phenol adsorption onto HJ-L15 is combination of the surface adsorption and the absorption due to skeleton swelling. The molecular form of phenol was favorable for the adsorption. The isotherms could be fitted by Freundlich model and the adsorption was shown to be an exothermic process. The kinetic curves could be characterized by pseudo-second-order rate equation and the intra-particle diffusion was the rate-limiting step at the initial stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3achemical engineering 3aequations 3aheat production 3aphenol 3aresins 3asorption isotherms1 aDeng, Ruijie1 aHuang, Kelong0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 July 15, v. 171, no. 3 p.951-957dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.04.0453Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03372naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006900149245016100218500001900379520177100398592002802169650001302197650001602210650001502226650002502241650000902266650001202275650001202287650003002299650002002329650001502349650001602364650001302380650001302393650002102406650003002427650001302457650001102470651001102481653001102492653001902503653002702522653003402549700006402583700001902647773010702666856008402773852000902857655001202866IND60726632920221119202208.0210322e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072663292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2021.1049412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Jocenei A.T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9830-802710aQuantification of the pore size distribution of a Rhodic Hapludox under different management systems with X-ray microtomography and computational simulation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAgricultural soils are extremely susceptible to changes due to agricultural practices. Conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT) and no-tillage (NT) are examples of important management systems largely utilized in Brazil, one of the world’s leading producers of coffee, sugar, soybean, corn, and many other agricultural products. Evaluate how these managements disturb the soil structure at the micrometric scale constitutes one of the major challenges for the soil scientists. Due to its potential of producing high-resolution images, X-ray microtomography (μCT) has been increasingly considered as a technique for accurately characterizes three-dimensionally (3D) the soil pore network. In this study, the use of X-ray μCT images associated with a computational algorithm based on the mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) was utilized for quantifying changes in the soil structure, induced by different management systems (CT, MT, NT), as compared to the same soil under forest (F). 3D analyses of the pore system were carried out and complemented with information from the soil water retention curve (SWRC) and its first derivative, the water capacity function (WCF). The obtained results showed that the soil under CT and MT presented significant changes in its pore size distribution as compared to F and NT. Results from both methods showed that CT and NT were the managements that promoted major changes in the soil porosity mainly by increasing the percentage of transmission pores (< 500 μm). The obtained results also suggest that the computational algorithm based on MIP, running on 3D images (30 μm of spatial resolution), was valuable to quantify the pore size distribution and their modifications induced by the different management systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHapludox 3aX-radiation 3aalgorithms 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3aforests 3amercury 3amicro-computed tomography 3aminimum tillage 3ano-tillage 3aporosimetry 3aporosity 3aresearch 3asoil pore system 3asoil water characteristic 3asoybeans 3asugars 3aBrazil 0aOxisol 0aImage analysis 0aPore size distribution 0aMercury intrusion porosimetry1 aCássaro, Fabio A.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7240-39471 aPires, Luiz F.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2021 May, v. 209 p.104941-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.1049413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011900167300001600286500001500302520182100317592002802138650001402166650001702180650001702197650002502214650001102239650002502250650002402275650000702299650001602306650002302322650001302345650000902358650001902367650001502386653000902401700002302410700001802433700001902451773010502470856008102575990002302656852000902679655001202688IND60093016320221119004156.0141103e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009301632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.04.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, Diwakar10aManganese-modified natural sand in the remediation of aquatic environment contaminated with heavy metal toxic ions  ap. 958-966.  a2019-12-06  aThe present communication aims towards the possible exploitation of modified natural sand materials in the remediation of the heavy metal toxic ions contaminated aquatic environment. The surface of the sand was modified as depositing the nano-particles of manganese (i.e., manganese-modified natural sand: MMNS) and the mineral phase of manganese was perhaps depicted to be pyrolusite as indicated by the XRD analytical data. The d-spacings of quartz was significantly enhanced with the manganese modification indicated the manganese caused an apparent increase in basal spacing of sand structure. SEM images and the EDX analysis showed that manganese nano-particles are evenly distributed onto the surface of sand. The BET surface area of the MMNS was increased significantly. The amount of manganese aggregated was found to be 1002.6mg/Kg of sand and the stability tests suggested that the nano-particles aggregated onto the sand surface are fairly stable within the pH region 3–10. Further, the removal behavior of this MMNS was employed for the attenuation of two important heavy metal toxic ions i.e., Pb(II) and Cu(II) in aqueous medium. The uptake of these two metal ions followed the Freundlich adsorption isotherm. The removal capacity of MMNS estimated with the Freundlich approximation was found to be 0.4596mg/g for Cu(II) and 2.996mg/g for Pb(II). Further, the 1000 times increase in ionic strength caused for relatively insignificant change in uptake of these two ions onto the solid surface points it a predominant strong chemical binding involved at the solid/solution interface. The column experiments and the breakthrough curves suggested that material possessed significantly high removal capacity i.e., 0.190 and 0.895mg/g, respectively, for Cu(II) and Pb(II) even under the dynamic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3asurface area 3aheavy metals 3aspatial distribution 3aquartz 3achemical engineering 3aaquatic environment 3apH 3aremediation 3asorption isotherms 3atoxicity 3asand 3aionic strength 3ametal ions 0aions1 aLaldanwngliana, C.1 aChoi, Chul-Ho1 aLee, Seung Mok0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 July 15, v. 171, no. 3 p.958-966dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.04.0463Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015100169300001800320520148000338592002801818650001701846650001701863650001501880650001101895650001601906650002501922650001301947650003101960650002201991650001702013650002202030650000702052650001102059650001402070700002002084700001902104773010702123856008102230990002302311852000902334655001202343IND60093016420221119004237.0141103e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009301642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamrakhiani, Lata10aRemoval of hexavalent chromium by heat inactivated fungal biomass of Termitomyces clypeatus: Surface characterization and mechanism of biosorption  ap. 1060-1068.  aMechanism of Cr(VI) biosorption by heat inactivated fungal biomass of Termitomyces clypeatus was studied by analyzing its pH profile and surface chemistry. The biosorption efficiency enhanced with acid pretreatment and reduced by alkali. The pretreatment with CaCl₂ increased the biosorption capacity but decreased with NaCl. Surface chemistry was characterized by potentiometric titration pH of zero charge and SEM–EDX analysis. The acidic and basic sites for the biomass were quantified as 7.75 and 3.25mmol/g, respectively, and concluded that surface of the biomass was acidic. Acidic [carboxyl (pKₐ 3.45 and 4.29), imidazole (pKₐ 5.98), and phosphate (pKₐ 6.75)] and alkaline [amines (pKₐ 9.96, 11.92, and 12.47), sulfhydryl (thiol) (pKₐ 8.48), hydroxyl (pKₐ 11.12)] functional groups were identified and confirmed by FTIR analysis. The roles played by functional groups in chromium biosorption were found to be in the order: carboxyl>phosphates>lipids>sulfhydryl>amines. Integrative analysis of surface chemistry, functional group modification and FTIR showed that the Cr(VI) biosorption involved more than one mechanism such as physical adsorption, ion exchange, complexation and electrostatic attraction and followed in two subsequent steps – Cr₂O₇ ²⁻ biosorption at the protonated active sites (amino, carboxyl and phosphate groups) and reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by reductive groups (hydroxyl and carbonyl groups) on the biomass surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTermitomyces 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3aamines 3abiosorption 3achemical engineering 3achromium 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aheat inactivation 3aion exchange 3amicrobial biomass 3apH 3athiols 3atitration1 aMajumder, Rajib1 aKhowala, Suman0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 July 15, v. 171, no. 3 p.1060-1068dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03562naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245011800159300001800277520159200295592002801887650002601915650002801941650001301969650001601982650001001998650001802008650001602026650001402042650002302056650001302079650001502092650002202107650001102129650001302140650001202153650000702165650002002172650001202192650001402204650005202218650002402270650001102294650002702305653002402332653001702356653001602373653000802389700001502397700001802412700001302430700001602443700001602459700001402475700001402489700001902503700001602522700001402538700001402552700001602566700001502582700001602597773014802613856008202761852000902843655001202852IND60584558020221120163409.0171025e20171025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058455802DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b027462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Jie10aEffects of Long-Term Protein Restriction on Meat Quality, Muscle Amino Acids, and Amino Acid Transporters in Pigs  ap. 9297-9304.  aThis study aimed to investigate the long-term effects of protein restriction from piglets to finishing pigs for 16 weeks on meat quality, muscle amino acids, and amino acid transporters. Thirty-nine piglets were randomly divided into three groups: a control (20–18–16% crude protein, CP) and two protein restricted groups (17–15–13% CP and 14–12–10% CP). The results showed that severe protein restriction (14–12–10% CP) inhibited feed intake and body weight, while moderate protein restriction (17–15–13% CP) had little effect on growth performance in pigs. Meat quality (i.e., pH, color traits, marbling, water-holding capacity, and shearing force) were tested, and the results exhibited that 14–12–10% CP treatment markedly improved muscle marbling score and increased yellowness (b*). pH value (45 min) was significantly higher in 17–15–13% CP group than that in other groups. In addition, protein restriction reduced muscle histone, arginine, valine, and isoleucine abundances and enhanced glycine and lysine concentrations compared with the control group, while the RT-PCR results showed that protein restriction downregulated amino acids transporters. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway was inactivated in the moderate protein restricted group (17–15–13% CP), while severe protein restriction with dietary 14–12–10% CP markedly enhanced mTOR phosphorylation. In conclusion, long-term protein restriction affected meat quality and muscle amino acid metabolism in pigs, which might be associated with mTOR signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid metabolism 3aamino acid transporters 3aarginine 3abody weight 3acolor 3acrude protein 3afeed intake 3afinishing 3agrowth performance 3ahistones 3aisoleucine 3along term effects 3alysine 3amarbling 3amuscles 3apH 3aphosphorylation 3apiglets 3arapamycin 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3avaline 3awater holding capacity 0aprotein restriction 0ameat quality 0aamino acids 0apig1 aLi, Yuying1 aZhu, Xiaotong1 aHan, Hui1 aRen, Wenkai1 aChen, Shuai1 aBin, Peng1 aLiu, Gang1 aHuang, Xingguo1 aFang, Rejun1 aWang, Bin1 aWang, Kai1 aSun, Liping1 aLi, Tiejun1 aYin, Yulong0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Oct. 25, v. 65, no. 42 p.9297-9304dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.7b027463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012300164300001600287520119100303592002801494650002201522650001501544650001501559650001501574650002501589650001301614650001101627650002501638650001301663650001301676650002301689650001701712650003701729700001401766700001801780700001901798700001901817700002001836773010401856856008101960990002302041852000902064655001202073IND60093017520221119004249.0141103e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009301752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Wan-zhen12aA molecularly imprinted polymer based on TiO₂ as a sacrificial support for selective recognition of dibenzothiophene  ap. 191-198.  aSurface imprinting technique combined with a sacrificial support process was established to synthesize DBT-imprinted polymer in which TiO₂ acts as the sacrificial support material (H-MIP). The synthetic samples were characterized by the techniques of Fourier transmission infrared spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometer and nitrogen sorption. Then batch experiments were performed to evaluate the adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms, and selective recognition of H-MIP. The adsorption behavior followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating that the adsorption process was chemically carried out. Two adsorption isotherm models were applied to analyze the equilibrium data, obtaining the best description by Freundlich isotherm model. Thermodynamic parameters revealed the spontaneity and endothermic nature of adsorption. The absorption abilities of DBT from n-octane solutions followed the order H-MIP>T-MIP>H-NIP>TiO₂. H-MIP also could selectively recognize DBT over similar compounds. Finally, the method was applied to the desulfurization and determination of trace DBT in gasoline sample, and the adsorbent could be regenerated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3achemical engineering 3agasoline 3amodels 3amolecular imprinting 3anitrogen 3apolymers 3asorption isotherms 3aspectroscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhou, Wei1 aXu, Ping-ping1 aPan, Jian-ming1 aWu, Xiang-yang1 aYan, Yong-sheng0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 172, no. 1 p.191-198dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.0893Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245014300164300001800307520110700325592002801432650002101460650002501481650001201506650001301518650001801531650001601549650001701565650000901582650001501591650001001606650002101616650001001637650002801647650001401675650001801689650001301707653002101720653001301741653001701754653000901771653003101780653001801811700001801829700001201847700002001859700002001879700001901899700001701918700001901935700001801954700001801972773013301990856008202123852000902205655001202214IND60584558920221120153244.0171025e20171025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058455892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b033912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXin, Zhao-Zhe10aTranscriptome-Wide Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes in Chinese Oak Silkworm Antheraea pernyi in Response to Lead Challenge  ap. 9305-9314.  aAntheraea pernyi is a commercially cultivated silk moth and a source of insect food with high-quality protein. Insects suffer oxidative stress on exposure to heavy metals, and reactive oxygen species are cleared by antioxidant enzymes. To gain better understanding of the antioxidant defense system of A. pernyi, we analyzed transcriptomes of pupae after stimulation with lead and phosphate-buffered saline (control). In total, 72 367 unigenes were identified. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these DEGs were in 20 biological process subcategories, 19 cellular component subcategories, and 18 molecular function subcategories. Clusters of orthologous groups of protein annotation placed a total of 528 DEGs into 25 categories. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis identified antioxidant defense pathways, including “Peroxisome” and “Glutathione metabolism”, which are reported for the first time in A. pernyi. Our study enriches A. pernyi transcriptome databases and provides insight into the heavy metal responses of antioxidant systems of this insect fat bodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAntheraea pernyi 3aantioxidant activity 3aenzymes 3afat body 3agene ontology 3aglutathione 3aheavy metals 3alead 3ametabolism 3amoths 3aoxidative stress 3apupae 3areactive oxygen species 3asilkworms 3atranscriptome 3aunigenes 0aAntheraea pernyi 0asilkworm 0aheavy metals 0alead 0aantioxidant defense system 0atranscriptome1 aLiu, Qiu-Ning1 aLiu, Yu1 aZhang, Dai-Zhen1 aWang, Zheng-Fei1 aZhang, Hua-Bin1 aGe, Bao-Ming1 aZhou, Chun-Lin1 aChai, Xin-Yue1 aTang, Bo-Ping0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Oct. 25, v. 65, no. 42 p.9305-9314dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.7b033913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245011700179300001600296520122400312592002801536650002201564650002501586650001301611650001101624650001401635650000901649650001101658650000701669650001601676700002101692700002401713773010401737856008101841990002301922852000901945655001201954IND60093018620221119004442.0141103e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009301862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGando-Ferreira, Licínio M.10aEquilibrium and kinetic studies on removal of Cu²⁺ and Cr³⁺ from aqueous solutions using a chelating resin  ap. 277-286.  aIn this study, a chelating resin, Diaion CR 11, was studied in order to selectively remove Cu²⁺ and Cr³⁺ present in synthetic effluents. Single-component equilibrium isotherm was determined in batch experiments for copper, and an exchange equilibrium based model was used to correlate the experimental data of the binary system Cu²⁺/H⁺. It was observed that the maximum capacity of the resin increased 2.3 times when the pH varied from 2 to 5 at 25°C. The equilibrium constant increased 1.4 times when the temperature changed from 25 to 50°C at initial pH of 3. For the operating conditions tested, it was found that the resin exhibited a better selectivity for Cu²⁺ over Cr³⁺. A mathematical dynamic model was successfully implemented for describing the saturation behavior of the multicomponent system Cu²⁺/Crₜ/H⁺ in the column operation. The regeneration of the resin was also experimentally studied by using HCl followed by a mixture of NaOH/H₂O₂. High efficiencies were observed for copper during the first step, where it was almost fully eluted from the resin with 1M HCl. The use of those regenerant agents in the presence of iron seems to effectively strip chromium from the resin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical engineering 3achromium 3acopper 3aeffluents 3airon 3amodels 3apH 3atemperature1 aRomão, Inês S.1 aQuina, Margarida J.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 172, no. 1 p.277-286dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.1053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245013500164300001800299520132800317592002801645650002501673650002001698650002001718650001901738650001501757650001801772650002001790650001201810650001401822650002801836650001301864650001901877650001501896650001201911650002101923650001101944650001101955650002201966650002301988650001702011650000902028650001702037650002102054650002202075650001402097653001302111653001502124653002302139653001502162700001502177700001802192700001702210700001802227773013302245856008202378852000902460655001202469IND60584559220221122062914.0171025e20171025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058455922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b035442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Chaohua10aMetabolic Characterization of Dairy Cows Treated with Gossypol by Blood Biochemistry and Body Fluid Untargeted Metabolome Analyses  ap. 9369-9378.  aTo characterize the metabolic disorders of dairy cows treated with gossypol, 12 dairy cows were assigned to either a control group or a treatment group that was fed 1000 mg of gossypol per kilogram of dry matter feed for 28 days. Milk quality was adversely affected, as both milk protein and lactose levels were significantly decreased in the gossypol-treated group (3.40% vs 3.16%, P = 0.044; 5.15% vs 4.91%, P = 0.027; respectively). Plasma samples revealed increases in alanine aminotransferase (P = 0.092), choline esterase (P = 0.02), and glutathione transferase (P = 0.0005) and decreases in glucose (P = 0.076) in the gossypol-treated group. Mass spectrometry based comparative metabolomic analyses showed reduced concentrations of the gluconeogenesis precursor l-glutamine (P = 0.047), with significant decreases (P < 0.05) in plasma l-lysine, l-threonine, and homoserine levels after gossypol treatment. HDL-C and LDL-C levels in the gossypol-treated group were increased (P = 0.044) and decreased (P = 0.023), respectively. These results demonstrate that gossypol induced oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity; reduced peripheral lipid metabolism, and enhanced hepatic lipid accumulation; decreased amino acid bioavailability and milk protein synthesis; and decreased gluconeogenesis and milk lactose in dairy cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3abioavailability 3ablood chemistry 3acholinesterase 3adairy cows 3adairy protein 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3aglutamine 3aglutathione transferase 3agossypol 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahomoserine 3alactose 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3alysine 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolomics 3amilk 3amilk quality 3aoxidative stress 3aprotein synthesis 3athreonine 0agossypol 0adairy cows 0ablood biochemistry 0ametabolome1 aZhang, Kai1 aZhan, Tengfei1 aZhao, Qingyu1 aZhang, Junmin0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Oct. 25, v. 65, no. 42 p.9369-9378dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.7b035443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03571naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245013300164300001800297520159800315592002801913650003301941650001901974650001001993650003502003650001602038650001602054650001402070650001302084650001602097650002402113650001402137650004102151650001902192650001702211650002302228650002302251650001602274650001002290650000902300650001202309650001502321650002102336650001302357650004802370650001602418650001102434650002102445653003802466653002902504653002202533653001802555653002302573700002002596700001502616700001602631700001802647700002002665773013302685856008202818852000902900655001202909IND60584559320221122063030.0171025e20171025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058455932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b035782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Ja-Jen10aSolanum nigrum Polyphenol Extracts Inhibit Hepatic Inflammation, Oxidative Stress, and Lipogenesis in High-Fat-Diet-Treated Mice  ap. 9255-9265.  aPatients with diabetes, obesity, and hyperlipidemia are all high-risk groups for fatty liver; however, the mechanism of fatty liver formation is not completely understood. Studies have indicated that abnormal fat metabolism, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance are positively correlated with peroxidation and abnormal cytokine production. Recent studies have revealed that Solanum nigrum extracts (SNE) possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidation, antihyperlipidemia, and liver protection abilities. Therefore, the present study investigated the in vivo and in vitro effects of an SNE on nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)-induced hepatitis. In vivo data demonstrated that the SNE reduced blood triglyceride, sugar, and cholesterol levels, as well as fat accumulation, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation in high-fat-diet-treated mice. The results indicated that the SNE downregulated the expression of fatty acid synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and upregulated the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. Furthermore, we prepared a Solanum nigrum polyphenol extract (SNPE) from the SNE; the SNPE reduced hepatic lipid (oleic acid) accumulation. Therefore, SNE have the potential to alleviate NAFL-induced hepatitis, and polyphenolic compounds are the main components of SNE. Moreover, SNE can be used to develop health-food products for preventing NAFL disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aSolanum nigrum 3ablood 3acarnitine palmitoyltransferase 3acholesterol 3acorrelation 3acytokines 3adiabetes 3afatty liver 3afatty-acid synthase 3ahepatitis 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductases 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3alipid peroxidation 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3amice 3aobesity 3aoleic acid 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3apolyphenols 3asugars 3atriacylglycerols 0aSolanum nigrum polyphenol extract 0anonalcoholic fatty liver 0aanti-inflammatory 0aantioxidation 0aantihyperlipidemia1 aChung, Dai-Jung1 aLee, Yi-Ju1 aWen, Bo-Han1 aJao, Hsing-Yu1 aWang, Chau-Jong0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Oct. 25, v. 65, no. 42 p.9255-9265dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.7b035783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007300164300001600237520173500253592002801988650001502016650001502031650001702046650002502063650002302088650001902111650002202130650001202152650000902164650001402173650001402187650001502201650001702216650001602233700001502249700001602264700001502280700001602295773010402311856008102415990002302496852000902519655001202528IND60093019020221119004432.0141103e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009301902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngelova, D.10aKinetics of oil and oil products adsorption by carbonized rice husks  ap. 306-311.  aComposite C/SiO₂ containing material has been obtained by pyrolysis of rice husks, carried out at a temperature of 480°C. The material has been studied as adsorbent for purification of pollutions caused by oil and oil products. The amount and composition of the fluids, dispersed on the surface of the carbonized rice husks, has been determined applying extraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry method (GC–MS). The material has been characterized also with respect to the specific surface area by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and mercury porosimetry. Adsorption capacity of the pyrolyzed rice husks was determined in respect of water, oil and petroleum products with different densities. The material obtained by pyrolysis of rice husk has very good buoyancy characteristics, high oil sorption capacity and high hydrophobicity. The influence of the bulk density of the sorbent has been investigated as well as that of the density of the oil product on the kinetics and mechanism of sorption. It was established that the dependence between the bulk density of the adsorbent and the height of penetration of the oil in it for a specified time is inversely proportional. The height of penetration of the sorbate in the sorbent layer depends on the density of the liquid phase. The changes of the adsorption rate for the various oil products can be described by hyperbolic dependence. A correlation between surface functional groups and morphology of the adsorbent and adsorption properties of the material was created. The research provides the basis for development of a new environmental material with optimal characteristics, providing efficient adsorption of oil and oil products from aqueous medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abulk density 3achemical engineering 3agas chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3amass spectrometry 3amercury 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apyrolysis 3arice hulls 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aUzunov, I.1 aUzunova, S.1 aGigova, A.1 aMinchev, L.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 172, no. 1 p.306-311dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.05.1143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01740naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009800163300001600261520068100277592002800958650002500986650001701011650002401028650001801052650001101070650002301081700001601104700001401120700001901134700002001153773010401173856008101277990002301358852000901381655001201390IND60093019120221119004158.0141103e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009301912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorba, C.E.10aApplication of the mass action law to describe ion exchange equilibrium in a fixed-bed column  ap. 312-320.  aIon exchange experiments were carried out in a fixed-bed column employing the binary systems Cu²⁺–Na⁺ and Zn²⁺–Na⁺.

Alternatively, species with high genetic variation could rapidly respond to forces of selection such that a local population evolves traits that provide an advantage in its local environment. We tested this generalist versus local adaptation paradigm in a widely distributed, recently introduced riparian tree / shrub, Tamarix spp. Using an eighty-day, mid-summer common garden drought experiment, we tested three inter-related hypotheses: 1) stomatal sensitivity to soil water depletion is lower in genotypes from a low-elevation, ephemerally flowing river than genotypes from a low-elevation, perennially flowing river, indicative of local adaptation to hydrological conditions, 2) stomatal sensitivity to soil water depletion is lower in genotypes from high-elevations with regular freeze-thaw exposure than genotypes sourced from locations with no freeze-thaw exposure, indicative of local adaptation to temperature conditions, and 3) differences among genotypes in drought sensitivity are correlated with differences in fine root area to leaf area ratios (Aᵣ:Aₗ). For the most part, results did not support hypothesis 1, but largely supported hypotheses 2 and 3. Specifically, sap-flux scaled canopy transpiration (Eₗ) declined 14 days earlier in the low-elevation populations after drought initiation compared to Eₗ of the highest elevation population with the highest freeze-thaw exposure. Root area to leaf area ratios of the two low-elevation populations were also only 42% and 55% of Aᵣ:Aₗ in the highest elevation population. Results indicate that the high degree of reported Tamarix hybridization since its introduction to North America has largely produced a swarm of “generalist” genotypes in terms of drought sensitivity. Nevertheless, rapid changes in ecohydrologic conditions may result in some Tamarix populations becoming maladapted sooner to reductions in available water than others in the western US.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000010 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTamarix 3acanopy 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3afine roots 3aforests 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3agenetic variation 3ahybridization 3aleaf area 3ameteorology 3aphenotypic plasticity 3arivers 3ashrubs 3asoil water 3asummer 3aswarms 3atemperature 3atranspiration 3atrees 3aWestern United States 0aHydraulic architecture 0alocal adaptation 0aplant water relations 0ariparian ecohydrology 0asap flux 0astomatal regulation1 aGuo, Jessica S1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9566-91821 aDehn, Donna1 aGrady, Kevin C.,1 aHull, Julia B.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1611-89621 aJohnson, Emily1 aKoepke, Dan F1 aLong, Randall W1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9308-99961 aPotts, Dan L1 aHultine, Kevin R0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2021 May 15, v. 301-302dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.1083423Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7266358  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011100168300001600279520133800295592002801633650002301661650001501684650001501699650001601714650002501730650001301755650001701768650001701785650001701802650001901819650001101838650000701849650002301856773010401879856008101983990002302064852000902087655001202096IND60093019820221119004436.0141103e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009301982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Mingliang10aAdsorption study of Pb(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) from simulated acid mine drainage using dairy manure compost  ap. 361-368.  aDairy manure compost (DMC) was used to be one efficient biosorbent for the removal of heavy metals from simulated acid mine drainage. Single and competitive adsorption of Pb, Cu and Zn by DMC were studied. The adsorption isothermal data fit the Langmuir isotherm better than the Freundlich isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacities calculated by applying the Langmuir isotherm were 0.460mmol/g for Pb, 0.428mmol/g for Cu, and 0.237mmol/g for Zn at pH 4.0. The single and competitive adsorption studies showed that the adsorption affinity order of the three heavy metals was Pb>Cu>Zn. The rate of adsorption of the three metals was fast, which reached equilibrium in 60min, and followed the pseudo-second-order model well. Adsorption efficiency of the heavy metals was pH dependent and the maximum adsorption was found to occur at around 3.5 for Pb, 4.5 for Cu, 5.5 for Zn. An increase of ionic strength caused a decrease in adsorption capacity for Zn and Cu, while negligible effect for Pb. The regeneration experiments showed that the adsorbent could be regenerated and reused at least three cycles without significant decrease in adsorption capacity. The results showed DMC could have great potential in treating heavy metals in acid mine drainage. Finally, ion exchange was found to be the primary mechanism of adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiosorbents 3achemical engineering 3acomposts 3adairy manure 3aheavy metals 3aion exchange 3aionic strength 3amodels 3apH 3asorption isotherms0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 172, no. 1 p.361-368dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.06.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04200naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024004100138040001800179100006300197245013500260500001900395506007600414506003100490520209200521592002802613596004402641596004502685596004602730506003702776650002002813650001102833650001702844650001902861650001802880650001102898650001702909650002102926650001202947650001902959650002102978650002002999650002603019650001503045650002703060653002703087653001103114653002103125653002203146653001503168653001803183700006103201700001903262700001803281700006203299773011603361856008803477961001203565852000903577655001203586IND60726636020221207094823.0210519e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072663602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.1083472chorus7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.1083472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Benjamin D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2446-450710aOnly sun-lit leaves of the uppermost canopy exceed both air temperature and photosynthetic thermal optima in a wet tropical forest  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aTropical forests have evolved under relatively narrow temperature regimes, and therefore may be more susceptible to climatic change than forests in higher latitudes. Recent evidence shows that lowland tropical forest canopies may already be exceeding thermal maxima for photosynthesis. Height can strongly influence both the microclimate and physiology of forest canopy foliage, yet vertical trends in canopy micrometeorology are rarely examined in tropical forests. To improve our understanding of how climatological and micrometeorological conditions affect tropical tree function, we assessed vertical gradients of photosynthetic photon flux density, vapor pressure deficit, air temperature, leaf temperature, and the difference between leaf and air temperature (ΔT) in a Puerto Rican tropical wet forest. Both air temperature and vapor pressure deficit increased linearly with height. Leaf temperature, however, did not significantly differ across the shaded foliage from 0-16 m, while the uppermost layer (20 m) was up to 4°C hotter than the rest of the foliage and up to 5°C hotter than air temperature at the highest radiation intensity. As a result, leaf temperatures in the shaded middle canopy and understory showed nearly poikilothermic behavior (i.e., leaf temperatures = air temperature), while the uppermost canopy strata showed megathermic behavior (i.e., leaf temperatures greater than air temperature), revealing different thermoregulation strategies for sun-lit versus shaded foliage. In addition, the uppermost canopy was the only stratum to exceed mean photosynthetic temperature optima for this site (Tₒₚₜ = 30.2 ± 1.1°C). Because the upper canopy plays a disproportionately large role in whole-forest photosynthesis, continued warming could potentially weaken the tropics’ carbon sink capacity. However, the shaded leaves may be able increase carbon uptake with further warming because they appear to be able to maintain temperatures below photosynthetic optima, possibly with the help of radiation shielding provided by the uppermost canopy layer.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSDOEdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000150 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair temperature 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3aforest canopy 3aleaves 3amicroclimate 3amicrometeorology 3aphotons 3aphotosynthesis 3athermoregulation 3atropical plants 3atropical rain forests 3aunderstory 3avapor pressure deficit 0aPhotosynthetic Optimum 0aCanopy 0aLeaf Temperature 0aVertical Gradient 0aMegathermy 0aPoikilothermy1 aCarter, Kelsey R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8327-64131 aReed, Sasha C.1 aWood, Tana E.1 aCavaleri, Molly A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0984-611X0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2021 May 15, v. 301-302dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.1083473Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03712naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245013700161300001400298520186500312592002802177650002102205650002202226650001902248650001402267650001502281650001202296650001102308650001802319650001302337650003002350650001202380650000702392650004302399650001902442650005202461650002602513650001102539650002002550650002402570650001002594650001302604650001202617653001702629653002002646653003002666653006502696653002402761653003702785700001902822700001702841700001602858700001702874773013202891856007803023852000903101655001203110IND60584560320221120215402.0190615e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058456032DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2017.23312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHa, Ji-Hyoung10aEfficacy of Combination Treatment with Sodium Metasilicate and Sodium Hypochlorite for Inactivation of Norovirus on Fresh Vegetables  ap. 73-80.  aIn recent years, fresh vegetables have frequently been associated with the foodborne transmission of enteric viruses, such as human norovirus (NoV). Therefore, several studies have focused on developing methods to inactivate foodborne viruses for preventing outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is commonly used as a disinfectant, but results in undesirable effects on the appearance and taste of foods and can generate toxic byproducts when it exceeds the allowable concentration. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of a range of NaOCl concentrations (50–1000 ppm) for reducing the amounts of human NoV (NoV GII.4) on lettuce (Lactuca sativa), celery (Apium graveolens L.), and white cabbage (Brassica oleracea ssp. capitata). In addition, the combination treatment of NaOCl and sodium metasilicate (SMS, 0.1–0.5%) pentahydrate was evaluated for its ability to decrease the populations of NoV GII.4 in the three food samples. An immunomagnetic separation procedure combined with reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used for virus detection. For lettuce, celery, and cabbage, the NoV GII.4 recovery rates were 57.3% ± 6.5%, 52.5% ± 1.7%, and 60.3% ± 3.9%, respectively, using a glycine/NaCl elution buffer (0.25 M glycine/0.14 M NaCl, pH 9.5). The reductions of NoV GII.4 were 3.17, 3.06, and 3.27 log₁₀ genomic copies/μL for lettuce, celery, and cabbage, respectively, at 1000 ppm NaOCl, while a reduction of ∼3 log₁₀ genomic copies/μL was obtained when the samples were treated with a combination of 100 ppm NaOCl and 0.4% SMS pentahydrate. Taken together, these results demonstrated that combined treatment with NaOCl and SMS pentahydrate was an efficient strategy to reduce the concentration of NaOCl for control of NoV GII.4 contamination in fresh vegetables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApium graveolens 3aBrassica oleracea 3aLactuca sativa 3aNorovirus 3abyproducts 3acabbage 3acelery 3adisinfectants 3agenomics 3aimmunomagnetic separation 3alettuce 3apH 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3araw vegetables 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcription 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asodium hypochlorite 3ataste 3atoxicity 3aviruses 0adisinfectant 0ahuman norovirus 0aimmunomagnetic separation 0areverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction 0asodium hypochlorite 0asodium metasilicate pentahydrate1 aKim, Sung Hyun1 aLee, Hee-Min1 aKim, Su-ji,1 aLee, Hae-Won0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 15, no. 2 p.73-80dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2017.23313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245009300168500001900261520118700280592002801467650002001495650002501515650001701540650002601557650001301583650002301596650001601619650001701635650002101652650001401673653002601687653001201713653002101725653002301746653002101769700001601790700001501806700001501821700001401836700001401850700001601864773009801880856008701978852000902065655001202074IND60726636420221119202945.0210312e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072663642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.1108352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Huina10aMitochondrial citrate synthase plays important roles in anthocyanin synthesis in petunia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAnthocyanins are important flavonoid pigments in plants. Malonyl CoA is an important intermediate in anthocyanin synthesis, and citrate, formed by citrate synthase (CS) catalysing oxaloacetate, is the precursor for the formation of malonyl-CoA. CS is composed of two isoforms, mitochondrial citrate synthase (mCS), a key enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and citrate synthase (CSY) localizated in microbodies in plants. However, no CS isoform involvement in anthocyanin synthesis has been reported. In this study, we identified the entire CS family in petunia (Petunia hybrida): PhmCS, PhCSY1 and PhCSY2. We obtained petunia plants silenced for the three genes. PhmCS silencing resulted in abnormal development of leaves and flowers. The contents of citrate and anthocyanins were significantly reduced in flowers in PhmCS-silenced plants. However, silencing of PhCSY1 and/or PhCSY2 did not cause a visible phenotype change in petunia. These results showed that PhmCS is involved in anthocyanin synthesis and the development of leaves and flowers, and that the citrate involved in anthocyanin synthesis mainly derived from mitochondria rather than microbodies in petunia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPetunia hybrida 3aabnormal development 3aanthocyanins 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3acitrates 3amalonyl coenzyme A 3amicrobodies 3amitochondria 3aoxaloacetic acid 3aphenotype 0aAnthocyanin synthesis 0aPetunia 0aCitrate synthase 0aFlower development 0aLeaf development1 aChen, Guoju1 aSang, Lina1 aDeng, Ying1 aGao, Lili1 aYu, Yixun1 aLiu, Juanxu0 tPlant science.g2021 Apr., v. 305 p.110835-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.1108353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01436naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245017800171300001600349520035000365592002800715650001600743650002500759650001500784650002200799650001800821650001000839650001500849700002900864773010400893856008100997990002301078852000901101655001201110IND60093021320221120090649.0141103e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009302132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.06.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, Rodrigo J.G.10aRETRACTION: Detoxification of high-strength liquid pollutants in an ozone bubble column reactor: Gas–liquid flow patterns, interphase mass transfer and chemical depuration  ap. 476-486.  aThis article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy).

The current study aimed to address the association of these factors and their combined effect on emotional eating. Method: Twenty-eight participants conducted an emotional Go/Nogo task including pictures of neutral, negative and positive scenes and an additional emotion suppression condition. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded continuously. Emotional eating and habitual emotion suppression were assessed through questionnaires. Emotional reactivity to affective pictures was measured through a visual analogue scale and the amplitude of the electrophysiological late positive potential (LPP). Inhibition parameters were assessed behaviorally (i.e., commission errors) and through event-related potentials of the EEG (i.e., N2/P3-amplitudes).The trait questionnaire data revealed that emotional eating was not correlated with habitual emotion suppression. During the emotional Go/Nogo paradigm, higher emotional eating scores were positively related to higher LPP amplitudes in response to negative affective scenes. Inhibitory control capacities were not related to emotional eating while watching neutral or negative pictures, but higher emotional eating scores were associated with more commission errors when negative emotions were suppressed.Emotional eating tendencies seem to be related to higher reactivity when confronted with negative affective information and inhibitory control deficits may arise especially when an effort is made to suppress these negative emotions. Therefore, a focus on adaptive emotion regulation in treatments of emotional eating seems to be important; solely targeting inhibitory control capacities may not be sufficient in order to help people with emotional eating to regulate their food intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3aelectroencephalography 3aelectrophysiology 3afood intake 3aquestionnaires 0aEmotional eating 0aEmotional reactivity 0aEmotion regulation 0aResponse inhibition 0aEvent-related potentials1 aBiehl, Stefanie1 aSvaldi, Jennifer0 tAppetite.g2021 June 01, v. 161 p.105142-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.1051423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245008800168520199500256592002802251650001302279650001802292650001402310650001102324650001902335650002202354650001702376650002102393650002602414650001902440653001902459653002402478653001502502653001902517653002102536700001902557700002102576700006702597773009502664856008402759852000902843655001202852IND60726637920221119202304.0210619e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072663792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2021.1051432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotoki, Kosuke10aEvaluation of energy density and macronutrients after extremely brief time exposure  aMany food decisions are made rapidly and without reflective processing. The ability to determine nutritional information accurately is a precursor of food decisions and is important for a healthy diet and weight management. However, little is known about the cognitive evaluation of food attributes based on visual information in relation to assessing nutritional content. We investigated the accuracy of visual encoding of nutritional information after brief and extended time exposures to food images. The following questions were addressed: (1) how accurately do people estimate energy and macronutrients after brief exposure to food images, and (2) how does estimation accuracy change with time exposure and the type of nutritional information? Participants were first asked to rate the energy density (calories) and macronutrient content (carbohydrates/fat/protein) of different sets of food images under three time conditions (97, 500 or 1000 ms) and then asked to perform the task with no time constraints. We calculated estimation accuracy by computing the correlations between estimated and actual nutritional information for each time exposure and compared estimation accuracy with respect to the type of nutritional information and the exposure time. The estimated and actual energy densities and individual macronutrient content were significantly correlated, even after a brief exposure time (97 ms). The degree of accuracy of the estimations did not differ with additional time exposure, suggesting that <100 ms was sufficient to predict the energy and macronutrients from food images. Additionally, carbohydrate estimates were less accurate than the estimates of other nutritional variables (proteins, fat and calories), regardless of the exposure time. These results revealed rapid and accurate assessment of food attributes based on visual information and the accuracy of visual encoding of nutritional information after brief and extended time exposure to food imagery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3acarbohydrates 3acognition 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3aexposure duration 3ahealthy diet 3anutrient content 3anutrition information 3aweight control 0aEnergy density 0aEstimation accuracy 0aFood image 0aMacronutrients 0aRapid processing1 aSaito, Toshiki1 aSuzuki, Shinsuke1 aSugiura, M.q(Motoaki),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5412-03800 tAppetite.g2021 July 01, v. 162 p.105143-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.1051433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015200164300001600316520147900332592002801811650002201839650003401861650001101895650001601906650001501922650002501937650001001962650001401972650001401986650001402000650001302014650001102027650001502038650001102053650001002064700001302074700001502087700001102102700001702113700001402130773009802144856008102242852000902323655001202332IND60584562220221120133242.0171025e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058456222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-016-0698-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Q. Q.10aApplication of X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy to the study of the effect of sulphur on selenium uptake and assimilation in wheat seedlings  ap. 726-732.  aSelenium (Se) is an essential trace element for humans and animals. A hydroponic experiment was performed to study the effects of sulphur (S) on Se uptake, translocation, and assimilation in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings. Sulphur starvation had a positive effect on selenate uptake and the form of Se supplied greatly influenced Se speciation in plants. Compared with the control plants, Se uptake by the S-starved plants was enhanced by 4.81-fold in the selenate treatment, and selenate was readily transported from roots to shoots. By contrast, S starvation had no significant effect on selenite uptake, and selenite taken up by roots was rapidly converted to organic forms and tended to accumulate in roots. X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) analysis showed that organic forms of selenium, including selenocystine, Se-methyl-selenocysteine (MeSeCys), and selenomethionine-Se-oxide, were dominant in the plants exposed to selenite and accounted for approximately 90 % of the total Se. Whereas selenate remained as the dominant species in the roots and shoots exposed to selenate, with little selenate converted to selenite and MeSeCys. Besides, sulphur starvation increased the proportion of inorganic Se species in the selenate-supplied plants, but had no significant effects on Se speciation in plants exposed to selenite. The present study provides important knowledge to understand the associated mechanism of Se uptake and metabolism in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3ahumans 3ahydroponics 3ametabolism 3amethylselenocysteine 3aroots 3aseedlings 3aselenates 3aselenites 3aselenium 3ashoots 3astarvation 3asulfur 3awheat1 aWang, Q.1 aWan, Y.

Here, we report the FeCl₃ and mesoporous carbon nitride hybrid (FeCl₃/mpg-C₃N₄) as an active and selective photocatalyst to activate H₂O₂ for the oxidation of benzene to phenol under visible-light illumination. By fine-optimizing FeCl₃ loading amount in catalyst and reaction conditions, the one-step process achieved a 38% benzene conversion with 97% selectivity for phenol. The excellent catalytic performance of FeCl₃/mpg-C₃N₄ should be attributed to the fast reduction of Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺ by photo-irradiated electrons from mpg-C₃N₄. To further understand the reaction route, several electron spin resonance (ESR) tests were carried out, confirming mpg-C₃N₄ promoted redox cycle of Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ in the FeCl₃/mpg-C₃N₄ system. Based on these results, a catalytic mechanism for the oxidation of benzene by FeCl₃/mpg-C₃N₄ hybrids was provided. This environmental-friendly and efficient method is expected to open up a new avenue for one-step phenol preparation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3abenzene 3abyproducts 3acarbon nitride 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reduction 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectrons 3aferric chloride 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3alight 3alighting 3aoxidation 3aphenol 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotoirradiation 3aporous media1 aGong, Yutong1 aLi, Haoran1 aChen, Zhirong1 aWang, Yong0 tRSC advances.g2013 Mar. 18, v. 3, no. 15 p.5121-5126dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra23357j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01688naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245010700164300001800271520053600289592002800825650001400853650002300867650002900890650001200919650002300931650001300954650001100967650002800978650001901006650002001025700001401045700005501059773012001114856008301234852000901317655001201326IND60608369320221119050054.0180807e20180321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060836932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b004132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Long10aPhotochemical Nickel-Catalyzed Reductive Migratory Cross-Coupling of Alkyl Bromides with Aryl Bromides  ap. 1880-1883.  aA novel method to access 1,1-diarylalkanes from readily available, nonactivated alkyl bromides and aryl bromides via visible-light-driven nickel and iridium dual catalysis, wherein diisopropylamine (ⁱPr₂NH) is used as the terminal stoichiometric reductant, is reported.

Fifteen large dairy farms in twelve major milk-producing provinces of China were enrolled in the study for approximately one year; 1,153 mastitis milk samples were collected and processed. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus spp. (39.03 %), Streptococcus spp. (11.01 %), Bacillus spp. (8.24 %), Aerococcus viridans (6.76 %), and Acinetobacter spp. (3.38 %), and most of these pathogens were environmental bacteria (67.53 %). Contagious pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae) were more prevalent in milk samples from bovine clinical mastitis cases than in milk samples from bovine subclinical mastitis cases. The percentages of Staphylococcus spp. and Bacillus spp. might be higher in northeastern farms than in farms located in other regions. A higher percentage of Staphylococcus spp. was observed in summer, while a lower proportion of Streptococcus spp. was detected in fall. Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus uberis were more frequently isolated in farms using sand bedding, whereas Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Bacillus licheniformis were more prevalent in farms using organic bedding. No obvious associations were found between the main mastitis pathogens and parity or lactation stage. Based on these findings, the dominant pathogens, types of milk, regions, seasons and bedding materials should be considered when designing mastitis prevention and control programs at large Chinese dairy farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aAerococcus viridans 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStaphylococcus haemolyticus 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aStreptococcus uberis 3abovine mastitis 3acattle 3alactation stage 3amilk 3aobservational studies 3asand 3asummer 3aChina 0aMastitis 0aPathogen 0aBedding materials 0aSeason1 aHuang, Xiaoping1 aXu, Hongyan1 aZhang, Cheng1 aChen, Shang1 aLiu, Fei1 aGuan, Shan1 aZhang, Shan1 aZhu, Kui1 aWu, Congming0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2020 Aug., v. 247 p.108757-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.1087573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245010000202500001900302520149300321592002801814650002501842650001601867650001301883650001001896650001101906650001701917650002701934650001701961650001401978650005001992650002502042650001002067651001002077653000902087653002202096653002002118653001402138700001602152700001902168700001802187700001702205700001602222700001302238700001602251700001602267700001502283700001702298700001702315700001902332700001502351700001602366773010702382856008502489852000902574655001202583IND60699540020221119090801.0200809e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069954002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.1087562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHa, Zhuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0072-627X10aPrevalence, pathogenesis, and evolution of porcine circovirus type 3 in China from 2016 to 2019  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPorcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) infection causes substantial economic losses in pig populations since its discovery in 2016. However, PCV3 molecular epidemiology remains need further study. In order to assess the prevalence of PCV3 infection in China, 4094 clinical samples from 271 pig farms in 10 provinces of China were evaluated by PCR. It was shown that the overall prevalence of PCV3 infection was 29.3 % (1200/4094) and 74.2 % (201/271) at sample and farm levels respectively, suggesting that PCV3 infection is prevalent in China. Furthermore, a statistical analysis showed PCV3 might exacerbate PCV2 and PRRSV infection rate and have a potential association with pig clinical disease. In addition, we sequenced the entire genome of 57 PCV3 strains; homology analysis showed that PCV3 strains have more than 96 % similarities at the nucleotide level, and PCV3 shares less than 60 % similarities with other circoviruses. By comparing the total 673 PCV3 strains from the NCBI GenBank, we found the major of amino acid mutations are located in predicted epitope regions and the mutations ratio changed during PCV3 evolution. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all isolates belonged to PCV3a and PCV3b, and increasing PCV3a and decreasing PCV3b trends were observed during PCV3 evolution. Overall, this study provides important insights for understanding PCV3 prevalence, pathogenesis, and evolution and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine circovirus-3 3aamino acids 3aepitopes 3afarms 3agenome 3amicrobiology 3amolecular epidemiology 3apathogenesis 3aphylogeny 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3astatistical analysis 3aswine 3aChina 0aPCV3 0aGenetic diversity 0aComplete genome 0aEvolution1 aLi, Jinfeng1 aXie, Changzhan1 aYu, Chengdong1 aHao, Pengfei1 aZhang, Ying1 aXu, Wang1 aNan, Fulong1 aXie, Yubiao1 aLi, Yanwei1 aRong, Fulong1 aWang, Guanyu1 aGuo, Yingcheng1 aLu, Huijun1 aJin, Ningyi0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2020 Aug., v. 247 p.108756-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.1087563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014800154300001800302520106400320592002801384650002201412650001401434650001101448650001801459650002301477650001301500650000901513650002201522650001301544650003301557650001801590650001601608650003701624700001501661700001601676700001601692700001701708700001801725700001701743773012201760856007401882852000901956655001201965IND60664255220221122221753.0190910e20130326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066425522DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra23415k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Fan10aPreparation of Au nanodendrites supported on carbon fiber cloth and its catalytic performance to H₂O₂ electroreduction and electrooxidation  ap. 5483-5490.  aWell-defined Au dendrites supported on carbon fiber cloth are successfully prepared by potential pulse electrodeposition without additives or surfactants.

The D-Au/CFC electrode exhibits much higher catalytic activity and remarkably improved utilization of Au than Au nanoparticles prepared by the same method for both H₂O₂ electroreduction and electrooxidation owing to its unique open dendritic structure.

Such an apparent hysteresis effect of water stress (HEWS) is usually neglected in simulating root-water-uptake (RWU) by empirical models. To consider HEWS in the empirical macroscopic RWU model of Feddes, a water stress recovery coefficient (δ) was introduced based on two lysimetric experiments under greenhouse and field conditions for winter wheat. The integrated effects of historical water stress events were investigated by assuming that the normalized influence weight of each past stress event declines with the increase of time interval before simulation as an exponential function of attenuation rate. Although δ could be described by an exponential function of an integrative index representing the general historical stress extent (R² = 0.65, P < 0.001), with an attenuation rate smaller than 0.13, it is challenging to establish such a function practically. An attenuation rate close to zero means HEWS is mainly dominated by the water stress on the previous day, validated by a significant relationship between the relative transpiration or stomatal conductance on the day after irrigation and the water stress extent on the day before irrigation. Therefore, a simplification, substituting the integrative index in the exponential function with the stress extent on the previous day, was proposed for estimating δ. Compared to the traditional RWU model, the revised model considering HEWS was more successful in simulating relative transpiration and soil water dynamics. Root mean square error of relative transpiration was reduced by 65.9 % and of soil water by 30 % in the greenhouse experiment and by 7.4 % and 12.5 %, respectively, in the field experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3afield experimentation 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahysteresis 3airrigation 3aplant stress 3aroot water potential 3aroots 3asoil water 3asoil-plant interactions 3astomatal conductance 3awater stress 3awater uptake 3awet-dry cycles 3awinter wheat 0aRoot water uptake 0aRelative transpiration 0aHysteresis effect 0aRecovery1 aZuo, Qiang1 aShi, Jianchu1 aWang, Lichun1 aXue, Xuzhang1 aBen-Gal, A.q(Alon),0 tAgricultural water management.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 240 p.106293-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1062933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01990naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012900159300001800288520082700306592002801133650001601161650002101177650001501198650001301213650001401226650002401240650001901264650001801283700001501301700001601316700001901332700001601351700001901367700001401386773012101400856007401521852000901595655001201604IND60664255920221122042520.0190910e20130306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066425592DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra23477k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Jingjing10aSelf-assembled hydrothermal synthesis for producing a MnCO₃/graphene hydrogel composite and its electrochemical properties  ap. 4400-4407.  aAs ultrathin and flexible materials, graphene sheets are versatile building blocks for fabricating graphene-based functional composite materials for widespread applications. In this paper, we demonstrated a facile approach to prepare MnCO₃/graphene hydrogel (MGH) composites via a hydrothermal process. The MnCO₃ nanoparticles are 50–100 nm in size and are deposited on graphene sheets’ surfaces as spacers to prevent graphene sheets from restacking. A combination of deposited MnCO₃ nanoparticles and hydration of the hydrogel could effectively keep the neighboring graphene sheets separated. The obtained MGH nanocomposite presents a high specific capacitance (Cₛ) of 645.5 F g⁻¹ at 0.5 A g⁻¹ in a three-electrode system, suggesting that it is a robust candidate as a supercapacitor electrode material.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3ahydrogels 3amanganese carbonate 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles1 aZhu, Junwu1 aBi, Huiping1 aZhang, Zhaozhi1 aChen, Sheng1 aLiang, Shiming1 aWang, Xin0 tRSC advances.g2013 Mar. 6, v. 3, no. 13 p.4400-4407dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra23477k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245007900177500001900256520178700275592002802062650002602090650001102116650002002127650001202147650002202159650001402181650002202195650000902217650002102226650001702247651001002264653002802274653002302302653001702325653002702342653002902369773011602398856008402514852000902598655001202607IND60699541320221119085000.0200705e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069954132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1062712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-Limón, José A.10aHydrological drought insurance for irrigated agriculture in southern Spain  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn Mediterranean-climate regions, irrigated agriculture is especially vulnerable to the risk of hydrological drought, and irrigators are particularly concerned about the negative effects of water supply failures. This paper proposes a new index-based drought insurance scheme to cover the risk of water supply failures in irrigated agriculture that overcomes the problems currently hindering the development of this kind of insurance, especially those related to arbitrariness in annual water allotments decision-making. Although the proposal is tailored to Spain, it can be easily adapted to other countries or regions because its main features can also be implemented worldwide. The scheme proposed is a promising instrument to help irrigators manage the risk related to hydrological droughts since it has been proved to be technically feasible. The main contribution of this paper is the innovative actuarial analysis implemented, which is aimed at calculating fair premiums. Considering that recent changes in the institutional framework (new demands, new storage capacity, and revised basin and drought management plans) make historical records unsuitable for this purpose, the actuarial analysis applied is based on a stochastic hydrological model able to simulate future hydrological situations under updated settings. Simulation results have shown that irrigated agriculture in southern Spain is expected to be more vulnerable to hydrological droughts. In fact, incidence rates are likely to increase because of the new institutional framework, leading to relatively high fair premiums. Only by implementing high ordinary deductibles can the hypothetical cost of commercial premiums be affordable for irrigators, accounting for less than 10% of their current variable costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3abasins 3adecision making 3adrought 3ahydrologic models 3ainsurance 3airrigated farming 3arisk 3awater management 3awater supply 3aSpain 0aIrrigation water supply 0aWater availability 0aDrought risk 0aAgricultural insurance 0aGuadalquivir River Basin0 tAgricultural water management.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 240 p.106271-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1062713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01375naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012800170300001800298520037000316592002800686650001800714650002900732650001300761650001300774650002200787700006400809773012000873856008300993852000901076655001201085IND60608371320181001000000.0180807e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060837132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b004732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoscales, Silvia10aSynthesis of Di(hetero)arylamines from Nitrosoarenes and Boronic Acids: A General, Mild, and Transition-Metal-Free Coupling  ap. 1667-1671.  aThe synthesis of di(hetero)arylamines by a transition-metal-free cross-coupling between nitrosoarenes and boronic acids is reported.

This transformation relies on an electronically differentiated Lewis base catalyst, which is uniquely capable of promoting a reductive aldol reaction of α,α-disubstituted and α,α,β-trisubstituted enones. This approach provides a valuable synthetic alternative for carbon–carbon bond formation in complex molecular settings due to its orthogonal reactivity compared to that of traditional aldol reactions.

Furthermore, the excessive storage of subcutaneous fat can seriously affect the health and carcass traits of domestic animals. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cell adipogenic differentiation increases the number of differentiated adipocytes and plays a role in lipid deposition. The adipogenic differentiation of SVF cells is regulated by various factors, including microRNAs and cytokines. Sirt6 and miR-33a are known to be involved in metabolism and adipogenesis, respectively; however, their effects on the adipogenic differentiation of ovine SVF cells were previously unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate this. The results showed that SIRT6 is a binding target for miR-33a. Moreover, overexpression or inhibition of miR-33a was found to change the expression of SIRT6 messenger RNA and protein. Furthermore, modulating SIRT6 altered the expression of adipogenic marker genes. In addition, miR-33a and SIRT6 were found to play opposing roles in adipogenesis. Specifically, we demonstrated that miR-33a is involved in the negative regulation of ovine SVF cell adipogenic differentiation by inhibiting the expression of SIRT6. These findings reveal a key role for miR-33a and SIRT6 in adipogenesis, which will enrich our understanding of the regulatory factors associated with SVF cell adipogenic differentiation and provide a basis for further study on this process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aadipose tissue 3acytokines 3aendocrinology 3aenergy balance 3alipids 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3amicroRNA 3asheep 3asubcutaneous fat 0aOvine 0aMiR-33a 0aSIRT6 0aAdipogenic differentiation1 aPan, Y.1 aZhao, B.1 aQiao, L.1 aLiu, J.1 aLiang, Y.1 aLiu, W.0 tDomestic animal endocrinology.g2021 Jan., v. 74 p.106513-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl34945x0739-72407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2020.1065133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01752naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245017200162300001800334520060100352592002800953650001600981650002700997650001701024650002301041650001601064650001401080650001401094700001901108700002501127700002101152700002401173773012201197856007401319852000901393655001201402IND60664259220221120141310.0190910e20130326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066425922DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra40450a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamulu, B.

Planners, developers, and local authorities in Sogamoso have explicitly framed PUA as a barrier to development: a backwards, localized, low-tech and economically poorly performing activity that needs to make space for a more ‘productive’ ‘modern’ economy. Based on a survey of 160 peri-urban farming and gardening households, this study identifies PUA forms of food self-provisioning and exchange (FSPE) and further characterizes the practice’s social embeddedness, barriers, and opportunities as perceived by peri-urban farmers. The article combines scholarship on PUA and ‘quiet sustainability’ (Smith and Jehlička, 2013) to propose a novel perspective that could help transform the terms of discourse on the role and future of PUA in urban sustainable development from arguments founded in productivity metrics to the appreciation of FSPE as an environmentally sustainable practice that strengthens the social fabric of local communities, thus contributing to their sense of purpose, meaning, and resilience. This study has implications not only for Sogamoso, but also for many other cities in Latin America and the Global South, where the role of PUA in relation to sustainable urban development is being actively contested.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3aissues and policy 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3aurban agriculture 3aurban development 3aColombia 3aLatin America 0aFood self-provisioning and exchange 0aFood sharing 0aUrbanization1 aSuzunaga, Jaime1 aSoler, Jenny1 aWilson, Amanda0 tJournal of rural studies.g2020 Dec., v. 80 p.1-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.04.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01389naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016100159300001800320520030700338592002800645650002800673650002100701650002200722650001400744700001500758700001800773700002000791700002600811700002100837773012200858856007400980852000901054655001201063IND60664259620221120141234.0190910e20130326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066425962DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra40558c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwakura, Izumi10aPulsed Nd:YAG laser induced high throughput stereospecific [2 + 2] cycloaddition of highly organized 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene in a supramolecular scaffold  ap. 5354-5356.  aThe 3rd harmonic generation in a Nd:YAG pulsed laser induces the high throughput [2 + 2] cycloaddition of 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene that assemble itself tightly into a face-to-face manner around the Yb³⁺ octaaqua complex via hydrogen bonds, without damaging the cyclobutyl ring-containing products.  aPublisher supplied data 3acycloaddition reactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3astereospecificity 3aytterbium1 aKato, Saki1 aHino, Ryotaro1 aFukumoto, Ayumu1 aKomori-Orisaku, Keiko1 aKoide, Yoshihiro0 tRSC advances.g2013 Mar. 26, v. 3, no. 16 p.5354-5356dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra40558c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
